# Chapter 14 Liver and Biliary Apparatus; Pancreas and Spleen; Respiratory System; Body Cavities and Diaphragm

## HIGHLIGHTS (FIG. 14.1 AND FLOWCHART 14.1)

- Liver and biliary apparatus develop from endodermal hepatic bud. The hepatic bud arises as an outgrowth from the ventral wall of terminal part of foregut.
- Pancreas develops from two endodermal buds, the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds that arise at the junction of foregut and midgut. Most of the pancreas develops from dorsal bud. The ventral bud forms lower part of head and uncinated process.
- Spleen develops in the mesoderm of dorsal mesogastrium.
- Respiratory system develops from a median endodermal diverticulum of foregut. At its caudal end the diverticulum divides into right and left lung buds.
- Larynx and trachea develop from the endodermal respiratory diverticulum cranial/proximal to its division.
- Bronchial tree and alveoli of the lungs develop from repeated division of the lung buds.
- Pleural, pericardial and peritoneal cavities develop from intraembryonic coelom. Before formation of head fold the intraembryonic coelom consists of right and left halves that are connected, across the midline, cranial to the prochordal plate.
- Pericardial cavity is derived from the median midline part of intraembryonic coelom. With the formation of head fold of embryo this cavity comes to lie ventral to the foregut.
- Peritoneal cavity is derived from the right and left limbs of intraembryonic coelom. After the formation of lateral folds of embryo the two limbs unite to form single cavity.
- Pleural cavities are formed from right and left pleuropericardial canals that connect pericardial and peritoneal cavities. Each pleuropericardial canal is invaginated by corresponding endodermal lung bud. Growth and expansion of lung bud leads to great enlargement of pleuropericardial canal and formation of pleural cavity.
- Diaphragm develops in relation to the septum transversum. It receives contribution from pleuroperitoneal membranes, the body wall and the mesenteries of the esophagus.


## LIVER AND BILIARY APPARATUS

## LIVER AND INTRAHEPATIC BILIARY APPARATUS

- Developmental primordium: Liver is the largest gland in the body (Fig. 14.2). It has number of functions including exocrine, endocrine, hematopoietic, metabolic and phagocytic. It develops from endodermal hepatic bud during 4th week of intrauterine life (IUL). It arises from
the ventral margin of terminal part of foregut that forms upper half of second part of duodenum (Fig. 14.3A).
- Direction of growth of hepatic bud: Hepatic bud consists of rapidly proliferating endodermal cells that grow ventrally and cranially into the ventral mesogastrium (Fig. 14.3B) and through it into the septum transversum (Unsplit part of intraembryonic mesoderm between pericardial cavity and yolk sac cavity) (Fig. 14.3C).
- Subdivisions of hepatic bud: The hepatic bud elongates and divides into a larger cranial part pars hepatica that forms the liver, and a smaller caudal part pars cystica

Fig. 14.1: Development of liver, biliary apparatus, pancreas, respiratory system, body cavities and diaphragm
that forms gallbladder and cystic duct (Figs 14.14.3B and C).

- Division of pars hepatica: It divides into right and left branches that become right and left hepatic ducts. The terminations of the hepatic ducts contribute for the two solid right and left lobes of the liver (Figs 14.3D and E). The two lobes of the liver are of equal size during early development but the size of left lobe reduces gradually (Table 14.1). In the 3rd month of intrauterine life (IUL), the weight of liver is one-tenth of total body weight of fetus and occupies most of the upper abdomen. In the 7th month of IUL it reduces to one-fifth of body weight.
- Formation of hepatic architecture:
- From the terminal part of right and left branches of parshepatica (hepatic ducts), when they reach septum transversum clusters of cells (hepatocytes) in the form of laminae arise, and break up into interlacing columns called hepatic trabeculae (Fig. 14.3E).
- In between hepatic trabeculae the hepatic sinusoids develop in situ.
- During this process of formation of hepatic trabeculae, the vitelline and umbilical veins that are running longitudinally in the septum transversum, break up and establish communication with the hepatic sinusoids (Fig. 14.4).
- Within the substance of liver the hepatic ducts branch repeatedly and canalized to acquire a lumen to form intrahepatic biliary passages (Fig. 14.5).
- The hepatic trabeculae differentiate into the components of parenchyma, i.e. liver cells and cells lining intrahepatic biliary system (Fig. 14.5). Septum transversum contributes for the Kupffer cells, hematopoietic cells and connective tissue cells.
- Reorganization of cells of hepatic bud and the mesenchymal cells of connective tissue and blood

Fig. 14.2: Full term fetus showing thoracic and abdominal viscera
vessels form the hepatic lobule with bile canaliculi, portal triad and sinusoids of liver (Fig. 14.5).

- Formation of peritoneal folds in relation with the liver from septum transversum: With the rapid growth of developing liver into the septum transversum, the mesoderm of septum transversum between the liver and foregut becomes the lesser omentum, and the part between liver and ventral abdominal wall becomes the falciform, triangular and coronary ligaments. Lesser omentum and falciform ligament together are called ventral mesentery/ventral mesogastrium (Fig. 14.6).


### Functions of Fetal Liver

- Hematopoiesis: Begins in 6th week of IUL and continues up to birth. After birth this function is carried out by spleen and bone marrow.

- Bile secretion: Secretion of bile by hepatocytes starts during 12th week of IUL. The bile is released into the foregut derived part of duodenum and then passes
through the rest of intestine. The first stool passed by the new born is green in color due to the excretion of bile and it is called meconium.

Anomalies of liver are rare. Those that are reported in literature are (Fig. 14.8):

- Absence of quadrate lobe
- Reidel's lobe: tongue like extension of right lobe of liver (Fig. 14.8A).
- Anomalous lobulation (Fig. 14.8B)
- Accessory liver in falciform ligament (Fig. 14.8C)
- Polycystic liver: Failure of union of intrahepatic biliary canaliculi and ductules with extrahepatic bile ducts, results in the formation of cysts within the liver. It is usually associated with cysts in the kidney and pancreas.
- Intrahepatic biliary atresia: It is a serious anomaly and is not compatible with life unless a liver transplantation is undertaken.
- Rudimentary liver.


### Additional explanation

- Role of septum transversum in the development of hepatic bud: Septum transversum has an inductive effect on differentiation, proliferation, branching and formation of hepatocytes and cells lining the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary apparatus from the hepatic bud.
- Establishment of hepatic architecture: Columnar endodermal cells of foregut get transformed into pseudostratified cells in early hepatic bud, that later transforms into bipotential hepatoblast. The hepatoblasts reorganize when they come into contact with the mesenchyme of septum transversum and the breaking down umbilical and vitelline veins (to form sinusoids). They are bipotential, as they can differentiate into two types of cells. Those hepatoblasts close to the branches of portal vein (derived from vitelline veins) become cuboidal cells and along with the mesenchyme around periportal vein they form primordia for bile ducts, which acquire a lumen by reorganization of cells.
- Lobular arrangement: Initially the arrangement of hepatocytes was around the portal triad (interlobular bile ductule, branch of portal vein and hepatic artery) forming portal lobule. Later the hepatocytes change to an arrangement along sinusoids and around central vein forming the classical hepatic lobule.
- Massive growth of liver when compared to other organs: The reasons for massive growth of liver in the early part is due to oxygen rich blood supply through the left umbilical vein and ductus venosus, presence of large number of sinusoids and rapidly proliferating hemopoietic tissue. Further facilitated by herniation of midgut between 6th to 10th weeks of IUL. The reduction in weight in later part of IUL is due to the reduced hematopoietic activity, reduction of physiological hernia and to provide room for expanding and lengthening derivatives of the gut.
- Gradual decrease in size of left lobe when compared to right lobe: More space provided for enlargement of right lobe by early closure of pleuropericardial and pleuroperitoneal membranes on right side than left side. Right lobe is supplied by right branch of portal vein that conveys blood via superior mesenteric vein, from small intestine that contains products of digestion. Hence a nutritional advantage for the right lobe. Whereas, left branch of portal vein receives blood from large intestine via inferior mesenteric vein and splenic vein making left lobe at nutritionally disadvantageous position. Further, the left branch of portal vein is longer and narrower than the right branch and makes an angle with the trunk of portal vein making the left lobe at a nutritionally disadvantageous position. Because of these reasons the left lobe undergoes degeneration.
- Molecular mechanisms in liver development: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) from cardiac mesoderm and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) from septum transversum.


## GALLBLADDER AND EXTRAHEPATIC BILIARY PASSAGES (EXTRAHEPATIC BILIARY APPARATUS)

- Gallbladder and cystic duct develop from pars cystica of hepatic bud (Figs 14.3B to E).

![img-276.jpeg](img-276.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 14.7A and B: Serial section of 6 weeks embryo: (A) Sagittal section showing the developing liver, stomach and spleen; (B) Transverse section showing developing liver

- Extrahepatic duct system of biliary apparatus: The narrow portion of hepatic bud between pars cystica and duodenal part of foregut forms the common bile duct. The undivided part of pars hepatica distal to the origin of pars cystica forms the common hepatic duct. The right and left branches of pars hepatica become right and left hepatic ducts (Fig. 14.3E).
- The bile duct at first opens on the ventral aspect of developing duodenum. Due to the differential growth of duodenal wall, and rotation of duodenal loop, it opens on the dorsomedial aspect of duodenum along with ventral pancreatic bud (Fig. 14.18D).


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the gallbladder

### Anomalies of shape:

- Phrygian cap: Fundus may be folded on itself to form a cap-like structure (Fig. 14.9A).
- Hartmann's pouch: The wall of infundibulum may project downward as a pouch, which may be adherent to the cystic duct or even to the bile duct (Fig. 14.9B).


### Anomalies of position:

- Transverse position on the under surface of right lobe, or under the left lobe (Fig. 14.10).
- Floating gallbladder: The gallbladder will be lined by peritoneum on all sides. It may be attached to the liver by a fold of peritoneum or it may be completely free (Fig. 14.11).
- Intrahepatic gallbladder: It may be embedded in the substance of liver (Fig. 14.12).


### Duplication (Fig. 14.13):

- The lumen may be partially or completely divided by a septum, which may or may not extend into the cystic duct.
- The gallbladder may be completely or partially duplicated.

Other anomalies:

- Sessile gallbladder: The gallbladder may directly open into the bile duct instead of the cystic duct (Fig. 14.14).
- Agenesis: Absence of gallbladder
- Diverticula may arise from any part of the organ.

Anomalies of the extrahepatic duct system
Abnormal length: There is considerable variation in the level at which various ducts join each other, with the result that occasionally some of them may become abnormally long, or short (Figs 14.15A to D).
Abnormal mode of termination (Figs 14.15E to H):

- Cystic duct may join left side of common hepatic duct, passing either in front of it, or behind it, to reach its left side.
- Cystic duct may end in the right hepatic duct.
- Cystic duct may pass downward, anterior to the duodenum, before joining the common hepatic duct.
- Bile duct may open into the pyloric, or even the cardiac end of the stomach.
Atresia (Figs 14.16A to F): Parts of the duct system, and sometimes the whole of it, may be absent.
Duplication (Figs 14.17A to C):
- Parts of the duct system may be duplicated.
- Accessory ducts arising from the right lobe may terminate in the right hepatic duct, the cystic duct, the bile duct, or even directly into the gallbladder.

## PANCREAS AND SPLEEN

## PANCREAS

- Developmental primordia: Functionally the pancreas is both exocrine and endocrine gland with difference in microscopic structure of the two components. But the developmental primordium of the two structural and functional components is common. The pancreas develops from two endodermal buds, the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds (Table 14.2).
- Site of origin of pancreatic buds: The dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds arise from the dorsal and ventral walls of terminal part of foregut (future second part of duodenum), caudal to hepatic bud (Fig. 14.18A) before rotation of midgut.
- Dorsal pancreatic bud:
- First to appear (4th week) and larger in size when compared to ventral bud.
- It is cephalic to the ventral bud.
- It grows between the two layers of dorsal mesentery of duodenum.
- Ventral pancreatic bud:
- It arises in close relation to hepatic bud, in the inferior angle between duodenum and hepatic bud.
- It appears later and is smaller than the dorsal bud.
- It grows between the two layers of ventral mesentery of duodenum.
- Change in the position of pancreatic buds:
- Before rotation of duodenal loop the ventral pancreatic bud is on ventral aspect and the dorsal pancreatic bud is on dorsal aspect of duodenum (Fig. 14.19A). With the rotation of duodenal loop to the right, the ventral pancreatic bud along with primitive

bile duct comes to the right, and the dorsal bud to the left of duodenum (Figs 14.18B and 14.19B).

- Due to differential growth of wall of gut, the attachment of ventral pancreatic bud along with primitive bile duct (hepatic bud derivative) shifts to the left moving closer to the dorsal pancreatic bud (Figs 14.18C and 14.19C and D).
- Fusion of buds: Pancreatic tissue formed from ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds fuse to form one mass in 7th week of IUL (Figs 14.18E and 14.19D).
- Derivatives of pancreatic buds:
- Ventral pancreatic bud forms lower part of head and uncinated process of pancreas (Fig. 14.18E).

The ventral bud to the right and dorsal bud to the left; (C and D) Movement of ventral bud to the left lying close to dorsal bud with differential growth of duodenal wall

- Dorsal pancreatic bud forms upper part of head, neck, body and tail of pancreas (Fig. 14.18E).
- Duct system of pancreas:
- Initially the ducts of dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds are separate and they open separately into the duodenum (Fig. 14.20A).
- Opening of dorsal pancreatic duct is 2.0 cm proximal to the opening of ventral pancreatic duct.
- Ventral pancreatic duct and bile duct (hepatic bud derivative) have a common opening in the duodenum.
- The ducts of dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds anastomose establishing a cross-communication between the two (Fig. 14.20B).
- The main pancreatic duct is formed in its distal part, by the duct of dorsal bud, in its middle part by the oblique cross-communication between ducts of two buds and in its proximal part by the duct of ventral bud. The main pancreatic duct, therefore, opens into the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla, along with the bile duct (Fig. 14.20C).
- The accessory pancreatic duct is formed by the proximal part of dorsal pancreatic duct (between the anastomosis and duodenum). It remains narrow and opens into the minor duodenal papilla 2.0 cm proximal to major duodenal papilla (Fig. 14.20C).
![img-289.jpeg](img-289.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 14.20: Formation of duct system of pancreas. Distal part of main pancreatic duct is derived from the distal part of duct of dorsal bud, communication between dorsal and ventral ducts and from the duct of ventral bud. Accessory pancreatic duct is derived from the proximal part of dorsal pancreatic duct

- Repeated branching of the major and minor pancreatic ducts forms the interlobular and intralobular ducts and ductules (Fig. 14.21).
- Parenchyma (Fig. 14.21):
- The parenchyma develops from branching of endodermal pancreatic buds into the surrounding mesoderm.
- The parenchyma of pancreas consists of exocrine and endocrine secreting units.
- The exocrine part of pancreas, consisting of acinar secreting units, develops from proliferation and reorganization of cells at the terminations (ductules) of duct system.
- The endocrine part, i.e. Islets of Langerhan's, develops from separation of groups of cells from the terminations of duct system.
- Retroperitoneal location of entire pancreas except tail: Though initially both buds were suspended in the respective mesogastria, due to their migration they occupy a position posterior to the peritoneum except the tail of pancreas which lies in the lienorenal ligament.


### Functions of Fetal Pancreas

- Its exocrine function begins after birth.
- Endocrine function begins in fetal and in early embryonic period. By 7 th week $\alpha$-cells start secreting glucagon and by 10 th week insulin production by $\beta$-cells begins.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the pancreas

- Annular pancreas: Pancreatic tissue surrounds the duodenum completely and may obstruct it (Fig. 14.22).
- Divided pancreas (pancreas divisum): Failure of fusion of parts of pancreas derived from dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds with each other (Fig. 14.23A).
- Accessory pancreatic tissue: It may be found in stomach, duodenum, jejunum, Meckel's diverticulum, gallbladder and spleen.
- Inversion of pancreatic ducts: Embryonic arrangement of the ducts persists and the greater part of the pancreas is drained through the minor duodenal papilla (Fig. 14.23C).


## SPLEEN

- Developmental primordia: Spleen is a lymphoid organ. It develops from mesoderm in the dorsal mesogastrium, close to the developing stomach (Fig. 14.7A).
- Spleniculi: It develops as a collection of mesenchymal cells to form small lobular masses of splenic tissue (Spleniculi) in the dorsal mesogastrium (Fig. 14.24A). These lobules later fuse to form single mass of spleen.

Presence of splenic notches along the upper border of adult spleen indicates lobulated development of spleen (Fig. 14.25).

- As the mesenchymal cells proliferate, the splenic mass projects in the left layer of dorsal mesogastrium (Fig. 14.24B).
- Because of the splenic projection the dorsal mesogastrium is divided into an anterior part extending from the stomach to the spleen the gastrosplenic ligament, and a posterior part that extends from the
![img-290.jpeg](img-290.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 14.21: Development of exocrine and endocrine components of pancreas. Major and minor ducts, interlobular and intralocular ducts, ductules, exocrine and endocrine units of pancreas are shown
spleen to the posterior abdominal wall the lienorenal ligament (Fig. 14.24B).

- The posterior layer of dorsal mesogastrium fuses with the posterior abdominal wall (Fig. 14.24C). As a result of this fusion and change in orientation of the stomach, the posterior part of dorsal mesogastrium between spleen and posterior abdominal wall now shifts its position. It extends between spleen and left kidney forming the lienorenal ligament.
- As a consequence of this fusion and change in orientation of stomach, the spleen comes to lie on the left side and takes part in forming left boundary of the lesser sac of peritoneum (Fig. 14.24D).
- Capsule, septa and connective tissue framework including reticular fibers develop from mesoderm. The mesenchymal cells differentiate into lymphoblasts and other blood forming cells.

## BODY CAVITIES AND DIAPHRAGM

## BODY CAVITIES

### Subdivisions and Developmental Primordium of Body Cavities

There are three body cavities. They are pericardial, pleural and peritoneal cavities. They are derivatives of the intraembryonic coelom. The pericardial cavity develops in relation to heart, the pleural cavity in relation to lungs and the peritoneal cavity in relation to the abdominal viscera.

### Formation of Intraembryonic Coelom

In the Chapter 5 the subdivisions of intraembryonic mesoderm and a brief description of formation of intraembryonic coelom were presented. For understanding the intraembryonic coelom it is described in detail in this chapter. Refer Figures 5.5 to 5.8 of Chapter 5: Further Development of Embryonic Disc.

- Appearance of lateral plate mesoderm: In the 3rd week of development intraembryonic mesoderm (Fig. 5.5) develops from the primitive streak and separates ectoderm from endoderm except at prochordal plate, cloacal membrane and in the midline caudal
to prochordal plate that is occupied by notochord. The intraembryonic mesoderm subdivides into three components. They are paraxial mesoderm, intermediate mesoderm and lateral plate mesoderm from medial to lateral on either side of the developing notochord (Fig. 5.6).
- Appearance of intraembryonic coelom: Small cavities appear in the lateral plate mesoderm that coalesce to form one large horse-shoe shaped or inverted U-shaped cavity, the intraembryonic coelom (IEC) during the 4th week of IUL (Figs 5.7 and 14.26).
- Communication between intraembryonic coelom (IEC) with extraembryonic coelom (EEC): To begin with the intraembryonic coelom is a closed cavity (Figs 5.7 and 14.26) but soon it communicates with extraembryonic coelom to provide nutrition to the differentiating germ layers of embryo by a process of diffusion of fluid in the chorionic sac (Figs 5.8 and 14.27).
- Splitting of lateral plate mesoderm: With the formation of intraembryonic coelom, the lateral plate mesoderm is split into two layers a parietal and a visceral. The parietal (somatopleuric) layer that is in contact with ectoderm and continuous with somatopleuric extraembryonic mesoderm over the amnion. The visceral (splanchnopleuric) layer is adjacent to endoderm and is continuous with splanchnopleuric layer of extraembryonic mesoderm covering yolk sac (Fig. 5.8).
- Formation of serous cavities from intraembryonic coelom:
- The IEC gives rise to the serous cavities of the body, i.e. pericardial, pleural and peritoneal cavities (Figs 14.28 to 14.30 ). The IEC is in two halves, one on either side of the midline and joined together cranial to prochordal plate (Figs 14.28 to 14.30 ).
- Before the formation of head fold of the embryo the IEC has a narrow midline portion and two lateral parts. The midline part lies caudal to septum transversum and cranial to prochordal plate near the cranial end of the embryonic disc (Figs 14.28 to 14.30). From this part of the coelom the pericardial cavity is formed. The two lateral limbs of the coelom form the peritoneal cavities (Fig. 14.30). At this stage there is no pleural cavity as the lung buds are not developed.
- For some time, the pericardial and peritoneal cavities are connected to each other by a pair of narrow pericardio-peritoneal canals (Fig. 14.30). These canals are contributed by the cranial part of each limb of inverted U-shaped IEC. The pericardioperitoneal canals undergo great enlargement to form the pleural cavities when the lung buds come in

- Partitions develop to separate definitive pericardial, pleural and peritoneal cavities from one another. Appearance of a cranial and a caudal partition in each pericardio-peritoneal canal separates it from pericardial and peritoneal cavities.
The partitioning of pericardio-peritoneal canal is described in detail in the development of pleural cavities.
- Derivatives of parietal and visceral layers of IEC:
- The parietal and visceral layers of pericardium, pleura and peritoneum are formed from parietal/ somatopleuric and visceral/splanchnopleuric layers of intraembryonic mesoderm respectively.
- The mesodermal cells lining the cavities differentiate into a flattened epithelial lining called mesothelium. The mesothelium gives the peritoneum, pleura and pericardium their smooth surfaces.

### Pericardial Cavity

- The midline part of intraembryonic coelom that lies near the cranial end of embryonic disc forms the pericardial cavity (Figs 14.28 to 14.30).
- Before the formation of head fold the primitive pericardial cavity lies between the septum transversum (cranially) and prochordal plate (caudally) (Figs 14.28 to 14.30). Between septum transversum and prochordal plate is the cardiogenic area where the primitive heart tubes develop (Figs 14.28 to 30). The heart tubes are in the floor of the developing pericardial cavity (Figs 14.28 to 14.30 ).
- During the formation of head fold the heart tube and pericardial cavity undergo $180^{\circ}$ rotation and with the result the heart tube occupies the roof of pericardial cavity.

![img-299.jpeg](img-299.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 14.30: Subdivisions of intraembryonic coelom and their location before head fold

- After the formation of head fold, the pericardial cavity and heart tube occupy a position ventral to the developing foregut, caudal to stomodeum and cranial to the septum transversum (Fig. 14.31).
![img-300.jpeg](img-300.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 14.31: Lateral view of embryo after head fold showing parts of intraembryonic coelom and their relationship to the gut

- The fibrous pericardium and parietal layer of serous pericardium develop from somatopleuric layer of intraembryonic mesoderm. The visceral layer of pericardium develops from splanchnopleuric layer of intraembryonic mesoderm.
The development of pericardial cavity is closely related to the development of heart. Hence, it will be described in detail in the Chapter 15: Cardiovascular System.


### Pleural Cavity

- The right and left pleural cavities develop from right and left pericardio-peritoneal canals (Fig. 14.31), i.e. cranial part of each limb of inverted U-shaped IEC.
- Partitioning of pleural, pericardial and peritoneal cavities:
- Partitions develop to separate definitive pericardial, pleural and peritoneal cavities from one another
- With the growth of lung bud into the pericardioperitoneal canal, the canal enlarges to form pleural cavity (Fig. 14.32A).
![img-301.jpeg](img-301.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 14.32A to C: Formation of pleural cavity and its separation from pericardial and peritoneal cavities: (A) Enlargement of pericardio-peritoneal canal to form pleural cavity; (B) communication between pleural cavity and pericardial and peritoneal cavities by pericardio-pleural and pleuro-peritoneal openings and formation of pleuro-pericardial and pleuro-peritoneal folds; (C) Separation of pleural cavity from the pericardial and peritoneal cavities by formation of pericardio-pleural and pleuro-peritoneal membranes

- A pair of membranous ridges appears in the cranial and caudal parts of lateral wall of pericardioperitoneal canal (Fig. 14.32B). They are:
- A cranial pericardio-pleural fold above the developing lung bud. It separates the pericardial cavity from the pleural cavities as they enlarge. The folds become the pleuropericardial membranes (Fig. 14.32C). The pleuropericardial fold contains the common cardinal vein and phrenic nerve.
- A caudal pleuroperitoneal fold below the developing lung bud. This fold enlarges and forms pleuroperitoneal membrane (Fig. 14.32C).
![img-302.jpeg](img-302.jpeg.jpg)

Developing lung buds are seen projecting into the pericardioperitoneal canal; (C) Transverse section showing the lung buds projecting into the pleural cavity, pericardiopleural membrane containing phrenic nerve and common cardinal vein; (D) Transverse section of cranial part of abdomen showing right and left halves of peritoneal cavity and dorsal and ventral mesogastria in relation to foregut; (E) Transverse section of caudal part of abdomen showing the fused peritoneal cavity and dorsal mesentery in relation to midgut/ hindgut In the figure the lines V - D represents ventral (V) to dorsal (D) aspect of each section.

- Formation of pleural cavity and its communication with other coelomic cavities: As the lung buds enlarge to form the lungs, the pericardio-peritoneal canals balloon out to form the pleural cavities (Figs 14.32A and 14.33C). Each developing pleural cavity now communicates with the pericardial cavity through the pericardio-pleural opening and with the peritoneal cavity through the pleuroperitoneal opening (Fig. 14.32B).
- Closure of communications between coelomic cavities: In subsequent development, these openings are closed by the formation of the pericardio-pleural and the pleuro-peritoneal membranes, respectively (Fig. 14.32C). These two membranes are continuous with the septum transversum. The pericardio-pleural membrane forms the lateral boundary for the pericardio-pleural opening and contains the common cardinal vein and phrenic nerve (Fig. 14.33C). The pleuro-peritoneal membrane, an extension from the body wall closes the pleuro-peritoneal opening and helps in completing the development of diaphragm.
- Extension of pleural cavities into the body wall: The pleural cavities are at first dorsolateral to the pericardium (Fig. 14.34A). With the expansion of lungs and descent of heart, the pleural cavities extend into the mesoderm of the body wall (which is expanding at
the same time), and gradually come to lie lateral, and to some extent ventral, to the pericardium (Fig. 14.34B). The pleural cavities also extend downward into the mesoderm that forms the posterior abdominal wall, and upward toward the neck (Fig. 14.34C).
- Splitting of mesoderm of body wall: With the expansion of the pleural cavity the mesoderm of the body wall is split into two parts. An outer part that forms the wall of the thorax, and an inner part over the pericardial cavity. The latter is called the pleuropericardial membrane. The phrenic nerve runs through this membrane. Later this membrane forms the fibrous pericardium. This explains the course of phrenic nerve over the pericardium.


### Peritoneal Cavity

- Peritoneal cavity is the largest of the coelomic cavities. It is formed from the distal parts of two limbs of the horseshoe or inverted $U$-shaped intraembryonic coelom.
- The closure of pleuroperitoneal openings by pleuroperitoneal membranes separates the peritoneal cavity from the pleural cavities.
- The caudal parts of the two limbs of horse-shoe-shaped IEC were separate initially. With laterals folding of the embryo, the two parts fuse to form single large peritoneal
![img-303.jpeg](img-303.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 14.34A to C: Expansion of pleural cavities into the body wall: (A) Pleural cavities on dorsolateral aspect of pericardium; (B) Ventral and dorsal extension of pleural cavities into the body wall; (C) Upward and downward extension of pleural cavities into the body wall

cavity. But, the cranial part of peritoneal cavity remains in two halves (Figs 14.33A and B and 14.35A and B).

- The peritoneal cavity is in communication with the extraembryonic coelom at the umbilicus up to 10th week of IUL (Fig. 14.32). Later with the reduction of physiological hernia and return of midgut loop into the abdomen from the umbilicus the peritoneal cavity loses communication with the extraembryonic coelom.
- The splanchnopleuric intraembryonic mesoderm forms the visceral layer of peritoneum. The parietal layer of peritoneum derived from somatopleuric layer of intraembryonic mesoderm lines the body wall.
- Mesenteries of the gut:
- The line of reflection of parietal peritoneum to visceral peritoneum forms the mesenteries for various organs of gastrointestinal tract.
- Mesentery is a double layer of visceral peritoneum that connects the primitive gut to the body wall. It contains nerves and vessels.
- There is a dorsal mesentery and a ventral mesentery in relation to the dorsal and ventral margins of the primitive gut.
- The dorsal and ventral mesenteries divided the peritoneal cavity into right and left halves.
- The mesentery connecting the primitive gut to the anterior abdominal wall is called ventral mesentery. The ventral mesentery soon disappears except the part connecting the distal part of foregut, i.e. caudal part of esophagus, stomach and proximal duodenum to the anterior abdominal wall which is known as ventral mesogastrium (Fig. 14.33D). With the extension of developing hepatic bud into the ventral mesogastrium, it splits into a part connecting foregut with liver, the lesser omentum and a part connecting liver with anterior abdominal wall, the falciform ligament (Fig. 14.24).
- Because of fusion of two halves of the caudal part of horse-shoe-shaped IEC the lower part of peritoneal cavity is single and the midgut and hindgut do not have ventral mesentery (Fig. 14.33E).
- The mesentery connecting the primitive gut to the posterior abdominal wall is called dorsal mesentery (Fig. 14.33E). Its attachment is at first in the midline.
- As a result of changes, involving the rotation of the gut, and as a result of some parts of the gut becoming retroperitoneal, the line of attachment of the dorsal mesentery becomes complicated. The peritoneal cavity, therefore, comes to be subdivided into a number of pockets that are partially separated by folds of peritoneum (Fig. 14.36).


### Development of the Lesser Sac/Omental Bursa

- Lesser sac is the part of peritoneal cavity that lies behind the stomach and lesser omentum.
- It communicates with the greater sac of peritoneal cavity through a small opening called Foramen of Winslow or epiploic foramen that lies behind the right free margin of lesser omentum.
- The development of lesser sac is closely related to the development of stomach.
- Three distinct processes are involved in the formation of the lesser sac of peritoneum. They are:
- Formation of pneumoenteric recesses in dorsal mesogastrium and formation of major part of lesser sac:
- Cavities in dorsal mesogastrium: The dorsal mesogastrium that connects the stomach to the posterior wall of the abdomen is, initially, a thick membrane (Fig. 14.37A). Two small cavities appear in this membrane. These are the right and left pneumatoenteric recesses (Fig. 14.37B).
- Formation of part of lesser sac behind stomach from right pneumoentreic recess: The left recess
![img-304.jpeg](img-304.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 14.35A and B: Peritoneal cavity before (A) and after (B) lateral folding of embryo

soon disappears. The right recess opens into the peritoneal cavity (Fig. 14.37C). The cavity of right recess now enlarges considerably and extends to the left to form the part of the lesser sac that lies behind the stomach (Figs 14.37D and E).

- Cranial extension of right pneumoenteric recess behind liver: The cavity of right pneumoenteric recess also extends cranially on the right side of the esophagus, behind the liver and below the diaphragm. This extension is the superior recess of lesser sac (Fig. 14.37F).

Figs 14.37A to G: Development of lesser sac: (A and B) Formation of right and left pneumoenteric receeses in dorsal mesogastrium; (C) Disappearance of left recess and opening of right into the peritoneal cavity; (D and E) Extension of right pneumoenteric recess to the left behind the stomach; (F) Cranial extension of pneumoenteric recess to form superior recess; (G) Extensions of the right pneumoenteric recess above the level of the diaphragm to form infracardiac bursa

- Cranial most extension of right pneumoenteric recess above diaphragm to form infracardiac bursa: Subsequently, with the establishment of the diaphragm, the uppermost part of the cranial extension of right pneumoenteric recess comes to lie above the diaphragm, where it gives rise to the infracardiac bursa (Fig. 14.37G).
- Formation of a part of lesser sac behind lesser omentum:
- Formation of lesser omentum from ventral mesogastrium: While the right pneumoenteric recess extends to the left, the stomach makes a counterclockwise rotation around its longitudinal axis changing its orientation. The posterior border of stomach (to which the dorsal mesogastrium was attached), now faces to the left. This border forms the greater curvature. The ventral border (to which the ventral mesogastrium was attached), now comes to face to the right and forms the lesser curvature (Figs 14.38A and B). The ventral mesogastrium may now be called the lesser omentum.
- Extension of peritoneal cavity behind lesser omentum: As a result of this change in the orientation of the stomach, a part of the peritoneal cavity comes to lie behind the lesser
omentum (M in Fig. 14.38C). This part of the peritoneal cavity now forms vestibule of the lesser sac. It is continuous with the part of lesser sac lying behind the stomach (derived from the right pneumoenteric recess Fig. 14.38C).
- Divisions of dorsal mesogastrium and formation of lower part of lesser sac: With the altered orientation of stomach (Fig. 14.39A) and the development of spleen, the dorsal mesogastrium, which is attached to the greater curvature is subdivided into three parts (Fig. 14.39A).
- The part extending from the stomach to the diaphragm is the gastrophrenic ligaments, from stomach to spleen is the gastrosplenic ligament and from the spleen to the left kidney is the lienorenal ligament. The gastrosplenic and lienorenal ligaments, therefore, form the left margin of the lesser sac and the part of lesser sac extending between these ligaments is the splenic recess of lesser sac.
- The part extending from the lower border of the stomach to the posterior abdominal wall (Figs 14.39C and 14.40A) forms the greater omentum. The greater omentum undergoes enlargement. With the result it comes to increasingly project
![img-307.jpeg](img-307.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 14.38A to C: Schemes to explain formation of the lesser sac: (A) Shows the dorsal and ventral mesogastria. Note that the ventral mesogastrium has a free border facing downward and forward; (B) The appearance if a section is cut in the plane XY in A; (C) Due to rotation of gut original ventral border of the stomach comes to lie on the right side. Two parts of the lesser sac-one derived from the right pneumoenteric recess and the part that comes to lie behind the ventral mesogastrium (lesser omentum)

below the level of the stomach, and becomes folded on itself. The space within this fold forms the inferior recess of the lesser sac (Fig. 14.40B).

- The parts of lesser sac can be summarized as follows (Fig. 14.40C):
- Infracardiac bursa: Cranial extension of right pneumoenteric recess above the diaphragm.
- Superior recess: Cranial extension of right pneumoenteric recess behind liver and on right side of esophagus.
- Vestibule of lesser sac: Part of right pneumoenteric recess behind lesser omentum.
- Part behind stomach: Part of right pneumoenteric recess.
- Splenic recess of lesser sac: Part of right pneumoenteric recess between gastrosplenic and lienorenal ligaments.
- Inferior recess of lesser sac: Extension of right pneumoenteric recess between layers of greater omentum.

![img-309.jpeg](img-309.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 14.40A to C: Development of the lesser sac: Downward extension of the sac by elongation and folding of the greater omentum. The derivation of the parts numbered in (C) is (1) from cranial extension of right pneumoenteric recess above diaphragm (Infracardiac bursa), (2) cranial extension of right pneumoenteric recess on right side of esophagus (superior recess), (3) part of peritoneal cavity that comes to lie behind ventral mesogastrium, (4 and 5) right pneumoenteric recess in between gastrosplenic and lienorenal ligaments, i.e. splenic recess and (6) cavity produced by elongation and folding of greater omentum on itself (inferior recess)

## DIAPHRAGM

- Diaphragm is the dome-shaped musculotendinous partition that separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities.
- The pericardial and pleural cavities are above (or cranial to) it, whereas the peritoneal cavity is below (caudal to) it. The development of the diaphragm is, therefore, intimately related to the development of these cavities.
- Diaphragm is mesodermal in origin. Four mesodermal components contribute for its development (Table.14.4). The components are:
- Septum transversum is the most important component and it contributes for the unpaired anterior and median part that includes central tendon, esophageal and vena caval openings. The liver develops in the caudal part of septum transversum. Its cranial part helps to form the diaphragm.
- Pleuroperitoneal membranes form the paired dorsolateral part of diaphragm.

TABLE 14.4: Developmental components of adult diaphragm

| Components of diaphragm | Embryological origin |
| :-- | :-- |
| Central tendon | Septum transversum (Unpaired) |
| Right and left crus | Dorsal mesentery of esophagus <br> (Unpaired) |
| Large, peripheral (posterolateral) <br> part—costal part | Muscular (mesodermal) ingrowth <br> from lateral body wall external <br> to the part derived from <br> pleuroperitoneal membranes |
| Small peripheral part—right and <br> left | Pleuroperitoneal membranes <br> (Paired) |

- Ventral and dorsal mesenteries of esophagus form the irregular dorsal median part that fuses with septum transversum and pleuroperitoneal membranes.
- Mesoderm of body wall including mesoderm around dorsal aorta that fuses with pleuroperitoneal membranes.
- Fusion of mesodermal components to form diaphragm: The formation of the septum transversum was

considered in detail in Chapter 5: Further Development of Embryonic Disc.

- Septum transversum is the unsplit part of intraembryonic mesoderm in the cranial part of embryo. It develops during 3rd week of IUL and lies opposite C3, C4 and C5 somites.
- After the formation of head fold, during 4th week of IUL the septum transversum migrates in a ventrocaudal direction, and forms the thick incomplete partition between thoracic and abdominal cavities, leaving large gaps that has to be closed by other components that contribute components for diaphragm development (Figs 14.33A and B).
- Dorsal to septum transversum is the esophagus and its mesenteries. The ventral margin of esophagus is connected to the dorsal border of septum transversum by ventral mesentery (derived from septum transversum). The dorsal margin of esophagus is attached to posterior abdominal wall by dorsal mesentery (mesoesophagus) (Fig. 14.41A).
- Dorso-lateral to the septum transversum, the pleural and peritoneal cavities communicate through the pleuroperitoneal canals that lie one on either side of the esophagus. Dorsal margin of septum transversum forms the anterior boundary for the pleuroperitoneal openings for some time (Fig. 14.42A).
- The partition between the thorax and the abdomen is completed when the pleuroperitoneal canals are closed by the formation of the pleuroperitoneal membranes (Fig. 14.41A).
- During 6th week septum transversum expands and fuses with ventral and dorsal mesenteries of esophagus and pleuroperitoneal membranes (Figs 14.41B and 14.42B). Dorsal mesentery of esophagus (mesoesophagus) contributes for the median portion containing the two crura of the diaphragm.
- During 9th-12th weeks of IUL the pleural cavities increase in size. Simultaneously, the diaphragm also enlarges, and this enlargement takes place at the expense of the lateral body wall (Figs 14.41C and 14.42C). Splitting of body wall tissue contributes for the peripheral parts of diaphragm outside the parts contributed by pleuroperitoneal membranes. With the result the thorax as a whole also expands and extensions of pleural cavity into body wall forms costodiaphragmatic recess of pleura (Fig. 14.34C).
- Various views on proportion of contribution by each developmental component: There is, however, considerable controversy as to how much of the diaphragm is formed from each of the constituents. According to some workers, the septum transversum forms only the central tendon, while according to others, it gives rise to almost the whole of the costal and sternal parts of the diaphragm. The crura of the diaphragm are
![img-310.jpeg](img-310.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 14.41A to C: Development of diaphragm: (A) Pleuroperitoneal canals, septum transversum and mesenteries of esophagus; (B) Closure of pleuroperitoneal canal their closure; (C) Expansion from body wall

formed from the mesoderm of the posterior abdominal wall (mesoesophagus/dorsal mesentery of esophagus), as a result of the downward extension of the pleural cavities into this region.

- Embryological components of adult diaphragm:
- Septum transversum-Central tendon of diaphragm
- Pleuroperitoneal membranes-Small peripheral part
- Mesoderm of body wall—Large peripheral part
- Dorsal mesentery of esophagus-Crura of diaphragm.
- Diaphragm innervation:
- During 4th week of IUL septum transversum lies at the level of C3, C4 and C5 somites. The ventral rami of spinal nerves from C3, C4 and C5 spinal segments grow into the septum transversum and fuse to form the phrenic nerve.
- The phrenic nerves enter septum transversum through pleuropericardial fold and later pleuropericardial membrane. This membrane forms the fibrous pericardium. Thus, the phrenic nerves course through the fibrous pericardium. Phrenic nerve contributes for sole motor and sensory supply to the central part of diaphragm.
- The peripheral part of diaphragm develops from the lateral body wall. Lower intercostal nerves provide sensory supply to this part of diaphragm derived from lateral body wall. The sensory innervation of the peripheral parts of the diaphragm by the intercostal nerves is an evidence for the contribution made by the body wall to the muscle.
- Descent of diaphragm:
- At first (4th week of IUL) the septum transversum is at cervical 3rd-5th segments.
- Later (6th weeks of IUL) the diaphragm descends to the thoracoabdominal junction opposite T7-T12 vertebra.
- At 8th week of IUL the dorsal part of diaphragm reaches the level of T12/L1 vertebra due to rapid growth of dorsal part of body of embryo when compared to ventral part.
- When the diaphragm descends, it carries its nerve supply (phrenic nerve) with it.
- The factors responsible for descent of diaphragm are:
- Elongation of neck
- Descent of heart
- Expansion of pleural cavities.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of diaphragm

- Diaphragmatic hernias: Failure of development of parts of diaphragm resulting in gaps in the muscle. Abdominal contents may pass through these gaps to produce diaphragmatic hernias. Diaphragmatic hernias may be (Fig. 14.43):
- Posterolateral: Due to failure of closure of pleuroperitoneal canal.
- Posterior: Due to failure of development of crura.
- Retrosternal: Due to the presence of abnormally large gap between sternal and costal parts of diaphragm.
- Accessory diaphragm: It is rare and when present it partially subdivides the lung into two parts.
- Congenital eventration of diaphragm: Diaphragm may be thin and aponeurotic and may bulge upward into the thorax. The bulging may be unilateral or may be confined to a smaller area.

## RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

- Subdivisions of respiratory system:
- Anatomically it is divided into upper and lower respiratory tracts.
- Upper respiratory tract includes nostrils, nasal cavities, paranasal air sinuses, pharynx and larynx.
- Lower respiratory tract consists of trachea, bronchi, terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveoli.
- Functionally it is divided into conducting part and respiratory part.
- Conducting part includes entire upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory part up to terminal bronchioles and it facilitates conduction, cleaning, warming and moistening of air.
- Respiratory part includes respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli and is concerned with exchange of gases.
The development of various components of upper respiratory tract up to pharynx is described in the chapters of face, nose and palate and in alimentary system-Part 1. In the present chapter development of various components of respiratory system from larynx to alveoli will be dealt.
- Developmental primordia of respiratory system:
- The respiratory system is endodermal in origin.
- It develops from a median endodermal diverticulum of the foregut (respiratory diverticulum) (Figs 14.33B and C and 14.44A) and the adjacent splanchnopleuric intraembryonic mesoderm.
- The lining epithelium of larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli are endodermal in origin.
- The connective tissue, cartilages and muscles in relation to the various parts of respiratory system
are derived from splanchnopleuric mesoderm surrounding the foregut.
- Development of respiratory (laryngotracheal) diverticulum:
- Development of respiratory system is first seen as a midline evagination known as respiratory diverticulum or laryngotracheal diverticulum from the ventral wall of pharyngeal part of foregut (Fig. 14.44A).
- Respiratory or laryngotracheal diverticulum is caudal to hypobranchial eminence (epiglottis) and is in the floor of developing pharynx (Figs 14.45A and 14.46).
- It extends in caudal direction and elongates (Figs 14.44 A to D and 14.46).
- Derivatives of respiratory diverticulum:
- The free caudal end of the respiratory diverticulum grows downward to enter the thorax where it becomes bifid to form the right and left bronchial/ lung buds (Figs 14.47 and 14.48A).
- The part of diverticulum cranial to the bifurcation is laryngotracheal tube and it forms the larynx and trachea, while the lung buds form the bronchi and lung parenchyma (Figs 14.44D and 14.46).
- Separation of laryngotracheal tube from the foregut:
- The groove separating the ventral pharyngeal wall and the proximal part of respiratory diverticulum is the laryngotracheal groove. It appears during 4th week of IUL (Figs 14.44C, 14.45A and 14.48A).
- The laryngotracheal groove is flanked by sixth pharyngeal arch on either side (Fig. 14.45A).
- As the laryngotracheal groove deepens, the laryngotracheal tube and its continuation, the respiratory diverticulum are formed (Figs 14.44D and 14.46 ).
- At the caudal part of respiratory diverticulum two lateral folds known as tracheooesophageal folds grow medially from the margins of tracheoesophageal groove, and fuse to form tracheoesophageal septum (Figs 14.44B and D).
- The tracheoesophageal septum is coronally oriented and extends caudocranially. The caudal part of septum separates trachea ventrally from the esophagus dorsally (Figs 14.44B and D).
- The respiratory primordium maintains its communication with the pharynx through laryngeal orifice or inlet of larynx. The cranial part of tracheoesophageal septum is arrested to form a sagittal slit the inlet of larynx or furcula of His through which the laryngotracheal tube communicates with the pharynx (Figs 14.44D and 14.49A).

![img-313.jpeg](img-313.jpeg.jpg)

- Invagination of lung bud into the pleural cavity:
- Each lung bud invaginates into the pericardioperitoneal canal (Fig. 14.33B).
- The right and left pericardioperitoneal canals form right and left pleural cavities (Figs 14.48B and 14.50).


## LARYNX

- The larynx develops from the cranial most part of the laryngotracheal tube.
- Inlet of larynx:
- The communication between the laryngotracheal tube and the pharynx persists as a slit like orifice, the inlet of the larynx or furcula of His (Figs 14.45A and 14.49A).
- The laryngeal inlet is surrounded by the mesenchyme of 4th and 6th pharyngeal arches. This mesenchyme proliferates to form thyroid, cricoid, and arytenoid cartilages (Figs 14.45A and 14.49A and B).
- The slit-like laryngeal inlet becomes $U$-shaped in the beginning, and is bounded at its cephalic end by caudal part of hypobranchial eminence (4th arch derivative) and on each side by a mucous fold derived from 6th arch, in which a pair of arytenoid swellings develop (Figs 14.45B and C).
- Because of proliferation of mesenchyme of 4th and 6th arches the $U$-shaped laryngeal inlet now changes into a $T$-shaped orifice. The horizontal limb of $T$ is caudal to hypobranchial eminence and the vertical limb is between arytenoid swellings. Reorganization of cartilages results in characteristic adult shape of laryngeal inlet. The caudal part of hypobranchial eminence (4th arch) forms epiglottis and cuneiform cartilages. The upper part of arytenoid swelling forms the arytenoid and corniculate cartilages, whereas the lower part of it forms the cricoid cartilage (Figs 14.45 C and 14.49B and C).

Fig. 14.46: Developing larynx, trachea and lung and the pharyngeal arches and stomodeum

- Developmental components of larynx:
- Lining epithelium: The internal lining of larynx is derived from endoderm.
- Cartilages: The epiglottis, thyroid and cuneiform cartilages are derived from 4th arch. Cricoid,
![img-316.jpeg](img-316.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 14.47: Developing lung buds coming in contact with pleuropericardial canal developing pharynx
arytenoid and corniculate cartilages are derivatives of 6th arch (Figs 14.49A to C).

- Muscles: The laryngeal muscles are derived from branchial mesoderm as indicated by their nerve supply (All intrinsic muscles by recurrent laryngeal

nerve (6th arch) except cricothyroid which is supplied by external laryngeal branch of superior laryngeal nerve (4th arch).

- Interior of larynx: Initially there will be rapid proliferation of epithelium of larynx occluding its lumen. Later vacuolation and recanalization of epithelium produces two lateral recesses known as ventricles of larynx. These recesses are bounded by endodermal folds that differentiate to form an upper pair of vestibular folds and a lower pair of vocal folds. The vocal folds are at the junction of 4th and 6th arches. Hence, the sensory innervation of mucosa of larynx above the vocal folds is from internal laryngeal branch of vagus (4th arch) whereas that part below the vocal folds is from recurrent laryngeal branch of vagus (6th arch) (Fig. 14.49C).


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of larynx

- Laryngocele: In this condition, the laryngeal saccule is abnormally large. It may extend beyond the larynx proper, and may even form a swelling in the neck.
- Congenital stenosis or atresia: There may be stenosis or atresia of the larynx.
- The entire larynx, or part of it (e.g. vocal cords), may be duplicated.
- Laryngoptosis: The larynx lies low down in the neck. Part of it may be behind the sternum. One or more of the laryngeal cartilages may be absent.


## TRACHEA

- The trachea develops from the intermediate part of laryngotracheal tube that lies between the points of its
bifurcation into bronchial or lung buds and the larynx. With the caudocranial extension of tracheoesophageal septum, the trachea elongates. At birth the bifurcation of trachea lies at the level of lower border of 4th thoracic vertebra.
- Developmental components of trachea:
- The endoderm of laryngotracheal diverticulum forms the lining epithelium and glands of trachea.
- The cartilage, muscle, and connective tissue of trachea develop from splanchnopleuric mesoderm surrounding laryngotracheal tube.


## EXTRAPULMONARY BRONCHI

- The laryngotracheal diverticulum divides during 5th week of IUL to form the right and left principal bronchi.
- The right principal bronchus is larger than the left and is in line with the trachea. The left division comes to lie more transversely (Fig. 14.48B).


## INTRAPULMONARY BRONCHI AND LUNGS

- Formation of pleural cavity and pleura:
- With the subsequent growth of the respiratory diverticulum in caudal and lateral direction, the lung buds come in contact with the respective pericardioperitoneal canal and bulges into it (Figs 14.47, 14.48B and C and 14.50).
- The pericardioperitoneal canals are narrow, and lie on either side of the foregut. The canals are filled with gradually expanding bronchial/lung buds (Fig. 14.51).
![img-317.jpeg](img-317.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 14.48A to D: Respiratory diverticulum growth and development: (A) Bifid respiratory diverticulum to form the right and left bronchial/lung buds. (B) Formation of principal bronchi and contact of lung buds with pleural cavity; (C) Formation of lobar bronchi and expanding lung within pleural cavity; (D) Formation of segmental bronchi

- Pleuropericardial and pleuroperitoneal folds separate the pericardioperitoneal canals from the pericardial and peritoneal cavities, respectively. This results in formation of primitive pleural cavity from that part of pleuropericardial canal lying in contact with the dividing and expanding lung bud (Fig. 14.51).
- The splanchnopleuric layer of intraembryonic mesoderm in contact with the dividing and expanding lung bud becomes the visceral pleura and the somatopleuric layer of intraembryonic mesoderm covering the inner aspect of body wall forms the parietal pleura. The space between the parietal and visceral pleura forms the pleural cavity (Figs 14.48C and D).
- Subdivisions of intrapulmonary bronchi:
- When it comes in contact with the developing pericardioperitoneal canal (pleural cavity) the right
and left principal bronchi subdivide into secondary/ lobar bronchi (Figs 14.48C and 14.52).
- The left principal bronchus shows two subdivisions (upper and lower) that represent the two lobar bronchi of the left lung.
- The right division divides into three lobar bronchi (superior, middle, and inferior) of right lung.
- As the pleuralines the surface of each lobe separately, the lobes come to be separated by fissures (Figs 14.48 C and D and 14.52 ).
- The substance of the lung is formed by further subdivisions of the lobar bronchi.
- Each lobar bronchus further subdivides to form segmental bronchi in the 7th week of IUL.
- Each segmental bronchus and its surrounding mesenchyme constitute the bronchopulmonary segment. Each lung contains 10 bronchopulmonary segments (Figs 14.48D and 14.52).

Fig. 14.51: The three coelomic cavities with pleuropericardial and pleuroperitoneal membranes separating them

- The total number of divisions of each main bronchus is about 17 by 7 th month of IUL, and six more after birth to attain final shape of adult lung.
- Divisions and subdivisions of each segmental bronchus form the bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, and alveoli. After the establishment of the bronchial tree, alveoli are formed by expansion of the terminal parts of the tree.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the trachea

- Agenesis of trachea: Very rarely trachea may be absent. The bronchi to the lungs may arise from the blind bifurcation (Fig. 14.53B) or from the esophagus (Fig. 14.53C).
- Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF): There is abnormal communication between esophagus and trachea. This is associated with esophageal atresia. This occurs due to defective formation of tracheoesophageal septum, resulting in communication between trachea and esophagus. The various types of TEF are:
- Atresia of distal esophagus with communication between proximal esophagus and trachea (Fig. 14.53D)
- Both proximal and distal parts of esophagus connected to trachea by a single passage (Fig. 14.53E).
- A diverticulum may arise from the trachea.
- Accessory/displaced bronchi may arise from the trachea above its bifurcation or even from the esophagus. Such a bronchus:
- May be blind (Fig. 14.54A).
- May supply a mass of lung tissue (accessory lobe) which is not a normal part of the lungs (Fig. 14.54B).
- May replace a normal bronchus (e.g. apical) in one of the lungs (Fig. 14.54C).
![img-321.jpeg](img-321.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 14.52: Sagittal section of a developing lung at 6 weeks gestation branching bronchial tree and mesenchymal condensation to form lobes of lung

- Parenchyma of lung:
- The parts of the lung parenchyma, developing from the endoderm of lobar bronchi, are separated from one another by s mesoderm.
- The endoderm of respiratory diverticulum forms the lining epithelium of the bronchial tree.
- The mesoderm forms the cartilages, smooth muscle and connective tissue, basis of lung and also gives rise to the pleura. As the pleura lines the surface of each lobe separately, the lobes come to be separated by fissures.
Development of various segments of respiratory system is represented in Flowchart 14.2.

Maturation of lung: There are four stages in the maturation of lung. The ramifications of the bronchial tree pass through these stages. They are represented in Table 14.5 and Figure 14.55.

- During fetal life all subdivisions of the bronchial tree are lined by cuboidal epithelium that undergoes changes with the maturation of lung (Table 14.5). Within the respiratory passages some of the cells become specialized to for production of surfactant. This substance is rich in phospholipids and forms a thin layer over alveoli and reduces surface tension.
- Pulmonary surfactant: Before birth the respiratory passages are full of fluid derived from amniotic fluid which also contains surfactant. When the new born begins to breathe, the fluid is rapidly absorbed and partly expelled. The surfactant remains as a thin layer lining the alveoli. This prevents collapse of alveoli during expiration. In premature babies, a deficiency of surfactant may cause difficulty in expansion of the lung and can be a cause of death of the baby.
- Viable age of fetus: The pulmonary circulation is established early in fetal life. However, most of the blood is at first short circuited through foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus. The amount of blood circulating through the lungs progressively increase, and by the 7th month of IUL the circulation is rich enough to provide adequate oxygen for sustaining life. Hence an infant born, thereafter, is viable (i.e. it can live).


### Molecular mechanism in respiratory system development

- Appearance of lung bud is dependent on increase in retinoic acid in adjacent mesoderm
- Transcription factor TBX4 is expressed in the endoderm of foregut that develops into respiratory diverticulum.
- Branching of bronchial tree: Interaction between the endoderm derived epithelium and splanchnopleuric mesoderm derived mesenchyme (epithelial-mesenchymal interaction) under the influence of fibroblast growth factors.

Figs 14.54A to C: Varieties of tracheal bronchi: (A) Blind bronchus; (B) Supplying accessory lobe; (C) Replacing apical bronchus

- Adult position oflungs: With the branching of bronchial tree and expansion of terminal parts of tree, the lungs assume the adult position and bifurcation of trachea is fixed at 4th thoracic vertebra.
- Factors influencing lung development:
- Adequate thoracic space facilitating lung growth
- Fetal respiratory movements
- Adequate amniotic fluid volume.
- Developmental relationship between lungs and kidneys: Urine excreted from fetal kidneys maintains the amniotic fluid volume which is essential for normal fetal lung development. In renal agenesis reduced bronchial breathing results in pulmonary hypoplasia.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the lungs:

- Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or hyaline membrane disease (HMD): Insufficient production of surfactant leading to collapse of lung in expiration. This requires prenatal treatment of mothers with glucocorticoids and use of artificial surfactants in the premature new born.
- Agenesis and hypoplasia: The whole of one lung, or one of its lobes (and associated bronchi), may fail to develop, or may remain underdeveloped.

Flowchart 14.1: Overview of development of liver, biliary apparatus and pancreas zygote
![img-324.jpeg](img-324.jpeg.jpg)

### - Abnormalities of lobes:

- Absence of fissures that is normally present leads to a reduction in the number of lobes. Absence of the transverse fissure of the right lung results in a right lung with only two lobes (Fig. 14.56A).
- Presence of abnormal fissures:
- A transverse fissure may be present on the left side with the result that the left lung has three lobes (Fig. 14.56B).
- The medial basal segment (cardiac lobe) of the left lung may be separated by a fissure from the rest of the lower lobe (Fig. 14.56D).
- The superior segment of the lower lobe may be similarly separated (Fig. 14.56C).
- A part of the upper lobe of the right lung may come to lie medial to the azygos vein. This part is called the azygos lobe (Fig. 14.57). In this condition the azygos vein is suspended from the wall of the thorax by a fold of parietal pleura (mesoazygos).
- Accessory lobes are usually connected to bronchi that are not part of the normal bronchial tree. Such bronchi may arise from the:
- Trachea above its bifurcation (upper accessory lobe) (Fig. 14.18B).
- Esophagus (lower accessory lobe, Fig. 14.22). Occasionally, the lobe may not have any bronchus.
- Sequestration of lung tissue: An area of embryonic lung tissue may separate from the tracheobronchial tree (sequestration = separation). Such tissue may form a complete lobe (lobar sequestration), which may have an independent pleural covering. In other cases the sequestrated tissue may lie within a lobe (intralobar sequestration). The sequestrated lung tissue derives its blood supply from an abnormal branch of the aorta. The condition is most frequently seen in the lower lobe of the left lung.
- Lung hernia: Part of a lung may herniate: (a) through the inlet of the thorax, (b) through a defect in the thoracic wall, (c) into the mediastinum, or (d) into the opposite pleural cavity.
- Ectopic lung: Either the entire lung or a lobe of it arises from trachea or esophagus. This is due to the development of respiratory buds from the foregut in addition to the main respiratory system or in place of normal lung (Fig. 14.58).
- Congenital cysts of lung: Due to dilatation of terminal bronchi. These can be multiple and give honeycomb appearance of lung on X-ray.

TABLE 14.5: Stages in the maturation of lung—morphological changes in bronchial tree and its functional importance

| Stage of lung and age of embryo/fetus/new born | Changes in the morphology of bronchial tree and its functional importance |
| :--: | :--: |
| Pseudoglandular stage 6-16 weeks (2nd-4th month of IUL) (Fig. 14.55A) | - The lung is similar to exocrine gland giving the appearance of tubuloacinar mucus gland. <br> - Bronchi divide up to terminal bronchiole. Respiratory portion of lung not developed. <br> - Proximal part of bronchial tree is lined by columnar epithelium and the distal part by cuboidal epithelium. <br> - Adjacent mesenchymal cells around the epithelium differentiate into smooth muscle, cartilage and connective tissue cells. <br> - Respiration is not possible; hence, premature fetuses born at this stage cannot survive. |
| Canalicular stage 17-26 weeks (5th-7th month of IUL) (Fig. 14.55B) | - Three generations of branching of bronchial tree occurs. <br> - Respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and few alveolar sacs are formed. <br> - Vascularization of lung tissue due to increase in capillary network in relation to distal air spaces, i.e. future alveoli. <br> - Some of the cuboidal respiratory epithelial cells change into simple squamous type I pneumocytes. Remaining cuboidal cells are specialized and form type II pneumocytes that act as stem cells and produce the surfactant. <br> - Fetus born at this stage can survive if intensive care is provided. |

Stage of lung and age of embryo/fetus/new born

Saccular stage
27 weeks to full term (7th month of IUI, to delivery) (Fig. 14.55C)

Alveolar stage
From birth to 8 years of postnatal life (Fig. 14.55D)

### Changes in the morphology of bronchial tree and its functional importance

- More number of primitive alveoli develops.
- Change in lining epithelium of alveolar sacs to type I pneumocytes with change of cuboidal cells lining bronchioles into thin, flat cells.
- Gas exchange between blood and air possible in primitive alveoli
- Type II cells secrete phospholipid rich surfactant that lowers surface tension and prevent collapse of alveoli during expiration.
- Intimate contact between epithelium of alveolar sac and capillaries (blood-air barrier) develops to permit gaseous exchange.
- The fetus born at this stage is viable.
- Division of respiratory bronchioles forming alveolar ducts and definitive alveoli takes place.
- Definitive alveoli will be formed and their number is more.
- The amount of surfactant production increases.
- Rapid exchange of gases between alveolar epithelium and capillary endothelium occurs.

## EMBRYOLOGICAL BASIS FOR CLINICAL CONDITIONS OR ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS

### Case Scenario 1

A baby was born at 26th week of gestation and was having difficulty in breathing. Can you explain the embryological basis for this condition and how this baby can be treated to avoid mortality?

- This condition is called neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or hyaline membrane disease (HMD).
- The alveoli of a baby born before 28 weeks of gestation (premature birth/preterm delivery) are not fully
![img-329.jpeg](img-329.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 14.58: Fetus with extrathoracic lung in abdominal cavity
developed and cannot produce sufficient phospholipid rich fluid called surfactant.

- The pulmonary surfactant is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells from 26th week to birth with a gradual increase in quantity with increasing maturity of alveoli (Fig. 14.55)
- The surfactant lowers surface tension at air-blood interface and prevents collapse of alveoli during expiration. Insufficient production of surfactant raises the air-blood surface membrane tension leading to collapse of alveoli during expiration and thus difficulty in breathing.
- The mortality rate is nearly $20 \%$ for these infants if left untreated. The treatment requires a specialized neonatal

intensive care for breathing support from a ventilator and artificial surfactants.

### Case Scenario 2

At autopsy of a dead aborted fetus there was only trachea, left bronchus and left lung in the thoracic cavity. Right bronchus was seen as a blind diverticulum. Right lung was found in the abdominal cavity with the right bronchus extending from esophagus. What is the embryological basis for this condition?

- This is a case of an extrathoracic lung or ectopic lung. It is a congenital abnormality in the development of lung (Fig. 14.58).
- The laryngotracheal diverticulum originating from the ventral wall of developing foregut and divides during 5th week of IUL to form the right and left principal bronchi.
- The principal bronchi when they come in contact with the developing pericardioperitoneal canals (pleural cavity) each undergoes subdivisions to form intrapulmonary bronchial tree.
- The contact between the endodermal respiratory diverticulum and its cartilaginous, muscular and connective tissue components of splanchnopleuric mesodermal origin is under the influence of retinoic acid produced by the adjacent mesoderm and its upregulation of TBX4 transcription factor.
- In the present case due to the reduced production of retinoic acid in the mesoderm of thoracic region adjacent to right principal bronchus prevented the contact, growth and expansion of right principal bronchus. Hence, right principal bronchus ended as a blind diverticulum.
- Additional respiratory diverticulum originated from the esophagus part of foregut and has come into contact with the retinoic acid rich splanchnic mesoderm in the right side of abdominal cavity and has grown and expanded in to the lung. Hence, it resulted in extrathoracic lung of esophageal origin.


### Case Scenario 3

A mother brought her newborn baby to the pediatrician with a complaint of feeding difficulty as the baby is not swallowing the milk and when tried to feed there were episodes of choking. The pediatrician attempted to introduce a nasogastric tube but could not. He ordered for an X-ray chest which showed absence of stomach bubble. When enquired about antenatal history it was found about to be a case of polyhydramnios.

- It is a case of esophageal atresia (Fig. 14.53)
- Because of esophageal atresia, during intrauterine life the fetus could not swallow amniotic fluid and it resulted in polyhydramnios.
- Because of esophageal atresia the new born is not able to swallow the milk and it resulted in choking and inability to pass the nasogastric tube.
- Absence of stomach bubble on X-ray suggests the agenesis of esophagus.
- Treatment is to reconnect the two ends of esophagus.


### Case Scenario 4

What is the embryological basis for difference in innervation of mucosa and muscles of larynx by different nerves?

- The laryngeal muscles are derived from branchial mesoderm as indicated by their nerve supply. All intrinsic muscles of larynx are supplied by recurrent laryngeal nerve (nerve of 6th arch) except cricothyroid which is supplied by external laryngeal branch of superior laryngeal nerve (nerve of 4th arch).
- The vocal folds are formed at the junction of 4th and 6th arches. Hence, the sensory innervation of mucosa of larynx above the vocal folds is from internal laryngeal branch of superior laryngeal nerve vagus (4th arch) whereas that part below the vocal folds is from recurrent laryngeal branch of vagus ( 6 th arch) (Fig. 14.49C).
