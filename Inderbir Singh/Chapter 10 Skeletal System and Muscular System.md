# Chapter 10 Skeletal System and Muscular System

## HIGHLIGHTS

- Subdivisions of intraembryonic mesoderm are paraxial mesoderm, intermediate mesoderm and lateral plate mesoderm.
- The paraxial mesoderm extends as a longitudinal column on either side of the notochord and the developing neural tube. With the formation of otic vesicle (neuroectodermal thickenings that form the membranous labyrinth of internal ear), the paraxial mesoderm is divided into preotic and postotic parts. The preotic part is unsegmented and is called head mesoderm (somitomeres). The postotic part undergoes segmentation into 40-45 pairs of segments called somites.
- Somites undergo division into three parts: (1) the dermatome which forms the dermis of the skin; (2) myotome which forms skeletal muscle; and (3) sclerotome which helps to form the vertebral column and ribs.
- The skull is divided into neurocranium and viscerocranium. Viscerocranium forms the facial skeleton. The neurocranium forms the bones around the brain.
- The neural crest cells enter the head mesoderm and both together contribute for facial skeleton (viscero/splanchnocranium) and membranous neurocranium. The chondrocranium or base of skull rostral to the level of pituitary gland is formed by neural crest cells. The part posterior to it is formed by occipital sclerotomes.
- The vertebral column is derived from the sclerotomes of somites. Each sclerotome divides into three parts: (1) cranial; (2) middle; and (3) caudal.
- A vertebra is formed by fusion of the caudal part of one sclerotome and the cranial part of the next sclerotome. It is, therefore, intersegmental in position.
- The middle part of the sclerotome forms an intervertebral disc, which is therefore segmental in position.
- The sternum is formed by fusion of right and left sternal bars.
- The skull develops from mesenchyme around the developing brain. Some skull bones are formed in membrane (e.g. parietal); some partly in membrane and partly in cartilage (e.g. sphenoid); and a few entirely in cartilage (e.g. ethmoid).
- The mandible is formed in membrane from the mesenchyme of the mandibular process.
- Limbs are first seen as outgrowths (limb buds) from the side wall of the embryo. Each bud grows and gets subdivided to form parts of the limb.
- Limb bones develop from mesenchyme of the limb buds. Joints are formed in intervals between bone ends.
- All muscles of the body develop from mesoderm except muscles of iris, arrectores pilorum of skin and myoepithelial cells lining ducts of sweat glands.
- Skeletal muscle is derived partly from somites and partly from mesenchyme of the region.
- Most smooth muscle is formed from mesenchyme related to viscera and blood vessels.
- Cardiac muscle is formed from mesoderm related to developing heart.

## PART 1: SKELETAL SYSTEM

## INTRODUCTION

The intraembryonic mesoderm divides into paraxial, intermediate and lateral plate mesoderm. The paraxial mesoderm extends as a longitudinal column on either side of the notochord and the developing neural tube. The developing otic capsules (neuroectodermal thickenings that form the membranous labyrinth of internal ear) divide the paraxial mesoderm into preotic and postotic parts. The preotic part of paraxial mesoderm is the unsegmented head mesoderm (somitomeres). The postotic part of paraxial mesoderm shows 40-45 pairs of segments called somites that appear in craniocaudal sequence. Somites undergo division into three parts. These are:

1. Dermatome which forms the segmental dermis of the skin.
2. Myotome which forms the skeletal muscle.
3. Sclerotome which helps to form the vertebral column.

Some books refer them as dermomyotome and sclerotome as shown in Flowchart 10.1.

Skeletal system includes cartilage and bone. The process of formation of cartilage and bone has been considered in Chapter 7. Skeleton is classified into axial skeleton

and appendicular skeleton. All bones are of mesodermal origin. Bones can be classified as cartilaginous bones or membranous bones or membrano-cartilaginous bones on the basis of their mode of ossification.

- Most bones of the axial skeleton are derived from sclerotomes of somites (paraxial mesoderm) and head mesoderm.
- Bones of the shoulder and hip girdle, and of the limbs, arise from somatopleuric layer of lateral plate mesoderm.
- Some bones of the face and skull are derivatives of the mesoderm of pharyngeal arches that are invaded by neural crest.


## SOMITES

The paraxial mesoderm becomes segmented to form 40-45 pairs of somites that lie on either side of the developing neural tube (Figs 5.6 to 5.8 ) and notochord.

The somites appear between the 20th and 30th day of development. Hence, the 4th week of development is known as somite period of development.

A cross section through a somite shows that it is a triangular structure and has a cavity (Figs 10.1A to C). The somite is divisible into three parts.

1. The ventromedial part is called the sclerotome. The cells of the sclerotome migrate medially. They surround the neural tube and give rise to the vertebral column and ribs (Figs 10.1A to C).
2. The lateral part is called the dermatome. The cells of this part also migrate, and come to line the deep surface of the ectoderm covering the entire body. These cells give rise to the dermis of the skin and to subcutaneous tissue (Figs 10.1A to C).
3. The intermediate part is the myotome. It gives rise to striated muscle as described in the following section (Figs 10.1A to C).
Recently, it has been held that the dermatome only forms dermis on the back of the head and trunk, and that dermis elsewhere is derived from lateral plate mesoderm.

In the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions, one spinal nerve innervates each myotome. The number of somites formed in these regions, therefore, corresponds to the number of spinal nerves. In the coccygeal region, the somites exceed the number of spinal nerves but many of them subsequently degenerate. The first cervical somite is caudal to tip of notochord (which becomes the apical ligament of dens of axis vertebra). The first cervical is not the most cranial somite to be formed. Cranial to it, there are:

- Occipital somites (4-5) which give rise to muscles of the tongue and are supplied by the hypoglossal nerve.
- Preoccipital (or preotic) somites (somitomeres), supplied by the third, 4th and 6th cranial nerves.

![img-182.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-182.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 10.1A to C: (A) Somites lying on either side of the neural tube. Note subdivisions of somite. (B) The cells of the sclerotome have migrated medially and now surround the neural tube. The myotome is innervated by nerves growing out of the neural tube. (C) The cells of the dermatome have migrated to form the dermis of the skin

- Total number of somites and their classification craniocaudally is shown in Table 10.1.


## DEVELOPMENT OF AXIAL SKELETON

The axial skeleton consists of vertebral column, ribs, sternum and skull.

### Vertebral Column

- The vertebral column is formed from the sclerotomes of the somites. The cells of each sclerotome get converted into loose mesenchyme. This mesenchyme migrates medially and surrounds the notochord (Flowchart 10.1 and Fig. 10.2).
- The mesenchyme then extends backward on either side of the neural tube and surrounds it (Flowchart 10.1 and Fig. 10.3). Extensions of this mesenchyme also take place laterally in the position to be subsequently occupied by the transverse processes, and ventrally in the body wall, in the position to be occupied by the ribs.
- For some time, the mesenchyme derived from each somite can be seen as a distinct segment. The mesenchymal cells of each segment are at first uniformly distributed (Fig. 10.4A).
- However, the cells soon become condensed in a region that runs transversely across the middle of the segment. This condensed region is called the perichordal disc.

TABLE 10.1: Distribution of somites and their skeletal and muscular derivatives

| Somites | Number of <br> pairs | Skeletal <br> elements | Musculature |

Fig. 10.3: Formation of mesenchymal basis of the neural arch and of the costal element

Above and below it there are less condensed and more condensed parts (Fig. 10.4B).

- The mesenchymal basis of the body (or centrum) of each vertebra is formed by fusion of the more condensed part of one sclerotomic segment with the less condensed part of adjoining segment (Fig. 10.4C).
- The perichordal disc becomes the intervertebral disc.
- The neural arches and their processes are continuous with the less dense part of sclerotomic segment. The neural arch, the transverse processes and the costal elements are formed in the same way as the body.
- The interspinous and intertransverse ligaments are formed in the same manner as the intervertebral disc.
- The notochord disappears in the region of the vertebral bodies. In the region of the intervertebral discs, the notochord becomes expanded and forms the nucleus pulposus (Fig. 10.5).
From the above account, we may note that (Fig. 10.5, Flowchart 10.2):
- The vertebra is an intersegmental structure made up from portions of two somites.
- The intervertebral disc is formed at the center of the somite.
- The transverse processes and ribs are also intersegmental. They separate the muscles derived from two adjoining myotomes.
![img-185.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-185.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 10.4A to C: (A) Mesenchyme derived from somites is seen in the form of segments. (B) Each segment has a central condensed part, and cranial less dense and caudal more dense parts. (C) Centrum of a vertebra is formed by fusion of more dense caudal part of one sclerotomic segment with the cranial less dense part of adjacent sclerotomic segment. Hence, it is an intersegmental structure. Each intervertebral disc is derived from the condensed part of one somite. Hence, it is segmental in position
![img-186.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-186.jpeg.jpg)

- Spinal nerves are segmental structures. They, therefore, emerge from between the two adjacent vertebrae and lie between two adjacent ribs.
- The blood vessels supplying structures derived from the myotome (e.g. intercostal vessels) are intersegmental like the vertebrae. Therefore, the intercostal and lumbar arteries lie opposite the vertebral bodies.
- The mesenchymal basis of the vertebra is converted into cartilage by the appearance of several centers of chondrification. Three primary centers of ossification appear in the cartilaginous model for each vertebra; one for each neural arch and one for the greater part of the body (centrum).
- At birth, the centrum and the two halves of the neural arch are joined by cartilage (Fig. 10.6A). These are
![img-188.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-188.jpeg.jpg)

termed neurocentral joints. Note that the posterolateral parts of the vertebral body are formed from the neural arch (Fig. 10.6B). After the centrum and neural arch have fused, the junction between the two is indicated by the neurocentral line.

- In the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions, the contributions to the various parts of the vertebrae by the centrum, neural arches and costal elements are shown in Figure 10.7 and Table 10.2.
![img-189.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-189.jpeg.jpg)

### Clinical correlation

### Congenital anomalies of vertebral column

- One or more vertebrae may be absent, the caudal vertebrae being more commonly affected. Absence of the coccyx alone, or of the sacrum and coccyx, may be seen.
- Additional vertebrae may be present. The sacrum may show six segments.
- Part of a vertebra may be missing. Various anomalies result, depending on the part that is absent (Fig. 17.34).
- The two halves of the neural arch may fail to fuse in the midline. This condition is called spina bifida (Fig. 10.8). The gap between the neural arches may not be obvious (spina bifida occulta), or may be large enough for meninges and neural elements to bulge out of it (see meningocele and meningomyelocele). Spina bifida in a fetus can be recognized by ultrasound examination. Examination of amniotic fluid shows increased levels of alpha-fetoproteins (AFPs) in a case with spina bifida.
- The vertebral body may ossify from two primary centers which soon fuse. One of these parts may fail to develop, resulting in only half of the body being present. This is called hemivertebra. It is usually associated with absence of the corresponding rib.
- The two halves of the vertebral body may be formed normally but may fail to fuse. The vertebral body then consists of two hemivertebrae. Sometimes the gap between the two halves is large enough for meninges and nerves to bulge forward between them (anterior spina bifida).
- Two or more vertebrae that are normally separate may be fused to each other. Such fusion may occur in the cervical region (Klippel-Feil syndrome). The atlas vertebra may be fused to the occipital bone (occipitalization of atlas) (Fig. 10.9). The fifth lumbar vertebra may be partially or completely fused to the sacrum (sacralization of 5th lumbar vertebra).
- Parts of the vertebral column that are normally fused to each other may be separate. The first sacral vertebra may be separate from the rest of the sacrum (lumbarization of the 1st sacral vertebra). The odontoid process may be separate from the rest of the axis vertebra.
- The articular facets may be abnormal in orientation, or may be deficient. When there is deficiency of both the inferior articular processes of the fifth lumbar vertebra, the body of the vertebra may slip forward over the sacrum. This is called spondylolisthesis.
- The vertebral canal may be divided into two lateral halves by a projecting shelf of bone, which splits the spinal cord longitudinally into two halves (diastematomyelia).
- Ossification of the vertebral bodies may be defective thus reducing the total length of the spine. This can lead to the formation of dwarfs who have a short trunk but have limbs of normal length (chondro-osteodystrophy).
- A peculiar tumor arising from cells of the primitive knot may be seen attached to the lower end of the spine. Various tissues may be seen in it. Such a growth is called a sacrococcygeal teratoma.
- Anomalies of the vertebrae are of practical importance in that:
- They may cause deformities of the spine. The spine may be bent on itself (congenital scoliosis). Deformities of cervical vertebrae may lead to tilting of the head to one side and its rotation to the opposite side (congenital torticollis). This deformity may be secondary to a contracture of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
- The spinal nerves, or even the spinal cord, may be implicated. They may be subjected to abnormal pressure leading to paralysis.
- They are frequently the cause of backache.


### Ribs

- The ribs are derived from ventral extensions of the sclerotomic mesenchyme that forms the vertebral arches. These extensions are present not only in the thoracic region but also in the cervical, lumbar and sacral regions.
- They lie ventral to the mesenchymal basis of the transverse processes with which they are continuous. In the thoracic region, the entire extension (called the
![img-190.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-190.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 10.8: Spina bifida produced by nonfusion of the two halves of the neural arch

primitive costal arch) undergoes chondrification, and subsequent ossification, to form the ribs.

- However, some mesenchyme between it and the developing transverse process does not undergo chondrification: it becomes loose and forms the costotransverse joint.
- In the cervical, lumbar and sacral regions, chondrification and ossification of the costal arch are confined to the region in immediate relationship to the transverse process. The bone formed from the arch is fused to the transverse process and is referred to as the costal element of the process. The contributions made by the costal element to the cervical, lumbar and sacral vertebrae are shown in Figures 10.7A to D and Table 10.2.


### Sternum

The sternum is formed by fusion of two sternal bars, or plates, that develop on either side of the midline. Mesenchymal condensations forming at these sites become cartilaginous in the 7th week of intrauterine life. Laterally, the sternal bars are continuous with ribs. The fusion of the two sternal bars first occurs at their cranial end (manubrium) and proceeds caudally (Figs 10.10B and C).

The manubrium and the body of the sternum are ossified, separately. The xiphoid process ossifies only late in life.

### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the sternum and ribs

- Some ribs that are normally present may be missing. Unilateral absence of a rib is often associated with hemivertebra.
- Accessory ribs may be present. Such a rib may be attached to the seventh cervical vertebra (cervical rib), or to the first lumbar vertebra (lumbar rib).
- When the fusion of the two sternal bars is faulty, the body of the sternum shows a partial or even a complete midline cleft. Minor degrees of nonfusion may result in a bifid xiphoid process or in midline foramina. Transverse clefts may also occur.
- In the condition called funnel chest, the lower part of the sternum and the attached ribs are drawn inward into the thorax. The primary defect is that the central tendon of the diaphragm is abnormally short.
- The upper part of the sternum (and related costal cartilages) may project forward (pigeon breast).


### Skull

- The bones of skull (cranium) develop around the developing brain.
- Cranial to the first cervical somite there are four occipital somites. The mesenchyme arising from the sclerotomes of these somites helps to form part of the base of the skull in the region of the occipital bone.
![img-191.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-191.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 10.10A to C: Development of the sternum. (A) Sternal bars formed on each side of the middle line. (B) The sternal bars begin to fuse with each other at the cranial end. (C) Fusion progresses caudally

- The developing internal ear (otic vesicle), and the region of the developing nose, are surrounded by mesenchymal condensations called the otic, and nasal, capsules respectively. These capsules also take part in forming the mesenchymal basis of the skull.
- The first branchial arch is closely related to the developing skull. It soon shows two subdivisions, called the (1) mandibular and (2) maxillary processes. Some bones of the skull are formed in the mesoderm of these processes.
- The skull is divided into two parts: (1) the neurocranium and (2) viscerocranium. The neurocranium forms the bones that encloses the brain and protects it. The viscerocranium forms facial skeleton.
- The neurocranium is divided into chondrocranium that forms the bones of base of skull and membranous neurocranium that forms the bones of vault of skull.

- The neural crest cells enter the head mesoderm and both together contribute for facial skeleton (viscero/ splanchnocranium) and membranous neurocranium.
- The chondrocranium or base of skull up to pituitary gland is formed by occipital sclerotomes and the part rostral to it is formed by neural crest cells.


### Chondrocranium (Base of Skull)

- Base of the developing cranium is formed by fusion of several cartilages. Three cartilaginous centers appear in cranial base during 2nd month. They are:

1. Parachordal cartilages: Appear around cephalic part of notochord in the otico-occipital region.
2. Polar cartilages: Appear around hypophysis cerebri in the region of sphenoid.
3. Orbitosphenoids, alisphenoids and trabeculae cranii: Appear between otic and nasal capsules that form the internal ear and nasal cavity respectively.

- The fusion of the cartilages forms the various part of base of skull (chondrocranium) as shown in Figure 10.11.
- Some bones of the skull are formed in membrane, some in cartilage, and some partly in membrane and partly in cartilage, as listed below.


### Membranous Neurocranium (Vault of Skull)

- Intramembranous ossification occurs in the mesenchyme at the sides and top of the brain forming calvaria (cranial vault).
- This mesenchyme also receives contribution from neural crest cells.


### Viscerocranium (Facial Skeleton)

- The viscerocranium is divided into a cartilaginous part and a membranous part.
- The cartilaginous viscerocranium is derived from the cartilaginous skeleton of the first two pairs of pharyngeal arches. The membranous viscerocranium forms the following by intramembranous ossification of the maxillary prominence of the first pharyngeal arch. It also receives contribution from neural crest cells.


### Bones that are Completely Formed in Membrane

- The frontal and parietal bones are formed in relation to mesenchyme covering the developing brain.
- The maxilla (excluding the premaxilla), zygomatic and palatine bones, and part of the temporal bones, are formed by intramembranous ossification of the mesenchyme of the maxillary process. The nasal, lacrimal and vomer bones are ossified in the membrane covering the nasal capsule.


### Bones that are Completely Formed in Cartilage

- The ethmoid bone and the inferior nasal concha are derived from the cartilage of the nasal capsule.
- The septal and alar cartilages of the nose represent parts of the capsule that do not undergo ossification.
![img-193.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-193.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 10.11: Developmental components of chondrocranium and their derivatives

### Bones that are Partly Formed in Cartilage and Partly in Membrane

- Occipital: The interparietal part (lying above the superior nuchal lines) is formed in membrane; the rest of the bone is formed by endochondral ossification.
- Sphenoid: The lateral part of the greater wing and the pterygoid laminae are formed in membrane; the rest is cartilage bone.
- Temporal: The squamous and tympanic parts are formed in membrane. The petrous and mastoid parts are formed by ossification of the cartilage of the otic capsule. The styloid process is derived from the cartilage of the second branchial arch.
- Mandible: Most of the bone is formed in membrane in the mesenchyme of the mandibular process. The ventral part of Meckel's cartilage gets embedded in the bone. The condylar and coronoid processes are ossified from secondary cartilages that appear in these situations. The development of the hyoid bone has been described in Chapter 9.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the skull

- The greater part of the vault of the skull is missing in cases of anencephaly (Fig. 17.33).
- The skull may show various types of deformity. In one syndrome, deformities of the skull are associated with absence of the clavicle (cleidocranial dysostosis). Premature union of the sagittal suture gives rise to a boat-shaped skull (scaphocephaly). Early union of the coronal suture results in a pointed skull (acrocephaly). Asymmetrical union of sutures results in a twisted skull (plagiocephaly). When the brain fails to grow the skull remains small (microcephaly).
- The bones of the vault of the skull may be widely separated by expansion of the cranial cavity in congenital hydrocephalus (Fig. 17.35).
- In a rare congenital condition called Hand-Schüller-Christian disease, large defects are seen in the skull bones. The primary defect is in the reticuloendothelial system; the changes in the bones are secondary.
- The occipital bone may be fused to the atlas vertebra (occipitalization of atlas) (Fig. 10.9).
- Several genetic disorders of craniofacial development have been described. One syndrome caused by under development of the first branchial arch is mandibulofacial dysostosis.


## FORMATION OF LIMBS

- The bones of the limbs, including the bones of the shoulder and pelvic girdles, are formed from mesenchyme of the limb buds. With the exception of the clavicle (which is a membrane bone), they are all formed by endochondral ossification.
- The limb buds are paddle-shaped outgrowths that arise from the side wall of the embryo at the beginning of the 2nd month of intrauterine life (Fig. 10.12). Each bud is a mass of mesenchyme covered by ectoderm.
- The mesenchyme of limb buds is derived from (the parietal layer of) the lateral plate mesoderm. This mesenchyme gives rise to bones, connective tissue and some blood vessels. The muscles of the limbs are derived from myotomes of somites which migrate into the limbs.
- The forelimb buds appear a little earlier than the hindlimb buds. As each forelimb bud grows, it becomes subdivided by constrictions into arm, forearm and hand. The hand itself soon shows outlines of the digits. The interdigital areas show cell death because of which the digits separate from each other (Fig. 10.13). Similar changes occur in the hindlimb.
- While the limb buds are growing, the mesenchymal cells in the buds form cartilaginous models, which subsequently ossify to form the bones of the limb.
- The limb buds are at first directed forward and laterally from the body of the embryo (Fig. 10.14). Each bud has a preaxial (or cranial) border and a postaxial border (Fig. 10.15). The thumb and great toe are formed on the preaxial border.
- The radius is the preaxial bone of the forearm. In a later development, the forelimb is adducted to the side of the
![img-194.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-194.jpeg.jpg)

body (Fig. 10.15). The original ventral surface forms the anterior surface of the arm, forearm and hand.

- In the case of the lower limb, the tibia is the preaxial bone of the leg. Adduction of this limb is accompanied by medial rotation with the result that the great toe and tibia come to lie on the medial side. The original ventral surface of the limb is represented by the inguinal region, the medial side of the lower part of the thigh, the popliteal surface of the knee, the back of the leg and the sole of the foot.
- The forelimb bud is derived from the part of the body wall belonging to segments C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, T1 and T2. It is, therefore, innervated by the corresponding spinal nerves. The hindlimb bud is formed opposite the segments L2, L3, L4, L5, S1 and S2.


### Molecular regulation of limb bud development

Three centers in the limb bud determine the three limb axes. They are:

1. Apical ectodermal ridge (AER): It determines proximal and distal segments. It is essential for limb bud development. At the tip of each limb bud, the ectoderm is thickened to form the AER. This ridge has an inducing effect on underlying mesenchyme causing it to remain undifferentiated and to proliferate. Areas away from the apical ridge undergo differentiation into cartilage, muscle, etc. Sometimes two AERs are formed on a limb bud. This results in formation of a supernumerary limb. Removal of it leads to failure of growth and differentiation of limb called phocomelia.
2. Zone of polarizing activity (ZPA): It determines cranial to caudal axis (preaxial and postaxial margins).
3. Dorsal and ventral ectoderm: It determines dorsal and ventral axes.

## JOINTS

The tissues of joints are derived from mesenchyme intervening between developing bone ends. This mesenchyme may differentiate into fibrous tissue, forming a fibrous joint (syndesmosis), or into cartilage forming a cartilaginous joint. In the case of some cartilaginous joints (synchondrosis or primary cartilaginous joints), the cartilage connecting the bones is later ossified, with the result that the two bones become continuous. This is seen, typically, at the joints between the diaphyses and epiphyses of long bones.

At the site where a synovial joint is to be formed, the mesenchyme is usually seen in three layers. The two outer layers are continuous with the perichondrium covering the cartilaginous ends of the articulating bones. The middle layer becomes loose and a cavity is formed in it. The cavity comes to be lined by a mesothelium that forms the synovial membrane (Fig. 10.16). The capsule and other ligaments are derived from the surrounding mesenchyme.

### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of limbs

- One or more limbs of the body may be partially, or completely, absent (phocomelia, amelia). These conditions may be produced by ingestion of harmful drugs.
- Part of a limb may be deformed. Deformities are most frequently seen in the region of the ankle and foot, and are of various types. In the most common variety of deformity, the foot shows marked plantar flexion (equinus: like the horse), and inversion (varus). Hence, this condition is called talipes equinovarus, or clubfoot (Fig. 10.17).
- Congenital strictures, congenital amputations or congenital contractures may be present.
- There may be abnormal fusion (bony or fibrous) between different bones of the limb. Adjoining digits may be fused (syndactyly). The phalanges of a digit may be fused to one another (synphalangia).
- A digit may be abnormally large (macrodactyly), or abnormally short (brachydactyly). In arachnodactyly, the fingers are long and thin (spider fingers).
- Supernumerary digits may be present (polydactyly) (Fig. 10.18). A digit (most commonly the thumb) may have an extra phalanx.
- The palm or sole may show a deep longitudinal cleft (lobster claw).
- The limbs may remain short in achondroplasia (Fig. 7.21).
- Sometimes the bone ends forming a joint are imperfectly formed (congenital dysplasia). This can lead to congenital dislocation. The hip joint is most commonly affected.


## PART 2: MUSCULAR SYSTEM

## INTRODUCTION

Majority of the skeletal muscles develop from somites. The cardiac and smooth muscles develop from splanchnic mesoderm. The myogenesis of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle are described in Chapter 7. In this chapter, the development of skeletal musculature of body will be considered.

## SKELETAL MUSCLE

- Each myotome establishes contact with one segmental nerve. Hence, theoretically, the embryological derivation of a muscle should be indicated by its nerve supply. On this basis, it would be presumed that all the musculature of the body walls and limbs is derived from the myotomes and has subsequently migrated to these regions.
- Such migration of myotomes can be seen in embryos of some lower animals, but not in the human embryo. In man, the myotomes appear to give origin only to the musculature of the trunk, in whole or in part. The
occipital myotomes are believed to give rise to the musculature of the tongue, while the extrinsic muscles of the eyeball are regarded as derivatives of the preoccipital myotomes.
- Soon after its formation, each myotome, in the neck and trunk, separates into a small dorsal part (epimere) which gives rise to the muscles supplied by the dorsal primary ramus of the spinal nerve, and a larger ventral part (hypomere), which gives origin to the muscles supplied by the ventral ramus (Figs 10.1A to C) of spinal nerve. The epimeres give origin to the muscles of the back (epaxial/extensors of the vertebral column), while the hypomeres give origin to the hypoxia1/flexor muscles of the body wall and limbs. The intermuscular septum separating these two groups is represented by thoracolumbar fascia.
- Some cells from the ventrolateral region of the dermomyotomes migrate into the parietal layer of lateral

## DEVELOPMENT OF MUSCULAR SYSTEM

The skeletal musculature of the body is derived from mesoderm as described below with exceptions:

- Somatic mesoderm—limb, trunk
- Branchial mesoderm—head and neck
- Splanchnic mesoderm—cardiac, smooth.
- Exceptions-ectodermal
- Musculature of iris
- Arrectores pilorum of skin
- Myoepithelial cells of ducts of sweat glands.

Developmentally the skeletal musculature of the body can be divided into branchial arch derived and somite derived muscles.

### Branchial Arch Derived Musculature

Muscles of head and neck and face are derived from pharyngeal arches. They are discussed in Chapter 9.

### Somite Derived Skeletal Musculature

The somite derived musculature distribution is divided as follows (Table 10.3, Figs 10.19 to 10.21):

### Extraocular Muscles of Eyeball

- These are derived from the three preoptic myotomes that are arranged around the developing eyeball (Fig. 10.19).
- They receive innervation from the 3rd (supplies inferior oblique, levator palpebrae superioris and medial, superior and inferior recti), 4th (supplies superior oblique) and 6th (supplies lateral rectus) cranial nerves.


### Muscles of Tongue

- All muscles of tongue both intrinsic and extrinsic except palatoglossus are derived from the four occipital myotomes (Fig. 10.19) and are supplied by 12th cranial nerve (which is formed by fusion of pre cervical nerves) and the palatoglossus is supplied by vagus nerve.
- The occipital myotomes migrate into the developing tongue (contributed by 1st to 3rd pharyngeal arches) in the floor of mouth.

Figs 10.21A to C: Distribution of limb and trunk musculature

### Body Wall (Trunk)

- They are derived from segmental myotomes of somite origin. They are divided into epaxial and hypaxial groups (Fig. 10.20A).
- Epaxial or dorsal groups are supplied by posterior spinal rami. They form the erector spinae group of muscles that act as extensors of vertebral column.
- Hypaxial or ventral groups are supplied by ventral ramus. They extend in ventrolateral direction along the

somatopleuric layer of mesoderm of coelomic cavities and form the flexors of vertebral column that divides into the three layers of muscles of thorax (external, internal and innermost intercostals) and that of anterior abdominal wall (external oblique, internal oblique and transversus abdominis) (Fig. 10.20B).

- The hypaxial musculature in the prevertebral region of neck forms longus and scalene muscles in the midline and rectus (sternalis and abdominis) and infrahyoid muscle on either side of midline.


### Limb Muscles

- Myotome derived mesodermal cell migration into the developing limb buds occurs during 5th week.
- For upper limb they are derived from C4 to T2 segments and for lower limb they are derived from L1 to S3 segments (Figs 10.21A to C).
- The muscles are at first organized along the preaxial and postaxial borders of in situ developing somatopleuric mesodermal derived bones. The muscles and the borders of the limbs differentiate into preaxial and postaxial groups. The preaxial muscles are supplied by upper segments of nerves and the postaxial muscles are supplied by lower segmental nerves.
- Regrouping of muscles and spinal nerves results in formation of anterior and posterior groups of muscles of limbs and nerve plexuses in relation to the limbs respectively. The anterior groups are flexors and adductors of the limb and are supplied by anterior divisions of nerve plexuses (e.g. medial and ulnar nerves supply flexors). The posterior groups are extensors and abductors of the limbs and are supplied by posterior divisions of nerve plexuses (e.g. radial nerve supplies the extensors).

### Diaphragm

- The musculature develops from C3 to C5 myotomes. It is supplied by phrenic nerves that invade septum transversum.
- The transversus layer of thorax is peeled off due to the down growth of lung buds and comes into contact with the septum transversum to form thoracoabdominal diaphragm.


### Other Muscles

- The 2nd sacral to 1st coccygeal myotomes contribute for the formation of pelvic diaphragm, external anal sphincter and striated muscles of genital organs.


## TIME TABLE OF SOME EVENTS

Time table of some events has been shown in Table 10.4.
TABLE 10.4: Time table of some developmental events

| Age | Developmental events |
| :--: | :--: |
| 4th week (26th day) | Forelimb bud appears |
| 4th week (28th day) | Hindlimb bud appears |
| 5th week | Limbs become paddle-shaped |

Fig. 10.23: Anencephalic fetus

## CLINICAL CASE WITH PRENATAL ULTRASOUND AND ABORTED FETAL IMAGES: EMBRYOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL EXPLANATION

A primi of 30 years age came for obstetric checkup at 22nd week and was informed about twin pregnancy on obstetrical examination. She was advised transabdominal fetal ultrasound. The ultrasound picture (Fig. 10.22) presented one fetus with normal head and the other presented absence of skull cap. It was diagnosed as a twin pregnancy with one normal and one anencephalic fetus. The woman was advised to continue the pregnancy and was advised to come for regular checkup. At 36 weeks, polyhydramnios was identified and by emergency cesarean section twin babies were delivered. One was normal and was admitted in neonatal care unit. Another was anencephalic and did not survive (Fig. 10.23). Give the embryological explanation and explanation for continuation of pregnancy and extra care taken in this case.

- In the ultrasound, normal skull image was observed for one fetus and its absence for the other, i.e. anencephalic fetus.
- The ultrasound image of anencephalic fetus presented bulging eyes.
- Failure of closure of cephalic part of neural tube and nonformation of vault of skull resulted in this condition. As the brainstem is intact, the fetus was live born and subsequently died.
- The neural tissue is disorganized due to exposure to amniotic fluid that caused necrosis of nervous tissue.
- Because of one normal fetus, the pregnancy was continued by taking antenatal care to save the normal fetus and a planned preterm cesarean was done.
- A $100 \%$ diagnosis of anencephaly can be made by prenatal ultrasound. If it is a singleton, anencephalic pregnancy termination of pregnancy will be advised as the anencephalic fetus has no chance of survival.
- Since it is a multiple gestation with dichorionic and diamniotic pregnancy with one normal fetus the pregnancy was continued.
