# Chapter 16 Urogenital System

## HIGHLIGHTS

- The urogenital system is derived from the intermediate mesoderm, and the primitive urogenital sinus (UGS) which is a part of the cloaca.
- The primitive UGS divides into the vesicourethral canal and the definitive UGS.
- The vesicourethral canal divides into the urinary bladder and the primitive urethra.
- The definitive UGS has a pelvic part and a phallic part.
- The kidneys develop from two sources. The excretory tubules (nephrons) are derived from the metanephros (= lowest part of nephrogenic cord which is derived from intermediate mesoderm). The collecting part is formed by ramification of the ureteric bud (which arises from the mesonephric duct).
- The ureter arises from the ureteric bud.
- The urinary bladder is derived from the cranial part of the vesicourethral canal (endoderm). The epithelium of the trigone is derived from absorbed mesonephric ducts.
- The female urethra is derived from the primitive urethra and the pelvic part of the UGS.
- In the male, the prostatic urethra corresponds to the female urethra. The membranous urethra is derived from the pelvic part of UGS and the penile urethra from the phallic part of the UGS. The terminal part is ectodermal.
- The prostate is formed by buds arising from the caudal part of the vesicourethral canal and the pelvic part of the UGS.
- The uterine tubes are derived from paramesonephric ducts (mesoderm).
- The uterus is formed from the uterovaginal canal (fused right and left paramesonephric ducts).
- External genitalia are formed from swellings that appear around the urogenital membrane.
- Gonads (testis and ovary) are derived from coelomic epithelium covering the nephrogenic cord. Ova and spermatozoa arise from primordial germ cells that arise in the region of the yolk sac. The testis is formed in the lumbar region, and later descends to the scrotum.
- The duct system of the testis is derived from mesonephric tubules and from the mesonephric duct.


## INTRODUCTION

Urinary and genital systems are closely associated in their development, topography and function. Two embryonic structures that play an important role in the development of the urogenital system are the intermediate mesoderm and the cloaca. These are briefly considered below.

### Intermediate Mesoderm

Intraembryonic mesoderm is subdivided into three parts (Fig. 16.1):

1. Paraxial mesoderm which becomes segmented to form the somites.
2. Lateral plate mesoderm in which the intraembryonic coelom appears.
3. Intermediate mesoderm lying between the two.

Before head fold the intermediate mesoderm is between paraxial mesoderm and coelomic cavity in lateral plate mesoderm. After the folding of the embryonic disc and the formation of the peritoneal cavity, the intermediate mesoderm forms a bulging on the posterior abdominal wall lateral to the attachment of the dorsal mesentery of

the gut. It is known as urogenital ridge. Its surface is covered by the epithelium lining the peritoneal cavity (coelomic epithelium) (Fig. 16.2A). The urogenital ridge is divided into two parts. The medial part is called genital ridge that gives rise to the genital system and a lateral part the nephrogenic cord that forms the urinary system.

The nephrogenic cord extends from the cervical region to the sacral region of the embryo. At varying stages of development, a number of important structures are formed in relation to the nephrogenic cord on each side. These are (Fig. 16.2B):

- Excretory renal tubules (para-, meso- and metanephric) associated with the development of the kidney.
- The nephric duct which is formed in relation to the developing excretory tubules. At later stages, this becomes the mesonephric duct.
- The paramesonephric duct, which is formed lateral to the nephric duct.
- The gonad (testis or ovary), which develops from the coelomic epithelium lining the medial side of the nephrogenic cord.


### Cloaca

The part of hindgut caudal to allantois is called cloaca. It is divided by the urorectal septum (in the angle between
![img-400.jpeg](img-400.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 16.1: Location of intermediate mesoderm
allantois and cloaca) into dorsal primitive rectum and ventral primitive urogenital sinus (Figs 13.3 and 13.4).

In further development, the primitive urogenital sinus is subdivided into a cranial part, called the vesicourethral canal, and a caudal part, called the definitive urogenital sinus. The openings of the mesonephric ducts (see below) lie at the junction of these two subdivisions (Figs 16.3 and 16.4A).

Still later, the definitive urogenital sinus shows a division into a cranial, pelvic part, and a caudal phallic part (Fig. 16.4B).

The urogenital system is derived from the various structures that develop in the intermediate mesoderm, and from the various subdivisions of the cloaca, as described below.

## DEVELOPMENT OF KIDNEYS

- The definitive human kidney arises from two distinct sources.

1. The secretory part, i.e. excretory tubules (or nephrons) are derived from the lowest part of the nephrogenic cord. This part is the metanephros, the cells of which form the metanephric blastema.
2. The collecting part of the kidney is derived from a diverticulum called the ureteric bud which arises from the lower part of the mesonephric duct (Figs 16.5 A and B).

- Some of the features of the development of the kidney in the human embryo can be appreciated only if the evolutionary history of the organ is kept in mind. The vertebrate kidney has passed through three stages of evolution (Fig. 16.6).

1. The most primitive kidney is called the pronephros. It is the functioning kidney in some cyclostomes and teleost fishes. The pronephros is formed in relation to the cervical region of the nephrogenic cord. This is followed by appearance of the mesonephros in the thoracolumbar region, and finally by formation of
![img-401.jpeg](img-401.jpeg.jpg)

![img-402.jpeg](img-402.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 16.3: Subdivisions of the cloaca. Also see Figure 16.4
the metanephros in the sacral region (Figs 16.5 and 16.6). The human pronephros is nonfunctional, and disappears soon after its formation. A nephric duct formed in relation to the pronephros and ending in the cloaca, however, persists.
2. The pronephros has been succeeded in higher vertebrates by the mesonephros that is the functioning
kidney of most anamniotes (Amphbia and some fishes). The mesonephros consists of a series of excretory tubules that develop in the thoracolumbar region. These tubules drain into the nephric duct which may now be called the mesonephric duct. Most of the mesonephric tubules disappear, but some of them are modified and take part in forming the duct system of the testis (Fig. 16.6).
3. The kidney of amniotes (including man) is called the metanephros. It begins in the sacral region. It is seen as an unsegmented mass called metanephric blastema.

- During the development of the human embryo, the evolutionary history of the kidney repeats itself being a classic example of the saying that ontogeny repeats phylogeny.
- As the ureteric bud grows cranially toward the metanephric blastema, its growing end becomes dilated to form an ampulla. The ampulla divides repeatedly. The first three to five generations of branches fuse to form the

Fig. 16.6: Some details of developing pronephros, mesonephros and metanephros. The pronephros and pronephric duct degenerate soon after formation. The proximal part of the mesonephros shows segmentation (in craniocaudal sequence). The segments contain functional excretory tubules that drain into the mesonephric duct. Most of these tubules disappear by the time the metanephros forms the definitive kidney

Figs 16.7A to F: Formation of the collecting system of the kidney, from ramifications of the ureteric bud
pelvis of the kidney. The next divisions become the major calyces while further divisions form the minor calyces and collecting tubules (Figs 16.7A to F). The number of collecting tubules formed is one to three million.

- The cells of the metanephric blastema in contact with an ampulla undergo differentiation to form a nephron. This differentiation is induced by the ampulla. Loosely arranged cells of the metanepric blastema form solid
clumps in relation to the ampulla. Each solid clump is converted into a vesicle. The vesicle soon becomes pear-shaped and opens into the ampulla. The vesicle now becomes an S-shaped tube. Its distal end comes to be invaginated by a tuft of capillaries which form a glomerulus. The various parts of the nephron are derived from this S-shaped tube. The various stages in the formation of a nephron are shown in Figure 16.8.

![img-407.jpeg](img-407.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 16.8: Scheme to show stages in the development of the nephron

### Ascent of the Kidney 

- The definitive human kidney is derived from the metanephros and lies in the sacral region in the initial stages of development. In subsequent development of the embryo, differential growth of the abdominal wall causes the kidney to ascend to the lumbar region (Fig. 16.9).
- The metanephros, at first, receives its blood supply from the lateral sacral arteries, but with its ascent, higher branches of the aorta take over the supply. The definitive renal artery represents the lateral splanchnic branch of the aorta at the level of the second lumbar segment.
- During ascent, the kidneys pass through the fork like interval between the right and left umbilical arteries. If the arteries come in the way of ascent, the kidney may remain in the sacral region.
![img-408.jpeg](img-408.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 16.9: Ascent of the kidney

### Rotation of the Kidney

The hilum of the kidney, at first, faces anteriorly. The organ gradually rotates so that the hilum comes to face medially.

### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of kidneys

- One or both kidneys may be absent (agenesis). The kidney may be underdeveloped (hypoplasia) or overdeveloped (hyperplasia). Adrenal tissue may be present within the substance of the kidney.
- Distention of the pelvis with urine (hydronephrosis) may occur as a result of obstruction in the urinary passages.
- Duplication: There may be an extra kidney on one side. It may be separate, or may be fused to the normal kidney (Figs 16.10A to C).
- Anomalies of shape:
- Horseshoe kidney: The lower poles of the two kidneys (or sometimes the upper poles) may be fused. The connecting isthmus may lie either in front of, or behind, the aorta and inferior vena cava (Figs 16.11G and H). A horseshoe kidney does not ascend higher than the level of the inferior mesenteric artery as the latter prevents its higher ascent.
- Pancake kidney: The two kidneys may form one mass, lying in the midline or on one side (Fig. 16.11I). The two kidneys may lie on one side, one above the other, the adjacent poles being fused.
- Lobulated kidney: The fetal kidney is normally lobulated. This lobulation may persist (Fig. 16.11C).
- Anomalies of position:
- The kidneys may fail to ascend. They then lie in the sacral region.
- The ascent of the kidneys may be incomplete as a result of which they may lie opposite the lower lumbar vertebrae.
- The kidneys may ascend too far, and may even be present within the thoracic cavity.
- Both kidneys may lie on one side of the midline. They may lie one above the other or side by side (Figs 16.11D and E). The ureter of the displaced kidney crosses to the opposite side across the midline.
- Both kidneys may be displaced to the opposite side. The two ureters then cross each other in the midline (Fig. 16.11F).
- Abnormal rotation:
- Nonrotation: The hilum is directed forward.
- Incomplete rotation: The hilum is directed anteromedially.
- Reverse rotation: The hilum is directed anterolaterally.
- Congenital polycystic kidney: Failure of the excretory tubules of the metanephros to establish contact with the collecting tubules, leads to the formation of cysts. Isolated cysts are commonly seen, but sometimes the whole kidney is a mass of such cysts (Fig. 16.11A). The cysts press upon normal renal tissue and destroy it. An alternative recent view about the formation of cysts in the kidney is that they are derived from abnormally developed collecting tubules.
- Aberrant renal arteries: The kidney may receive its blood supply partially or entirely, from arteries arising at an abnormal level (Fig. 16.11B). In the case of nonascent, or of incomplete ascent, the aberrant arteries may constitute the only supply to the organ. An aberrant artery may be the only source of arterial blood to a segment of the kidney. It may press upon the ureter and cause obstruction, leading to hydronephrosis.
- Multiple anomalies: Two or more of the above anomalies may coexist. Anomalies of position are frequently associated with those of rotation.


## ABSORPTION OF LOWER PARTS OF MESONEPHRIC DUCTS INTO CLOACA

The lower ends of the mesonephric ducts open into that part of the cloaca that forms the urogenital sinus. The ureteric buds arise from the mesonephric ducts, a little cranial to the

Figs 16.12A to D: (A) Mesonephric duct opens into primitive urogenital sinus; (B) As the sinus grows the proximal parts of mesonephric ducts are absorbed so that the mesonephric ducts and ureters now open separately; (C) The openings are at first close together; (D) Further absorption of ureters causes their opening to shift upward and laterally. The shaded area is derived from absorbed parts of ureters and mesonephric ducts, and is mesodermal. It forms the trigone of the bladder and the posterior wall of part of the urethra
cloaca (Fig. 16.12A). The parts of the mesonephric ducts, caudal to the origin of the ureteric buds, are absorbed into the vesicourethral canal; with the result the mesonephric ducts and the ureteric buds now have separate openings into the cloaca (Fig. 16.12B). These openings are at first close together (Fig. 16.12C). However, the openings of the ureteric buds move cranially and laterally due to continued absorption of the buds. The triangular area (on the dorsal wall of the vesicourethral canal) between the openings of the ureteric buds and those of the mesonephric ducts is derived from the absorbed ducts and is, therefore, of mesodermal origin (Fig. 16.12D).

## DEVELOPMENT OF THE URETER

The ureter is derived from the part of the ureteric bud that lies between the pelvis of the kidney, and the vesicourethral canal.

### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the ureter

- The ureter may be partially or completely duplicated (Figs 16.10A to C). This condition may, or may not, be associated with duplication of the kidney. Very rarely, there may be more than two ureters on one, or both, sides. Of the two ureters, one may open into the urinary bladder while the other may open at an abnormal site (see below).
- Instead of opening into the urinary bladder, the ureter may end in the prostatic urethra, ductus deferens, seminal vesicles, or rectum, in the male (Fig. 16.13B); and in the urethra, vagina, vestibule or rectum in the female (Fig. 16.13A).
- The upper end of the ureter may be blind, i.e. it is not connected to the kidney.
- The ureter may be dilated (hydroureter) because of obstruction to urine flow.
- The ureter may have valves or diverticula.
- The right ureter may pass behind the inferior vena cava. It then hooks around the left side of the vena cava; this may result in kinking and obstruction of the ureter. The real defect is in the development of the vena cava as described in Chapter 15.


## DEVELOPMENT OF THE URINARY BLADDER

- The part of primitive urogenital sinus above the openings of the mesonephric ducts is called vesicourethral canal. It presents a wider upper part and a narrower lower part. The allantois opens into the apex of the upper wider part of vesicourethral canal. The allantois extends from
![img-412.jpeg](img-412.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 16.13A and B: Abnormal sites at which the ureter may open

the apex of the urinary bladder. The urinary bladder develops from this dilated part of vesicourethral canal including the proximal part of allantois. The lower narrow part of vesicourethral canal becomes the primitive urethra.

- With the absorption of mesonephric ducts and ureteric buds into the posterior wall of vesicourethral canal, the trigone of bladder will be formed. The trigone is mesodermal in origin.
- The epithelium of the urinary bladder develops from the cranial part of the vesicourethral canal (endoderm). The epithelium of the trigone of the bladder is derived from the absorbed mesonephric ducts (mesoderm) (However, it is later overgrown by the surrounding endodermal cells).
- The muscular and serous walls of the organ are derived from splanchnopleuric mesoderm.
- The developing bladder is continuous cranially with the allantois. It is uncertain whether the allantois contributes to the formation of the bladder. The allantois atrophies, and is seen in postnatal life as a fibrous band, the urachus (median umbilical ligament), extending from the apex of the bladder to the umbilicus.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the urinary bladder

- The urinary bladder may be absent, or may be duplicated. The sphincter vesicae may be absent.
- The lumen of the urinary bladder may be divided into compartments by septa.
- The bladder may be divided into upper and lower compartments (hourglass bladder) because of a constriction in the middle of the organ (Figs 16.14A).
- The bladder may communicate with the rectum (Fig. 13.25A).
- Ectopia vesicae: The lower part of the anterior abdominal wall, as well as the ventral wall of the bladder, may be missing. As a result, the cavity of the bladder may be exposed on the surface of the body (Fig. 16.14B). This defect is usually associated with epispadias. Ectopia vesicae is caused by failure of mesoderm to migrate into the lower abdominal wall (between umbilicus and genital tubercle). Failure of migration may be due to excessive development of the cloacal membrane. The ectoderm of the anterior abdominal wall and the endoderm of the ventral wall of the urinary bladder remain unsupported and thin. Their rupture leads to the exposure of the cavity of the urinary bladder.
- Congenital diverticula may be present. These are found at the junction of the trigone with the rest of the bladder.


## DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEMALE URETHRA

The female urethra is derived from the caudal part of the vesicourethral canal (endoderm). We have seen that the
![img-413.jpeg](img-413.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 16.14A and B: Anomalies of the bladder. (A) Hourglass bladder; (B) Ectopia vesicae. The ureteric openings and the trigone are seen on the surface of the body
posterior wall of this canal is derived from the mesonephric ducts and is, therefore, mesodermal in origin. The female urethra may receive a slight contribution from the pelvic part of the urogenital sinus (Figs 16.15A to E).

## DEVELOPMENT OF THE MALE URETHRA

- The part of the male urethra extending from the urinary bladder up to the openings of the ejaculatory ducts (original openings of mesonephric ducts) is derived from the caudal part of the vesicourethral canal (endoderm). The posterior wall of this part is derived from absorbed mesonephric ducts (mesoderm). (It may later be overgrown by endoderm).
- The rest of the prostatic urethra, and the membranous urethra, are derived from the pelvic part of the definitive urogenital sinus.
- The penile part of the urethra (except the terminal part) is derived from the epithelium of the phallic part of the definitive urogenital sinus (see "Development of Penis").
- The terminal part of the penile urethra that lies in the glans is derived from ectoderm (Figs 16.15A to E).
From the above, it will be clear that the female urethra corresponds to the prostatic part of the male urethra.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the urethra

- There may be obstruction to the urethra at its junction with the bladder.
- The urethra may show diverticula.
- It may be duplicated in whole or in part.
- The urethra may have abnormal communications with the rectum (Figs 13.25B and C), the vagina (Fig. 16.16) or the ureter (Figs 16.13A and B).
- Hypospadias and epispadias.

The definitive urogenital sinus (UGS) divides into pelvic and phallic parts; (D) The female urethra is formed from the primitive urethra and from part of the pelvic portion of UGS. The rest of the pelvic part of UGS forms the vestibule; (E) In the male, the prostatic urethra is formed in the same way as the female urethra. The membranous urethra is derived from the pelvic part of UGS. The penile urethra is derived from the phallic part of UGS. Red circles = openings of mesonephric ducts and ureters. Blue = part derived from mesoderm. Green = ectoderm

## DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROSTATE

This gland develops from a large number of buds that arise from the epithelium of the prostatic urethra, i.e. from the caudal part of the vesicourethral canal, and from the pelvic part of the definitive urogenital sinus. These buds form the secretory epithelium of the gland. The buds that arise from the mesodermal part of the prostatic urethra (i.e. posterior wall, above the openings of the ejaculatory ducts) form the inner glandular zone of the prostate. Buds arising from the rest of the prostatic urethra (endoderm) form the outer glandular zone (Figs 16.17A).

The outer zone differentiates earlier than the inner zone. In later life, the outer zone is frequently the site of carcinomatous change, while the inner zone is affected in senile hypertrophy of the organ. The muscle and connective tissue of the gland are derived from the surrounding

Figs 16.18A to D: Formation of paramesonephric ducts by invagination of coelomic epithelium
mesenchyme which also forms the capsule of the gland. The secretory elements of the prostate are rudimentary at birth. They undergo considerable development at puberty. The organ undergoes progressive atrophy in old age, but in some men it undergoes benign hypertrophy. The prostate may, rarely, be absent.

### Female Homologues of Prostate

Endodermal buds, similar to those that form the prostate in the male, are also seen in the female. The buds that arise from the caudal part of the vesicourethral canal give rise to the urethral glands, whereas the buds arising from the urogenital sinus form the paraurethral glands of Skene.

## PARAMESONEPHRIC DUCTS

Paramesonephric ducts are present in the intermediate mesoderm. They are formed by invagination of coelomic epithelium (Figs 16.18A to D). They lie lateral to the mesonephric ducts in the cranial part of the nephrogenic cord (Fig. 16.19A). When traced caudally, they cross to the medial side of the mesonephric ducts. Here the ducts of the two sides meet and fuse in the middle line to form the uterovaginal canal (or uterine canal) (Fig. 16.19B). The
![img-418.jpeg](img-418.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 16.19A and B: Formation of uterovaginal canal by fusion of the caudal parts of paramesonephric ducts
caudal end of this canal comes in contact with the dorsal wall of the definitive urogenital sinus. In the female, this part of the sinus gives rise to the vestibule. In the female, the paramesonephric ducts give origin to the uterine tubes, the uterus, and part of the vagina (Fig. 16.20A).

## DEVELOPMENT OF UTERUS AND UTERINE TUBES

The epithelium of the uterus develops from the fused paramesonephric ducts (uterovaginal canal: 1, in Figure 16.20A). The myometrium is derived from surrounding mesoderm (3, in Figure 16.20A). As the thickness of the myometrium increases, the unfused horizontal parts of the two paramesonephric ducts come to be partially embedded within its substance, and help to form the fundus of the uterus (2, in Figure 16.20A). The cervix can soon be recognized as a separate region. In the fetus, the cervical part is larger than the body of the uterus.

The uterine tubes develop from the unfused parts of the paramesonephric ducts. The original points of invagination of the ducts into the coelomic epithelium remain as the abdominal openings of the tubes. Fimbriae are formed in this situation.

### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the uterus

- The uterus may be in the form of two horns (bicornuate, Fig.16.21A) or completely or partially separated (septate, Fig.16.21B). Complete duplication of uterus and cervix is referred to as uterus didelphys (Fig.16.21F).
- The uterus is in two horns, the cervix is separated and the vagina is single and is known as uterus bicornis and bicolis (Fig. 16.21C).
- The entire uterus may be absent.
- Uterus may be slightly indented in the middle and is known as arcuate uterus (Fig.16.21D).
- Uterus and vagina both may be separated in to two and is known as subseptate uterus (Fig.16.21E).
- The uterus may remain rudimentary.
- There may be atresia of the lumen either in the body or in the cervix.


### Anomalies of the uterine tubes

- The uterine tubes may be absent, on one or both sides.
- The tubes may be partially, or completely, duplicated on one or both sides.
- There may be atresia of the tubes.

Remnants are seen as the appendix of the testis and the prostatic utricle. 1: uterovaginal canal; 2: fundus of uterus; 3: myometrium

## DEVELOPMENT OF VAGINA

- The lower end of the uterovaginal canal comes in close contact with the dorsal wall of the phallic part of the urogenital sinus (Fig. 16.22A). However, the uterovaginal canal and the urogenital sinus are soon separated from each other by the formation of a solid plate of cells called the vaginal plate. The vagina is formed by the development of a lumen within the vaginal plate (Fig. 16.22D). The vaginal plate is formed as follows:
- Endodermal cells of the urogenital sinus proliferate to form two swellings called the sinovaginal bulbs (Fig. 16.22B). These bulbs soon fuse to form one mass.
- Most of the vaginal plate is formed from these sinovaginal bulbs (Fig. 16.22C).
- The part of the vaginal plate near the future cervix is derived from mesodermal cells of the uterovaginal canal.
- The hymen is situated at the junction of the lower end of the vaginal plate with the urogenital sinus. Both surfaces of the hymen are lined by endoderm.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of vagina

- The vagina may be duplicated. This condition is usually associated with duplication of the uterus (Fig. 16.21A).
- The lumen may be subdivided longitudinally, or transversely, by a septum.
- The vagina may be absent. This condition may or may not be associated with absence of the uterus.
- The hymen may be imperforated.
- The vagina may have abnormal communications with the rectum (rectovaginal fistula) or with the urinary bladder (vesicovaginal fistula) (Fig. 16.16).

### Paramesonephric Ducts in Male

The paramesonephric ducts remain rudimentary in the male. The greater part of each duct eventually disappears (Fig. 16.20B). The cranial end of each duct persists as a small rounded body attached to the testis (appendix of testis) that may occasionally give rise to cysts.

It has generally been considered that the prostatic utricle represents the uterovaginal canal and is, therefore, a homologue of the uterus. However, it is now believed to correspond mainly to the vagina (and possibly part of the uterus).

## DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL GENITALIA

### Introduction

With the formation of the urorectal septum, the cloacal membrane comes to be subdivided into a ventral, urogenital membrane, and a caudal anal membrane (Figs 16.23). The urogenital membrane becomes elongated in a craniocaudal direction. The mesoderm on either side of it is soon heaped up to form two longitudinal elevations called the primitive urethral folds (Figs 16.23 and 16.24). In addition to these folds, three other elevations of mesoderm are soon apparent. These are:

- The genital tubercle which is situated in the midline between the urogenital membrane and the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall; and
- The right and left genital swellings (Fig. 16.23).


### Development of Female External Genitalia (Figs 16.23 to 16.25)

- The genital tubercle becomes cylindrical and forms the clitoris.
- The genital swellings enlarge to form the labia majora. Their posterior ends fuse across the midline to form the posterior commissure.
- The urogenital membrane breaks down, so that continuity is established between the urogenital sinus (which forms the vestibule) and the exterior. The primitive urethral folds now form the labia minora. It will be obvious that they are lined on the outside by ectoderm and on the inside by endoderm (Figs 16.24 and 16.25).


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of female external genitalia

- The clitoris may be absent, may be bifid, or may be double. It may be enlarged in hermaphroditism.
- The labia minora may show partial fusion.
- The urethra may open on the anterior wall of the vagina; this is the female equivalent of male hypospadias.


### Development of Male External Genitalia (Figs 16.23, 16.24 and 16.26)

- The genital tubercle becomes cylindrical and is now called the phallus. It undergoes great enlargement to form the penis. As the phallus grows, the glans becomes distinguishable by the appearance of a coronary sulcus.

![img-422.jpeg](img-422.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 16.23: Subdivisions of primitive urogenital sinus and cloacal membrane

Still later, the prepuce is formed by reduplication of the ectoderm covering the distal part of the phallus (Figs 16.23, 16.24 and 16.26 ).

- We have seen that the urogenital membrane lies in a linear groove, flanked on either side by the primitive urethral folds (Figs 16.27A to C). As the phallus grows, this groove elongates and extends onto its under surface (Fig. 16.27B). This groove is lined by ectoderm and is called the primitive urethral groove.
- From Figures 16.27C and D, it will be clear that the phallus is closely related to the endodermal lining of the phallic part of the urogenital sinus. The endodermal cells of this lining proliferate, and grow into the phallus, in the form of a solid plate of cells called the urethral plate (Fig. 16.27C). The cells of the urethral plate are in contact with the ectodermal cells lining the primitive urethral groove.
- The urogenital membrane soon breaks down, so that the urogenital sinus (phallic part) opens to the outside, in the caudal part of the primitive urethral groove (Fig. 16.27D). At the same time, the cells forming the core of
the urethral plate degenerate, along with the ectodermal cells lining the primitive urethral groove. In this way, a deeper groove (called the definitive urethral groove) lined by endodermal cells, is now formed on the under surface of the phallus (Figs 16.27E and F). At the base of the phallus, this groove is continuous with the cavity of the urogenital sinus (Fig. 16.27F). The margins of this groove are called the definitive urethral folds.
These folds now approach and fuse with each other. The fusion begins posteriorly in the region of the urogenital sinus and extends forward onto the phallus (Figs 16.27G and H). The penile urethra is formed as a result of this fusion. It will now be apparent that the wall of the penile urethra is made up of the:

1. Original endodermal lining of the phallic part of the urogenital sinus.
2. The endodermal cells of the urethral plate.

The penile urethra formed in this way extends only up to the glans penis. The distal most part of the urethra is of ectodermal origin, and is formed by canalization of a solid mass of ectodermal cells (Figs 16.27G and H).

![img-425.jpeg](img-425.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 16.26A to C: Formation of the prepuce of the penis

- The genital swellings fuse with each other, in the midline, to form the scrotal sac into which the testes later descend.


### Prenatal Diagnosis of Sex

The sex of a baby can be determined before birth by ultrasound examination. The penis can be seen in a male child. In this connection, it has to be noted that in fetuses about 3-4 months old, the genital tubercle is equally developed in both the male and female. Ultrasound examination at this stage can be misleading as the clitoris can be mistaken for a penis.

### Clinical correlation

### anomalies of male external genitalia

- The entire penis may be absent. Alternatively, the corpora cavernosa, or the prepuce, may be missing. The opening of the prepuce may be too narrow to allow retraction (phimosis).
- The penis may be double or bifid.
- Rarely, the penis may lie posterior to the scrotum.
- The urethral folds may fail to fuse, partially, or completely. When failure to fuse is complete, the scrotum is in two halves and the genitals look like those of the female (Fig. 16.28A). If the defect is confined to the anterior part of the phallus, the urethra opens on the under surface of the penis. This condition is called hypospadias (Fig. 16.28B).
- The urethra sometimes opens on the dorsal aspect of the penis. The condition is called epispadias, and is usually associated with ectopic vesicae. In such cases, it is believed that the genital tubercle is formed caudal to the urogenital membrane instead of being ventral to it. When the membrane ruptures, the urogenital sinus opens cranial to the developing penis. Other anomalies of the penile urethra have been described earlier.


### Primordial Germ Cells (Fig. 16.29)

The cells of the ovaries and the testes, from which germ cells are formed, are believed to be segregated early in the life of
the embryo. They probably differentiate in the wall of the yolk sac and migrate to the region of the developing gonads. All spermatozoa and ova that are formed throughout the life of the individual are believed to arise from these primordial germ cells. Migration of primordial germ cells into them is essential for development of the gonads. These cells have an inducing effect on the gonad.

## DEVELOPMENT OF TESTES

- Each testis develops from the coelomic epithelium that covers the medial side of the mesonephros, of the corresponding side (Figs 16.30 and 16.31). In the region where the testis is to develop, this germinal epithelium becomes thickened. This thickening is called the genital ridge.
- The cells of the germinal epithelium proliferate and form a number of solid sex cords that grow into the underlying mesenchyme. They reach deep into the gonad and are called medullary cords. They are soon canalized to form the seminiferous tubules. Meanwhile, the primordial germ cells migrate to the region of the developing testis and get incorporated in the seminiferous tubules.
- The interstitial cells of the testis are derived from sex cords that are not canalized. Some of them are also derived from the surrounding mesenchyme.
- The mesenchymal cells, surrounding the developing testis, form a dense layer of fibrous tissue. This is the tunica albuginea. It completely separates the sex cords from the germinal epithelium and, thereafter, this epithelium can make no further contribution to testicular tissue.


### Duct System of Testes

We have seen, above, that the testis develops in close proximity to the mesonephros, and the mesonephric duct.

![img-426.jpeg](img-426.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 16.27A to H: Stages in the development of male genitalia and of penile urethra. In each set (A to H), the central Figure (1) shows the genital region from the ventral aspect; (2) and (3) are transverse sections at the levels indicated; and (4) is a median section through the region. In sections, ectoderm is depicted in black line, and endoderm is red. Mesoderm is green. (A) Note the following. The phallus is formed by enlargement of the genital tubercle. Caudal to the phallus there is a median, longitudinal depression, the primitive urethral groove (PUG) bounded by primitive urethral folds (PUFs). Lateral to these folds we see the genital swellings (GS). In the depth of the PUG, there is the urogenital membrane which separates the groove from the urogenital sinus (UGS); (B) The phallus has enlarged. The PUG is beginning to extend onto it. A solid mass of endodermal cells derived from the UGS, extends into the phallus. This mass is the urethral plate (UP); (C) The PUG is now fully formed. The UP has enlarged and extends deeper into the phallus; (D) The urogenital membrane has broken down so that endoderm of the UGS can now be seen from outside; (E) Ectoderm overlying the UP has disappeared. As a result, endoderm of the plate is seen on the surface; (F) Cells in the center of the UP now break down and convert the plate into a groove that is seen on the surface. This is the definitive urethral groove, and the folds forming its edges are the definitive urethral folds; (G) The definitive urethral folds grow toward each other and fuse to form a median raphe. In this way the definitive urethral groove is converted into a tube, which is the urethra. This process of fusion starts caudally and progresses cranially; (H) In this Figure and in "G" note that the urethra formed as described above does not extend into the glans. The part of the urethra lying in the glans is derived from ectoderm which first forms a solid cord that is later canalized

![img-428.jpeg](img-428.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 16.29: Migration of primordial germ cells from the neighborhood of the yolk sac to the developing gonad

We have also seen that most of the mesonephric tubules degenerate. Some of them that lie near the testis persist and, along with the mesonephric duct, form the duct system of the testis (Figs 16.32A to C). The ends of the seminiferous tubules anastomose with one another to form the rete testes. The rete testes, in turn, establish contact with persisting mesonephric tubules which form the vasa efferentia.

The cranial part of the mesonephric duct becomes highly coiled on itself to form the epididymis while its distal part becomes the ductus deferens. The seminal vesicle arises, on either side, as a diverticulum from the lower end of the mesonephric duct. The part of the mesonephric duct between its opening into the prostatic urethra, and the origin of this diverticulum, forms the ejaculatory duct.

### Descent of Testes

The testes develop in relation to the lumbar region of the posterior abdominal wall (Fig. 16.33). During fetal life, they gradually descend to the scrotum. They reach the iliac fossa during the 3rd month, and lie at the site of the deep inguinal ring up to the 7th month of intrauterine life. They pass through the inguinal canal during the 7 th month (Figs 16.34 and 16.35), and are normally in the scrotum by the end of the 8th month (Fig. 16.36).

The descent of the testes is caused or assisted by several factors. These are:

- Differential growth of the body wall.
- Formation of inguinal bursa: About the 6th month of intrauterine life, the various layers of the abdominal wall, of each side, show an outpouching toward the scrotum (Fig. 16.37). This pouch progressively increases in size, and depth, and eventually reaches the bottom of the scrotal sac. The descending testis enters this pouch to reach the scrotum. Note that the pouch is formed before the testis enters it. The cavity of the inguinal bursa becomes the inguinal canal, while the various layers of its wall form the coverings of the testis and spermatic cord.
- The gubernaculum: This is a band of mesenchyme which extends from the lower pole of the testis to the scrotum. For many years, it was believed that descent of the testis was caused by shortening of the gubernaculum. However, we now know that this is not possible because the gubernaculum does not contain any contractile tissue. According to some authorities, the gubernaculum does not reach the scrotum but reaches the bottom of the inguinal bursa. In spite of this, the gubernaculum

![img-429.jpeg](img-429.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 16.30A to E: Development of gonads. (A) Indifferent stage; (B and C) Testis; (D and E) Ovary
does play an important part in the descent of the testis as follows:

- When the embryo increases in size, the gubernaculum does not undergo a corresponding increase in length. There is thus a relative shortening of the gubernaculum and, as a result, the testis assumes a progressively lower position.
- The gubernaculum helps to dilate the inguinal bursa. It provides a continuous pathway for the descending testis.
- Processus vaginalis: This is a diverticulum of the peritoneal cavity. It actively grows into the gubernacular mesenchyme of the inguinal canal and of the scrotum (Fig. 16.37). While descending the testis invaginates the processus vaginalis from behind. After the descent of the testis is completed, the processus vaginalis loses all connection with the peritoneal cavity and becomes the tunica vaginalis (Figs 16.38A to C).
- The descent of the testis is greatly influenced by hormones secreted by the pars anterior of the hypophysis cerebri.

Figs 16.38A to C: Relation of descending testis to processus vaginalis. Note that as the testis descends it progressively invaginates the processus vaginalis

### Vestigial Structures in the Region of the Testis

A number of vestigial structures are to be seen in the neighborhood of the testis. Their importance lies in the fact that any one of them may enlarge to form a cyst. These structures are:

- Appendix of testis (also called hydatid of Morgagni)
- Appendix of epididymis
- Superior aberrant ductules
- Inferior aberrant ductules
- Paradidymis.


## DEVELOPMENT OF THE OVARY

- The early stages in the development of the ovary are exactly the same as in the testis (Figs 16.30A, C and E).
- The coelomic epithelium on the medial side of the mesonephros becomes thickened to form genital ridges.
- Cords of cells (sex cords or medullary cords) proliferate from this germinal epithelium, and grow into the underlying mesoderm.
- Primordial germ cells that are formed in relation to the yolk sac migrate to the region of the developing ovary, and give rise to oocytes.
- The sex cords become broken up into small masses. The cells of each mass surround one primordial germ cell, or oocyte, to form a primordial follicle.
- According to some authorities, the original (medullary) sex cords undergo regression in the ovary, and are replaced by a new set of cortical cords arising from coelomic epithelium. Follicular cells are derived from these cortical cords.
- Interstitial gland cells differentiate from mesenchyme of the gonad.
- As no tunica albuginea is formed, the germinal epithelium may contribute to the ovary even in postnatal life.

### Descent of the Ovary

The ovary descends from the lumbar region, where it is first formed, to the true pelvis. A gubernaculum forms, as in the male, and extends from the ovary to the labium majus. It becomes attached to the developing uterus at its junction with the uterine tube. The part of the gubernaculum that persists between the ovary and the uterus becomes the (round) ligament of the ovary. The part between the uterus and the labium majus becomes the round ligament of the uterus.

### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of testis

- The testis may be absent on one or both sides.
- The testis may be duplicated.
- The two testes may be fused together.

Anomalies of descent (cryptorchidism): Descent of the testis may fail to occur, or may be incomplete. The organ may lie in the lumbar region, in the iliac fossa, in the inguinal canal, or in the upper part of the scrotum. Some interesting facts about this condition are as follows:

- The testis may complete its descent after birth.
- Spermatogenesis often fails to occur in an undescended testis.
- An undescended testis is more likely to develop a malignant tumor than a normal testis. The condition can be surgically corrected.
Abnormal positions (ectopia): The testis may lie (Fig. 16.39):
- Under the skin of the lower part of the abdomen.
- Under the skin of the front of the thigh.
- In the femoral canal.
- Under the skin of the penis.
- In the perineum behind the scrotum.

Also see hermaphroditism.

### anomalies of duct system of testis

- The seminiferous tubules may fail to establish connection with the vasa efferentia.
- The ductus deferens may be absent, in whole or in part, on one or both sides.
![img-438.jpeg](img-438.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 16.39: Ectopic positions of the testis. $a=$ under skin of the abdomen; $b=$ over front of thigh; $c=$ in femoral canal; $d=$ under skin of penis; $\mathrm{e}=$ in perineum

- The ductus deferens may have no connection with the epididymis.


### anomalies of the processus vaginalis

We have seen that the part of the processus vaginalis, that extends from the deep inguinal ring up to the tunica vaginalis, normally disappears. This may persist in whole, or in part. Abdominal contents may enter it to produce various forms of inguinal hernia. Alternatively, fluid may accumulate in it producing the condition called hydrocele. Various forms of hernia and of hydrocele are shown in Figures 16.40A to G.

### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of ovary

- The ovary may be absent on one or both sides.
- The ovary may be duplicated.
- The ovary may descend into the inguinal canal or even into the labium majus.
- Adrenal or thyroid tissue may be present in the ovary. The ovary sometimes contains cells that are capable of differentiating into various tissues like bone, cartilage, hair, etc. and the growth of these cell rests can give rise to a peculiar tumor called a teratoma.


## FATE OF MESONEPHRIC DUCT AND TUBULES IN THE MALE

The mesonephric ducts give rise to the following structures (Figs 16.41 and 16.42):

- Ureteric buds from which the ureters, pelvis, calyces and collecting tubules of the kidneys are derived
- Trigone of the urinary bladder
- Posterior wall of the part of the prostatic urethra, cranial to the openings of the ejaculatory ducts
- Epididymis
- Ductus deferens
- Seminal vesicles
- Ejaculatory ducts
- Mesodermal part of prostate
- Appendix of epididymis: This is a small rounded structure attached to the head of the epididymis (Fig. 16.40A). It represents the cranial end of the mesonephric duct. Occasionally, it may give rise to a cyst. This is not to be confused with the appendix of the testis, which is a remnant of the paramesonephric duct.


### Remnants of Mesonephric Tubules

We have seen that most of the mesonephric tubules disappear. Some persist to form the vasa efferentia. Other mesonephric tubules persist to form some vestigial structures that are seen near the testes. Their only importance is that they sometimes give rise to cysts. These remnants are as follows:

![img-439.jpeg](img-439.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 16.40A to G: Anomalies of processus vaginalis. Abnormal persistence of the processus vaginalis can lead to hernia (passage into it of abdominal contents, indicated by arrows); or hydrocele (collection of fluid, shown as dots). Various types of hernia and hydrocele are shown

- The superior aberrant ductules (or epigenital tubules) lie cranial to the vasa efferentia. They are connected to the testis but not to the epididymis.
- The inferior aberrant ductules lie caudal to the vasa efferentia. They are connected only to the epididymis.
- The paradidymis consists of tubules that lie between the testis and the epididymis (paragenital tubules) but are not connected to either of them.


## FATE OF MESONEPHRIC DUCTS AND TUBULES IN THE FEMALE

As in the male, the mesonephric ducts give rise to the ureteric bud from which the ureter, pelvis, calyces and collecting tubules of the kidneys are derived, and give rise to the trigone of the bladder. The posterior wall of the female urethra is also derived from them.

The mesonephric ducts and tubules do not establish any connection with the developing ovary. However, they give rise to some vestigial structures seen in the broad ligament near the ovary. These are (Fig. 16.42B):

- Epoophoron: This consists of a longitudinal duct running parallel to the uterine tube, and a number of transverse ductules that open into the longitudinal duct. It corresponds to the epididymis and vasa efferentia of the male (Note that the word "epoophoron" means "above egg basket": ep = above, oo = egg, and phoron = basket). In some cases, the longitudinal duct is unusually long.
![img-440.jpeg](img-440.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 16.41A and B: (A) Mesonephric duct, early stage; (B) Mesonephric duct in the male, before descent of the testis

It runs along the side of the uterus, and lower down, becomes embedded in the wall of the cervix. It, however, never opens into the uterine lumen. It is the equivalent of the male ductus deferens and is also called Gartner's duct.

- Paroophoron: This consists of small blind tubules lying between the ovary and the uterus, and is the female equivalent of the paradidymis. The word paroophoron means "near egg basket".
Male and female homologues derived from undifferentiated genital system are presented in Table.16.1.

![img-441.jpeg](img-441.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 16.42A and B: Some structures derived from the mesonephric ducts. (A) In the male, these are the epididymis, the ductus deferens, the seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts. The appendix of the epididymis is a vestigial remnant; (B) In the female, most of the duct disappears, some remnants are seen as the epoophoron. For complete list of derivatives of the mesonephric ducts see text

## CONTROL OF DIFFERENTIATION OF GENITAL ORGANS

From the account of the development of the gonads and genitalia, it is seen that these organs are derived from the same primordia in both sexes. The male and female genital systems

are identical till the beginning of 7 th week of intrauterine life. The factors that determine whether these organs will develop as in the male or as in the female are as follows:

- The most important factor is the chromosomal sex of the individual, which is determined at the time of fertilization. We have already seen that individuals with two X-chromosomes are female, while those with one X-chromosome and one Y-chromosome are male.
- The Y-chromosome bears a gene that is responsible for production of a testis determining factor. This factor plays a vital role in causing the developing gonad to

become a testis. Apart from a direct action on the gonad, this factor influences other genes that play a role in the process. Under the influence of these genes, supporting (Sertoli) cells are formed from cells of the sex cords and interstitial (Leydig) cells are formed from mesenchymal cells of the gonadal ridge.

- Once the testis is formed, interstitial cells in it begin to produce testosterone (under the influence of gonadotropins produced in the placenta). This testosterone influences the differentiation of genital ducts, and external genitalia. By the end of 18th week of intrauterine life, fetal interstitial cells disappear to reappear only at the time of puberty.
- Supporting cells in the fetal testis produce a Müllerian inhibiting substance. This substance causes regression of paramesonephric ducts. The sertoli cells also secrete an androgen binding factor that helps in formation of spermatozoa from spermatogonia. As the Y-chromosome is missing in a female fetus, none of the processes described above take place. The estrogens (derived from maternal and placental sources) influence the formation of internal and external genital organs.


### Clinical correlation

### Hermaphroditism

Abnormal development of the gonad and the genitalia gives rise to various types of hermaphroditism. A hermaphrodite is really a person who is both a male and a female at the same time. Such a person has never been known to exist. However, persons having both testes and ovaries have been reported and such individuals are referred to as true hermaphrodites. The word pseudohermaphrodite is used for a person whose external genitalia look like those of one sex, whereas the gonad is of the other sex.
Some forms of hermaphroditism are as follows:

### True hermaphroditism

The person has at least one testis and one ovary in the body. The external genitalia may be male, or female, or midway between the two. The chromosomal sex may be either male or female.

### Pseudohermaphroditism

Gonads are of one sex, while genitalia (internal, external or both) are of opposite sex. A patient having a testis is described as a male hermaphrodite; and one having an ovary is described as a female hermaphrodite.
Female pseudohermaphroditism is caused by excess of androgens produced by the fetal suprarenal gland (adrenogenital syndrome). It may also be caused by administration of progestins to the mother during pregnancy.
