# Chapter 18 Endocrine Glands

## HIGHLIGHTS

- Endocrine gland is a ductless gland. Its cells secrete the substance called hormone, which is directly poured into the blood and transported to the target organ through circulation where it exerts its physiological function.
- The major endocrine glands of the body are pituitary, pineal, adrenal, thyroid and parathyroid. The others are islets of Langerhans in pancreas, gonads and hypothalamus.
- The endocrine glands develop from all three germ layers.
- They produce steroid hormones. Those developing from ectoderm or endoderm secrete amines.
- The pituitary gland develops from two different components. The adenohypophysis develops from a diverticulum extending upward from the roof of stomodeum called Rathke's pouch. The neurohypophysis develops from a downgrowth called infundibular process arising from the floor of the 3rd ventricle.
- The pineal gland develops as a diverticulum from the roof of the 3rd ventricle (diencephalon).
- The adrenal gland develops from two different sources. The adrenal cortex is derived from coelomic epithelium. The cells of the adrenal medulla are derived from the neural crest.


## INTRODUCTION

The development of endocrine glands from the epithelial surface is described in Chapter 7, Figure 7.1.

## CLASSIFICATION OF ENDOCRINE GLANDS

1. Based on location:
a. Head region, e.g. hypothalamus, pineal gland, pituitary gland
b. Neck region, e.g. thyroid gland, parathyroid gland
c. Abdominal region, e.g. pancreas, adrenal, testis/ovary.
2. Based on number:
a. Unilateral, e.g. pituitary, pineal gland, pancreas
b. Bilateral, e.g. thyroid, adrenal, parathyroid gland.
3. Based on secretion:
a. Telecrine-The hormones act at a distance place by traveling through circulation, e.g. thyroid gland, adrenal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, etc.
b. Paracrine-The hormones act on adjacent cells in the region where they are produced, e.g. gastric G cells, somatostatin secreting $\delta$-cells that act on adjacent $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-cells in islets of Langerhans.
4. Based on germ layer of origin:
a. Surface ectoderm-adenohypophysis
b. Neuroectoderm-hypothalamus, neurohypophysis, pineal
c. Neural crest cells-adrenal medulla
d. Endoderm-pancreas
e. Mesoderm-testis, ovary.

In this chapter, we will consider the development of three glands, i.e. (1) pituitary gland, (2) pineal gland and (3) adrenal gland as their development is closely connected with that of the nervous system. The development of gonads is considered in urogenital system. The development of thyroid and parathyroid in pharyngeal system and pancreas in development of organs associated with digestive system.

## HYPOPHYSIS CEREBRI OR PITUITARY GLAND

The hypophysis cerebri or pituitary gland is developed from two separate sources, i.e. surface ectoderm and neuroectoderm.

- The adenohypophysis/anterior pituitary develops from an ectodermal diverticulum that grows upward from the roof of the stomodeum (primitive mouth), just in front of the buccopharyngeal membrane. The diverticulum is called Rathke's pouch (Fig. 18.1A).
- The Rathke's pouch appears in the 3rd week of intrauterine life. It extends upward toward the developing diencephalic floor. It loses contact with the surface epithelium by 2 nd month and is cut off from the stomodeum (Figs 18.1B to D). The cavity of the pouch persists after birth as an intraglandular cleft.
- The neurohypophysis/posterior pituitary develops from a downgrowth from the floor of the 3rd ventricle (diencephalon) in the region of the infundibulum (Fig. 18.1C) during 6th week. This downgrowth (infundibular process) comes into relationship with
the posterior aspect of Rathke's pouch and fuses with it (Figs 18.1D and E). This contact between the two is critical in the development of pituitary.
- The anterior wall of Rathke's pouch proliferates greatly to form the pars anterior (pars distalis) of the hypophysis. The posterior wall remains thin and forms the pars intermedia. The original cleft of Rathke's pouch separates these two parts. Some cells of the anterior part grow upward along the infundibular stalk to form the tuberal part of the hypophysis (Fig. 18.1E).
- The infundibular process forms infundibular stalk and posterior lobe (pars nervosa) of neurohypophysis. The cavity of infundibulum persists as infundibular recess of 3rd ventricle. Though posterior lobe is neuroectodermal in origin it does not contain nerve cells. Most of the cells are neuroglial and it is invaded by nerve fibers originating from hypothalamic nuclei.
- Rathke's pouch constricts at its base and gets separated from the stomodeum to come closer to neurohypophysis. With the formation of the mouth and pharynx, the original site of attachment of Rathke's pouch

to the stomodeum, comes to lie in the roof of the nasopharynx corresponding to the junction of nasal septum and palate.

- The acidophil cells are formed in pars anterior during 3rd month of intrauterine life followed by other cells. During development of pituitary six different cells develop from Rathke's pouch and they form the pars anterior and pars intermedia. Though the posterior lobe is neuroectodermal in origin it does not contains neurons. The cells of posterior lobe are neuroglial (pituicytes) and are traversed by nerve fibers from hypothalamus (Fig. 18.1F).


### Clinical correlation

- Craniopharyngiomas: The original track of Rathke's pouch is called craniopharyngeal canal. Detachment of Rathke's pouch from the roof of stomodeum forms the adenohypophysis. Remnants of Rathke's pouch may sometimes give rise to peculiar type of brain tumors called craniopharyngiomas that are seen in relation to the sphenoid bone and the roof of the nasopharynx. They occur most commonly in children but also in men and women in their 50s and 60s.
- Pharyngeal hypophysis: Accessory anterior lobe tissue seen in relation to the posterior wall of the pharynx.
- Pituitary agenesis/hypoplasia: Rarely the hypophysis may fail to develop (agenesis) or may be underdeveloped (hypoplasia).
- Pharyngeal hypophysis: The gland may be located in the roof of nasopharynx.


## PINEAL GLAND

The pineal gland (or pineal body) arises as an evagination of the roof of the diencephalon (Figs 18.1B and 18.2A). The outgrowth is at first hollow but later becomes solid (Figs 18.2B and C). The specific cells of the pineal body are believed to be modified neuroglial cells. For long considered to be a vestigial structure of no importance, the pineal gland is now known to secrete a number of hormones that have a regulatory influence on many other endocrine glands.

## ADRENAL GLAND

- The adrenal gland consists of a superficial cortex and a deeper medulla. The cells of the cortex arise from coelomic epithelium (mesoderm). The cells of medulla are derived from the neural crest cells (ectoderm).
- The adrenal gland begins to develop in the 5th week of intrauterine life.
- The cells of the cortex arise from the coelomic epithelium that lies in the angle between the developing gonad and the attachment of the mesentery (Fig. 18.3A). The cells

Figs 18.2A to C: Development of pineal gland
arising from the coelomic epithelium may be divided into two groups:

1. The cells that are formed first are large and are acidophils. They surround the cells of the medulla, and form the fetal cortex (Figs 18.3B to D). The fetal cortex disappears after birth.
2. Subsequently, the coelomic epithelium gives origin to smaller cells that surround the fetal cortex. These smaller cells form the definitive cortex (Figs 18.3C and D). According to some authorities, the cells of the fetal cortex are incorporated into the reticular zone of the definitive cortex.

- The differentiation of cortical zones (Fig. 18.3D) begins during the late fetal period. The zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata are present at birth but the zona reticularis becomes recognizable at the end of the third year.
- The suprarenal of the human fetus is almost of the same size as that of the adult. It is quite large as compared to the fetal kidney. The size of the gland (particularly of fetal cortex) becomes smaller during the first year of postnatal life.
- The cells of the medulla are derived from the neural crest. They are similar to the postganglionic sympathetic neurons (cells of sympathetic ganglia). Preganglionic sympathetic neurons terminate in relation to them. These cells migrate to the region of the developing cortical cells and come to be surrounded by them.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of adrenal

- Adrenal cortical tissue may be present at various ectopic sites. The entire adrenal may be ectopic and may lie deep to the capsule of the kidney. It may be fused to the liver or the kidney.
- There may be congenital hyperplasia (over development) of the cortex. In the male, this leads to the adrenogenital syndrome marked by very early development of secondary sexual characters. In the female, it may cause enlargement of the clitoris and the child may be mistaken for a male (pseudohermaphroditism).

## CHROMAFFIN TISSUE

Chromaffin tissue is made up of cells similar to those of the adrenal medulla, and like the latter, is derived from the cells of the neural crest. This tissue is to be seen in relation to the abdominal aorta where it forms the para-aortic bodies (see Fig. 17.7). It is also seen in relation to sympathetic ganglia and plexuses and along the splanchnic nerves (see Fig. 17.7).

### Molecular and genetic basis of pituitary, pineal and adrenal development

- Expression of transcription factors and growth factors in a tightly regulated pattern is responsible for the formation of Rathke's pouch, its orientation with posterior lobe, cell differentiation of anterior and posterior lobes and the hormonal production by the gland. Dysregulation of expression of these factors leads to congenital anomalies of pituitary and hormonal imbalance.
- Home box transcription factor Pax6 and intermediate filament vimentin are required for proper development of pineal gland.
- WT1 gene and transcription factors SF-1 and DAX-1 regulate the development of adrenal gland.

## EMBRYOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR CLINICAL CONDITIONS ORANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS IN EYEBALL

### Case Scenario 1

A 20-year-male was admitted to the neurology department with a history of chronic headache of generalized nature with episodes of nausea and vomiting of more than 2 years duration. Neurological examination presented bilateral papilledema suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. Computed tomography (CT) picture presented mild dilatation of inferior horns of both lateral ventricles. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. Tumor was removed by neurosurgeon and histopathological examination of extracted tumor confirmed the diagnosis. Explain the embryological basis for this clinical presentation.

- Craniopharyngioma is a benign tumor with malignant presentation.
- It accounts for $2.5-4 \%$ of all intracranial tumors.
- The tumor can be present at birth, but it may not be symptomatic until childhood or adulthood. It is believed to be primarily a congenital illness.
- It arises from the remnants of Rathke's pouch. Wnt/betacatenin signaling pathway defect due to beta-catenin gene mutation can produce this condition.
- Ultrasonography during fetal period and CT and MRI scans at later age are the useful diagnostic tools.
- It occurs in sella turcica region of cranial cavity. Early diagnosis of this tumor helps in prevention of sequelae, i.e. raised intracranial tension and pressure effects on surrounding structures like optic chiasma, temporal lobe, and hypothalamus producing visual, neurological and hormonal disturbances.
