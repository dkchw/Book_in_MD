# Chapter 5 Further Development of Embryonic Disc

## HIGHLIGHTS

- The cranial end of the primitive streak enlarges to form the primitive knot.
- Cells of the primitive knot multiply and pass cranially to form a rod-like structure reaching up to the prochordal plate. This is the notochordal process.
- The notochordal process undergoes changes that convert it first into a canal and then into a plate and finally back into a rod-like structure. This is the notochord.
- Most of the notochord disappears. Remnants remain as the nucleus pulposus of each intervertebral disc.
- A wide strip of ectoderm overlying the notochord becomes thickened and forms the neural plate from which the brain and spinal cord develop.
- Intraembryonic mesoderm shows three subdivisions. The mesoderm next to the middle line is called the paraxial mesoderm. It undergoes segmentation to form somites. The mesoderm in the lateral part of the embryonic disc is called the lateral plate mesoderm. A cavity called the intraembryonic coelom appears in it and splits the mesoderm into a somatopleuric layer (in contact with ectoderm) and a splanchnopleuric layer (in contact with endoderm). A strip of mesoderm between the lateral plate mesoderm and the paraxial mesoderm is called the intermediate mesoderm.
- The intraembryonic coelom later forms the pericardial, pleural and peritoneal cavities.
- The embryonic disc, which is at first flat, undergoes folding at the cranial and caudal ends. These are the head and tail folds. Lateral folds also appear. As a result of these folds, the endoderm is converted into a tube, the gut. It is divisible into foregut, midgut and hindgut.
- After formation of the head fold the gut is closed cranially by the prochordal plate, which is now called the buccopharyngeal membrane. Caudally, the gut is closed by the cloacal membrane.
- The umbilical cord develops from the connecting stalk. It contains the right and left umbilical arteries, the left umbilical vein, and remnants of the vitellointestinal duct and yolk sac. The ground substance of the umbilical cord is made up of Wharton's jelly derived from mesoderm. The cord is covered by amnion.
- The allantoic diverticulum arises from the yolk sac before formation of the gut. After formation of the tail fold, it is seen as a diverticulum of the hindgut.
- The pericardial cavity is derived from part of the intraembryonic coelom that lies cranial to the prochordal plate. The developing heart lies ventral to the cavity. After formation of the head fold the pericardial cavity lies ventral to the foregut; and the developing heart is dorsal to the pericardial cavity.
- The septum transversum is made of intraembryonic mesoderm that lies cranial to the pericardial cavity. After formation of the head fold, it lies caudal to the pericardium and heart. The liver and the diaphragm develop in relation to the septum transversum.

## INTRODUCTION

- During the 2nd and 3rd week of development, there is change in the shape of embryonic disc from circular to oval and then pear shape (Figs 5.1A to C). During the 2nd week the bilaminar embryonic disc is established with two germ layers (hypoblast and epiblast) and two cavities (amniotic and yolk sac) suspended by connecting stalk (Fig. 5.2).
- The cephalocaudal axis, dorsoventral axis and right left axis are established with the appearance of prochordal plate and migration of connecting stalk. The cells of epiblast at the caudal end of bilaminar embryonic disc are pluripotent (Fig. 5.1).
- Pluripotent ectodermal cells form the following:
- Definitive endoderm
- Intraembryonic mesoderm
- Definitive ectoderm
- Notochord
- Primordial germ cells (PGC)
- On 15th day of gestation, there is active migration and invagination of these pluripotent ectodermal cells between ectoderm and endoderm forming a narrow median groove and raised lateral margins, the primitive streak (Figs 5.1 and 5.2) from which notochord and the third germ layer Intraembryonic mesoderm are formed during the early part of 3rd week resulting in trilaminar germ disc.


## FORMATION OF NOTOCHORD

The notochord is a midline structure that develops in the region lying between the cranial end of the primitive streak and the caudal end of the prochordal plate (Figs 4.16 and 5.1).

During its development, the notochord passes through several stages that are as follows:

- The cranial end of the primitive streak becomes thickened. This thickened part of the streak is called the primitive knot, primitive node or Henson's node (Figs 5.1 A and 5.3 A$)$.

Figs 5.3A to D: Section through embryonic disc showing formation of (A) primitive knot; (B) blastopore; (C) notochordal process and (D) notochordal canal. Note that the notochordal process is deep to ectoderm and that its position is shown diagrammatically

- A depression appears in the center of the primitive knot. This depression is called the blastopore/primitive pit (Fig. 5.3B).
- Cells in the primitive knot multiply and pass cranially in the middle line, between the ectoderm and endoderm, reaching up to the caudal margin of the prochordal plate.

These cells form a solid cord called the notochordal process or head process (Figs 5.3C and 5.4A). The cells of this process undergo several stages of rearrangement (Figs 5.1 and 5.2) ending in the formation of a solid rod called the "notochord".

- The cavity of blastopore extends into the notochordal process and converts it into a tube called the notochordal canal (Figs 5.3D and 5.4B).
- The cells forming the floor of notochordal canal become intercalated in (i.e. become mixed up with) the cells of the endoderm (Fig. 5.4C). The cells forming the floor of the notochordal canal now separate the canal from the cavity of the yolk sac.
- The floor of the notochordal canal begins to break down. At first, there are small openings formed in it, but gradually the whole canal comes to communicate with the yolk sac (Fig. 5.4D). The notochordal canal also communicates with the amniotic cavity through the blastopore. Thus, at this stage, the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac are in communication with each other.
- Gradually the walls of the canal become flattened so that instead of a rounded canal we have a flat plate of cells called the notochordal plate (Fig. 5.4E).
- However, this process of flattening is soon reversed and the notochordal plate again becomes curved to assume the shape of a tube (Fig. 5.4F). Proliferation of cells of this tube converts it into a solid rod of cells. This rod is the definitive (i.e. finally formed) notochord. It gets completely separated from the endoderm.
- As the embryo enlarges, the notochord elongates considerably and lies in the midline, in the position to be later occupied by the vertebral column. However, the notochord does not give rise to the vertebral column. Most of it disappears, but parts of it persist in the region of each intervertebral disc

as the nucleus pulposus and its cranial continuation the apical ligament of dens of axis vertebra.

- The notochord is present in all animals that belong to the phylum Chordata. In some of them, e.g. Amphioxus, it persists into adult life and forms the central axis of the body. In others, including man, it appears in the embryo but only small remnants of it remain in the adult.
- Experiments have shown that formation of the neural tube is induced by the notochord.
- Primitive streak is the primary organizer as it induces formation of notochord and intraembryonic mesoderm. Formation of notochord determines the cranio-caudal axis and right and left sides of embryo.
- Fate of primitive streak: It regresses at the end of 3rd week of development and completely disappears by 26th day.


## FORMATION OF THE NEURAL TUBE

The details of the formation of the neural tube will be studied later. For the time being, it may be noted that:

- The neural tube gives rise to the brain and the spinal cord
- The neural tube is formed from the ectoderm overlying the notochord and, therefore, extends from the prochordal plate to the primitive knot (Fig. 5.6).
- The neural tube is soon divisible into: (a) a cranial enlarged part that forms the brain, and (b) a caudal tubular part that forms the spinal cord.
- In early embryos, the developing brain forms a large conspicuous mass, on the dorsal aspect. The process of formation of the neural tube is referred to as neurulation.


## SUBDIVISIONS OF INTRAEMBRYONIC MESODERM

The intraembryonic mesoderm is formed by proliferation of cells in the primitive streak and that it separates the ectoderm and the endoderm, except in the following regions that remain bilaminar throughout life (Fig. 5.5):

- Prochordal plate: Later becomes buccopharyngeal membrane (future oral cavity)â€”represents the junction of primitive mouth and pharynx.
- Cloacal membrane: Later divided into the anal membrane (future anal opening) and urogenital membrane (future urinary and genital openings). The rupture of these membranes establishes the communication of urinary, genital and digestive systems with the outside.
- In the midline caudal to the prochordal plate, as this place is occupied by the notochord.
Cranial to the prochordal plate, the mesoderm of the two sides meets in the midline (Figs 4.16 and 5.5). At the edges of the embryonic disc, the intraembryonic mesoderm is continuous with the extraembryonic mesoderm (Fig. 5.6). The intraembryonic mesoderm now becomes subdivided into three parts (Figs 5.6 to 5.8):

1. Mesoderm, on either side of the notochord, becomes thick and is called the paraxial mesoderm.
2. More laterally, the mesoderm forms a thinner layer called the lateral plate mesoderm.
3. Between these two, there is a longitudinal strip called the intermediate mesoderm.

### Paraxial Mesoderm

At first, the cells of the paraxial mesoderm are homogenously arranged. Later, the mesoderm gets segmented. The

Fig. 5.8: Communication between intraembryonic coelom and extraembryonic coelom. Strucutres in the midline of germ disc before folding

segments are of two categories: (1) somitomeres and (2) somites (Figs 5.7 and 5.8). Somitomeres lie in the region of the head. They are rounded structures. There are seven of them. They form the mesoderm and muscles of the head and jaw. Somites are cubical and more distinctly segmented. The most cranial somites are formed in the occipital region. New somites are progressively formed caudal to them. Ultimately there are about 44 pairs of somites (4 occipital, 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 8-10 coccygeal). Occipital somites form muscles of the tongue. Somites form the axial skeleton, skeletal muscle and part of skin. Somitomeres are not confined to the region of somites. In the head region, cranial to somites, somitomeres give origin to some mesenchyme.

Somitomere derived structures are mentioned in Chapter 9.The fate of somites is described in Chapter 10.

## LATERAL PLATE MESODERMFORMATION OF INTRAEMBRYONIC COELOM

- While the paraxial mesoderm is undergoing segmentation, to form the somites, changes are also occurring in the lateral plate mesoderm. Small cavities appear in it. These coalesce (come together) to form one large cavity, called the intraembryonic coelom.
- The cavity has the shape of a horseshoe (Fig. 5.7). There are two halves of the cavity (one on either side of the midline) which are joined together cranial to the prochordal plate. At first, this is a closed cavity (Fig. 5.7) but soon it comes to communicate with the extraembryonic coelom (Fig. 5.8).
- With the formation of the intraembryonic coelom, the lateral plate mesoderm splits into:
- Somatopleuric or parietal layer intraembryonic mesoderm that is in contact with ectoderm.
- Splanchnopleuric or visceral layer of intraembryonic mesoderm that is in contact with endoderm (Figs 5.7 and 5.8).
- The intraembryonic coelom gives rise to pericardial, pleural, and peritoneal cavities. Their development will be considered later. For the time being, note that the pericardium is formed from that part of the intraembryonic coelom that lies, in the midline, cranial to the prochordal plate.
- The heart is formed in the splanchnopleuric mesoderm forming the floor of this part of the coelom (Figs 5.7 to 5.9). This is, therefore, called the cardiogenic area (also called cardiogenic plate, heart-forming plate).
- Cranial to the cardiogenic area (i.e. at the cranial edge of the embryonic disc) the somatopleuric and splanchnopleuric mesoderms are continuous with
each other. The mesoderm here does not get split, as the intraembryonic coelom has not extended into it. This unsplit part of intraembryonic mesoderm forms a structure called the septum transversum (Figs 5.7 to 5.9).


## INTERMEDIATE MESODERM

The urinary and genital systems are derived from the intermediate mesoderm. This will be discussed in detail in the Chapter 16: Urogenital System.

## YOLK SAC

- The formation of the yolk sac has been described in Chapter 4: Fertilization and Formation of Germ Layers (Figs 5.9 and 5.10). We have seen that the primary yolk sac is bounded above by cubical endoderm of the embryonic disc and elsewhere by flattened cells lining the inside of the blastocystic cavity.
- With the formation of the extraembryonic mesoderm, and later the extraembryonic coelom, the yolk sac becomes much smaller; it comes to be lined all round by cubical cells; and it is then called the secondary yolk sac.


## FOLDING OF EMBRYO

The changes that now take place will be best understood by a careful study of Figure 5.10. Note the following:

- There is progressive increase in the size of the embryonic disc due to rapid growth of cells of central part of embryonic disc and rapid growth of somites.
- This causes conversion of flat pear-shaped germ disc into a cylindrical embryo (Fig. 5.10A).
- The head and tail ends of the disc ( X and Y ), however, remain relatively close together. Hence, the increased length of the disc causes it to bulge upward into the amniotic cavity (Figs 5.10B and C).
![img-81.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-81.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 5.10A to H: Figures A to E are formation of head and tail folds and establishment of the gut. F to H is embryonic discrelated structures before (F), during (G) and after (H) formation of head and tail folds. Note the changing relationships of septum transversum, pericardium, buccopharyngeal membrane, cloacal membrane and allantois

- With further enlargement, the edges of embryonic disc become folded on itself in the median and in the transverse planes. The folding in the median plane form ventrally directed head fold and tail fold (Figs 5.10D and E). The folding in the transverse plane forms ventrally directed lateral folds.
- Cephalocaudal folding is due to rapid and longitudinal growth of central nervous system (Fig. 5.10F). Lateral foldings are due to rapid growth of somites and convert the embryo into a tubular structure. These are not three separate folds but occur simultaneously and merge into one another. The notochord, neural tube and somites stiffen the dorsal axis of the embryo making it more foldable.
- With the formation of the head and tail folds, parts of the yolk sac become enclosed within the embryo. In this way, a tube lined by endoderm is formed in the
embryo. This is the primitive gut, from which most of the gastrointestinal tract is derived (Figs 5.10B to E). At first, the gut is in wide communication with the yolk sac. The part of the gut cranial to this communication is called the foregut; the part caudal to the communication is called the hindgut; while the intervening part is called the midgut (Fig. 5.10E). The communication with the yolk sac becomes progressively narrower. As a result of these changes, the yolk sac becomes small and inconspicuous, and is now termed the definitive yolk sac (also called the umbilical vesicle). The narrow channel connecting it to the gut is called the vitellointestinal duct (also called vitelline duct; yolk stalk or omphalomesenteric duct). This duct becomes elongated and eventually disappears.
- As the head and tail folds are forming, similar folds are also formed on each side in transverse or horizontal plane. These are the lateral folds. As a result, the embryo

| - Septum transversum <br> - Heart, pericardial cavity <br> - Buccopharyngeal membrane <br> - Neural tube and notochord <br> - Primitive node <br> - Primitive streak <br> - Cloacal membrane <br> - Connecting stalk with allantois | Ventral to gut <br> (Cranial to caudal) | Dorsal to gut <br> (Cranial to caudal) | Cranial to gut | Caudal to gut |  |

comes to be enclosed all around by ectoderm except in the region through which the vitellointestinal duct (omphalomesenteric duct) passes. Here, there is a circular aperture which may now be called the umbilical opening (Fig. 5.10E).

- The folding facilitates growth and expansion of amniotic cavity that comes to surround the embryo on all sides. In this way, the embryo now floats in the amniotic fluid, which fills the cavity (Fig. 5.10E).
- Convergence of folds on ventral surface forms tubular investment of amnion for connecting stalk. This causes obliteration of extraembryonic coelom. Now, the amnion forms a covering for the umbilical cord.
- The arrangement of embryonic structures from cranial to caudal end of the embryo before and after formation of head and tail folds are presented in Table 5.1 and Figure 5.8 and in Figures 5.10F to H. The events resulting from various folds are presented in Table.5.2.
- The stomodeum is an ectodermal depression at the head end between the bulging head and pericardial bulge. The buccopharyngeal membrane breaks at 4th week and the cloacal membrane at 7th week.


## CONNECTING STALK

While discussing the formation of the extraembryonic coelom, we have seen that with the formation of this cavity, the embryo (along with the amniotic cavity and yolk sac) remains attached to the trophoblast only by extraembryonic mesoderm into which the coelom does not extend (Figs 4.17 and 5.11A to D). This extraembryonic mesoderm forms the connecting stalk.

We shall see later that the trophoblast and the tissues of the uterus together form an important organ, the placenta, which provides the growing embryo with nutrition and with oxygen. It also removes waste products from the embryo. The importance of the connecting stalk is obvious when we see that this is the only connecting link between the embryo and the placenta.

As the embryo grows, the area of attachment of the connecting stalk to it becomes relatively smaller. Gradually this attachment is seen only near the caudal end of the embryonic disc (Figs 5.11D and E). With the formation of the
tail fold, the attachment of the connecting stalk moves (with the tail end of the embryonic disc) to the ventral aspect of the embryo. It is now attached in the region of the umbilical opening (Fig. 5.11F).

By now, blood vessels have developed in the embryo, and also in the placenta. These sets of blood vessels are in communication by means of arteries and veins passing through the connecting stalk. At first, there are two arteries and two veins in the connecting stalk, but later the right vein disappears (the left vein is "left").

It is clear from Figure 5.12 that, at this stage, the amnion has a circular attachment to the margins of the umbilical opening and forms a wide tube in which the following lie:

- Vitellointestinal duct and remnants of the yolk sac
- Mesoderm (extraembryonic) of the connecting stalk. This mesoderm gets converted into a gelatinous substance called "Wharton's jelly". It protects blood vessels in the umbilical cord.
- Blood vessels that pass from the embryo to placenta
- A small part of the extraembryonic coelom.

This tube of amnion, and the structures within it, constitutes the umbilical cord (Fig. 5.13). This cord progressively increases in length to allow free movement of the embryo within the amniotic cavity. At the time of birth of the child (i.e. at full term), the umbilical cord is about half a meter long, and about 2 cm in diameter. It shows marked torsion, which is probably due to fetal movements. An umbilical cord that is either too short or too long can cause problems during delivery of the fetus.

## ALLANTOIC DIVERTICULUM

Before the formation of the tail fold, a small endodermal diverticulum called the allantoic diverticulum arises from the yolk sac near the caudal end of the embryonic disc (Fig. 5.11 E ). This diverticulum grows into the mesoderm of the connecting stalk. After the formation of the tail fold, part of this diverticulum is absorbed into the hindgut. It now passes from the ventral side of the hindgut into the connecting stalk (Fig. 5.11F). We will refer to it again while considering the development of the urinary bladder.

## EFFECT OF HEAD AND TAIL FOLDS ON POSITIONS OF OTHER STRUCTURES

Just before the formation of the head and tail folds, the structures in the embryonic disc are oriented, as shown in Figure 5.8. A median (midline) section across the disc, at this stage, is shown in Figure 5.10F. From the cranial to the caudal side, the structures seen in the midline are the:

- Septum transversum
- Developing pericardial cavity and the heart
- Prochordal plate
- Neural plate
- Primitive streak
- Cloacal membrane.

Note that the primitive streak is now inconspicuous. After folding, the relative positions of these structures

### Molecular regulation of primitive streak

Migration of primitive streak cells and their specification to form various derivatives are controlled by fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) produced by primitive streak cells.
change to that shown in Figures 5.10G and H. The important points to note here are as follows:

- With the formation of the head fold, the developing pericardial cavity comes to lie on the ventral side of the embryo, ventral to the foregut. The heart, which was developing in the splanchnopleuric mesoderm in the floor of the pericardial cavity (Fig. 5.10F), now lies in the roof of the cavity (Fig. 5.10G). The pericardium enlarges rapidly and forms a conspicuous bulging on the ventral side of the embryo (Fig. 5.10H).
- The septum transversum, which was the most cranial structure in the embryonic disc (Fig. 5.8), now lies caudal to the heart (Fig. 5.10G). At a later stage in development, the diaphragm and liver develop in relation to the septum transversum.
- The region of the prochordal plate now forms the buccopharyngeal or oral membrane, which closes the foregut cranially. When this membrane breaks down, the foregut communicates with the exterior.
- The most cranial structure of the embryo is now the enlarged cranial part of the neural tube, which later forms the brain (Fig. 5.10G). This enlarges enormously (Fig. 5.10 H ). There are now two big bulgings on the ventral aspect of the embryo. Cranially, there is the developing brain, and a little below it there is the bulging pericardium (Fig. 5.10H). In between these two, there is a depression called the stomatodeum or stomodeum, the floor of which is formed by the buccopharyngeal membrane.
- Toward the tail end of the embryo, the primitive streak is now an inconspicuous structure that gradually

disappears. The distal end of the hindgut is closed by the cloacal membrane. At first, this is directed caudally (Fig. 5.10G), but later it comes to face ventrally (Fig. 5.10H). We have traced the development of the embryo to a stage when the rudiments of the nervous system, the heart and the gut have been formed. We are now in a position to trace the development of individual organ systems in detail. Before we do this, however, we must study the development of the placenta.

### Clinical correlation

- Teratogenic effects on primitive streak: The embryo is highly sensitive to teratogens during 15th to 18th day (3rd week/ gastrulation period) of development as the primitive streak and its derivatives will be affected.
- Holoprosencephaly: In this condition, the forebrain is small and the two lateral ventricles fuse into a single cavity (Fig. 5.14). The eyes are closely placed (hypertelorism). High doses of alcohol in the mother can cause this condition.
- Caudal dysgenesis (Sirenomelia): Deficiency of mesoderm in the caudal part of the embryo that normally contributes for the formation of lower limbs, urogenital system and lumbosacral vertebrae will result in abnormalities in these structures. The child is born with fused lower limbs and presents renal, genital and vertebral anomalies including imperforate anus. This condition is more common in mother with diabetes.
- Sacrococcygeal teratoma: Persistence of pluripotent cells of primitive streak at the caudal end of embryonic disc after 4th week of gestation gives rise to a large tumor called sacrococcygeal teratoma. It can cause obstruction during labor and is usually malignant. It has to be removed within 6 months after birth.
- Chordoma: Malignant tumor arising from remnants of notochord. It can be seen at cranial or caudal end of notochord.
- Serinomelia or caudal dysgenesis: Due to deficient development of caudal IEM.
