# Chapter 3 Reproductive System, Gametogenesis, Ovarian and Menstrual Cycles

## HIGHLIGHTS

- Reproduction is the process of formation of a new living organism. For reproduction in higher animals, presence of dimorphic gametes and sex organs are required.
- The gametes in males are called spermatozoa and are produced in testis. In females, they are called ova and are produced in ovary.
- The gametes are derived from primordial germ cells (PGC)/primitive sex cells. These cells do not develop in gonads. They are derived from ectoderm or epiblast the first embryonic germ layer.
- The process of formation of gametes is called gametogenesis. In males, it is called spermatogenesis and in females the oogenesis.
- Stages of spermatogenesis are summarized in Flowchart 3.1.
- Spermatozoa are derived from rounded spermatids.
- Spermiogenesis is the process of conversion from a typical cell (spermatid) to a specialized cell the spermatozoon.
- A spermatozoon has a head, a neck, a middle piece and a principal piece or tail.
- Stages of oogenesis are summarized in Flowchart 3.2.
- An ovarian follicle is a rounded structure that contains a developing ovum surrounded by follicular cells. The follicle has a cavity filled with fluid.
- Ovarian follicles have a cellular covering called the theca interna. The cells of the theca interna produce estrogens.
- The follicle gradually increases in size and finally bursts and expels the ovum. This process of shedding of the ovum is called ovulation.
- The corpus luteum is formed by enlargement and transformation of follicular cells, after-shedding of the ovum. The corpus luteum secretes progesterone, which is essential for maintenance of pregnancy.
- The term menstrual cycle is applied to cyclical changes that occur in the endometrium every month. The most obvious feature is a monthly flow of blood (menstruation).
- The menstrual cycle is divided into the following phases: postmenstrual, proliferative, secretory, and menstrual.
- The menstrual cycle is also divided into the follicular phase (in which changes are produced mainly by estrogens) and the luteal phase (in which effects of progesterone predominate). Both phases are of roughly equal duration.
- The main changes in the endometrium during menstrual cycle are (a) increase in thickness, (b) growth of uterine glands, (c) changes in epithelial cells lining the glands and (d) increase in thickness and fluid content of the endometrial stroma.
- Just before onset of menstruation, the blood supply to superficial parts of the endometrium is cut off. This part is shed off and there is bleeding.
- The menstrual cycle is influenced by estrogens, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).

## INTRODUCTION

The term "reproduction" means formation of new living organism that closely resembles the parents. The purpose of reproduction is maintenance and propagation of species. It requires the presence of dimorphic gametes. In higher animals it is accomplished by separate male and female sexual organs. The processes involved in reproduction are complicated.

The gametes or germ cells are produced in the gonads (testis in males and ovary in females). The male gametes are called spermatozoa and female gametes the ova.

At the time of sexual intercourse the male gametes are introduced into the female reproductive tract where fertilization (fusion of male and female gametes) takes place. This initiates the development of a new individual the embryo that grows further to be called as fetus.

The growth and development of fertilized egg in the female reproductive system is called pregnancy. The woman who bears the fertilized egg that grows for a period of 10 lunar months is called a pregnant woman. At the end of growth period the fetus is delivered and is nourished by mother's milk for a certain period which is known as lactation.

## MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM

It consists of external and internal genital organs. External genital organs include penis, scrotum and its contents.

Flowchart 3.1: Stages of spermatogenesis
Spermatogenesis
![img-25.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-25.jpeg.jpg)

Internal genital organs include the gonads, the duct system and accessory sex organs. Male organs of reproduction (Fig. 3.1) and their functions are:

- Gonads: These are a pair of organs known as testes (plural)/testis (singular). The gonads produce male sex cells and secrete male hormone the testosterone.
- Duct system: It includes epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory ducts and urethra that extend from the testes to penis (copulatory organ) and assist in storage, maturation and transport of male sex cells.
- Accessory sex glands: These include seminal vesicle, prostate and bulbourethral glands. These secrete fluid that helps in nutrition and transport of sperms. Contraction of smooth muscle that is present in these glands causes a thorough mixture of secretions of accessory glands and spermatozoa which is known as "semen".
- Penis: It is a muscular and highly vascular organ that ejaculates or deposits spermatozoa into the vagina of female during sexual intercourse.
- Scrotum: The testis is located in the scrotum. It protects the testis and maintains the temperature suitable for spermatogenesis.


### Testis

- Testis is oval in shape and is suspended in the scrotal sac by spermatic cord. It is obliquely oriented in scrotal sac. Its upper end is connected to head of epididymis by efferent ductules and is overlapped by it. Lower end is connected to tail of epididymis by areolar tissue. The lateral surface is overlapped by body of epididymis in its posterior part.
- Testis is covered by three covering from outside inwards. They are tunica vaginalis (serous layer), tunica albuginea (fibrous capsule) and tunica vasculosa (vascular membrane). The tunica albuginea is thickened on the posterior aspect of the testis to form an incomplete partition called mediastinum testis. From the anterior surface of mediastinum number of septa extend into the substance of testis and divide it into 250-300 lobules (Fig. 3.2).
- Lobule of testis: Each lobule contains 2-4 tightly coiled seminiferous tubules that form the exocrine part of testis and interstitial cells of Leydig between them form the endocrine part. The spermatozoa are produced in seminiferous tubules and the process is known as "spermatogenesis".
- Seminiferous tubule: Seminiferous tubules are structural and functional units of testis. Each seminiferous tubule when uncoiled is about $70-80 \mathrm{~cm}$ (2 feet) in length.

Fig. 3.2: Vertical section of testis, epididymis and vas deferens

It consists of a coiled part in front and a straight part behind. The straight part extends to mediastinum of testis where it joins with adjacent tubules and forms a plexiform network in mediastinum known as rete testis. About 10-20 efferent ductules arise from rete testis and enter the head of epididymis (Fig. 3.2).

- Seminiferous tubule (Microscopic structure): Each seminiferous tubule is covered by basement membrane externally. Internally it is lined by complex stratified epithelium composed of two main types of cells, the spermatogenic cells and supporting cells of Sertoli (Fig. 3.3A).
- Spermatogenic cells are given different names in different stages of development. Stem cells are known as spermatogonia that develop from primordial germ cells (PGC). At puberty the spermatogonia start maturing into primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa. The spermatozoa are released into the lumen of seminiferous tubules. Within the basement membrane the spermatogenic cells are arranged in several layers. An outer layer of cuboidal cells with small nuclei enlarge to form spermatogonia. Large polyhedral cells with clear nuclei in two or three layers form the spermatocytes, primary and secondary. By meiotic division the primary spermatocytes give rise to secondary spermatocyte. Secondary spermatocytes undergo another maturation division to form the spermatids that metamorphose into spermatozoa. The spermatozoa occupy the luminal aspect of the seminiferous tubule (Fig. 3.3B).
- Sertoli cells: These are polyhedral cells situated between the spermatogenic cells. They extend from the basement membrane to the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. Each is fixed to the basal
lamina of seminiferous epithelium. The nucleus is situated toward the basal part of the cell. It forms an elaborate system of thin processes that extend to the lumen. The spermatogenic cells lie in the deep depressions formed by the Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the developing spermatozoa, phagocytose the excess cytoplasm of spermatids, control the movement and release of spermatogenic cells and produce the hormone inhibin (Fig. 3.3B).
- Leydig cells: These are larger polyhedral cells of 14-21 microns diameter, lying in connective tissue between the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 3.3B). The cells contain fat, phospholipids and Vitamin C and secrete the male hormone testosterone. The function of testosterone is to stimulate development of male genitalia, maintenance of spermatogenesis (formation and maturation of spermatozoa), development and maintenance of secondary sexual characters like growth of beard, male type of hair distribution and male voice.


## FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM

It consists of external and internal genital organs. External genital organs are collectively known as vulva. Internal genital organs include the ovaries, uterine/fallopian tubes, uterus and vagina. Female organs of reproduction (Fig. 3.4) and their functions are:

- Gonads: Two in number and are known as ovaries (Plural)/ovary (singular). The ovaries produce female sex cells (oocytes) and secrete female hormones (estrogen and progesterone), inhibin and relaxin.
- The uterine tube or oviduct transports the oocyte to uterus and is the seat of fertilization. These are a pair of ducts that convey sperms to reach an ovum, and transport secondary oocytes from ovary to uterine tube for fertilization and fertilized ovum from uterine tube to
![img-28.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-28.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 3.3A and B: Cut-section of seminiferous tubule showing cells of spermatogenic lineage and Sertoli cells

uterine cavity. The uterine tube presents two openings and four parts. The two openings are uterine ostium by means of which it communicates with the uterus and the abdominal/pelvic ostium through which it communicates with the peritoneal cavity. The margins of pelvic ostium present finger-like processes called fimbriae. From medial to lateral it presents four parts, i.e. intramural, isthmus, ampulla and infundibulum. Ampulla is the widest and longest part of uterine tube where fertilization takes place. The funnel-shaped lateral end of tube is called "infundibulum".

- The uterus is the seat of implantation of fertilized ovum, growth of embryo and fetus during pregnancy and delivery of fetus at labor.
- Vagina is an intromittent organ that receives penis during copulation and is the site of release of sperms. It is the passage for child birth.


### Ovaries

- Ovaries are almond-shaped structures. They are intraperitoneal organ and dull gray in color. Before puberty, the surface is smooth. Afterwards due to repeated ovulations the surface becomes irregular. They are located one on either side of uterus below and behind the corresponding uterine tube. They are attached to the posterior layer of broad ligament (Fig. 3.4).
- Each ovary presents two ends, two borders and two surfaces. The tubal end is close to the fimbriae of uterine tube and is attached along with uterine tube to the lateral pelvic wall by suspensory ligament of ovary. The uterine end is connected to the uterus by ligament of ovary.
![img-29.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-29.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 3.4: Female reproductive system

- Ovaries produce the female gametes the oocytes that develop into ova after fertilization. They produce the female sex hormones the progesterone and estrogen that are required for maturation of gametes, receptive uterine endometrium for implantation of fertilized ovum and growth of embryo and fetus.
- Microscopic structure (Fig. 3.5):
- The surface of ovary is covered by simple cuboidal epithelium known as germinal epithelium. Underneath the germinal epithelium is a capsule of dense connective tissue known as tunica albuginea. The substance of ovary is divided into outer cortex and inner medulla.
- The inner medulla contains loose connective tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves.
- The outer cortex contains connective tissue stoma and ovarian follicles. Cortex of ovary is the seat of cyclical changes known as "ovarian cycle" during reproductive age of the female. It contains ovarian follicles in different stages of development.
- The formation of gametes in female gonads is called oogenesis and the development of ovarian follicles is known as folliculogenesis.
- The morphology and morphometry of ovarian follicles varies at different periods of life—prenatal, prepubertal, reproductive and menopausal.


### Uterus

- Uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped muscular organ where the embryo/fetus develops.
- It has three parts: (1) the fundus, (2) body and (3) cervix. The dome shaped upper part above the openings of
![img-30.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-30.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 3.5: Cut-section of ovary showing various stages of development of ovarian follicles, ovulation and degenerating corpus luteum

uterine tubes is the fundus. Body is the main part that presents a cavity where the fetus grows. Cervix is the lower cylindrical part that projects into the vagina (Fig. 3.4).

- The wall of the uterus is made up of three layers (Fig. 3.6).

1. The outermost layer or perimetrium is made up of peritoneum.
2. The main thickness of the wall is made up of smooth muscle. This is the myometrium and is highly vascular. The muscle fibers run in different directions with each one having a functional role (Table 3.1 and Fig. 3.7). During pregnancy these fibers undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia.
3. The innermost layer (corresponding to mucous membrane) is called the endometrium. It is this layer which undergoes cyclical changes called "menstrual cycle".
To understand the menstrual cycle it is necessary to know the structure of the uterus.

- The constituents of the endometrium are as follows (Fig. 3.7):
- The epithelium lining the surface of the endometrium is columnar.
- The stroma fills the interval between surface epithelium and myometrium. It contains numerous simple tubular glands (uterine glands) that secrete mucus.
![img-31.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-31.jpeg.jpg)

| Direction of muscle fiber layer | Function |
| :-- | :-- |
| Outer longitudinal | Expulsion of contents |
| Middle circular | Retention of products of <br> conception |
| Inner reticular | Living ligature of uterus |

- The arteries that supply the endometrium tend to run vertically toward the surface. Some of these run spirally and supply the whole thickness of the endometrium, while others that remain straight are confined to the basal part.


## GAMETOGENESIS

The process of formation of gametes is called "gametogenesis". The gametes are derived from primordial germ cells/ primitive sex cells.

- Primordial germ cells (PGC)/Primitive sex cells: Gametes are derived from PGC during 4th week of development. The PGC appear in the wall of yolk sac (Fig. 3.8) from which they migrate to the developing gonad from the coelomic epithelium and adjacent mesenchyme. The PGC undergo mitotic division during their migration resulting in increase in their number.
![img-32.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-32.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 3.8: Migrating primordial germ cells at the caudal end of yolk sac

- Definition: Gametogenesis can be defined as the process of conversion of primordial or primitive germ cells and their maturation into male and female gametes.
In males it is called spermatogenesis and it takes place in seminiferous tubules of testis. In females it is called oogenesis and it takes place in the cortex of ovary. The differences in gametogenesis between males and females are presented in Table 3.2.
- Different events in gametogenesis: The process of gametogenesis includes:

1. Formation and migration of PGC and their differentiation into male or female sex cells
2. Mitotic divisions of germ cells
3. Meiotic reduction in DNA or chromosome content of the germ cells
4. Differentiation and maturation of germ cells.

Phase 1 and 2 are similar in both sexes whereas the timing and pattern of phase 3 and 4 differ.

- The PGC are formed in the ectoderm/epiblast of the bilaminar germ disc of human embryo during 2nd week of development. They move to the wall of yolk sac by 4th week (Fig. 3.8). By 5th week they reach the developing gonad.

TABLE 3.2: Differences between spermatogenesis and oogenesis

| Spermatogenesis | Oogenesis |
| :--: | :--: |
| Continuous process from puberty to death | Cyclical from puberty to menopause |
| Absent before puberty | Starts before puberty-intrauterine life |
| Number of gametes released are 200-300 million/ejaculation | 400-500 mature ova are released during reproductive life |
| Meiosis I results in two secondary spermatocytes from one primary spermatocyte | Meiosis I results in one secondary oocyte from one primary oocyte |
| Meiosis II results in four spermatids from one primary spermatocyte | Meiosis II results in one ovum from one primary oocyte |
| Relatively short diplotene stage | Prolonged diplotene stage |
| Four gametes are of equal size | One large gamete (Ovum) and 2/3 polar bodies |
| Participates in fertilization only after completion of meiosis | Participates in fertilization before completion of meiosis |
| When the primary spermatocyte divides, its cytoplasm is equally distributed between the two secondary spermatocytes formed. | - When the primary oocyte divides, almost all its cytoplasm goes to the daughter cell, which forms the secondary oocyte. <br> - The other daughter cell (first polar body) receives half the chromosomes of the primary oocyte, but almost no cytoplasm. |
| Most cytoplasm is shed from spermatozoon | Cytoplasm is conserved in the ovum |

- Gonadal differentiation occurs in 6th week.
- The PGC undergo repeated mitotic divisions during their journey. The decision to develop into male sex cells (spermatogonia) and development of testis or female sex cells (oogonia) and ovary development depend on their own sex-chromosome constitution and on the sex determining region of Y (SRY) gene on the Y chromosome.


### Spermatogenesis

- Definition: It is the process of maturation of male gametes in the wall of seminiferous tubules.
- It involves a series of changes leading to the conversion of spermatogonia into spermatozoa.
- Time: In the male, the formation of gametes (spermatozoa) takes place only during the reproductive period, which begins at the age of puberty (12-16 years) and continues even into old age.
- Duration: 64-74 days.
- Stages: If we look at one of the seminiferous tubules under a microscope, we find that there are many cells of different sizes and shapes (Fig. 3.3B). Most of these represent stages in the formation of spermatozoa, but some (called Sertoli cells) have only a supporting function. The various cell-stages in spermatogenesis are spermatocytosis, meiosis and spermiogenesis. These stages can be described as follows (Figs 3.3, 3.9 to 3.11 and Flowchart 3.1).


### Spermatocytosis (Figs 3.3, 3.9 and Flowchart 3.1)

- It is the process of conversion of spermatognia to primary spermatocytes. It takes 16 days. It is by repeated mitotic divisions.
- Formation of stem cells: The PGCs give rise to spermatogonial stem cells.
- Cell growth: From these stem cells a group of cells are formed at regular intervals and are called type A spermatogonia. Production of type A spermatogonia marks the beginning of spermatogenesis.
- Mitotic divisions: Type A spermatogonia $(44+\mathrm{X}+\mathrm{Y})$ undergo a limited number of mitotic divisions and form a clone of cells. The last division of cells become Type B spermatogonia. The Type A spermatogonia are dark and Type B are pale in color. Type A spermatogonia are reserve cells. The spermatogonia (Type B) (44 + $\mathrm{X}+\mathrm{Y}$ ) enlarge, or undergo mitosis, to form primary spermatocytes.


### Meiotic Divisions (Figs 3.3, 3.9 and Flowchart 3.1)

- It is the process of conversion of primary spermatocytes to secondary spermatocytes and then spermatids. It takes 24 days.

- The primary spermatocytes $(44+X+Y)$ now divide so that each of them forms two secondary spermatocytes. This is the first meiotic division: it reduces the number of chromosomes to half.
- Each secondary spermatocyte has $22+X$ or $22+Y$ chromosomes. It divides to form two spermatids. This
![img-34.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-34.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 3.9: Stages in spermatogenesis. Note the number of chromosomes at each stage
is the second meiotic division and this time there is no reduction in chromosome number. It is called equation meiosis. There occurs balancing of species specific chromosome number and DNA content by reduction and equation divisions.

### Spermiogenesis (Figs 3.3, 3.9, 3.10 and Flowchart 3.1)

- It is the process of metamorphosis of spermatids to spermatozoa and takes 24 days.
- The process by which a spermatid $(22+X / 22+Y)$ gradually changes its shape to become a spermatozoon is called spermiogenesis (or spermateleosis). It is the final stage in the maturation of spermatids into mature, motile spermatozoa.
- The spermatid is a more or less circular cell containing a nucleus, Golgi apparatus, centriole and mitochondria (Fig. 3.10). All these components take part in forming the spermatozoon.
- Major events in spermiogenesis (Fig. 3.10)
- Nuclear morphogenesis and condensation
- Formation of tail
- Formation of acrosome
- Rearrangement of organelles (Mitochondria, centrioles)
- Shedding of excess cytoplasm.
- Various processes in spermiogenesis (Figs 3.8 and 3.11):
- Nucleus: Condensation of nucleus and its movement to one pole forms the head.
- Golgi apparatus: The Golgi apparatus is transformed into the acrosomic cap. Acrosomal cap covers twothird of nucleus.
- Centrosome: The centriole divides into two parts that are at first close together. The proximal centriole
![img-35.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-35.jpeg.jpg)

becomes spherical and comes to lie in the neck. The axial filament appears to grow out of it. Distal centriole forms the distal end of the middle piece, i.e. annulus. Centrioles are concerned for movement.

- Mitochondria: Form a spiral sheath around middle piece. The part of the axial filament between the neck and the annulus becomes surrounded by mitochondria, and together with them forms the middle piece. The remaining part of the axial filament elongates to form the principal piece and tail.
- Cytoplasm: Most of it is shed as residual bodies of Renaud and are engulfed by Sertoli cells.
- Cell membrane: Persists as a covering for the spermatozoon. Presents specialization for fertilization that includes:
- Sperm-egg recognition
- Sperm-egg binding
- Sperm-egg fusion.


### Difference between Spermatogenesis and Spermiogenesis

- Spermatogenesis is the complete process of formation of a spermatozoon from a spermatogonium. It includes the first and second meiotic divisions and spermiogenesis.
- On the other hand, spermiogenesis is the process of transformation of a rounded spermatid into a spermatozoon.


### Maturation and Capacitation of Spermatozoa

- When first formed in seminiferous tubules, spermatozoa are immature. They are nonmotile and incapable of fertilizing an ovum.
- A current of fluid in seminiferous tubules carries spermatozoa from the testis to the epididymis. Here they are stored and undergo maturation.
- As spermatozoa pass through the epididymis they undergo a process of maturation. Changes take place in glycoproteins of the plasma membrane covering the sperm head.
- Spermatozoa acquire some motility after maturation, but become fully motile only after ejaculation when they get mixed with secretions of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles.
- Spermatozoa acquire the ability to fertilize an ovum only after they have been in the female genital tract for some time. This final step in their maturation is called capacitation.
- In the process of capacitation, the glycoprotein coat and seminal proteins lying over the surface of the spermatozoon are altered. Spermatozoa usually undergo capacitation in the uterus or uterine tube, under the influence of substances secreted by the female genital tract.
- When a spermatozoon comes in contact with the zona pellucida, changes take place in the membranes over the acrosome and enable release of lysosomal enzymes. This is called the acrosome reaction.
- Some enzymes help in digesting the zona pellucida and in penetration of the spermatozoa through it. Changes in the properties of the zona pellucida constitute the zona reaction.


### Structure of a Mature Spermatozoon

- A spermatozoon is a highly specialized, free swimming, actively motile cell. The spermatozoon has a head, a neck, a middle piece and a principal piece or tail

(Figs 3.10 and 3.11). An axial filament passes through the middle piece and extends into the tail. The spermatozoon measures about $60 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in length.

- Head: The head of the human spermatozoon is piriform in shape and measures $4 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in length. It is derived from the nucleus, which consists of 23 highly condensed chromosomes. The chromatin in the head of the spermatozoon is extremely condensed. This makes the head highly resistant to various physical stresses. The chemical basis for condensation is the replacement of histones by protamines. The head is covered by a cap-like structure called the acrosome (also called the "acrosomic cap" or "galea capitis"). The acrosome contains enzymes that help in penetration of the spermatozoon into the ovum during fertilization (see Chapter 4: Fertilization and Formation of Germ Layers).
- Neck: The neck is narrow. It contains a funnel-shaped basal body and a spherical centriole. The basal body is also called the connecting piece because it helps to establish an intimate union between the head and the remainder of the spermatozoon (Fig. 3.10). The basal body is made up of nine segmented rod-like structures. On its proximal side (i.e. toward the head of the spermatozoon), the basal body has a convex articular surface which fits into a depression (implantation fossa) in the head.
- Middle piece and principal piece: The axial filament begins just behind the centriole. It passes through the middle piece and most of the tail. At the point where the middle piece joins the tail, the axial filament passes through a ring-like structure called "the annulus". The part of the axial filament, which lies in the middle piece, is surrounded by a spiral sheath made up of mitochondria. The axial filament is really composed of several fibrils arranged as illustrated in Figure 3.12.
![img-37.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-37.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 3.12: Transverse section across the principal piece (tail) of a spermatozoon to show the arrangement of fibrils

There is a pair of central fibrils, surrounded by nine pairs (doublets) arranged in a circle around the central pair. In addition to the doublets, the axial filament contains nine coarser petal-shaped fibrils, one such fibril lying just outside each doublet. The whole system of fibrils is kept in position by a series of coverings. Immediately outside the fibrils, there is a fibrous sheath. In the region of the middle piece, the fibrous sheath is surrounded by spirally arranged mitochondria.
Finally, the entire spermatozoon is enclosed in a plasma membrane.

### Oogenesis

- Definition: The process of maturation and differentiation of PGC to oogonia, primary oocytes, secondary oocytes and to mature ova in the female genital tract.
- Location: Ovarian cortex.
- Peculiarities of oogenesis:
- Starts before birth (10th week)
- Stops in the middle (birth to puberty)
- Restarts at puberty (11-13 years)
- Continues up to menopause (45-55 years)
- Processes: The various processes in oogenesis are:
- Mitosis
- Meiosis
- Growth of follicles
- Differentiation of follicles
- The cortex contains many large round cells called "oogonia". All the oogonia to be utilized throughout the life of a woman are produced at a very early stage (possibly before birth) and do not multiply thereafter.
- On arrival in the gonad the primordial germ cells differentiate into oogonia. The oogonia pass through the stages of primary and secondary oocyte and ovum.
- Oogenesis at different phases of life (Fig. 3.13 and Flowchart 3.2) can be described as:
- Before birth:
- Before 3rd month: The PGCs undergo mitosis to form oogonia. This occurs in the absence of testicular differentiation factor (TDF).
- Before 7th month: The oogonia continue to divide mitotically. The oogonia are surrounded by a layer of flat epithelial cells. Some of the oogonia enlarge to form primary oocytes.
- 7th month to birth: Formation of primordial follicles (primary oocyte with its surrounding flat epithelial cells) and multiplication of primary oocytes to produce millions of germ cells occurs. Primary oocyte enters prophase I of meiosis I at that phase the meiosis is arrested by oocyte maturation inhibitor (OMI) factor.

Fig. 3.13: Stages in oogenesis. Compare each stage with the corresponding one in Figure 3.9

- The oogonia are diploid (2n) in chromosome content. Many of these oogonia and primary oocytes degenerate before birth.
- Birth to puberty:
- There will be both maturation and degeneration of primordial follicle resulting in reduction in the number of primary oocytes.
- At the time of birth all primary oocytes are in the prophase of first meiotic division. At birth approximately two lakh primary oocytes in primordial follicles are present in each ovary.
- Instead of entering metaphase the primary oocytes enter prolonged resting or diplotene stage.
- After puberty-cyclical preparation for fertilization is known as ovarian cycle.
- From the time of birth to puberty there is degeneration of number of primary oocytes. Rest of the primary oocytes remain in prophase and do not complete their first meiotic division until they begin to mature and are ready to ovulate.
- The first meiotic division of a primary oocyte produces two unequal daughter cells. Each daughter cell has the haploid number of chromosomes (23). The large cell, which receives most of the cytoplasm, is called the secondary oocyte, and the smaller cell is known as "the first polar body" (Fig. 3.13). The secondary oocyte immediately enters the second meiotic cell division.
- Ovulation takes place while the oocyte is in metaphase. The secondary oocyte remains arrested in metaphase till fertilization occurs. The second meiotic division is completed only if fertilization occurs. This division results in two
unequal daughter cells. The larger cell is called ovum. The smaller daughter cell is called the second polar body. The first polar body may also divide during the second meiotic division (Fig. 3.13) making a total of three polar bodies.
- If fertilization does not occur, the secondary oocyte fails to complete the second meiotic division and degenerates about 24 hours after ovulation.


### Reproductive Period

In an individual, the formation of gametes takes place only during the reproductive period which begins at the age of puberty (10-14 years). In women, it ends between the ages of 45 years and 50 years, but in men it may continue till the age of 60 years or more.

The period of a woman's life in which she can bear children is during the reproductive period. The most obvious feature of this period is a monthly flow of blood from the uterus that is referred to as menstruation (or menses). The onset of menstruation (menarche) takes place at about 12 years of age. Menstruation ceases to occur at about 45 years of age, and this is referred to as menopause. The monthly menstruation is the external manifestation of a series of cyclic changes taking place in the uterus. These changes constitute the menstrual cycle.

Simultaneously, cyclic changes also take place in the ovaries, and these constitute the ovarian cycle. The most important event in the ovarian cycle is ovulation. During the reproductive life of a female in each month/menstrual cycle several primary and secondary follicles start developing but only one reaches maturity for release of ovum in that cycle.

The process of fusion of sperm and ovum is known as fertilization. If fertilization does not take place the

secondary oocyte degenerates. The secondary oocyte at fertilization completes its meiosis II.

In each menstrual cycle, 5-30 primary oocytes in primordial follicles start maturing, but only one of them reaches maturity and is ovulated and the remaining degenerate. During the entire reproductive life of a female, only around 400 ova are discharged (out of 40,000 primary oocytes available).

## OVARIAN CYCLE

Definition: Cyclical change in ovaries during 28 day reproductive cycle, terminating in the release of single mature ovum (ovulation) under the influence of anterior pituitary gonadotrophic hormones [follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormones (LH)].
Phases: It includes preovulatory, ovulatory and postovulatory phases.

### Preovulatory Phase

- In a 28-day reproductive cycle this extends from the 5th to 14th day, i.e. up to ovulation. This phase lasts for 8-10 days and may vary from 10-25 days depending on the length of reproductive cycle.
- During this phase under the influence of FSH in earlier stages and both FSH and LH of anterior pituitary in later stages, 10-15 primordial follicles start maturation process known as folliculogenesis. But only one follicle matures fully while others undergo degeneration or atresia at different stages of development.


### Folliculogenesis

Definition: It is the process of maturation of ovarian follicles. The various types of follicles that are formed during this process of maturation are primordial, primary, secondary, vesicular, tertiary and mature.

- Primordial follicles:
- The oogonia are surrounded by stromal cells. Some cells of the stroma become flattened and surround a primary oocyte. These flattened cells ultimately form the ovarian follicle and are, therefore, called follicular cells.
- Each primary oocyte covered by a single layer of flattened follicular cells is known as primordial follicle (Figs 3.5, 3.14 and Flowchart 3.2). The follicular cells protect the ova and form different types of follicle with progress in their development. Both primary oocyte and granulosa cells are covered by a thin basement membrane.
- The primordial follicles are the basic reproductive units at puberty. These are seen in the deeper part of cortex of developing ovary. These are formed during intrauterine life by the conversion of oogonia around 10th week of development.
- The division of primary oocyte is arrested until puberty by oocyte maturation inhibition (OMI) factor produced by the follicular cells that surround the oocyte.
- At birth approximately two lakh primary oocytes in primordial follicles are present in each ovary. From the time of birth to puberty there is degeneration of number of primary oocytes resulting in reduction in their number to 40,000 . Of these 40,000 that were present at puberty around 400-450 mature during the reproductive life of a female and release the ovum. The remaining primary oocytes undergo atresia or degeneration at different phases of maturation.
- Primary follicles: The oocyte resumes and completes its first meiotic division, when it starts maturing after puberty, and is preparing for ovulation. From puberty to menopause, i.e. during the reproductive period of a female under the influence of pituitary gonadotrophic hormones-FSH and LH, several primordial follicles (10-50 numbers) start maturing in each month, to be converted to primary follicles.
Each primary follicle consists of primary oocyte surrounded by a layer of cuboidal or low columnar follicular cells (Figs 3.5 and 3.15). The growing primary

Fig. 3.15: Primary follicle

follicle forms a homogenous layer of glycoprotein in between follicular cells and primary oocyte known as zona pellucida.

- Secondary/Multilaminar follicle: The follicular cells undergo mitotic division and form several layers of follicular cells surrounding the primary oocyte forming a multi-layered stratum granulosum (Figs 3.5 and 3.16). The primary oocyte increases in size up to 40 microns. Its nucleus is large and vesicular. The follicular cells are now called as "granulosa cells". The primary oocyte receives its nutrition from the granulosa cells up to puberty.
- Preantral follicle: Fluid-filled spaces appear between granulosa cells, and such follicle is known as "preantral follicle" (Figs 3.5 and 3.17). The fluid is secreted by granulosa cells.
- Tertiary/Antral follicle: With the growth of the follicle, fluid-filled spaces between granulosa cells coalesce

and form a bigger cavity known as "follicular antrum" pushing the primary oocyte with surrounding granulosa cells (Figs 3.5 and 3.18). The fluid that is filling the antrum is called liquor folliculi and is secreted by granulosa cells. Because of the proliferation of granulosa cells the size of the follicle increases.

- Mature/Graafian follicle: Around 7th day of sexual cycle one of the tertiary follicles increases in size in response to FSH and LH and forms the largest mature follicle that is known as "Graafian follicle" (Figs 3.5 and 3.19). Remaining follicles degenerate and become atretic.
- A fully mature Graafian follicle is about 3-5 mm in size. It reaches the periphery of the cortex and starts projecting on to the surface of the ovary. The follicular antrum is filled with fluid pushing the

Fig. 3.19: Mature graafian follicle

primary oocyte with a layer of covering cells to one side of the follicle.

- The layer of cells immediately surrounding the oocyte and zona pellucida are called corona radiata cells. The projection of granulosa cells covering the primary oocyte projecting into the follicular antrum is called cumulus oophorous. The area of attachment of primary oocyte and corona radiata to the wall of follicle is called discus proligerous.
- As the follicle expands, the stromal cells surrounding the membrana granulosa become condensed to form a covering called the theca interna (theca = cover). Theca interna increases in thickness and becomes more vascular. The cells of the theca interna later secrete a hormone called estrogen; and they are then called the cells of the thecal gland (Fig. 3.19). Outside the theca interna some fibrous tissue becomes condensed to form another covering for the follicle called the theca externa (Fig. 3.18). The ovarian follicle is now fully formed.
- The follicle gradually increases in size and finally bursts and expels the ovum. This process of shedding of the ovum is called ovulation.
- Just before ovulation the primary oocyte of mature Graafian follicle completes first meiotic division and forms secondary oocyte and first polar body.
Hormonal control of ovarian cycle and uterine cycle are represented in Figures 3.22 and 3.23.


### Ovulatory Phase

The diploid (46 chromosomes) primary oocyte in the mature Graafian follicle completes its meiosis I, forming two cells of unequal size each with haploid number of chromosomes (23). The smaller cell is called first polar body. The larger cell is called secondary oocyte and at this stage the meiosis

II begins but it is stopped in metaphase II. At this stage the mature follicle ruptures and releases the secondary oocyte.

### Ovulation

- The shedding of the ovum from the ovary is called ovulation. The ovarian follicle is at first very small compared to the thickness of the cortex of the ovary (Figs 3.5 and 3.20).
- As it enlarges the mature Graafian follicle, becomes so big that it not only reaches the surface of the ovary, but also forms a bulging in this situation. Ultimately, the follicle ruptures and the ovum are shed from the ovary (Figs 3.5 and 3.20).
- Just before ovulation the follicle may have a diameter of 15 mm . The stroma and theca on this side of the follicle become very thin. An avascular area (stigma) appears over the most convex point of the follicle. At the same time, the cells of the cumulus oophoricus become loosened by accumulation of intercellular fluid between them.
- During the ovulation process there is rupture of mature follicle and release of secondary oocyte in metaphase of 2nd meiotic division.
- At ovulation the secondary oocyte is released from the surface of the ovary into the pelvic cavity together with first polar body and corona radiata cells (Figs 3.5, 3.20 and 3.21). The ovulated oocyte with its surrounding cells swims toward the fimbrial end of fallopian tube.
- In the ampulla of fallopian tube several sperms surround the secondary oocyte with its enclosed carona radiata cells. One sperm penetrates the various barriers surrounding the secondary oocyte. This initiates resuming of meiosis II of secondary oocyte.
- Stage of meiosis at ovulation: Completion of meiosis I resulting in secondary oocyte and the first polar body.
![img-45.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-45.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 3.20A to D: Stages in the formation of corpus luteum and transformation of follicular cells to luteal cells

- Time of ovulation: 14 days $\pm 1$ day before the onset of next menstrual cycle.

Sequence of events occurring during ovulation can be summarized as follows:

- Peak levels of FSH and surge of LH bring about changes in Graafian follicle
- Increase in liquor folliculi within the follicle
- Appearance of perivitelline space
- Withdrawal of processes of follicular cells resulting in homogenous zona pellucida
- Follicular cells showing increased activity
- Mature follicle reaching surface of ovary
- Loosening of cumulus cells with accumulation of intercellular fluid and separation of cells from follicular wall
- Stigma formation-ischemia and bulging of follicular wall
- Marked thinning and separation of supporting collagen fibers and cell layers of stigma with increase in collagenolytic enzymes in liquor and stigma tissue. This results in rupture of follicle.
- Shedding of secondary oocyte with first polar body enclosed in perivitelline space and zona pellucida and surrounded by cells of corona radiate into the peritoneal cavity near the fimbriated end of fallopian tube (Fig. 3.22)
- Entry of released ovum into the fallopian tube is at its fimbriated end.
The following factors may lead to ovulation:
- Ovulation occurs due to high concentration of luteinizing hormones (LH) in blood just before ovulation (Fig. 3.22).
- A high concentration of LH leads to increase activity of the enzyme collagenase, which in turn digests the collagen fibers surrounding the follicle.
- Increase in concentration of prostaglandins causes contraction of smooth muscle in the wall of the ovary.
- The increased pressure of fluid in the follicular cavity is also a significant factor for ovulation to occur.
- However, the enzymatic digestion of the follicular wall seems to be the main factor responsible for ovulation.


### Clinical correlation

### Detection of time of ovulation:

- Basal body temperature recording (Fig. 3.22)—it falls $0.3-0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ just before ovulation and increases slightly thereafter. Time of ovulation can be determined by recording the morning temperature during mid-cycle.
- Endometrial biopsy: to observe changes specific for ovulation under the influence of progesterone
- Observation of cervical mucus: It is sticky and presents fern pattern.
- Hormonal estimation: Blood progesterone, estrogen, FSH, LH estimation during mid-cycle-Increased LH and estrogen and decreased FSH at the time of ovulation and increased progesterone after ovulation (Fig. 3.22)
- Ultrasonography: process of ovulation can be recorded. Corpus luteum detection in ovary.
- Uterine bleeding-Intermenstrual occurs.
- Vaginal smear-Increased cornification of mucosa.
- Mittleschmerz-mid-cycle pain

Conditions affecting ovulation:

- Age: Anovulatory cycles are common before puberty, initial cycles after puberty, after menopause.
- Pregnancy
- Lactation
- Diseases-nutritional, endocrine and emotional
- Environment—extremes of temperature.


### Structure of the Ovum at Ovulation

The ovum that is shed from the ovary is not fully mature. It is a secondary oocyte that is undergoing division to shed off the second polar body (Figs 3.5 and 3.21). At this stage, the ovum has the appearance illustrated in Figure 3.21. Note that it is surrounded by the zona pellucida. Some cells of the corona radiata can be seen sticking to the outside of the zona pellucida. No nucleus is seen, as the nuclear membrane has dissolved for the second meiotic division. A spindle is, however, present. Between the cell membrane (or vitelline membrane) and the zona pellucida, a distinct perivitelline space is seen. The first polar body lies in this space. Note that the ovum is a very large cell and measures more than $100-120 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter. In contrast, most other cells of the body measure less than $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}(1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ is 1,000 th of a millimeter). Differences between spermatozoon and ovum are presented in Table 3.3.
![img-46.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-46.jpeg.jpg)

### Postovulatory Phase

### Fate of the Ovum

The ovum that is shed from the ovary is closely embraced by the fimbriated end of the uterine tube. The ovum is easily carried into the tube partly by the follicular fluid discharged from the follicle and partly by the activity of ciliated cells lining the tube. The ovum slowly travels through the tube toward the uterus, taking 3-4 days to do so. If sexual
intercourse takes place at about this time, the spermatozoa deposited in the vagina swim into the uterus and into the ampulla of uterine tube. One of these spermatozoa may fertilize the ovum. If this happens, the fertilized ovum begins to develop into an embryo. The fertilized ovum travels to the uterus and gets implanted in its wall. On the other hand, if the ovum (secondary oocyte) is not fertilized it dies in 12-24 hours. It passes through the uterus into the vagina and is discharged.

### Corpus Luteum

- The corpus luteum is an important structure. It mainly secretes the hormone progesterone, but also secretes some estrogen.
- The corpus luteum is formed by enlargement and transformation of follicular cells, after-shedding of the ovum (Figs 3.5 and 3.20A).
- The corpus luteum is derived from the ovarian follicle, after the latter has ruptured to shed the ovum, as follows (Figs 3.5 and 3.20):
- When the follicle ruptures, its wall collapses and becomes folded (Figs 3.20B and C).
- At this stage, the follicular cells are small and rounded (Fig. 3.20D). They now rapidly enlarge. As they increase in size, their walls press against those of neighboring cells so that the cells acquire a polyhedral shape (Figs 3.20C and D). Their cytoplasm becomes filled with a yellow pigment called lutein. They are now called luteal cells. The presence of this yellow pigment gives the structure a yellow color and that is why it is called the corpus luteum (= yellow body). Some cells of the theca interna also enlarge and contribute to the corpus luteum by becoming paraluteal cells.
- The corpus luteum secretes progesterone (Fig. 3.23), which is essential for maintenance of pregnancy.
![img-48.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-48.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 3.23: Hormonal control of ovulation and uterine cycles

This secretion has to be poured into the blood like secretions of endocrine glands. All endocrine glands are richly supplied with blood vessels for this purpose. The ovarian follicle itself has no blood vessels, but the surrounding theca interna is full of them. When the corpus luteum is forming, blood vessels from the theca interna invade it and provide it with a rich supply of blood (Fig. 3.20C).

- The subsequent fate of the corpus luteum depends on whether the ovum is fertilized or not.
- If the ovum is not fertilized, the corpus luteum persists for about 14 days. During this period it secretes progesterone. It remains relatively small and is called the corpus luteum of menstruation. At the end of its functional life, it degenerates and forms a mass of fibrous tissue called the corpus albicans (= white body) (Figs 3.5 and 3.24).
- If the ovum is fertilized and pregnancy results, the corpus luteum persists for 3-4 months. This
![img-49.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-49.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 3.24: Fate of ovarian follicles
is larger than the corpus luteum of menstruation, and is called the corpus luteum of pregnancy.

- The corpus luteum of pregnancy may occupy one-third to half the total volume of the ovary. The progesterone secreted by it is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy in the first few months. After the 4th month, the corpus luteum is no longer needed, as the placenta begins to secrete progesterone. Degeneration of the corpus luteum in the early months of pregnancy is prevented by human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) secreted by the trophoblast cells of the developing embryo.
- The series of changes that begin with the formation of an ovarian follicle and end with the degeneration of the corpus luteum constitute what is called an ovarian cycle. An ovarian cycle has an average duration of 28 days, with ovulation occurring at midcycle, i.e. on the 14th day.


### Fate of Ovarian Follicles

We have seen that in each ovarian cycle, one follicle reaches maturity, sheds an ovum, and becomes a corpus luteum. At the same time, several other follicles also begin to develop, but do not reach maturity (Fig. 3.20). It is interesting to note that, contrary to what one might expect, these follicles do not persist into the next ovarian cycle, but undergo degeneration. The ovum and granulosa cells of each follicle disappear. The cells of the theca interna, however, proliferate to form the interstitial glands, also called the corpora atretica (singular = corpus atreticum). These glands are believed to secrete estrogens. After a period of activity, each gland becomes a mass of scar tissue indistinguishable from the corpus albicans formed from the corpus luteum.

### Ovarian Cycle and Hormones

The changes taking place during the ovarian cycle are greatly influenced by certain hormones produced by the hypophysis cerebri (Figs 3.22 and 3.23). The hormones produced by the theca interna and by the corpus luteum in turn influence other parts of the female reproductive system (notably the uterus), resulting in a cycle of changes referred to as the uterine or menstrual cycle.

### Viability of Gametes

An ovum usually degenerates 24 hours after ovulation. However, at the most it may survive for 2 days. Similarly, sperms usually degenerate 48 hours after ejaculation, but may survive up to 4 days in female genital tract.

### Clinical correlation

### Abnormalities in formation of gametes

### Abnormalities of form

Spermatozoa may be too large (giant) or too small (dwarf). The head, body or tail may be duplicated. The ovum may have an unusually large nucleus or two nuclei. Two oocytes may be seen in one follicle.

### Chromosomal abnormalities

The gametes may be abnormal in chromosomal content as follows:

-  Nondisjunction:

- During the first meiotic division, the two chromosomes of a pair, instead of separating at anaphase, may both go to the same pole. This is called nondisjunction. The resulting gamete then has 24 chromosomes instead of the normal 23 (Fig. 3.25).
- During second meiotic division also nondisjunction can take place (Fig. 3.26).
- At fertilization by this gamete, the zygote will, therefore, have 47 chromosomes; there being three identical chromosomes instead of one of the normal pairs. This is called trisomy. Depending upon the particular chromosomes involved, various trisomy abnormalities are produced.
Down's syndrome: Trisomy of chromosome 21 results in this condition. In this condition, the child has a broad face, obliquely placed palpebral fissures, epicanthus, a furrowed lower lip, and broad hands with a single transverse crease. Usually, the patients are mentally retarded and have anomalies of the heart.
- Extra sex chromosome: The presence of an extra $X$ or $Y$ chromosome can give rise to various syndromes associated with abnormal genital development, mental retardation and abnormal growth. Some of these are: $X X X$ (abnormal female); $X X Y$ (Klinefelter's syndrome: abnormal male); $X Y Y$ (abnormal male). In Klinefelter's syndrome, the subject is a male (because of the presence of a $Y$ chromosome). However, the testes are poorly developed leading to sterility and gynecomastia.
- Super females: Patients with $X X X$ chromosomes show two masses of sex chromatin in their cells and are sometimes referred to as "super females". However, there is nothing "super" about them. In fact, their bodies show poor sexual development (i.e. they are infantile), and menstruation is scanty. Mental retardation is usual.
- Monosomy: When both chromosomes of a pair go to one gamete (as described above), the other gamete resulting from the division has only 22 chromosomes (instead of the normal 23); and at fertilization, the zygote has only 45 chromosomes. Hence one pair is represented by a single chromosome. This is called monosomy (Figs 3.25 and 3.26).
- Turner's syndrome: The best known example of monosomy is a female with only one $X$ chromosome (Turner's syndrome) (Figs 3.25 and 3.26). In this syndrome, the subject is always female (because of absence of a Y chromosome). There is agenesis of ovaries. Associated deformities include mental retardation, skeletal abnormalities, and folds of skin on the sides of the neck (webbed neck).
- Such anomalies may affect more than one pair of chromosomes. Alternatively, one pair may be represented by more than three chromosomes. When this happens with the sex chromosomes, individuals with the constitution XXXY, XXXXY, XXYY, or XXXX may be produced.
- Triploidy: Sometimes, a gamete may have the diploid number of chromosomes so that the zygote will have $46+23$ (i.e. 69) chromosomes. This is called triploidy. Higher multiples of 23 may also be seen. Such fetuses are generally born dead.
- Abnormalities in the process of crossing over can result in a number of chromosomal abnormalities as follows:
- Translocation: Part of a chromosome may get attached to a chromosome of a different pair.
- Deletion: Part of a chromosome may be lost (deletion).
- Duplication of genes: The two chromosomes of a pair may break at unequal distances. When each piece joins the opposite chromosome, one chromosome is longer than normal and some of the genes are duplicated. The other chromosome will be shorter than normal, some genes being missing.
- Inversion: A piece separating from a chromosome may get inverted before joining the opposite chromosome. Although the same genes are present, their sequence is disturbed.
- Isochromosomes: We have seen that during cell division, the centromere splits longitudinally so that each chromatid becomes a separate chromosome. Sometimes, the centromere splits transversely producing two dissimilar chromosomes. One chromosome is made up of the short arms of both chromatids, while the other is made up of the long arms. These are called "isochromosomes".
- Mosaicism: Chromosomal errors of the type described above may also occur during segmentation of the ovum. This results in a fetus having a mixture of cells with normal and abnormal chromosomes. This is called mosaicism. Such individuals may also show various abnormalities.


### Gene abnormalities (gene mutations)

Genes are responsible for normal embryological development. A change in the structure of a gene may occur at the time of gametogenesis. This may give rise to birth defects. The change in the structure or function of a gene is called "gene mutation". At present, many birth defects are known which are caused by gene mutation.

## MENSTRUAL CYCLE

- Definition: The term "menstrual cycle" is applied to cyclical changes that occur in the endometrium every month (Figs 3.27 and 3.28). It is also called uterine cycle.
- Duration of blood flow: The most obvious visible feature is a monthly flow of blood (menstruation). The duration of blood flow is 3-6 days.
- Length of the cycle: The length of the cycle is usually of 28 days and can vary from 21-40 days. The 1st day of bleeding in the present cycle marks the beginning of

the menstrual cycle. Ending of the cycle is the 1st day of bleeding of the next cycle.

- Purpose: The purpose of menstrual cycle is to prepare the endometrium for reception of fertilized ovum.
The layers in the wall of uterus and the constituents of endometrium were described in the early part of this chapter and in Figures 3.6 and 3.7.
- Changes in endometrium: The main changes in the endometrium are (a) increase in thickness, (b) growth of uterine glands, (c) changes in epithelial cells lining the glands and (d) increase in thickness and fluid content of the endometrial stroma (Fig. 3.29).
- Just before onset of menstruation, the blood supply to superficial parts of the endometrium is cut off (Fig. 3.6). This part is shed off and there is bleeding. The menstrual cycle is influenced by estrogen,progesterone,FSH and LH as represented in Figures 3.22 and 3.23.

### Phases of the Menstrual Cycle 

The menstrual cycle is divided into four phases on the basis of changes taking place in the endometrium (Figs 3.28 and 3.29).

i. Postmenstrual
ii. Proliferative
iii. Secretory
iv. Menstrual

- The changes during the postmenstrual phase and during most of the proliferative phase take place under the action of estrogens produced by the developing follicles in the ovary (Figs 3.22 and 3.23). Hence, this period is referred to as the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The follicular phase constitutes the first half of the menstrual cycle.
- Following ovulation, the corpus luteum is formed and starts secreting progesterone. During the second half of the menstrual cycle, this hormone (along with estrogens) produces striking changes in the endometrium (Figs 3.22 and 3.23). As these changes take place under the influence of the corpus luteum, this half of the menstrual cycle is called the luteal phase.
- Just before the onset of the next bleeding, there is lowering of levels of both progesterone and estrogens, and it is believed that this "withdrawal" leads to the onset of menstrual bleeding (Figs 3.22 and 3.23).
The division of the menstrual cycle into the phases mentioned above is, however, arbitrary.

The changes are really continuous and may be summarized as follows:

- Increase in thickness of endometrium: The endometrium progressively increases in thickness (Figs 3.29 and 3.30). In the postmenstrual phase it is $0.5-1 \mathrm{~mm}$ thick; in the proliferative phase it is $2-3 \mathrm{~mm}$ thick; and in the secretory phase its thickness reaches $5-7 \mathrm{~mm}$.
- Increase in dimensions of uterine glands: The uterine glands grow in length. At first they are straight (Fig. 3.29A), but gradually become convoluted (Fig. 3.29B). Because of these convolutions, the glands acquire a "saw-toothed" appearance when seen in longitudinal section. The glands also increase in diameter (Fig. 3.29C). The most basal parts of uterine glands, however, remain tubular and do not undergo these changes.
- Change in epithelial lining of glands: The epithelium lining the glands is at first cuboidal (Fig. 3.29A). During the proliferative stage it becomes columnar (Fig. 3.29B). Glycogen accumulates in the basal portion of the epithelial cell, pushing the nucleus nearer the lumen (Fig. 3.29C). During the secretory phase the apical part of the cell is shed off as part of the secretion (Fig. 3.29D). The cell again becomes cubical, but the edge toward the lumen becomes irregular (Fig. 3.29D).
Postmenstrual phase: During the postmenstrual phase, the cells of the stroma are uniformly distributed and are compactly arranged (Figs 3.6 and 3.29A).
Proliferative phase: The endometrium increases in thickness, the superficial part of the stroma remains compact, but the part surrounding the bodies of the uterine glands becomes spongy. The deepest part of the stroma also remains compact (Fig. 3.29B). The arteries of the endometrium are small to begin with. They grow in length during the proliferative phase. The stroma can, therefore, be divided into the following three layers from periphery to lumen.

1. Stratum basale (SB): Thin and has a separate blood supply.
![img-54.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-54.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 3.29A to F: Changes in uterine epithelium, glands and endometrium during menstrual cycle
Abbreviations: SC, stratum compactum; SS, stratum spongiosum; SB, stratum basale

2. Stratum spongiosum (SS): Thick and edematous.
3. Stratum compactum (SC): Thin and contains compact stroma.
The stratum compactum and spongiosum together are called functional zone as these layers are sloughed off during menstruation. The basal layer is retained and is the regenerative zone from which regeneration of endometrium occurs

Secretory phase: During the secretory phase, these three layers become better defined. The endometrium becomes soft and edematous, because of the fluid secreted by the uterine glands (Figs 3.29C and D). During the secretory phase, the arteries supplying the superficial two-third of the endometrium become very tortuous, and are called spiral arteries. The arteries to the basal third of the endometrium (which does not participate in the changes associated with the menstrual cycle) remain straight and short. Towards the end of the secretory phase the endometrium is thick, soft, and richly supplied with blood. The secretory activity of the uterine glands not only makes the endometrium soft, but also provides nutrition to the embryo. These changes are, therefore, an obvious preparation for providing a suitable environment for the fertilized ovum, when it reaches the uterus.

Menstrual phase: In the absence of pregnancy, however, these measures are abortive: the superficial parts of the thickened endometrium (stratum compactum and stratum spongiosum) are shed off (Fig. 3.29E), and this is accompanied by menstrual bleeding. Menstrual bleeding causes the endometrium to be shed off bit by bit, and the blood along with shreds of endometrium flows out through the vagina. At the end of menstruation, the endometrium that remains is only 0.5 mm thick. It consists of the stratum basale along with the basal portions of the uterine glands (Fig. 3.29E). The epithelium of these glands rapidly proliferates and reforms the lining epithelium (Fig. 3.29F).

- The endometrial changes associated with the menstrual cycle are confined to the body of the uterus. The cervical mucosa is not affected.

The mechanism for onset of menstrual bleeding is as follows:

- Constriction of spiral arteries and ischemia of superficial parts of endometrium: A few hours before the onset of menstrual bleeding the spiral arteries get constricted so that blood supply to superficial parts of the endometrium is cut off. This ischemia leads to degeneration of the endometrium and also damages the walls of the blood vessels themselves.
- Relaxation of spiral arteries and leakage of blood: Subsequently when the spiral arteries relax and blood again flows into the endometrium, it leaks out through the damaged blood vessels. This leaking blood is responsible for gradual shedding of endometrium.


### Time of Ovulation in Relation to Menstruation

In a 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation takes place at about the middle of the cycle (Fig. 3.30). The period between ovulation and the next menstrual bleeding is constant at about 14 days, but the time of ovulation does not have a constant relationship with the preceding menstruation. This is so because the length of the menstrual cycle may vary from month to month in an individual. Hence, it is difficult to predict the date of the next ovulation from the date of menstruation unless the woman has very regular menstrual periods.

There are many methods of finding out the exact time of ovulation, but the one commonly used is the temperature method. In this technique, the woman's temperature is recorded every morning. When these temperatures are plotted on a graph, we get a curve like that shown in Figure 3.22. The temperature is low during actual menstruation. Subsequently it rises. At about the middle of the cycle, there is a sudden fall in temperature followed by a rise. This rise is believed to indicate that ovulation has occurred.

### Clinical correlation

Importance of determining the time of ovulation and "safe period"

- Where pregnancy is not desired: After ovulation, the ovum is viable (i.e. it can be fertilized) for not more than 2 days. Spermatozoa introduced into the vagina die within 4 days. Therefore, fertilization can occur only if intercourse takes place during a period between 4 days before ovulation to 2 days after ovulation. The remaining days have been regarded as safe period as far as prevention of pregnancy is concerned. This forms the basis of the so-called rhythm-method of family planning.
- Where pregnancy is desired: Knowledge regarding the time of ovulation is also of importance in cases of sterility (difficulty in having children), where the couple can be advised to have intercourse during the days most favorable for conception.


### Correlation between Ovarian and Uterine Cycles

The ovarian and uterine cycles run parallel to each other. Both are of 28 days duration. The uterine cycle is dependent on ovarian cycle.

The menstrual cycle is also divided into the follicular phase (in which changes are produced mainly by estrogens), and the luteal phase (in which effects of progesterone predominate) in correlation with ovarian follicular development (Fig. 3.30). The uterine cycle is dependent on ovarian cycle. The uterine endometrium shows cyclic changes, which are dependent on the hormones secreted by developing ovarian follicles and corpus luteum of the ovary.

## HORMONAL CONTROL OF OVARIAN AND UTERINE CYCLES

These cycles are under the control of various hormones, which can be briefly summarized as follows (Fig. 3.22):

- The hypothalamus acts as a major center for the control of reproduction. It secretes the gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH), which in turn controls the secretion of gonadotrophic hormones from the anterior pituitary gland (adenohypophysis).
- There are two gonadotrophic hormones. They are the FSH and the LH.
- In the first half of the menstrual cycle the GnRH acts on the anterior pituitary to release FSH. The FSH acts on the ovary and stimulates the formation and maturation of ovarian follicles (Fig. 3.22).
- The maturing ovarian follicles now start secreting estrogens. The repair and proliferation of endometrium
takes place under the influence of estrogens. The endometrial stroma progressively thickens the glands in it, elongate and the spiral arteries begin to grow toward the surface epithelium.
- The level of estrogen rises to a peak about 2 days before ovulation. This leads to sudden increase in the level of LH secreted by the anterior pituitary (LH surge) about 24-36 hours before ovulation (Fig. 3.22). The LH surge leads to ovulation; and the Graafian follicle is transformed to the corpus luteum.
- The LH stimulates the secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum. Though the secretion of progesterone predominates, some estrogen is also produced. The combined action of estrogen and progesterone stimulates the endometrial glands to secrete glycogen rich mucoid material (Fig. 3.23).
- If fertilization does not occur, the granulosa cells produce the protein inhibin, which acts on the anterior pituitary and inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins. This leads to regression of the corpus luteum.
- Due to the regression of the corpus luteum there is a fall in the blood level of estrogen and progesterone. The withdrawal of these hormones causes the endometrium to regress and triggers the onset of menstruation.
- If fertilization occurs, the corpus luteum does not regress. It continues to secrete progesterone and estrogen. The secretory phase of endometrium continues and menstruation does not occur.

### Molecular and genetic basis of gametogenesis

- During oogenesis the number of layers of granulosal cells increase leading to the formation of theca interna. The oocyte accumulates mRNA molecules that are important for embryogenesis and for formation of zona pellucida.
- Proliferation of granulosa cells is mediated by growth differentiation factor 9, a member of TGF family.


### Clinical correlation

### Use of hormones in initiation of ovulation

Women of reproductive age with anovulatory cycles require hormonal treatment for treating the inability to conceive in the absence of other reasons for infertility (inability to conceive). The ovulation is induced by human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and clomiphene that suppresses negative feedback of estrogen on adenohypophysis and stimulates release of FSH and LH that induce follicular maturation an ovulation.

### Use of hormones for contraception/suppression of ovulation

- Ovulation in a woman (and by corollary, pregnancy) can be prevented by administration of contraceptive pills. The most important ingredients of such pills are progestins (in the form of
synthetic compounds). Better results are obtained when a small amount of estrogen is also given.
- In the most common variety of pill (distributed by government agencies in India), the progestin is norethisterone acetate ( 1 mg ); and the estrogen is in the form of estradiol $(50 \mu \mathrm{~g})$. The pills are distributed in packets, each packet containing 28 pills out of which 21 pills contain these hormones, and 7 pills do not (for use in the last 7 days). The use of pills is started 5 days after onset of menstruation. They are taken continuously without any break as long as contraception is desired. Normal menstruation occurs during the 7 days in which pills without hormones are being taken. If the pills are taken regularly there is a regular menstrual cycle of 28 days duration.
- Presence of progesterone in the preovulatory phase prevents occurrence of ovulation. This is because the progesterone in the pill prevents the secretion of FSH and LH by the pituitary. This interferes with the maturation of follicles and ovulation.
- Stoppage of pills reduces levels of these hormones in blood. It is this withdrawal that leads to menstrual bleeding. Such pills have almost $100 \%$ success in suppressing maturation of follicles and ovulation.
