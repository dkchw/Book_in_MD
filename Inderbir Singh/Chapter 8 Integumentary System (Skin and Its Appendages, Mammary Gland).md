# Chapter 8 Integumentary System (Skin and Its Appendages, Mammary Gland)

## HIGHLIGHTS

- Skin is the largest organ in the body.
- The two layers of skin are (1) epidermis and (2) dermis.
- The epidermis is derived from surface ectoderm.
- The dermis is formed by mesenchyme derived from dermatomes of somites.
- Nails develop from ectoderm at the tip of each digit. Later this ectoderm migrates to the dorsal aspect.
- Hairs are derived from surface ectoderm which is modified to form hair follicles.
- Sebaceous glands (ectoderm) arise as diverticula from hair follicles.
- Sweat glands develop as downgrowths from the epidermis that are later canalized.
- Mammary glands arise from surface ectoderm. They are formed along a milk line extending from axilla to the inguinal region.


## SKIN

The skin is derived from three diverse components (Fig. 8.1), i.e. (1) surface ectoderm, (2) underlying mesoderm and (3) neural crest cells.

### Epidermis

- The epidermis is derived from the surface ectoderm. This is, at first, single layered (Fig. 8.2A).
- During 2nd month, it presents two layers, i.e. (1) a superficial layer of flat cells called periderm/epitrichium and (2) a deep layer of cuboidal cells called basal/ germinative layer (Fig. 8.2B).
- Later the cells of basal layer proliferate to form a third intermediate layer (Fig. 8.2C).
- The basal layer is known as stratum germinativum as these cells proliferate to form the various layers of epidermis.
- During 3rd to 5th month because of proliferation of cells, the epidermis becomes typical stratified squamous epithelium consisting of five layers of strata (Fig. 8.2D). They are stratum germinativum, stratum spinosum,
stratum granulosum, stratum lucidum and stratum corneum.
- Up to the end of 5th month, there will be continuous keratinization, desquamation and replacement of peridermal cells by those arising from basal layer.
- Vernix caseosa: Many of the superficial layers of epidermis are shed off. These get mixed up with secretions of sebaceous glands and hairs to form a whitish sticky substance (vernix caseosa) which covers the skin of the newborn infant (Fig. 8.2D). The vernix caseosa has a protective function as it prevents the skin from maceration by amniotic fluid.
- After 5th month, the periderm disappears as the cells are cast off and appear in amniotic fluid. In the place of periderm, the stratum corneum forms.
- Proliferation of stratum germinativum extends into the developing dermis as epidermal ridges. They appear by 11th week and become permanent by 18th week (Figs 8.2A to D).
- Finger and palm prints are grooves on the surface of palms of the hand and soles of the feet including digits that are formed by epidermal ridges. Soon, thereafter,

characteristic patterns (whorls, composite, loop and arch) are formed on the tips of fingers and toes. The patterns are genetically determined, and are different for each person. Similarly the epidermal ridges form patterns on palm and sole also (Figs 8.3A and B).

- At birth, all the layers of adult epidermis are present.


### Melanoblasts

- The melanoblasts (or dendritic cells) of the epidermis are derived from the neural crest (Fig. 8.1).
- These invade the epidermis during 3rd month. Later they invade dermoepidermal junction and become melanocytes. These cells synthesize melanin pigments responsible for skin and hair color.
- Cell bodies of melanocytes are confined to basal layers of the epidermis. Their processes extend between the epidermal cells. Melanocytes begin producing melanin before birth and distribute it to the epidermal cells.
- Cells of Merkel and Langerhans cells appear in the epidermis between 8 weeks and 12 weeks of intrauterine life.


### Dermis

- The dermis is formed by condensation and differentiation of mesenchyme underlying the surface ectoderm (Figs 8.2A to D). The three sources of origin of this mesenchyme in different parts of the body are:

- The dermatomes give rise only to the dermis on the dorsal aspect of the head and trunk.
- The dermis of the limbs and that on the lateral and ventral aspects of the trunk arises from lateral plate mesoderm.
- The dermis over most of the head and over the anterior aspect of the neck is derived from the neural crest.
- By 11th week mesenchymal cells begin to produce collagen and elastic fibers.
- The line of junction between dermis and epidermis is at first straight (Figs 8.2A and B) subsequently, during 3rd and 4th months the epidermis shows regularly

Figs 8.3A and B: Dermatoglyphics: Epidermal ridges forming (A) patterns on palm and (B) patterns on fingers-arch, loop, composite and whorl
spaced thickenings that project into the dermis (Fig. 8.2D). The portions of dermis intervening between these projections form the dermal papillae. Still later, surface elevations (epidermal ridges) are formed by further thickening of the epidermis in the same situation.

- The dermis differentiates into two layers: (1) a superficial papillary layer and (2) a deep reticular layer.


### APPENDAGES OF SKIN

The appendages of skin are associated structures that are derived from the epidermis and dermis that usually are located adjacent to the skin and serve a specific function, e.g. prevention of heat loss, sensation. These include nails, hairs and glands.

### Nails

- Nails develop from the surface ectoderm.
- The ectoderm at the tip of each digit becomes thickened at 10th week to form a primary nail field.
- Subsequently, this thickening migrates from the tip of the digit onto its dorsal aspect and is surrounded by U-shaped nail folds of epidermis (Fig. 8.4A).
- The cells in the most proximal part of the nail field proliferate to form the root of the nail. Here the cells of
![img-160.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-160.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 8.4A and B: Derivation of nail. (A) Parts of nail; (B) Developing nail root and substance

the germinal layer multiply to form a thick layer of cells called the germinal matrix (Figs 8.4A and B).

- As the cells in this matrix multiply, they are transformed into the nail substance/nail plate which corresponds to stratum lucidum of the skin (Fig. 8.4B).
- At first the stratum corneum covers the surface of the nail but later it disappears except over the proximal part of nail plate.
- The part of epidermis overlapping proximal part of nail plate is called eponychium. The epidermis below free margin of nail is called hyponychium (Fig. 8.4A).
Migration of primary nail fields from the tips of the digits to their dorsal aspect explains why the skin of the dorsal aspect of the terminal part of the digits is supplied by nerves of the ventral aspect.

### Hair

- Hair is also derived from surface ectoderm. At the site where a hair follicle is to form, the germinal layer of the epidermis proliferates to form a cylindrical mass that grows down into the dermis (Figs 8.5A and B).
- The lower end of this downgrowth becomes expanded and is invaginated by a condensation of mesoderm, which forms the papilla (Figs 8.5C and D).
- The hair itself is formed by proliferation of germinal cells overlying the papilla. As the hair grows to the surface, the cells forming the wall of the downgrowth surround it and form the epithelial root sheath (Fig. 8.5E).
- An additional dermal root sheath is formed from the surrounding mesenchymal cells (Fig. 8.5E).
![img-162.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-162.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 8.5A to E: Development of a hair follicle and sebaceous glands

- A thin band of smooth muscle (arrector pili) is formed by mesodermal cells. It gets attached to the dermal root sheath. A typical hair follicle is thus formed (Fig. 8.5E).


### Glands of Skin

The glands of skin and their functions are as follows:

- Sebaceous glands: These are located near the hair follicle. They function as waterproof for the surface for protection.
- Eccrine sweat glands: These are present in deep dermis. They are involved in maintenance of body temperature.
- Apocrine sweat glands: These are located near hair follicles in armpit, groin, around nipple. Their secretions are odor producing and sexual attractant (emotional).
- Ceruminous glands: These are present in external auditory canal and produce earwax.
- Mammary glands: These glands secrete milk after parturition.


### Sebaceous Glands

- A sebaceous gland is formed as a bud arising from ectodermal cells forming the wall of a hair follicle (epithelial root sheath; Fig. 8.5C).
- The bud grows into the adjacent dermis and divides into number of branches, the primordia of alveoli and ducts (Figs 8.5D and E).
- The central cells of alveoli degenerate and produce oily sebum that is released on to the surface of skin.
- In the glans penis and labia minora, the sebaceous glands develop independent of hair follicle from epidermis.
- The arrector pili muscle is a small bundle of smooth muscle fibers that differentiate from the mesenchyme adjacent to hair follicle and is attached to the dermal sheath of hair follicle and the papillary layer of dermis (Fig. 8.5E).

Some stages in the formation of a sebaceous gland are shown in Figures 8.5C to E.

### Sweat Glands

- There are two types of sweat glands: (1) the eccrine and (2) apocrine.
- Eccrine sweat gland develops as a downgrowth from the epidermis (Fig. 8.6A) into the underlying dermis around 20 weeks. The downgrowth is at first solid, but later canalized (Figs 8.6B and C). The lower end of the downgrowth becomes coiled (Fig. 8.6D) and forms the secretory part of the gland. The upper end is straight and forms the duct of the sweat gland that opens on to the surface of the epidermis by sweat pore. The eccrine sweat glands start functioning from the time of birth, their mechanism of secretion is merocrine and they take part in temperature control.
- Apocrine sweat glands begin to develop during puberty. They are seen in axilla, in the areolae of nipples, pubic and perineal areas. They develop from the hair follicles in the form of buds and open into the hair follicles. They are named apocrine as a part of the secretory cell is shed as secretion.


### Molecular and genetic basis of skin development

- In the presence of Wnt signaling and absence of response to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, the ectodermal cells express bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and become committed to develop into epidermis.
- The cells that are not responding to Wnt signaling may receive BMP and FGF inhibitory signals from underlying mesenchyme thus facilitating development of skin appendages.
- Pax3 genes are active in neural crest cells migration and their differentiation into melanoblasts, melanocytes and to start their function of producing melanin pigment.

### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of skin and its appendages

- Aplasia: The skin may fail to develop in certain regions.
- Dysplasia: The skin may be abnormal in structure. Numerous varieties of dysplasia are described. There may be congenital growths of the skin. Dysplasia may be part of maldevelopment of various ectodermal derivatives including hair, teeth, sweat glands and sebaceous glands.


### Pigment disorders

- Albinism: Absence of pigment in skin, hair and eyes occurs because melanocytes are unable to synthesize melanin. In this autosomal recessive genetic condition, skin is depigmented all over the body. This should be distinguished from vitiligo.
- Piebaldism: A rare autosomal dominant disorder with patchy areas of absence of hair pigment (patches of white hair on forehead-white forelock) due to disordered development of melanocytes. Mutations in CD117 gene result in this condition.
- Vitiligo: It is an autoimmune disorder that presents as patchy loss of pigment that includes skin, hair and oral mucosa (Fig. 8.7) which is not congenital. In vitiligo, the absence of pigment is patchy. In the affected areas, there is degeneration of already existing melanocytes. It is an autoimmune disease.
- Waardenburg syndrome: It is due to defects in the migration and proliferation of neural crest cells from which the melanocytes are derived. It presents white patches of skin and hair, iris of different colors and deafness (loss of pigment cells in stria vascularis of cochlea). This condition can result from mutations in Pax3 gene.


### Keratinization defect

- Ichthyosis: Hyperkeratinization of skin is a hereditary disorder of autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance.
- Harlequin fetus: A severe form of excessive keratinization that can result in an ugly appearance of fetus.


### Hair distribution abnormalities

- Congenital alopecia: Hair may be absent over the scalp. The eyebrows and eyelashes may also be absent.
- Atrichia: Absence of hair in any part of the body. It is usually associated with other ectodermal defects, e.g. in teeth and nails.
- Hypertrichosis: Overgrowth of hair either localized (in lumbar region covering spina bifida occulta) or generalized.


### Anonychia

- Nails may be absent. Occasionally they may show over development.


### Dermatoglyphics

- The epidermal ridges produce typical patterns on the fingertips, palms of the hand and soles of the feet. These are permanent identification marks of an individual. These patterns are called dermatoglyphics and have genetic basis. Study of these patterns is used in medico-legal investigation, for establishing identity of an individual and in medical genetics (Fig. 8.3). It is used as a diagnostic tool in individuals with chromosomal abnormalities (Down's syndrome) and in certain medical conditions (cancers, hypertension, mental illness, diabetes).


### Mammary Glands

- Mammary glands are modified sweat glands and are ectodermal in development.
- In some animals (e.g. bitches), a series of mammary glands are present on either side of the midline, on the ventral surface of the trunk. These are situated along a line that extends from the axilla to the inguinal region (mammary line or ridge).
- In the human embryo, these lines appear around 7th week of development extending from root of upper limb to root of lower limb (Figs 8.8A and B). The ectoderm becomes thickened along this line to form mammary ridges or lines (Figs 8.8A and B). Most of this line soon disappears except in thoracic region.
- Each mammary gland develops from a part of this line that overlies the pectoral region. In the region where the mammary gland is to form, a thickened mass of

epidermal cells is seen projecting into the dermis as primary bud (Figs 8.8 and 8.9A). From this thickened mass, 16-20 solid outgrowths arise, and grow into the underlying dermis as secondary bud (Figs 8.9B and C).

- The thickened mass of epidermis (and the outgrowths) gets canalized (Figs 8.9C and D).
- The secretory elements (alveoli) of the gland are formed by proliferation of terminal parts of the outgrowths. The proximal end of each outgrowth forms one lactiferous duct. The ducts at first open into a pit formed by cavitation of the original epithelial thickening. However, the growth of underlying mesoderm progressively pushes the wall of this pit outward, until it becomes elevated above the surface and forms the nipple by the time of birth.
- The mammary gland remains rudimentary in the male. In females, the ducts and secretory elements undergo extensive development during puberty and pregnancy.


### Clinical correlation

### Developmental anomalies of mammary gland

Amastia: The gland may be absent on one or both sides.
Athelia: The nipple may be absent.
Polythelia and polymastia: Supernumerary nipples may be present anywhere along the milk line. They may remain rudimentary (polythelia) or may form accessory mammary glands (polymastia). Accessory breasts may be found away from the milk line. They have been observed in the neck, cheeks, femoral triangle and vulva (Figs 8.8A and B).

Inverted or crater nipple: The nipple may fail to form resulting in lactiferous ducts opening into a pit. This causes difficulty in suckling. Size variations: The gland may be abnormally small (micromastia) or abnormally large (macromastia).
Gynecomastia: The male breast may enlarge as in the normal female and may even secrete milk.

## EMBRYOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR CLINICAL CONDITIONS OR ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS IN SKIN

### Case Scenario 1

An adult male attended dermatology outpatient department (OPD) with number of white patches on the front of leg (Fig. 8.7) that were increasing in number and size over the past 6 months. There is no history of trauma such as cuts, burns or ulceration. There is no history of fever or jaundice or history of use of any medicines. What is the name given to

this condition? What is the explanation for the occurrence of white patches? What are the complications of it?

- The white patches are due to the absence of melanin pigment. This condition is called vitiligo.
- Vitiligo is one of the pigmentary disorders of integumentary system. It is due to destruction of pigment forming cells the melanocytes which are derived from neural crest cells. There is history of progression in the number and area of skin patches. This condition has to be differentiated from leukoderma where white patches are present but there will be history of trauma. By asking the history the possibility of drug
induced or other causes will be excluded. In the absence of a history of trauma and other tests to rule out diabetes and hyperthyroidism, it is diagnosed as vitiligo.
- Exact cause of this condition is not known. It is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. It can be hereditary.
- Lack of melanin causes sunburns and increased risk of carcinoma of skin on prolonged exposure to sun. Some people will have lack of pigmentation of the eyes and hearing loss.
For understanding different types of pigment disorders refer to pigment disorders mentioned under clinical correlation in this chapter.
