# Chapter 7 Formation of Tissues of the Body

## HIGHLIGHTS

- The four basic tissues of the body are (1) epithelial, (2) connective, (3) muscular and (4) nervous tissues.
- Epithelia may originate from all three germ layers, i.e. (1) ectoderm, (2) endoderm and (3) mesoderm.
- Epithelia lining the external surfaces of the body, and terminal parts of passages opening to the outside are ectodermal in origin.
- Epithelium lining the gut, and of organs that develop as diverticula of the gut, is endodermal in origin.
- Epithelium lining most of the urogenital tract is derived from mesoderm. In some parts, it is endodermal in origin.
- Mesenchyme is made up of cells that can give rise to cartilage, bone, muscle, blood and connective tissues.
- Blood cells are derived from mesenchyme in bone marrow, liver and spleen. Lymphocytes are formed mainly in lymphoid tissues.
- Most bones are formed by endochondral ossification, in which a cartilaginous model is first formed and is later replaced by bone. Some bones are formed by direct ossification of membrane (intramembranous ossification).
- An area where ossification starts is called a center of ossification. In the case of long bones, the shaft (or diaphysis) is formed by extension of ossification from the primary center of ossification. Secondary centers (of variable number) appear for bone ends. The part of bone ossified from a secondary center is called an epiphysis.
- In growing bone, the diaphysis and epiphysis are separated by the epiphyseal plate (which is made up of cartilage). Growth in length of a bone takes place mainly at the epiphyseal plate.
- The portion of diaphysis adjoining the epiphyseal plate is called the metaphysis.
- Skeletal muscle is derived partly from somites and partly from mesenchyme of the region. Most smooth muscle is formed from mesenchyme related to viscera and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is formed from mesoderm related to the developing heart.
- Neurons and many neuroglial cells are formed in the neural tube. The myelin sheaths of peripheral nerves are derived from Schwann cells, while in the central nervous system they are derived from oligodendrocytes.


## INTRODUCTION

Functional differentiation of cells of germ layers and organogenesis takes place during the embryonic period. The contributions by various germ layers are:

- The ectoderm differentiates into surface ectoderm, neuroectoderm and neural crest cells (Table 7.1).
- The endoderm contributes for the formation of digestive and respiratory systems (Table 7.2).
- The intraembryonic mesoderm is divided into three parts, i.e. paraxial, intermediate and lateral plate
mesoderm. The musculoskeletal, blood vascular and parts of urinary and genital systems develop from them (Table 7.3).
The four basic tissues of the human body are derivatives of germ layers. They are as follows:

1. Epithelial tissue: Epithelium consists of cells arranged in the form of continuous sheets. Epithelia line the external and internal surfaces of the body and of body cavities.
2. Connective tissue: Connective tissue proper includes loose connective tissue, dense connective tissue and

adipose tissue. Blood, cartilage and bone are special connective tissues.
3. Muscular tissue: This is of three types: (1) skeletal, (2) cardiac and (3) smooth.
4. Nervous tissue: This tissue consists of neurons (nerve cells), nerve cell processes (axons and dendrites) and cells of neuroglia.
In the present chapter, we shall study the formation of these basic tissues.

## EPITHELIA

An epithelium may be derived from ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In general, ectoderm gives rise to epithelia covering the external surfaces of the body; and some surfaces near the exterior. Endoderm gives origin to the epithelium of most of the gut; and of structures arising as diverticula from the gut (e.g. the liver and pancreas). Mesoderm gives origin to the epithelial lining of the greater part of the urogenital tract.

### Epithelia Derived from Ectoderm

- Skin and its appendages: Epithelium of skin, hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and mammary glands.
- Special senses: Epithelium over cornea and conjunctiva, external acoustic meatus and outer surface of tympanic membrane.
- Digestive system: Epithelium of some parts of the mouth, lower part of anal canal.
- Urogenital system: Terminal part of male urethra, parts of female external genitalia.


### Epithelia Derived from Endoderm

- Digestive system: Epithelium of the entire gut except part of the mouth and anal canal (lined by ectoderm).
- Respiratory system: Epithelium of respiratory tract.
- Urogenital system: Epithelium over part of urinary bladder, urethra and vagina.
- Special senses: Epithelium of auditory tube and middle ear.


### Epithelia Derived from Mesoderm

- Blood vascular system: Endothelium lining the heart, blood vessels and lymphatics.
- Coelomic cavities: Mesothelium lining the pericardial, peritoneal and pleural cavities; and cavities of joints.
- Urogenital system: Tubules of kidneys, ureter, trigone of urinary bladder; uterine tubes, uterus, part of vagina; and testis and its duct system.


### Glands

Almost all glands, both exocrine and endocrine, develop as downgrowths (diverticulum) from the epithelial surface into the underlying tissue (Figs 7.1A and B). Later the development of these downward extensions differs in exocrine and endocrine glands.

### Exocrine Glands

- The gland may be derived from elements formed by branching of one diverticulum (e.g. parotid) or may be formed from several diverticula (e.g. lacrimal gland, prostate). The opening of the duct (or ducts) is usually situated at the site of the original outgrowth.
- The diverticula are generally solid to begin with (Fig. 7.1B) and are canalized later (Fig. 7.1C). The proximal parts of the diverticula form the duct system. The distal parts of the diverticula form the secretory elements (Fig. 7.1D).


### Endocrine Glands

- In the case of endocrine glands (e.g. thyroid, anterior part of hypophysis cerebri), the gland loses all contact with the epithelial surface by degeneration of cells connecting the secretory elements with the surface epithelium from which it takes origin (Fig. 7.1D).
- The cells of secretory portion get organized in the form of cords (pituitary) or follicles (thyroid) and are surrounded by capillaries (Fig. 7.1E).
Depending on the epithelium from which they take origin, glands may be:
- Ectodermal, e.g. sweat glands, mammary glands
- Endodermal, e.g. pancreas, liver, submandibular and sublingual salivary glands
- Mesodermal, e.g. adrenal cortex
- Mixed origin, e.g. prostate.


### Mesenchyme

- A small proportion of mesodermal cells give rise to epithelia. The remaining cells that make up the bulk of mesoderm get converted into a loose tissue called mesenchyme (Fig. 7.2).

Fig. 7.2: Mesenchymal cells. Note the delicate cytoplasmic processes joining the cells to one another

- Mesenchymal cells have the ability to form many different kinds of cells that in turn give rise to various tissues (Fig. 7.3). They are:
- Chondroblasts form cartilage
- Osteoblasts form bone
- Myoblasts form muscle
- Lymphoblasts and hemocytoblasts form various cells of blood
- Endothelial cells form blood vessels and the primitive heart tubes
- However, after all these tissues have been formed, many mesenchymal cells are still left and they give rise to cells of various types of connective tissue.


## CONNECTIVE TISSUE

As the name suggests, connective tissue serves as a connecting system binding, supporting and strengthening all other body tissues. Connective tissue consists of three components, i.e. (1) cells, (2) fibers and (3) ground substance. The fibers and ground substance are synthesized by the cells of the connective tissue.

### Formation of Loose Connective Tissue

At the site of formation of loose connective tissue, the mesenchymal cells get converted into fibroblasts. Fibroblasts secrete the ground substance and synthesize the collagen, reticular and elastic fibers. Some mesenchymal cells present in the developing connective tissue also get converted into histiocytes, mast cells, plasma cells and fat cells (Fig. 7.3).

### Formation of Blood

- Blood is a specialized fluid connective tissue, which acts as a major transport system within the body. The formation of cells of blood begins very early in embryonic life (before somites have appeared) and continues throughout life. Blood formation is especially rapid in the embryo to provide for increase in blood volume with the growth of the embryo.
- In the 3rd week of embryonic life, formation of blood vessels and blood cells is first seen in the wall of the yolk sac, around the allantoic diverticulum and in the connecting stalk (Fig. 7.4A). In these situations, clusters of mesodermal cells aggregate to form blood islands (Fig. 7.4B). These mesodermal cells are then converted to precursor cells (hemangioblasts) that give rise to blood vessels and blood cells (Fig. 7.4C). Cells, which are present in the center of the blood island, form the precursors of all blood cells (hematopoietic stem cells). Cells at the periphery of the island form the precursors of blood vessels (angioblasts; Fig. 7.4D).
- Blood cells arising in the blood islands of the yolk sac are temporary. They are soon replaced by permanent stem cells, which arise from the mesoderm surrounding the developing aorta.
- These stem cells first form colonies in the liver. In the late embryonic period, formation of blood starts in the liver, which remains an important site of blood cell formation till the 6th month of intrauterine life.
- Almost near the middle of prenatal life, definitive hematopoietic stem cells from the liver migrate to

![img-130.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-130.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 7.3: Derivatives of mesenchymal cells
colonize the bone marrow. At the time of birth, blood formation is mainly in the bone marrow. Here totipotent hemal stem cells give rise to pluripotent lymphoid stem cells and pluripotent hemal stem cells (Fig. 7.5). These stem cells form colony-forming units (CFUs).

- Cells of one particular CFU are committed to differentiate only into one line of blood cells, i.e. erythrocytes, megakaryocyte, granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages
and lymphocytes (Fig. 7.5). In the case of erythrocytes, stem cells divide so rapidly that they seem to burst. They are therefore called burst-forming units (BFUs). Their daughter cells then form CFUs.
- In the adult, main sites of blood formation are bone marrow, lymph nodes, thymus and spleen.
The precursors of various types of blood cells are generally regarded as being of mesodermal in origin.

![img-131.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-131.jpeg.jpg)

However, blood forming cells differentiating in relation to the wall of the yolk sac and probably in the liver may be endodermal in origin.

### Formation of Cartilage

- Cartilage is formed from mesenchyme. At a site where cartilage is to be formed, mesenchymal cells become closely packed. This is called a mesenchymal condensation. The mesenchymal cells then become rounded and get converted into cartilage forming cells or chondroblasts.
- Under the influence of chondroblasts, the intercellular substance of cartilage is laid down. Some chondroblasts get imprisoned within the substance of this developing cartilage and are called chondrocytes. Some fibers also develop in the intercellular substance.
- In hyaline cartilage, collagen fibers are present, but are not seen easily. In fibrocartilage, collagen fibers are numerous and very obvious. In some situations, the intercellular substance is permeated by elastic fibers, forming elastic cartilage.
- Mesenchymal cells surrounding the surface of the developing cartilage form a fibrous membrane, the perichondrium.


### Bone

To understand the formation of bone, it is necessary for students to know its normal structure. This can be read from the author's Textbook of Human Histology. Some features of bone can be seen in Figures 7.6 and 7.7

- A regular parallel arrangement of collagen sheets called lamellae are stacked one above the other in the bone (Fig. 7.6A).
- The thickness of bone depends on the number of layers stacked (Fig. 7.6B).
- The spaces between the lamellae will be occupied by the osteocytes and their processes (Fig. 7.6C).
- With the mineralization of the sheets of lamellae, the spaces occupied by the osteocytes and their processes become lacunae and canaliculi respectively (Fig. 7.6D).
- Through their processes the osteocytes of adjacent lamellae are connected to one another and also with the

![img-132.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-132.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 7.5: Scheme showing the terms applied to precursors of various blood cells
blood vessels in the bone marrow and periosteal vessels for the supply of nutrition to the developing bone cells.

- Both compact and spongy bone contain lamellar organization. In a spongy bone, trabeculae (lamellae) are seen around marrow spaces (Fig. 7.7A). In the compact bone the great majority of lamellae are arranged concentrically around longitudinal vascular channels within the bone to form cylindrical structure called Haversian system (Fig. 7.7B).


### Cells of Bone

Three main types of cells are present in bone.

1. Osteocytes are cells that are seen in mature bone.
2. Osteoblasts are bone forming cells. These cells are, therefore, seen wherever bone is being laid down. They
have abundant basophilic cytoplasm and are arranged in regular rows, looking very much like an epithelial lining (Fig. 7.8).
3. Osteoclasts are, on the other hand, responsible for bone removal. They are large multinucleated cells and are seen in regions where bone is being absorbed (Fig. 7.8).

### Formation of Bone

- All bone is of mesodermal origin. The process of bone formation is called ossification.
- There are two methods of bone formation. Both involve transformation of a pre-existing mesenchymal model of tissue into bone tissue. They are:

1. Intramembranous ossification
2. Endochondral ossification.

![img-133.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-133.jpeg.jpg)

### Intramembranous Ossification

- It is direct conversion of mesenchymal tissue into bone. In some situations (e.g. the vault of the skull), formation of bone is not preceded by formation of a cartilaginous model. Instead, bone is laid down directly in a fibrous membrane.
![img-134.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-134.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 7.8: Relationship of osteoblasts and osteoclasts to developing bone

- This is called intramembranous ossification and these bones are called membrane bones. These include the bones of the vault of the skull, the mandible and the clavicle.
- It is observed in bones of vault of skull, mandible and clavicle.
- The various steps involved in this type of bone formation are (Flowchart 7.1):

1. Mesenchymal condensation: Star-shaped mesenchymal cells of loose connective tissue aggregate in the area where bone is to be formed. The mesenchymal cells are converted to spindle-shaped cells thus forming a condensed mesenchymal tissue model (Fig. 7.9A).
2. Conversion into a fibrous membrane: Spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells differentiate into fibroblasts. Fibroblasts lay down collagen fibers converting the mesenchymal model into a fibrous model (Fig. 7.9B).
3. Osteoblast and osteoid formation: Fibroblasts get converted into osteoblasts and start laying down the early bone matrix, i.e. osteoid (uncalcified bone). It contains fibers and ground substance which are products of osteoblasts. This forms the center of ossification (Fig. 7.9C).
![img-137.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-137.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 7.9A to F: Stages in intramembranous ossification

4. Mineralization of osteoid: Secretion of alkaline phosphatase by osteoblasts and deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals of calcium converts the osteoid into calcified bone matrix. Mineralized osteoid is seen as a spicule of bone (Fig. 7.9D).
5. Conversion of osteoblast to osteocyte and formation of woven bone: The osteoblasts trapped in matrix lacunae (shell around the bone cell) become osteocytes. Processes of osteoblasts traverse through mineralized canals of calcified matrix (tunnels) called canaliculi. The collagen fiber bundles run in different directions giving the appearance of a woven bone. The spicules are irregularly arranged with spaces between them (Fig. 7.9E).
6. Progressive bone formation: Fusion of adjacent spicules forms the bone model (Fig. 7.9F).
7. Remodeling into lamellar bone: Woven bone gets transformed into lamellar bone due to resorption by osteoclasts and bone deposition by osteoblasts. This results in formation of mature compact or spongy bone.

### Endochondral Ossification

- Here mesenchymal cells differentiate into cartilage cells that are later replaced by bone. In most parts of the embryo, bone formation is preceded by the formation of a cartilaginous model that closely resembles the bone to be formed. This cartilage is subsequently replaced by (not converted into) bone.
- This kind of bone formation is called endochondral ossification. Bones formed in this way are, therefore, called cartilage bones.
- Majority of bones of the body are formed by endochondral ossification. This type of ossification is seen in all long bones except clavicle, bones of base of skull, vertebrae and ribs.
- The essential steps in the formation of bone by endochondral ossification are (Flowchart 7.2):

1. Mesenchymal condensation: At the site where the bone is to be formed, the mesenchymal cells become closely packed to form a mesenchymal condensation (Figs 7.10A and B).
2. Cartilaginous model: Some mesenchymal cells become chondroblasts and lay down hyaline cartilage (Fig. 7.10C). Mesenchymal cells on the surface of the cartilage form a membrane called the perichondrium. This membrane is vascular and contains osteogenic cells.
3. Cartilage cell hypertrophy: The cells of the cartilage are at first small and irregularly arranged. However, in the area where bone formation is to begin, the cells enlarge considerably (Fig. 7.10D).
4. Calcification of intercellular matrix: The intercellular substance between the enlarged cartilage cells becomes calcified, under the influence of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase, which is secreted by the cartilage cells. The nutrition to the cells is thus cut off and they die, leaving behind empty spaces called primary areolae (Figs 7.11A and B).

Flowchart 7.2: Endochondral ossification
![img-138.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-138.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 7.10A to D: Endochondral ossification. (A and B) Mesenchymal condensation; (C) Cartilaginous model with perichondrium; (D) Enlarged cartilage cells (ECC) at the site of bone formation

5. Vascularization of cartilaginous matrix: Some blood vessels of the perichondrium (which may be called periosteum as soon as bone is formed) now invade the calcified cartilaginous matrix. They are accompanied by osteogenic cells. This mass of vessels and cells is called the periosteal bud. It eats away much of the calcified matrix forming the walls of the primary areolae, and thus creates large cavities called secondary areolae (Fig. 7.11C).
6. Osteoid and lamella formation: The walls of the secondary areolae are formed by thin layers of calcified matrix that have not been dissolved. The osteogenic cells become osteoblasts and arrange themselves along the surfaces of these bars, or plates, of calcified cartilaginous matrix (Fig. 7.12A). These osteoblasts now lay down a layer of ossein fibrils embedded in a gelatinous intercellular matrix (Fig. 7.12B). This material is called osteoid. It is calcified and a lamellus of bone is formed (Fig. 7.12C).
7. Formation of trabeculae: The osteoblasts now lay down another layer of osteoid over the first lamellus. This is also calcified. Thus two lamellae of bone are formed. Some osteoblasts that get caught between the lamellae form osteocytes. As more lamellae are laid down, bony trabeculae are formed (Fig. 7.12D).
![img-139.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-139.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 7.11A to C: Endochondral ossification. (A and B) Formation of primary areolae; (C) Formation of secondary areolae

- The calcified matrix of cartilage only acts as a support for the developing trabeculae and is not itself converted into bone.
- At this stage, the ossifying cartilage shows a central area (1 in Fig. 7.13A) where bone has been formed. As we move away from this area we see:
- A region where the cartilaginous matrix has been calcified and surrounds dead, and dying, cartilage cells (2 in Fig. 7.13A).
- A zone of hypertrophied cartilage cells, in an uncalcified matrix (3 in Fig. 7.13A).
- A normal cartilage (4 in Fig. 7.13A) in which there is considerable mitotic activity.
- If we see the same cartilage a little latter (Fig. 7.13B), we find that ossification has now extended into zone 2, and simultaneously the matrix in zone 3 has become calcified. The deeper cells of zone 4 have meanwhile hypertrophied, while the more superficial ones have multiplied to form zone 5 .
![img-140.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-140.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 7.12A to D: Endochondral ossification. Stages in the formation of bony lamellae

In this way, formation of new cartilage keeps pace with the loss due to replacement by bone. The total effect is that the ossifying cartilage progressively increases in size.

### Development of a Typical Long Bone

The various stages in the formation of a long bone are:

1. A mesenchymal condensation is seen in the limb bud in the region where the bone is to be formed (Figs 7.14A and B).
2. This mesenchymal condensation is converted into a cartilaginous model. This model closely resembles the bone to be formed. It is covered by perichondrium that has a superficial fibrous layer and a deeper layer that has osteogenic cells (Fig. 7.14C).
3. Endochondral ossification starts in a small area of the shaft as described above. This area is called the primary center of ossification (Fig. 7.15A).
4. Gradually, bone formation extends from the primary center toward the ends of the shaft. This is accompanied by enlargement of the cartilaginous model (Fig. 7.15B).
5. Soon after the appearance of the primary center, and onset of endochondral ossification in it, the perichondrium (which may now be called periosteum) becomes active. The osteogenic cells in its deeper layer lay down bone on the surface of the cartilaginous model by intramembranous ossification. This periosteal bone completely surrounds the cartilaginous shaft and is, therefore, called the periosteal collar (Fig. 7.16A). It is first formed only around the region of the primary center but rapidly extends toward the ends of the cartilaginous model.
![img-141.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-141.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 7.13A and B: Scheme to show the growth in length of a bone
6. The periosteal collar acts as a splint, and gives strength to the cartilaginous model, at the site where it is weakened by the formation of secondary areolae. We shall see that most of the shaft of the bone is derived from this periosteal collar and is, therefore, intramembranous in origin.
7. At about the time of birth, the developing bone consists of a part called the diaphysis (or shaft) (that is bony, and has been formed by extension of the primary center of ossification); and ends that are cartilaginous (Fig. 7.16A). At varying times after birth, secondary centers of endochondral ossification appear in the cartilages forming the ends of the bone (Fig. 7.16B). These centers enlarge until the ends become bony (Fig. 7.16C). More than one secondary center of ossification may appear at either end. The portion of bone formed from one secondary center is called an epiphysis.

8. For a considerable time after birth, the bone of the diaphysis and the bone of the epiphysis are separated by a plate of cartilage called the epiphyseal cartilage, or epiphyseal plate. This is formed by cartilage into which ossification has not extended either from the diaphysis or from the epiphysis. We shall see that this plate plays a vital role in growth of the bone.

### Growth of a Long Bone

A growing bone increases both in length and in thickness.

- We have seen that the periosteum lays down a layer of bone around the shaft of the cartilaginous model. This periosteal collar gradually extends over the whole length of the diaphysis. As more layers of bone are laid down over it, the periosteal bone becomes thicker and thicker.
- However, it is neither necessary nor desirable for it to become too thick. Hence, osteoclasts come to line the internal surface of the shaft and remove bone from this aspect. As bone is laid down outside the shaft, it is removed from the inside. The shaft thus grows in diameter, and at the same time, its wall does not become too thick (Figs 7.17A to E). The osteoclasts also remove the trabeculae lying in the center of the bone that were formed by endochondral ossification. In this way, a marrow cavity is formed.
- As the shaft increases in diameter, there is a corresponding increase in the size of the marrow cavity. This cavity also extends toward the ends of the diaphysis but does not reach the epiphyseal plate. Gradually, most of the bone formed from the primary center (i.e. of endochondral origin) is removed, except near the ends, so that the wall of the shaft is made up purely of periosteal bone formed by the process of intramembranous ossification.
![img-146.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-146.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 7.17A to E: Formation of a typical long bone. Increase in thickness. Shaft is ultimately made up almost entirely of periosteal bone formed by the process of intramembranous ossification

- To understand how a bone grows in length, we will now have a closer look at the epiphyseal plate. Depending on the arrangement of its cells, three zones can be recognized (Fig. 7.18).

1. Zone of resting cartilage: Here, the cells are small and irregularly arranged.
2. Zone of proliferating cartilage: Here, the cells are larger and are undergoing repeated mitosis. As they multiply, they come to be arranged in parallel columns, separated by bars of intercellular matrix.
3. Zone of calcification: Here, the cells become still larger and the matrix becomes calcified.

- Next to the zone of calcification, there is a zone where cartilage cells are dead and the calcified matrix is being replaced by bone. Growth in length of the bone takes place by continuous transformation of the epiphyseal cartilage to bone (Figs 7.18 and 7.19) in this zone (i.e. on the diaphyseal surface of epiphyseal cartilage). At the same time, the thickness of the epiphyseal cartilage is maintained by active multiplication of cells in the zone of proliferation.
![img-147.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-147.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 7.18: Structure of epiphyseal cartilage

- When the bone has attained its full length, cells in the epiphyseal cartilage stop proliferating. The process of ossification, however, continues to extend into it until the whole of the epiphyseal plate is converted into bone. The bone of the diaphysis and epiphysis then becomes continuous. This is called fusion of epiphysis.


### Metaphysis

The portion of diaphysis adjoining the epiphyseal plate is called the metaphysis. It is a region of active bone formation and, for this reason, it is highly vascular. The metaphysis does not have a marrow cavity. Numerous muscles and ligaments are usually attached to the bone in this region. Even after bone growth has ceased, the calcium-turnover function of bone is most active in the metaphysis, which acts as a storehouse of calcium. This region is frequently the site of infection.

### Interstitial and Appositional Growth

Tissues grow by two methods. In some of them, growth takes place by multiplication of cells (or by increase in intercellular material) throughout the substance of the tissue. This is called interstitial growth. As a result, the tissue expands equally in all directions and its shape is maintained. Cartilage (and most other tissues) grows in this way. On the other hand, bone grows only by deposition of more bone on its surface, or at its ends. This is called appositional growth.

### Remodeling

We have seen above that when a tissue grows by interstitial growth it is easy for it to maintain its shape. However, this is not true of bone which can grow only by apposition. This will be clear from Figure 7.20. In this Figure, the brown line represents the shape of a bone end. The green line represents the same bone end after it has grown for some time. It will be clear that some areas of the original bone have to disappear if proper shape is to be maintained. This process of removal of unwanted bone is called remodeling.

Fig. 7.20: Remodeling of bone ends during growth

The trabeculae of spongy bone and the Haversian systems of compact bone are so arranged that they are best fitted to bear the stresses imposed on them. This arrangement can change with change in stresses acting on the bone. This process is often called internal remodeling.

### Molecular and genetic basis of bone formation

- Sex-determining region of Y (SRY) related high mobility group box transcription factors Sox9, Sox5, Sox6 regulate differentiation of chondrocytes.
- Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is needed for invasion of capillaries into the cartilage.
- Runx2 and Osterix genes control osteoblastic differentiation.
- Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) also play an important role in development of skeleton. Together they regulate the events in bone development. FGFR1 is active in osteogenic differentiation and FGFR2 in cell proliferation. Mutations in these receptors are linked to skeletal dysplasia.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of bone formation

Bone and cartilage formation may sometimes be abnormal as a result of various genetic and environmental factors. The anomalies may be localized to a particular part of the skeleton, or may be generalized. Anomalies of individual parts of the skeleton are considered in Chapter 10.
Some anomalies that affect the skeleton as a whole are as follows:

- Dyschondroplasia or enchondromatosis: Disorderly and excessive proliferation of cartilage cells in the epiphyseal plate, or the failure of normally formed cartilage to be replaced by bone, leads to the formation of irregular masses of cartilage within the metaphysis.
- Multiple exostoses or diaphyseal aclasis: Abnormal masses of bone may be formed in the region of the metaphysis and may protrude from the bone. Such a protrusion is called an exostosis. This condition may be a result of interference with the process of remodeling of bone ends.
- Osteogenesis imperfecta: Defective calcification of bone and may result in multiple fractures.
- Fibrous dysplasia: Parts of bone may be replaced by fibrous tissue.
- Osteosclerosis: Bones may show increased density. One disease characterized by increased bone density is known as osteopetrosis, or marble bone disease.
- Achondroplasia: In this condition, there is insufficient, or disorderly, formation of bone in the region of the epiphyseal cartilage. This interferes with growth of long bones. The individual does not grow in height and becomes a dwarf (Fig. 7.21). A similar condition in which the limbs are of normal length, but in which the vertebral column remains short, is called chondroosteodystrophy.
- Cleidocranial dysostosis: Anomalous bone formation may be confined to membrane bones. One such condition in which the clavicle is absent and there are deformities of the skull. On the other hand, anomalies like achondroplasia and exostoses are confined to cartilage bones.
- Generalized underdevelopment (dwarfism), or overdevelopment (gigantism) of bone may be present. Sometimes all bones of one-half of the body are affected (asymmetric development).
- Overdevelopment or underdevelopment may be localized, e.g. to a digit, or to a limb.


## MUSCULAR TISSUE

There are three different types of muscles. They are (1) skeletal, (2) cardiac and (3) smooth muscles. The primitive mesenchymal cells differentiate into spindle-shaped cells with longitudinal striations called myoblasts or premuscle cells. These cells differentiate into skeletal/cardiac/smooth muscle cells.
![img-150.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-150.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 7.21: Achondroplasia

### Skeletal Muscle

Skeletal muscle is derived from somites and also from mesenchyme of the region. The description of somites and the muscles derived from them will be discussed in Chapter 10. In this chapter, the myogenesis of skeletal muscle will be considered in brief.
Myogenesis of skeletal muscle (Flowchart 7.3; Fig. 7.22): The mesenchymal cells of myotomal origin elongate and become the myoblasts. During differentiation, the premuscle cells or myoblasts fuse end to end form and form myotubes which are multinucleated, cylindrical syncytial cells (structural syncytium). Myotubes join to form the multinucleated muscle fibers. Protein synthesis in myoblasts forms myofilaments and myofibrils. The nuclei in
a muscle fiber are pushed to the periphery and aggregations of muscle fibers are wrapped in connective tissue to form individual muscles.

### Smooth Muscle

Almost all smooth muscle is formed from mesenchyme. The origin of smooth muscle at various locations with exceptions is as follows:

- This muscle is derived from splanchnopleuric mesoderm in relation with gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and respiratory system.
- Intermediate mesoderm forms the smooth muscle in relation to urogenital system.
- In situ differentiation of general/splanchnic/somatic mesoderm forms the muscle cells in blood vessels and lymph vessels.
- The neuroectodermal optic cup forms the smooth muscles of iris.

Fig. 7.22: Myogenesis of different muscle tissues

- Exception: Arrectores pilorum of skin and myoepithelial cells of sweat glands develop from surface ectoderm.
Myogenesis of smooth muscle (Flowchart 7.3; Fig. 7.22): The mesenchymal cells of splanchnopleuric mesoderm in relation to various viscera (e.g. GIT) elongate and become the spindle-shaped cells with oval nucleus called myoblasts. During differentiation the premuscle cells or myoblasts do not fuse. Protein granules are arranged in rows. The muscle fibers are mononucleated.


### Cardiac Muscle

This is derived from splanchnopleuric mesoderm in relation to the developing heart tubes and pericardium.
Myogenesis of cardiac muscle (Flowchart 7.3; Fig. 7.22): The mesenchymal cells of splanchnopleuric mesoderm in relation to the developing heart (myoepicardial mantle) elongate and become the myoblasts. Differentiation and growth of each myoblast forms muscle fiber. The muscle fibers show elongation and branching. The cell membranes at the ends and branches of adjacent fibers adhere to form intercalated discs. Thus cardiac muscle is a functional syncytium.

## NERVOUS TISSUE

Nervous tissue consists of cells, fibers and blood vessels. Two different categories of cells are found in the nervous tissues, i.e. (1) neurons and (2) neuroglial cells. The neurons are cells that generate and conduct nerve impulses (excitable), while the neuroglial cells are supporting
(nonexcitable) structures. Each neuron has many processes. They are a single long process called axons and number of smaller processes called dendrites. The axons of several neurons collect to form nerves.

The nervous system and special sense organs are derived from specialized surface ectoderm called neuroectoderm. The neuroectoderm differentiates to form neural tube, neural crest cell and ectodermal placodes. The neuroectoderm forms the central nervous system and the neural crest cells to peripheral nervous system. The ectodermal placodes contribute for the formation of cranial sensory ganglia, inner ear and hypophysis cerebri. Neurons and neuroglia are derived from the wall of a specialized ectodermal structure called neural tube. Blood vessels of the nervous tissue are not derived from the neural tube but enter it from surrounding mesoderm.

### Formation of Neurons and Neuroglial Cells

### Histogenesis of Neural Tube

The developing neural tube presents a lumen or cavity that contains cerebrospinal fluid and a wall. Initially the all of the neural tube is lined by single layer of columnar cells. This layer proliferates to form pseudostratified neuroepithelial (germinal) layer, the cells of which extend between internal and external limiting membranes (Fig. 7.23). The pattern of formation of various cells from neuroepithelium differs before and after closure of neural tube.

- Before closure of neural tube:
- The neuroepithelial layer [Fig. 7.23(A)] forms the neurons, neuroglial cells and ependymal cells.
- DNA synthesis occurs in the cells nearer to external limiting membrane after which the nucleus migrates toward internal limiting membrane [Fig. 7.23(B)].
- These cells loose contact with external limiting membrane.
- The separated cell undergoes mitosis at this stage, and the two daughter cells lie parallel to the lumen and are near the internal limiting membrane [Fig. $7.23(\mathrm{C})]$.
- Following this the cells elongate and reach the external limiting membrane to continue DNA synthesis [Fig. 7.23(D)].
- After closure of neural tube:
- The neuroepithelial layer gives different types of cells, the neuroblasts that are not capable of DNA synthesis.
- The pattern of mitosis changes. Some of the neuroepithelial cells continue mitosis with axis parallel to internal limiting membrane. Others undergo mitosis at right angles to the internal limiting membrane [Fig. 7.23(E)] resulting in

migration of one daughter cell to be detached from the internal limiting membrane that migrates toward the external limiting membrane to become a free neuroblast [Fig. 7.23(E)].

- Because of migration of neuroblast, a mantle layer is formed in the wall of the neural tube.


### Formation of Three Layered Neural Tube

The neurons and many neuroglial cells are formed in the neural tube. These proliferate (Fig. 7.24A) to form three layers in the wall of neural tube (Fig. 7.24B).

1. Nearest to the lumen of the tube is the matrix cell layer (primitive ependymal or germinal layer). Ependymal (or neuroepithelial) cells give rise both to neuroblasts and to neuroglia. However, these two cell types are not formed simultaneously. The neuroblasts are formed first. Neuroglial cells are formed after the differentiation of neuroblasts is completed. The cells of this layer undergo mitotic division and give rise to neuroblasts first. Subsequently when the production of neuroblasts ceases they form spongioblasts followed by ependymal cells (Fig. 7.24C).
2. Next comes the mantle layer in which are seen the migrated neuroblasts that differentiate into nerve cells. After cessation of production of neuroblasts, the cells of germinal layer form spongioblasts (neuroglial cells).
3. The outermost layer, termed the marginal zone, contains no nerve cells. It consists of a reticulum formed by protoplasmic processes of developing neuroglial cells (spongioblasts). It provides a framework into which the processes (axons) of nerve cells developing in the mantle layer can grow.

### Fate of Layers of Neural Tube after Cessation of Production of Cells

After cessation of production of neuroblasts and spongioblasts, the neuroepithelial cells form the ependymal layer lining the lumen of neural tube. The mantle layer forms the gray matter of central nervous system. The marginal layer forms the white matter of the central nervous system.

### Stages in the Formation of Nerve Cells

1. Stage of apolar neuroblast: One of the germinal cells passes from the germinal layer to the mantle layer and becomes an apolar neuroblast (Fig. 7.25).
2. Stage of bipolar neuroblast: Two processes develop and convert the apolar neuroblast to a bipolar neuroblast (Fig. 7.25).
3. Stage of unipolar neuroblast: One of the processes of the neuroblast disappears, and it can now be called a unipolar neuroblast (Fig. 7.25).
![img-153.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-153.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 7.24A to C: Layers of neural tube. (A) Cavity and wall of neural tube; (B and C) Differentiation of three layers of wall and formation of nerve cells, processes and neuroglia

4. Stage of multipolar neuroblast: The process of the cell (which does not disappear) now elongates, and on the side opposite to it numerous smaller processes form. At this stage, the cell is called a multipolar neuroblast (Fig. 7.25).

- Differentiation of processes of neuroblast: The main process of the multipolar neuroblast now grows into the marginal layer, and becomes the axon of the nerve cell (Fig. 7.24B). The axon can grow to a considerable length. It may either remain within the central nervous system, or may grow out of it as an efferent nerve fiber of a peripheral nerve. At its destination, it establishes connections, either with the cell bodies and dendrites of other neurons or with an effector organ (e.g. muscle). The smaller processes of the neuroblast are the dendrites. These ramify and establish connections with other nerve cells.
- At first the cytoplasm of the nerve cell is homogeneous. Later Nissl's granules make their appearance. After their formation, neurons lose the ability to divide.
- Formation of neuroglial cells: Majority of neuroglial cells are formed from germinal cells of the ependymal layer after it ceases to produce neuroblasts. These cells (glioblasts) migrate to the mantle and marginal zones. In the mantle zone, they form medulloblasts (also called spongioblasts), which differentiate into astroblasts, and subsequently into astrocytes. There are two types of astrocytes, i.e. (1) protoplasmic and (2) fibrous. In the marginal zone the glioblasts differentiate into oligodendroblasts that become oligodendrocytes. The oligodendrocytes form myelin sheath around the axons of ascending and descending tracts. There is a third type of neuroglial cell called microglia. This type does not develop from the cells of the neural tube, but migrates

into it along with blood vessels. These cells are believed to be of mesodermal origin (Table 7.4).

### Formation of Myelin Sheath

- Nerve fibers, which remain within the brain and spinal cord, receive support from, and are ensheathed by, neuroglial cells. The nerve fibers, which leave the central nervous system to become constituents of peripheral nerves, acquire a special sheath called the neurolemma. This sheath is derived from cells of neural crest origin called Schwann cells. At a later stage of development, a large number of nerve fibers, both inside and outside the central nervous system, develop another sheath between the neurolemma and the axon. This is called the myelin sheath. The myelin sheaths of peripheral nerves are derived from the same Schwann cells that form the neurolemma. In the central nervous system, there are no Schwann cells and the myelin sheath is formed by neuroglial cells called oligodendrocytes.
- The relationship of an axon to a Schwann cell in myelinated and unmyelinated fibers is illustrated in Figure 7.26. Note the following points:


### Myelinated Nerve Fiber

- A single axon comes in contact with a single Schwann cell [Fig. 7.26(A)].

- The axon invaginates cytoplasm of a Schwann cell and thus comes to be completely surrounded by it [Fig. 7.26(B)].
- Along the line of invagination, the cell membrane of the Schwann cell becomes drawn into form a doublelayered mesentery-like membrane called the mesaxon [Fig. 7.26(C)].
- The mesaxon elongates and becomes spirally wound around the axon. Some fatty substances are deposited between adjacent layers of the mesaxon and, together with it, form the myelin sheath [Fig. 7.26(D)].


### Unmyelinated Nerve Fiber

- A number of axons come in contact with a single Schwann cell [Fig. 7.26(E)].
- They invaginate into the cytoplasm of a single Schwann cell [Fig. 7.26(F)].
- There is no elongation of the mesaxon as several axons may invaginate the same Schwann cell [Fig. 7.26(G)].
- Nerve fibers in different parts of the brain and spinal cord become myelinated at different stages of development. The process begins during the 4th month of intrauterine life, but is not completed until the child is $2-3$ years old. Nerve fibers become fully functional only after they have acquired their myelin sheaths.
- The blood vessels of the brain, and their surrounding connective tissue, are not derived from the neural tube. These are mesodermal in origin and invade the developing brain and spinal cord from the surrounding mesoderm.
- The development of the pia mater and the arachnoid mater (leptomeninges) is not definitely understood.

According to some workers, these are derived from the neural crest. The dura mater develops from the mesoderm surrounding the neural tube.
