# Chapter 13 Alimentary System-II: Gastrointestinal Tract

## HIGHLIGHTS

- Endoderm, which is at first in the form of a flat sheet, is converted into a tube by formation of head, tail and lateral folds of the embryonic disc. This tube is the gut.
- The gut consists of foregut, midgut and hindgut. The midgut is at first in wide communication with the yolk sac. Later it becomes tubular. Part of it forms a loop that is divisible into prearterial and postarterial segments.
- The most caudal part of the hindgut is the cloaca. It is partitioned to form the primitive rectum (dorsal) and the primitive urogenital sinus.
- The esophagus is derived from the foregut.
- The stomach is derived from the foregut.
- Duodenum: The superior part and the upper half of the descending part are derived from the foregut. The rest of the duodenum develops from the midgut.
- The jejunum and ileum are derived from the prearterial segment of the midgut loop.
- The postarterial segment of the midgut loop gives off a cecal bud. The cecum and appendix are formed by enlargement of this bud.
- The ascending colon develops from the postarterial segment of the midgut loop.
- After its formation, the gut undergoes rotation. As a result, the cecum and ascending colon come to lie on the right side; and the jejunum and ileum lie mainly in the left half of the abdominal cavity.


## INTRODUCTION

- With the establishment of the head and tail folds, part of the cavity of the definitive yolk sac is enclosed within the embryo to form the primitive gut (Figs 13.1A to C). The primitive gut is in free communication with the rest of the yolk sac. The part of the gut cranial to this communication is the foregut; the part caudal to the communication is the hindgut, while the intervening part is the midgut (Figs 13.1A to C). The communication between foregut and midgut is called anterior intestinal portal which is represented in the adult by the termination of bile duct in the second part of duodenum. The communication between the midgut and hindgut is called posterior intestinal portal which corresponds in the adult to the junction of right two-thirds with the left one-third of transverse colon.
- The foregut is in the head fold of the embryo. Cranially, the foregut is separated from the stomodeum by the buccopharyngeal membrane. The hindgut is in the tail fold of the embryo. Caudally, the hindgut is separated from the proctodeum by the cloacal membrane. At a later stage of development, the buccopharyngeal and cloacal membranes disappear, and the foregut and hindgut are in communication with stomodeum and proctodeum respectively (Fig. 13.1B). Thus, the gut communicates with the exterior. The midgut during early embryonic period communicates with the extraembryonic part of yolk sac via vitellointestinal duct. The vitellointestinal duct disappears by 5th week of development.
- The epithelial lining of various parts of the gastrointestinal tract is of endodermal origin. In the region of the mouth and the anal canal, however, some of the epithelium is

Figs 13.1A to C: Parts of the primitive gut
derived from the ectoderm of the stomodeum and of the proctodeum respectively.

- The gut is fixed to the ventral and dorsal body wall of the embryo by ventral and dorsal mesenteries.
- While the gut is being formed, the circulatory system of the embryo undergoes considerable development. A midline artery, the dorsal aorta, is established and comes to lie just dorsal to the gut (Figs 13.1C and 13.2). It gives off a series of branches to the gut. Those in the region of the midgut, initially, run right up to the yolk sac and are, therefore, called vitelline arteries. Subsequently, most of these ventral branches of the dorsal aorta disappear and only three of them remain; one for the foregut, one for the midgut and one for the hindgut. The artery of the abdominal part of the foregut is the celiac, that of the midgut is the superior mesenteric and that of the hindgut is the inferior mesenteric.
- The wide communication between the yolk sac and the midgut is gradually narrowed down (Fig. 13.2B) with the result the midgut becomes tubular. Thereafter, the midgut assumes the form of a loop (Fig. 13.2C). The superior mesenteric artery now runs in the mesentery of this loop to its apex. The loop can, therefore, be said to have a proximal or prearterial segment and a distal or postarterial segment. A bud (cecal bud) soon arises
from the postarterial segment very near the apex of the loop (Fig. 13.2D).
- For a number of weeks, the midgut loop comes to lie outside the abdominal cavity of the embryo. It passes through the umbilical opening into a part of the extraembryonic coelom that persists in relation to the most proximal part of the umbilical cord. The loop is subsequently withdrawn into the abdominal cavity.
- While considering the formation of the allantoic diverticulum, it was seen that the diverticulum opens into the ventral aspect of the hindgut (Figs 13.1A to C). The part of the hindgut caudal to the attachment of the allantoic diverticulum is called the cloaca. The cloaca soon shows a subdivision into a broad ventral part and a narrow dorsal part (Figs 13.3A to C). These two parts are separated from each other by the formation of the urorectal septum, which is first formed in the angle between the allantois and the cloaca (Fig. 13.4B).
- The ventral subdivision of the cloaca is now called the primitive urogenital sinus, and gives origin to some parts of the urogenital system. The dorsal part is called the primitive rectum. It forms the rectum, and part of the anal canal. The urorectal septum grows toward the cloacal membrane and eventually fuses with it (Fig. 13.4B). The cloacal membrane is now divided into a

Figs 13.3A to C: Formation of urorectal septum as seen in transverse sections. This septum divides the cloaca into the primitive urogenital sinus and the primitive rectum
ventral urogenital membrane, related to the urogenital sinus, and a dorsal anal membrane related to the rectum.

- Mesoderm around the anal membrane becomes heaped up with the result that the anal membrane comes to lie at the bottom of a pit called the anal pit, or proctodeum. The anal pit contributes to the formation of the anal canal.
- Each one of the three segments of the primitive gut is divided into two parts. The derivatives of the gut are shown in Figures 13.1 and 13.4.

- Postallantoic part: It forms a dilated endodermal cloaca which is divided by urorectal septum into a dorsal part (primitive rectum) and a ventral part (primitive urogenital sinus).
- Rectum
- Upper part of anal canal
- Parts of the urogenital system derived from the primitive urogenital sinus.
- At this stage, it might be noted that the endoderm of the foregut, midgut and hindgut gives rise only to the epithelial lining of the intestinal tract. Smooth muscle, connective tissue and peritoneum are derived from the splanchnic mesoderm (Figs 13.5 and 13.6).


### Arteries of the Gut (Figs 13.1A to C)

- The celiac artery is the artery of the foregut. It supplies the gut from the lower part of the esophagus to the middle of the duodenum.
- The superior mesenteric artery is the artery of the midgut.

(A) Embryonic disc before lateral folding; (B) The lateral edges of the disc grow in a ventral direction; (C and D) The edges pass medially to meet in the middle line. In this way, the layer of endoderm is converted into a tube which is the future gut. The ectoderm also meets in the midline and cuts off the coelom from the exterior

- The inferior mesenteric artery is the artery of the hindgut.


## DERIVATION OF INDIVIDUAL PARTS OF ALIMENTARY TRACT

### Foregut Development

### Esophagus

- The esophagus is developed from the part of the foregut between the pharynx and the stomach.
- It is at first short but elongates with the formation of the neck, with the descent of the diaphragm, and with the enlargement of the pleural cavities.
- The musculature of the esophagus is derived from mesenchyme surrounding the foregut. Around the upper two-thirds of the esophagus, the mesenchyme forms striated muscle. Around the lower one-third, the muscle formed is smooth (as over the rest of the gut).


### Stomach

- The stomach is first seen as a fusiform dilatation of the foregut just distal to the esophagus. Its dorsal border is
![img-243.jpeg](img-243.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 13.6: Derivation of the coats of the gut
attached to the posterior abdominal wall by a fold of peritoneum called the dorsal mesogastrium. Its ventral border is attached to the septum transversum by another fold of peritoneum called the ventral mesogastrium (Figs 13.7A and B; Figs 13.8 and 13.9A).

- Subsequently, the liver and the diaphragm are formed in the substance of the septum transversum (Fig. 13.9C).
- The ventral mesogastrium now passes from the stomach to the liver and from the liver to the diaphragm and anterior abdominal wall (Figs 13.7C and 13.9). The part

Figs 13.7A to C: (A) Side view of stomach showing the dorsal and ventral mesogastria; (B) Transverse section through "A" showing that the ventral mesogastrium connects the stomach to the septum transversum; (C) The most important remnant of the ventral mesogastrium is the lesser omentum. It passes from the stomach to the liver (which develops in the septum transversum). The spleen is formed in relation to the dorsal mesogastrium. Its formation divides this part of the dorsal mesogastrium into the gastrosplenic ligament and the lienorenal ligament
![img-245.jpeg](img-245.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 13.8: Changes in the position and shape of stomach

![img-246.jpeg](img-246.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 13.9A to C: Changes in the relation of vagus nerve and the mesogastrium to the developing stomach
of the ventral mesogastrium between the liver and the stomach becomes the lesser omentum, while the part between the liver and the diaphragm (and anterior abdominal wall) gives rise to the coronary and falciform ligaments.

- Similarly, the dorsal mesogastrium is divided by the development of the spleen into a part between stomach and spleen (gastrosplenic ligament) and a part between spleen and posterior abdominal wall called the lienorenal ligament (Figs 13.7C and 13.9).
- The stomach undergoes differential growth resulting in considerable alteration in its shape and orientation. The original ventral border comes to face upward and to the right and becomes the lesser curvature. The dorsal border now points downward and to the left and becomes the greater curvature. The original left surface becomes its anterior surface and the original right surface becomes the posterior surface (Fig. 13.8).
- The rotation of the stomach can be explained as follows (Figs 13.8 and 13.9):
- First rotation is $90^{\circ}$ clockwise along longitudinal axis. This changes orientation of its surfaces and change in the position of vagus nerves.
- Second rotation: It is in transverse/anteroposterior axis. This brings about changes in position of fundus and duodenum and in the position of ends of stomach.
- One surface of stomach grows faster than the other resulting in formation of greater and lesser curvatures.
- The rotation and differential growth of surfaces explains the change in relationship of right and left vagus nerves to posteroinferior and anterosuperior surfaces respectively.
- During rotation the cranial end tilts to the left and the caudal end to the right to assume the adult position.
- Rotation and disproportionate growth of the stomach alters the position of dorsal and ventral mesogastria.
- Rotation along longitudinal axis pulls dorsal mesogastrium to the left thus forming the lesser sac/ omental bursa behind the stomach. During this rotation, the ventral mesogastrium is pulled to the right (Figs 13.9B and C). With the growth of stomach, the dorsal mesogastrium lengthens and the spleen develops between the layers of dorsal mesogastrium splitting it into gastrosplenic and lienorenal ligaments.
- Due to rotation along anteroposterior axis, the dorsal mesogastrium bulges downward and continues to grow to form a double-layered greater omentum.
- The lesser omentum and falciform ligament are formed from the ventral mesogastrium (a derivative of septum transversum).


### Duodenum

- The superior (or first) part and the upper half of the descending (or second) part of the duodenum are derived from the foregut.
- The rest of the duodenum develops from the most proximal part of the midgut (Fig. 13.10A).

- The part of the gut that gives rise to the duodenum forms a loop attached to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery called mesoduodenum (Figs 13.10B and C). Later, this loop falls to the right. The mesoduodenum then fuses with the peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall with the result that most of the duodenum becomes retroperitoneal (Figs 13.11A to C).
- The mesoduodenum persists in relation to a small part of the duodenum adjacent to the pylorus. This is the part seen in radiographs as the duodenal cap.
- In keeping with its development, the proximal part of the duodenum is supplied by branches of the celiac artery, and the distal part by branches of the superior mesenteric artery.


### Midgut Development

The midgut elongates to form U-shaped intestinal loop that is suspended from the posterior abdominal wall by a short mesentery. Anteriorly, it communicates with the yolk sac by the narrow vitellointestinal duct. The superior mesenteric artery runs in the middle of midgut loop and divides it into a prearterial (cranial) and a postarterial (caudal) segment.

### Jejunum and Ileum

The jejunum and most of the ileum are derived from the prearterial segment of the midgut loop. The terminal
portion of the ileum is derived from the postarterial segment proximal to the cecal bud (Figs 13.12A and B).

### Cecum and Appendix

- The cecal bud is a diverticulum that arises from the postarterial segment of the midgut loop (Fig. 13.13). The cecum and appendix are formed by enlargement of this bud. The proximal part of the bud grows rapidly to form the cecum. Its distal part remains narrow and forms the appendix (Figs 13.14A to E).
- During greater part of fetal life, the appendix arises from the apex of the cecum (Figs 13.14A to F). Subsequently, the lateral (or right) wall of the cecum grows much more rapidly than the medial (or left) wall with the result the point of attachment of the appendix comes to lie on the medial side (Figs 13.14A to E).


### Ascending Colon

It develops from the postarterial segment of the midgut loop (Figs 13.12A and B) distal to the cecal bud.

### Hindgut Development

Refer to the description of hindgut and its subdivisions in the earlier part of this chapter and in Figures 13.4A and B. With the formation of tail fold and growth of the

(A) Part of the duodenum above the entry of the bile duct is derived from the foregut, and the part below this level is derived from the midgut; (B and C) At first the duodenum has a mesentery called the mesoduodenum. As seen in "B", this is continuous, cranially, with the dorsal mesogastrium. The mesoduodenum later disappears (Fig. 13.11)

embryo, the urorectal septum comes into contact with the cloacal membrane dividing it into the urogenital and anal membranes. Rupture of anal membrane creates anal opening for the hindgut dorsally. Rupture of urogenital membrane creates opening for the urogenital sinus ventrally. The point of contact of tip of urorectal septum and cloacal membrane becomes the perineal body.

### Transverse Colon

The right two-thirds of the transverse colon develop from the postarterial segment of the midgut loop. The left one-third arises from the hindgut. This mode of origin is reflected in its arterial supply; the right two-thirds are supplied by the superior mesenteric artery and the left one-third by the inferior mesenteric.
![img-251.jpeg](img-251.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 13.14A to E: Development of cecum and appendix. The orientation is as in Figure 13.13

### Descending Colon

The descending colon develops from the hindgut.

### Rectum

The rectum is derived from the primitive rectum, i.e. the dorsal subdivision of the cloaca. According to some authorities, the upper part of the rectum is derived from the hindgut proximal to the cloaca.

### Anal Canal

It develops from two different components one endodermal and the other ectodermal. The upper two-thirds of it is derived from endoderm of the hindgut (primitive rectum). The lower one-third is derived from the ectodermal

proctodeum or anal pit (Figs 13.15A to C). The two parts are separated by anal membrane initially. Later this membrane ruptures and the line of junction of the endodermal and ectodermal parts is represented by the anal valves (pectinate line). The blood supply of the two parts also differs. The arteries supplying the anal canal are superior rectal artery (branch of superior mesenteric artery) and the inferior rectal artery (branch of internal pudendal artery, which is a branch of internal iliac artery). The venous drainage from endodermal part (superior rectal) is into the portal vein and from the ectodermal part (inferior rectal) is into the systemic veins. The nerve supply also differs. The endodermal part is innervated by autonomic nerves and the ectodermal part by somatic nerves. There is change in lining epithelium between the two parts. Above the pectinate line, the anal canal is lined by columnar epithelium and below that by stratified squamous epithelium.

### Physiological Umbilical Hernia

During 3rd week of development, the prearterial segment of midgut loop elongates rapidly. There is rapid growth of liver during this period. Because of rapid elongation of midgut loop and rapid growth of liver and the developing mesonephric kidney, the abdominal cavity becomes too small to accommodate all the intestinal loops. The midgut loop enters the extraembryonic coelomic cavity in the umbilical cord during 6th week of development. This herniation of intestinal loop is called physiological umbilical hernia.

## ROTATION OF THE GUT

After its formation, the midgut loop lies outside the abdominal cavity of the embryo, in a part of the extraembryonic coelom that persists near the umbilicus. The loop has a prearterial, or proximal, segment and a postarterial, or distal, segment (Fig. 13.16A). Along with
growth in length the midgut loop rotates around the axis of superior mesenteric artery.

When we view the midgut loop from the ventral aspect, it makes a rotation of $270^{\circ}$ in counterclockwise direction around the axis of superior mesenteric artery. During rotation also elongation of intestinal loop and coiling of jejunum and ileum takes place. Large intestine also shows elongation but without coiling.

The total rotation of midgut can be divided into three stages of each $90^{\circ}$. A $90^{\circ}$ rotation occurs during the herniation and the remaining $180^{\circ}$ during the return of intestinal loop into the abdominal cavity.

- First stage rotation: Initially, the loop lies in the sagittal plane outside the umbilical ring. Its proximal segment is cranial and ventral to the distal segment (Fig. 13.17A). The midgut loop now undergoes rotation. This rotation plays a very important part in establishing the definitive relationships of the various parts of the intestine. The steps in rotation must, therefore, be clearly understood. Viewed from the ventral side the loop undergoes an anticlockwise rotation by $90^{\circ}$, with the result that it now lies in the horizontal plane (Figs 13.16B and 13.17B). The prearterial segment comes to lie on the right side and the postarterial segment on the left of the superior mesenteric artery which forms the axis (compare Figs 13.16A and B).
- Second stage rotation: The prearterial segment now undergoes great increase in length to form the coils of the jejunum and ileum. These loops still lie outside the abdominal cavity, to the right side of the distal limb (Fig. 13.16C). During 10th week, the herniated intestinal loops return to the abdominal cavity. The reasons for return of the loop are the regression of mesonephric kidney, reduced growth of liver and expansion of abdominal cavity. The coils of jejunum and ileum (prearterial segment) now return to the abdominal cavity. As they do so, the midgut loop undergoes a further anticlockwise rotation of $90^{\circ}$. As a result, the coils of jejunum and ileum pass behind the superior mesenteric artery into

Figs 13.17A to D: Scheme to show the orientation of the proximal and distal ends of the midgut loop at different phases of the rotation of the gut. Arrows indicate the direction of rotation. Compare with Figure 13.16

the left half of the abdominal cavity (Fig. 13.17D). The duodenum, therefore, comes to lie behind the artery and the coils of jejunum and ileum occupy the posterior and left part of the abdominal cavity.

- Third stage rotation/retraction of herniated loop: The postarterial segment of the midgut loop returns to the abdominal cavity. As it does so, it also rotates in an anticlockwise direction of $90^{\circ}$ (Fig. 13.17E). With the result, the transverse colon lies anterior to the superior mesenteric artery, and the cecum comes to lie on the right side. At this stage re-wise reading the rotation of gut with Figures 13.16 and 13.17 for understanding the orientation of various parts of gut.
- At this stage, the cecum lies just below the liver, and an ascending colon cannot be demarcated. Gradually, the cecum descends to the iliac fossa, and the ascending, transverse and descending parts of the colon become distinct.


## FIXATION OF THE GUT

- At first all parts of the small and large intestines have a mesentery by which they are suspended from the posterior abdominal wall. After the completion of rotation of the gut, the duodenum, the ascending colon, the descending colon and the rectum become retroperitoneal by fusion of their mesenteries with the posterior abdominal wall (as indicated in Figures 13.11A to C).
- The original mesentery persists as the mesentery of the small intestine, the transverse mesocolon and the pelvic mesocolon.


### Clinical correlation

### Developmental anomalies of the gut Congenital obstruction

This may be due to a variety of causes.

- Atresia: The continuity of the lumen of the gut is interfered with as follows:
- A segment of the gut may be missing (Fig. 13.18A)
- A segment of the gut may be replaced by fibrous tissue (Fig. 13.18B)
- A septum may block the lumen (Fig. 13.18C).
- Stenosis:The lumen may be abnormally narrow (Fig. 13.18D) (As a normal developmental process, there is epithelial occlusion of the lumen of gut in early stages of development. The gut later gets recanalized. Some cases of atresia, duplication and stenosis of gut may be due to abnormal recanalization).
- Nondevelopment of nerve plexuses in the wall of a part of the intestinal tract may result in difficulty in the passage of intestinal contents through the part. Such a defect in the lower part of the colon gives rise to a condition in which the colon proximal to the defective segment becomes greatly distended with its contents. This condition is called megacolon or Hirschsprung's disease (Fig. 13.19).
- Abnormal thickening of muscular wall: This is seen typically at the pyloric end of the stomach (congenital pyloric stenosis) (Fig. 13.20). The thickened muscle bulges into the lumen and narrows it. According to some authorities, the primary cause of this defect is the same as in megacolon.
- External pressure by abnormal peritoneal bands or abnormal blood vessels. Such bands are often seen in relation to the duodenum (Fig. 13.21). The duodenum may also be compressed by an annular pancreas (Fig. 13.22).
- Imperforate anus: This is caused by stenosis or atresia of the lower part of the rectum or the anal canal. Some varieties of this condition are shown in Figures 13.23 and 13.24.


### Abnormal communications or fistulae

Parts of the gut may have abnormal communications with other cavities or with the surface of the body. These are most frequently seen in relation to the esophagus and the rectum, and are usually associated with atresia of the normal passage.

- Tracheoesophageal fistula: Atresia of the esophagus is often accompanied by abnormal communications between the esophagus and trachea as illustrated in Figures 13.24A to D.
- Incomplete septation of the cloaca: The rectum may communicate with the urinary bladder, urethra, or vagina (Figs 13.25A to C, E, F and H), or may open onto the perineum at an abnormal site (Figs 13.25D and G). These conditions are associated with imperforate anus.


### Duplication

Varying lengths of the intestinal tract may be duplicated. The duplicate part may form only a small cyst, or may be of considerable length. It may or may not communicate with the rest of the intestine (Figs 13.26A and B).

### Diverticula

These may arise from any part of the gut. They are most common near the duodenum (Fig. 13.27).

### Vitellointestinal duct anomalies

- Meckel's diverticulum is a small persist part of vitellointestinal duct. It is seen along the antimesenteric border of ileum. It is seen in $2 \%$ of people and is 2 feet from ileocecal junction and 2.0 cm in length. Persistence of it is called Meckel's diverticulum or diverticulum ilei. It is of surgical importance as it may undergo inflammation giving rise to symptoms similar to those of appendicitis.
- Meckel's diverticulum is also of interest as pancreatic tissue or a gastric type of mucosa may be present in its wall (In such cases, ulceration and perforation can occur in the diverticulum).
- Occasionally, the whole of the vitellointestinal duct, or its distal part alone, may be patent. The former conditions lead to a fecal fistula at the umbilicus. The latter condition leads to formation of an umbilical sinus.
- The vitellointestinal duct may be represented by cysts (enterocystoma or vitelline cyst) or by fibrous cords (Figs 13.28A to F). Fibrous cords constitute a danger in later life as coils of intestine may get twisted round them leading to strangulation.
- Remnants of the vitellointestinal duct may also give rise to growths.

### Errors of rotation

- Nonrotation of the midgut loop: In this condition, the small intestine lies toward the right side of the abdominal cavity, and the large intestine toward the left (Fig. 13.29A).
- Reversed rotation: The transverse colon crosses behind the superior mesenteric artery, and the duodenum crosses in front of it (Fig. 13.29B).
- Nonreturn of umbilical hernia: Sometimes, the coils of intestine that develop from the midgut loop remain outside the abdominal cavity. The child is born with loops of intestine hanging out of the umbilicus. This condition is called exomphalos or omphalocele (Fig. 13.30).
- Subhepatic cecum and appendix: This results due to failure of descent of cecum. Sometimes the descent of cecum is partial. Or it can be excessive descent resulting in its positional variations.


### Congenital umbilical hernia

Loops of intestine and other abdominal contents may also be seen outside the abdominal cavity for an entirely different reason. In congenital umbilical hernia, the muscle layer and skin are absent in the region of the umbilicus, creating a defect in the abdominal

wall through which abdominal contents can pass. Such contents are covered with peritoneum, but in exomphalos they are covered only by amnion.

### Errors of fixation

- Parts of the intestine that are normally retroperitoneal may have a mesentery. Abnormal mobility of this part of the intestine may result in its twisting. This condition is called volvulus. Twisting of blood vessels to the loop can lead to obstruction of its blood supply.
- Parts of the intestines, that normally have a mesentery, may be fixed by abnormal adhesions of peritoneum.
- The cecum may remain subhepatic, or may descend only to the lumbar region. Alternatively, it may descend into the pelvis (Figs 13.31A to C).


### Situs inversus

In this condition, all abdominal and thoracic viscera are laterally transposed, i.e. all parts normally on the right side are seen on the left side, and vice versa. For example, the appendix and duodenum lie on the left side, and the stomach on the right side.

## TIME TABLE OF SOME EVENTS DESCRIBED IN THIS CHAPTER

Time table of some events described in this chapter is shown in Table 13.1.

TABLE 13.1: Time table of some developmental events

| Age | Developmental events |
| :-- | :-- |
| 16 days | Allantoic diverticulum starts appearing |
| 3 weeks | Gut begins to acquire tubular form because of <br> head and tail foldings. At the end of third week, the <br> buccopharyngeal membrane ruptures |
| 4 weeks | The fusiform shape of the stomach becomes visible |
| 5 weeks | Stomach rotates and dilates. Intestinal loop begins to <br> form. Cecal bud can be identified |
| 6 weeks | Intestinal loop is well formed. Urorectal septum starts <br> dividing the cloaca. Allantois and appendix become <br> clearly visible. Stomach completes its rotation |
| 7 weeks | Septation of cloaca into rectum and urogenital sinus <br> is completed. Intestinal loop herniates out of the <br> abdominal cavity |
| 8 weeks | Intestinal loop rotates counterclockwise |
| 9 weeks | Anal membrane breaks down |
| 3 months | Head and tail foldings are completed. Herniated coils <br> of intestine return to the abdominal cavity |

## EMBRYOLOGICAL BASIS FOR CLINICAL CONDITIONS OR ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS

### Case Scenario 1

A 30-year-old 3rd gravida with previous normal obstetric history delivered a dead female (?) fetus of 32 weeks. Gestational age; 2.6 kg weight; 20 cm crown-rump length (CRL)—with multiple congenital anomalies. Observe the Figures 13.32A and B and give your observations and embryological explanation for each.
The observations as per the Figures 13.32A and B are as follows:

- Omphalocele: Failure of fusion of four ectomesodermal folds-defect in infraumbilical part of anterior abdominal wall with abdominal organs lying outside called omphalocele. The prognosis of this condition is bad as nearly $25 \%$ of infants die before birth and $50-80 \%$ present associated anomalies and nearly $10 \%$ present chromosomal anomalies. In the present case, associated anomalies were present. In the absence of associated defects and if the omphalocele contains only a herniated bowel, it can be corrected surgically.

Figs 13.25A to H: Various types of rectal fistulae in the male (A to D) and female (E to H). The fistula may be between rectum and urinary bladder (i.e. rectovesical) as in (A) and (F), between rectum and urethra (rectourethral) as in (B) and (C), and between rectum and vagina (rectovaginal) as in (G), (H) and (F). More than one type may be present at the same time (F). The rectum may open onto the perineum at an abnormal site (D) and (E). In these cases, the anal pit is formed at the normal site

Figs 13.28A to F: Anomalies in relation to the vitellointestinal duct (see arrows). (A) Meckel's diverticulum; (B) Patent vitellointestinal duct; (C) Umbilical sinus; (D) Cyst attached to the abdominal wall. A cyst may also be seen attached to the gut, or embedded in the abdominal wall as shown in "E"; (E) Stenosis of gut at the site of attachment of duct; (F) Vitellointestinal duct represented by a fibrous cord. An umbilical growth arising from remnants of the duct is also shown

Figs 13.32A and B: A dead fetus with OEIS complex

- Abnormal closure of pelvic wall resulted in exstrophy of bladder/cloaca where the rectum and bladder will be lying outside. Absence of partitioning of endodermal cloaca and cloacal membrane resulted in this condition. Isolated bladder exstrophy can be managed by bladder reconstruction.
- Imperforate anus is due to failure of rupture of anal membrane to establish communication of anal canal to outside.
- Skeletal anomalies that were observed are curved spine called scoliosis and bilateral clubfoot.
- Neurological anomaly oflumbosacral meningocele was observed.
- Since these conditions presented multiple anomalies, it is called OEIS complex where each letter stands for a clinical condition:
- Omphalocele
- Exstrophy of bladder or cloaca
- Imperforate anus
- Skeletal anomalies.

This is a most serious form of ventral lower midline malformation with associated multisystem anomalies.
Prenatal diagnosis of this condition is by:

- Biochemical: Elevated serum alpha-fetoproteins
- Ultrasound:
- Nonvisualization of the normally filled fetal bladder
- Infraumbilical anterior abdominal wall defect, omphalocele
- Renal anomalies
- Neural tube defect—meningocele
- Increased nuchal translucency.
