# Chapter 12 Alimentary System-I: Mouth, Pharynx and Related Structures

## HIGHLIGHTS

- The oral cavity is derived partly from the stomatodeum (ectoderm) and partly from the foregut (endoderm). These two are separated by the buccopharyngeal membrane which later disappears.
- Teeth are formed in relation to the dental lamina. An enlargement of the lamina is formed for each tooth. It is called the enamel organ.
- Ameloblasts (derived from ectoderm) form the enamel.
- Odontoblasts (derived from mesoderm) form dentine.
- The pulp is formed by mesenchyme that invaginates into the enamel organ.
- Three swellings appear in the floor of the pharynx, in relation to the first pharyngeal arch. These are the right and left lingual swellings, and a median swelling the tuberculum impar. Another median swelling is formed in relation to the third and fourth arches. This is the hypobranchial eminence.
- The anterior two-thirds of the tongue is formed from the lingual swellings and the tuberculum impar.
- The posterior one-third of the tongue is formed by the cranial part of the hypobranchial eminence.
- Salivary glands develop as outgrowths of buccal epithelium.
- The pharynx is derived from the foregut.


## MOUTH

The mouth is bidermal in development. It is derived partly from the stomatodeum (ectodermal) and partly from the cranial part of the foregut (endodermal). Hence its epithelial lining is partly ectodermal and partly endodermal and the demarcation between the two is buccopharyngeal membrane. After disappearance of the buccopharyngeal membrane (4th week), both become continuous with each other and the line of junction between the ectoderm and endoderm is difficult to define.

### Primitive Oral Cavity

The stomatodeum is divided into two parts by developing primitive and definitive palate.

1. Nasal part-forms mucus lining of nasal cavity, nasal septum and palate.
2. Oral part-forms mucus lining of cheek, lips, gums and enamel of teeth.
Nasal part was described in Chapter 11: Face, Nose and Palate.

The derivatives of oral part can be subdivided into those from ectoderm and those from endoderm.

- Ectodermal developmental derivatives are the major constituents. They are:
- Epithelium lining inside of lips, cheeks and palate
- Teeth and gums.
- Endodermal derivatives are the minor constituents that contribute mainly for the floor of oral cavity. They form epithelium of:

- Tongue, floor and soft palate
- Palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal folds.


### Definitive Oral Cavity

- The epithelium lining the inside of the lips and cheeks, and the palate, is most probably ectodermal.
- The teeth and gums are also of ectodermal origin.
- The epithelium of the tongue is, however, derived from endoderm (Fig. 12.1).
- Floor of oral cavity is derived from foregut, hence endodermal.
- Alveolabial sulcus is ectodermal.
- Alveolingual sulcus is endodermal.
- Floor of mouth: In the region of the floor of the mouth, the mandibular processes take part in the formation of three structures. These are:

1. Lower lip and lower part of cheeks
2. Lower jaw
3. Tongue.

- At first these regions are not demarcated from each other (Fig. 12.2A). Soon the tongue forms a recognizable swelling, which is separated laterally from the rest of the mandibular process by the linguogingival sulcus (Fig. 12.2B) which is endodermal.
![img-226.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-226.jpeg.jpg)

- Soon, thereafter, another more laterally placed sulcus makes its appearance. This is called the labiogingival sulcus (Fig. 12.2C) which is ectodermal. This sulcus deepens rapidly and the tissues of the mandibular arch lateral to it form the lower lip (or cheek). With the deepening of these two sulci, the area lying between them becomes a raised alveolar process (Fig. 12.2D). The alveolar process is between the labiogingival and linguogingival sulci. The alveolar process forms the jaw, and the teeth develop in relation to it. The tongue, the alveolar process (or jaw) and the lips (or cheeks) are thus separated from one another (Fig. 12.3).
- Roof of mouth: The roof of the mouth is formed by the palate. The development of the palate has already been considered. The alveolar process of the upper jaw is separated from the upper lip and cheek by appearance of a labiogingival furrow, just as in the lower jaw. The medial margin of the alveolus becomes defined when the palate becomes highly arched (Fig. 12.4).
Some anomalies in the region of the mouth are described in Chapter 11.


## TEETH

- The teeth are formed in relation to the alveolar process. The epithelium overlying the convex border of this process becomes thickened and projects into the underlying mesoderm. This epithelial thickening is called the dental lamina (Figs 12.2C and D). The dental lamina is, in fact, apparent even before the alveolar process itself is defined (Fig. 12.2C).
- As the alveolar process is semicircular in outline (Fig. 12.3), the dental lamina is similarly curved (Fig. 12.5A).
- The dental lamina now shows a series of local thickenings, each of which is destined to form one milk tooth. These thickenings are called enamel organs. There are 10 such enamel organs (five on each side) in each alveolar process (Fig. 12.5B).
- The stages in the formation of an enamel organ and the development of a tooth are as follows:
- Stage of dental lamina: Ectoderm over convex upper border of alveolar process thickens and projects into underlying mesoderm as dental lamina which is U shaped and corresponds to alveolar process. As already stated each enamel organ is formed by localized proliferation of the cells of the dental lamina (Figs 12.6A and B).
- Bud stage: During this stage, ten thickening of dental lamina appears five on each side. These are called tooth buds/enamel organs.
- Cap stage: As the enamel organ grows downward into the mesenchyme (of the alveolar process)

its lower end assumes a cup-shaped appearance (Fig. 12.6C). The cup comes to be occupied by a mass of mesenchyme called the dental papilla (According to some authorities, this mesenchyme is of neural crest origin). The enamel organ and the dental papilla together constitute the tooth germ. At this stage the developing tooth looks like a cap: it is, therefore, described as the cap stage of tooth development. The cells of the enamel organ that line the papilla become columnar. These are called ameloblasts (Fig. 12.6D).

- Bell stage: Mesodermal cells of the papilla that are adjacent to the ameloblasts arrange themselves as a continuous epithelium like layer. The cells of this layer are called odontoblasts (Fig. 12.6E). The ameloblasts and odontoblasts are separated by a basement membrane. The remaining cells of the papilla from the pulp of the

tooth. The developing tooth now looks like a bell (bell stage).

- Apposition stage: Ameloblasts lay down enamel on the superficial (outer) surface of the basement membrane. The odontoblasts lay down dentine on its deeper surface. The process of laying down of enamel and of dentine is similar to that of formation of bone by osteoblasts. As layer after layer of enamel and dentine are laid down, the layer of ameloblasts and the layer of odontoblasts move away from each other (Fig. 12.7).
- After the enamel is fully formed the ameloblasts disappear leaving a thin membrane, the dental cuticle, over the enamel. The odontoblasts, however, continue to separate the dentine from the pulp throughout the life of the tooth.
- The alveolar parts of the maxillae and mandible are formed by ossification in the corresponding alveolar process. As ossification progresses, the roots of the teeth are surrounded by bone.
- The root of the tooth is established by continued growth into underlying mesenchyme. Odontoblasts in this region lay down dentine. As layers of dentine are deposited, the pulp space becomes progressively narrower and is gradually converted into a canal through which nerves and blood vessels pass into the tooth.
- In the region of the root there are no ameloblasts. The dentine is covered by mesenchymal cells that differentiate into cementoblasts. These cells lay down a layer of dense bone called the cementum. Still further to the outside, mesenchymal cells form the periodontal

ligament which connects the root to the socket in the jaw bone.

- The permanent teeth are formed as follows:
- The dental lamina gives off a series of buds, one of which lies on the medial side of each developing milk tooth (Figs 12.8 and 12.9). These buds form enamel organs exactly as described above. They give rise to the permanent incisors, canines and premolars.
- The permanent molars are formed from buds that arise from the dental lamina posterior to the region of the last milk tooth.

Fig. 12.8: Diagram of an erupting temporary tooth. Note its relationship to the jaw. Also observe germ of permanent tooth

- The dental lamina is established in the 6th week of intrauterine life. At birth the germs of all the temporary teeth, and of the permanent incisors, canines and first molars, show considerable development. The germs of the permanent premolars and of the second molars are rudimentary. The germ of the third molar is formed after birth. The developing tooth germs undergo calcification. All the temporary teeth and the permanent lower first molar begin to calcify before birth; the other permanent teeth begin to calcify at varying ages after birth.
- The eruption of a tooth is preceded by a major development of its root. The ages at which teeth erupt vary considerably. The average age of eruption of temporary tooth and permanent tooth and structural derivatives of tooth are summarized in Tables 12.1 to 12.3 respectively.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of teeth

- One or more teeth may be absent. Complete absence is called anodentia.
- Supernumerary teeth may be present.
- Individual teeth may be abnormal. They may be too large or too small. They may have supernumerary cusps or roots. Alternatively, cusps or roots may be less than normal.
- Two (or more) teeth may be fused to each other (gemination).
- The alignment of the upper and lower teeth may be incorrect (malocclusion). This may be caused by one or more of the above anomalies or by defects of the jaws.
- Eruption of teeth may be precocious (i.e. too early). Lower incisors may be present at birth.
- Eruption of teeth may be delayed. The third molar frequently fails to erupt.
- Teeth may form in abnormal situations, e.g. in the ovary or in the hypophysis cerebri.
- There may be improper formation of the enamel or dentine of the tooth.

## PHARYNX

- Floor of pharynx is formed by fusion of ventral parts of pharyngeal arches and pouches. The floor contributes for the development of tongue, thyroid gland and lower respiratory tract.
- The pharynx is derived from the cranial most part of the foregut. We have already seen that the endodermal pouches are formed in relation to the lateral wall of this part of the foregut. The floor of the foregut gives rise to a midline diverticulum from which the entire respiratory system is developed (Chapter 14: Liver and Biliary Apparatus, Pancreas and Spleen; Respiratory System; Body Cavities and Diaphragm). Most of the endodermal pouches lose contact with the pharyngeal wall. The opening of the pharyngotympanic tube represents the site of origin of the tubotympanic recess. The site of the midline respiratory diverticulum is represented by the inlet of the larynx.
- With the establishment of the palate and mouth, the pharynx shows a subdivision into nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx. The muscles forming
the wall of the pharynx are derived from the third and subsequent pharyngeal arches.


## TONGUE

- The tongue develops in relation to the pharyngeal arches (1st to 4th) in the floor of the developing mouth. It develops during 4th to 8th weeks. We have seen that each pharyngeal arch arises as a mesodermal thickening in the lateral wall of the foregut and that it grows ventrally to become continuous with the corresponding arch of the opposite side (Fig. 12.10).
- The medial most parts of the mandibular arches proliferate to form two lingual swellings (Fig. 12.11). The lingual swellings are partially separated from each other by another swelling that appears in the midline. This median swelling is called the tuberculum impar.
- Immediately behind the tuberculum impar, the epithelium proliferates to form a downgrowth (thyroglossal duct) from which the thyroid gland develops. The site of this downgrowth is subsequently marked by a depression called the foramen cecum.
- Another, midline swelling is seen in relation to the medial ends of the second, third and fourth arches. This swelling is called the hypobranchial eminence or copula of His (Fig. 12.11). The eminence soon shows a subdivision into a cranial part related to the second and third arches (called the copula) and a caudal part related to the fourth arch (Fig. 12.12A). The caudal part forms the epiglottis.
- The anterior two thirds of the tongue is formed by fusion of the tuberculum impar and the two lingual swellings. The anterior two thirds of the tongue is thus derived from the mandibular arch (Figs 12.12B and C). According to some, the tuberculum impar does not make a significant contribution to the tongue.

![img-236.jpeg](img-236.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 12.12: Scheme to show the origin of different parts of the tongue

- The posterior one-third of the tongue is formed from the cranial part of the hypobranchial eminence (copula) (Fig. 12.12). In this situation, the second arch mesoderm gets buried below the surface. The third arch mesoderm grows over it to fuse with the mesoderm of the first arch (Fig. 12.13). The posterior one-third of the tongue is thus formed by third arch mesoderm.
- The posterior most part of the tongue is derived from the fourth arch (Fig. 12.13).
- The line of junction of anterior two thirds and posterior one-third of tongue is indicated by an inverted V-shaped sulcus terminalis. In keeping with its embryological origin, the anterior two thirds of the tongue is supplied by the lingual branch of the mandibular nerve, which

![img-237.jpeg](img-237.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 12.13: Scheme to show how the second arch is buried by overgrowth of the third arch, during development of the tongue
is the posttrematic nerve of the first arch, and by the chorda tympani which is the pretrematic nerve of this arch. The posterior one-third of the tongue is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve, which is the nerve of the third arch. The most posterior part of the tongue is supplied by the superior laryngeal nerve, which is the nerve of the fourth arch.

- The components of tongue include mucous membrane, muscles and fibroareolar stroma. The mucosa of tongue is derived from endoderm of foregut.
- The musculature of the tongue is derived from the occipital myotomes. This explains its nerve supply by the hypoglossal nerve, which is the nerve of these myotomes.
- The fibroareolar stroma is derived from the pharyngeal arch mesoderm.
- The epithelium of the tongue is at first made up of a single layer of cells. Later it becomes stratified and papillae become evident. Taste buds are formed in relation to
the terminal branches of the innervating nerve fibers. The circumvallate papillae of tongue develop from the cranial part of hypobranchial eminence and migrate to the anterior aspect of sulcus terminalis. They are supplied by glossopharyngeal nerve.
- The various components of the tongue and their embryonic origin and innervation are presented in Table 12.4.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the tongue

- The tongue may be too large (macroglossia) or too small (microglossia). Very rarely the tongue may be absent (aglossia).
- The tongue may be bifid because of nonfusion of the two lingual swellings.
- The apical part of the tongue may be anchored to the floor of the mouth by an overdeveloped frenulum. This condition is called ankyloglossia or tongue-tie. It interferes with speech. Occasionally, the tongue may be adherent, to the palate (ankyloglossia superior).
- A red, rhomboid-shaped smooth zone may be present on the tongue in front of the foramen cecum. It is considered to be the result of persistence of the tuberculum impar.
- Thyroid tissue may be present in the tongue either under the mucosa or within the muscles.
- Remnants of the thyroglossal duct may form cysts at the base of the tongue.
- The surface of the tongue may show fissures.


## DERIVATIVES OF ORAL CAVITY

The derivatives of oral cavity are:

- Salivary glands-Appear as epithelial buds from oral cavity
- Parotid gland: Ectodermal
- Submandibular gland: Endodermal
- Sublingual gland: Endodermal.

- Pituitary gland-Roof of stomatodeum contributes for adenohypophysis. The development of pituitary gland is discussed in Chapter 18.


## SALIVARY GLANDS

The salivary glands develop as outgrowths of the buccal epithelium. The outgrowths are at first solid and are later canalized. They branch repeatedly to form the duct system. The terminal parts of the duct system develop into secretory acini.

As the salivary glands develop near the junctional area between the ectoderm of the stomatodeum and the endoderm of the foregut, it is difficult to determine whether they are ectodermal or endodermal.

### Parotid Gland

It is the first salivary gland to appear (early 6th week). It arises from the oral ectoderm near angle of stomatodeum. It grows outward between maxillary process and mandibular arch in the form of ectodermal cords of cells. Proximal part canalizes and forms duct that opens into the mouth. The distal part extends into the cheek mesenchyme and reaches up to the developing ear where it branches and expands to form the secreting units/alveoli of gland. Fusion of maxillary process and mandibular arch results in shifting of opening of parotid duct into the vestibule opposite upper second molar. Capsule and connective tissue is formed from the surrounding mesoderm.

### Submandibular Gland

It appears in the later part of 6th week. It appears as an endodermal bud or outgrowth in the floor of stomatodeum
at the linguogingival sulcus. Canalization of outgrowth occurs to form duct, acini and ductules. Duct opens on sublingual papilla.

### Sublingual Gland

It appears during 8th week as multiple endodermal buds from linguogingival sulcus. One or more of the salivary glands may sometimes be absent.
