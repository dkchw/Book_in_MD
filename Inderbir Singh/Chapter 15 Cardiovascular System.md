# Chapter 15 Cardiovascular System

## HIGHLIGHTS

The heart develops from splanchnopleuric mesoderm related to that part of the intraembryonic coelom that forms the pericardial cavity. This mesoderm is the cardiogenic area.

- Two endothelial heart tubes (right and left) appear and fuse to form one tube. This tube has a venous end, and an arterial end.
- A series of dilatations appear on this tube. These are (1) bulbus cordis, (2) ventricle, (3) atrium and (4) sinus venosus.
- Further subdivisions are named as follows. The bulbus cordis consists of a proximal one-third (which is dilated), a middle one-third called the conus, and a distal one-third called the truncus arteriosus. The narrow part connecting atrium and ventricle is the AV canal. The sinus venosus has right and left horns.
- The right and left atria of the heart are formed by partition of the primitive atrium. This partition is formed by the septum primum and the septum secundum. A valvular passage, the foramen ovale, is present between these two septa. It allows flow of blood from right atrium to left atrium.
- The dilated proximal one-third of the bulbus cordis, the conus, and the primitive ventricle unite to form one chamber. This is partitioned to form right and left ventricles. This partition is made up of the following: (1) Interventricular septum that grows upward from the floor of the primitive ventricle; (2) A bulbar septum that divides the conus into two parts; (3) The gap left between these two is filled by proliferation of AV cushions that are formed in the AV canal.
- The truncus arteriosus is continuous with the aortic sac. This sac has right and left horns. Each horn is continuous with six pharyngeal (or aortic) arch arteries. These arteries join the dorsal aorta (right or left). The first, second and fifth arch arteries disappear. The caudal parts of the right and left dorsal aortae fuse to form one median vessel.
- The ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk are formed from the truncus arteriosus.
- The arch of aorta is formed by the aortic sac, its left horn, and the left fourth arch artery.
- The descending aorta is formed partly from the left dorsal aorta, and partly from the fused median vessel.
- The brachiocephalic artery is formed from the right horn of the aortic sac.
- The common carotid artery is derived from part of the third arch artery.
- The pulmonary artery is derived from the sixth arch artery.
- The arteries to the gut are formed from ventral splanchnic branches of the dorsal aorta
- The renal, suprarenal and gonadal arteries are formed from lateral splanchnic branches of the dorsal aorta.
- Arteries to the body wall and limbs are derived from dorsolateral (somatic intersegmental) branches of the aorta.
- The left subclavian artery is derived from part of the seventh cervical intersegmental artery.
- The right subclavian artery is formed from seventh cervical intersegmental artery and partly from the right fourth arch artery.
- The portal vein is derived from right and left vitelline veins and anastomoses between them.
- The superior vena cava is derived from part of the right anterior cardinal vein, and from the right common cardinal vein.
- The inferior vena cava receives contributions from several veins (and anastomoses between them). These are the right posterior cardinal vein, the right subcardinal vein, the right supracardinal vein, and the right hepatocardiac channel.

## PART 1: HEART

## INTRODUCTION

Need for transport system to maintain nutrition and development of embryo: The need for a transport system for the embryo is its changing demands at different stages of development, the source and adequacy of available nutritional supply.

### Nutrition of the Embryo at Various Stages of Development

Before implantation (1st week): During the zygote and morula stage, as the conceptus is small the meagre store of deutoplasm available with the ovum provides the nutrition. During blastocyst stage, it receives nutrients by simple diffusion from the uterine gland secretions. The waste products diffuse out in the opposite direction.
During implantation (2nd week): The implanting blastocyst as it is eroding the endometrial wall there is breaking down of endometrial cells in the path of blastocyst. The breakdown products are absorbed by diffusion.
After implantation (3rd week): The nutrition is provided by establishment of uteroplacental circulation where the lacunar spaces in syncytiotrophoblast facilitate diffusion.

The transport of nutrition from 1st week to 3rd week is by an indirect method of diffusion through amnion, extraembryonic coelom, primary yolk sac and secondary yolk sac. But this nutrition is not sufficient. Because of increased functional demands of growing embryo, development of a separate blood vascular system is necessary.

## COMPONENTS OF BLOOD VASCULAR SYSTEM

- Development of separate blood vascular system starts at the beginning of the 3rd week. It is by formation of blood cells and blood vessels in the extraembryonic mesoderm of yolk sac, connecting stalk and chorion. In the intraembryonic mesoderm, they develop 2 days later.
- The internal surfaces of the heart and of all blood vessels are lined by a layer of flattened cells called endothelium. The endothelium is supported, on the outside, by varying amount of muscle, and connective tissue. All the above mentioned components of the heart and blood vessels are of mesodermal origin.


## FORMATION OF BLOOD CELLS AND VESSELS

The first blood cells are formed by induction of mesodermal cells to hemangioblasts (common precursor for blood cells and vessels). Later definitive hemopoietic stem cells develop in the bone marrow. The blood vessels develop by two processes, i.e. vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.

### Vasculogenesis (Fig. 15.1)

- It is the process of differentiation of angioblasts into endothelial cells and formation of primitive vascular network.
- It is development of vessels from the aggregations of blood cells, i.e. blood islands.
![img-330.jpeg](img-330.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 15.1: Vasculogenesis

![img-331.jpeg](img-331.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 15.2: Angiogenesis-stages in formation of blood vessels

- The mesenchymal cells differentiate into angioblast cells.
- Aggregations of angioblasts form the blood islands.
- Later, clefts appear in the blood islands.
- The clefts communicate with one another forming capillary plexus.
- Reorganization of cells in islands leads to the formation of blood cells and blood vessels.


### Angiogenesis (Fig. 15.2)

- It is the process of sprouting of new vessels from existing ones.
- Very early in the life of the embryo mesenchyme differentiates, over the yolk sac, in the connecting stalk, and in the body of the embryo itself, to form small masses of angioblastic tissue. This angioblastic tissue gives rise to endothelium and also to blood cells.
- The first blood vessels are derived from this endothelium. The vessels rapidly proliferate in number and become interconnected to form a vascular system.
- Soon thereafter, a primitive heart begins to pump blood through this network of vessels with the result that nutrition from the placenta and yolk sac can be made available to the growing embryo.
- Angiogenesis begins first in the yolk sac wall during 3rd week. Erythrocytes produced in the yolk sac have nuclei.
- Inside the embryo it begins in 5th week. Erythrocytes produced in the embryo do not have nuclei.
- Hematopoiesis inside in the embryo occurs first in the liver, then later in the spleen, thymus, and bone marrow.


### Molecular regulation of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis

Molecular regularization of vasculogenesis is by fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and vasculoendothelial growth factor (VEGF). Sprouting of new vessels from existing one is by VEGF and maturation and modeling of vasculature is by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B).

## EXTRAEMBRYONIC BLOOD VASCULAR SYSTEM

In the early part of 3rd week of development, the extraembryonic blood cells and blood vessels develop in the following regions by a process similar to the development of blood vessels in general described above.

- Wall of yolk sac
- Connecting stalk
- Chorion.

Those developing in the wall of yolk sac become the vitelline vessels. Those developing in the connecting stalk and chorion become the umbilical vessels (Fig. 15.3).

## INTRAEMBRYONIC BLOOD VASCULAR SYSTEM

In the later part of 3rd week of development, the intraembryonic blood cells and blood vessels are formed
![img-332.jpeg](img-332.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 15.3: Conceptus showing intra- and extraembryonic blood vessels

in the intraembryonic mesoderm and establish connection with the extraembryonic vessels. Before the formation of embryonic folds, two longitudinal vessels (dorsal aortae) develop in the flattened embryonic disc on either side of notochord and along the dorsal wall of yolk sac (Figs 15.3 and 15.4).

The heart (like all blood vessels) is mesodermal in origin. It is formed from splanchnopleuric mesoderm lying immediately cranial to the prochordal plate. This mesoderm constitutes the cardiogenic area. The primitive heart tubes develop in the cardiogenic area.

The heart is, therefore, the first organ of the body to start functioning. We have seen that the pericardial cavity is formed from the cranial, midline, part of the intraembryonic coelom (Figs 5.8 and 5.10). With the formation of the coelom, the intraembryonic mesoderm of the region splits into a somatopleuric layer adjoining the ectoderm (in roof of pericardial cavity), and a splanchnopleuric layer adjoining the endoderm (Fig. 5.8) and forming the floor of the pericardial cavity.

The dorsal aortae at the cephalic end of embryonic disc invade the cardiogenic area and join the primitive heart tubes. At the caudal end of the embryonic disc, the dorsal aortae extend into the connecting stalk as umbilical arteries. Some blood vessels sprout from each dorsal aorta into the yolk sac that forms the vitelline arteries (Figs 15.3 and 15.4).

The umbilical veins develop in relation to somatopleuric layer of intraembryonic coelom. The vitelline veins develop in the splanchnopleuric layer of intraembryonic coelom. Cardinal veins develop in the body wall of embryo. Umbilical and vitelline veins pass through the septum transversum and join the cranial end of each primitive heart tube. Cardinal veins also join the cranial ends of primitive heart tubes (Figs 15.3 and 15.4).

## DEVELOPMENT OF HEART

### Cardiac Progenitor Cells and Primary and Secondary Heart Fields

Cardiac progenitor cells appear at the caudal epiblast, lateral to primitive streak during 16th-18th days of development. They migrate cranially in an orderly sequence through the primitive streak into the splanchnopleuric layer of intraembryonic mesoderm where they form a horseshoeshaped primary heart field along the cranial end of embryonic disc rostral to buccopharyngeal membrane and neural folds (Fig. 15.5). A sequence specification of cardiac progenitor cells known as laterality sequencing, i.e. atria, left ventricle and part of right ventricle from lateral to medial is produced by primary heart field.

By 21st day, a secondary heart field appears in the splanchnopleuric mesoderm ventral to posterior pharynx
(space between internal nares and soft palate). Now, there is change in the laterality sequencing because of spiraling of pulmonary trunk and aorta and their exits from the chambers of heart. Now, they are arranged as part of right ventricle and the outflow tract of heart (conus cordis and truncus arteriosus).

### Cardiogenic Area

Pharyngeal endoderm underlying primary heart field induces formation of cardiogenic area where horseshoeshaped blood islands are formed by angiogenic clusters, which later get canalized to form endothelial lined heart tubes that are surrounded by myoblasts. Bilateral blood islands close to midline or paranotochordal region form the dorsal aortae.

The heart develops from angioblastic tissue that arises from this splanchnopleuric mesoderm, which is,

Fig. 15.4: Transverse section of embryonic area showing dorsal aortae, vitelline, umbilical and posterior cardinal veins
![img-334.jpeg](img-334.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 15.5: Embryonic disc showing horseshoe-shaped cardiogenic area

therefore, called the cardiogenic area. This area is between the dorsal wall of yolk sac and the floor (splanchnopleuric layer) of pericardial cavity (which is derived from part of the intraembryonic coelom). With the establishment of the head fold, the splanchnopleuric mesoderm and the developing heart come to lie dorsal to the pericardial cavity, and ventral to the foregut (Fig. 5.12).

The endothelial heart tube is derived from the splanchnopleuric mesoderm related to the pericardial cavity (Fig. 15.6A). After formation of the head fold, this tube lies dorsal to the pericardial cavity and ventral to the foregut (Fig. 15.6B). The tube invaginates into the pericardial sac on its dorsal side. As it does so, the splanchnopleuric mesoderm lining the dorsal side of the pericardial cavity proliferates to form a thick layer called the myoepicardial mantle (or epimyocardial mantle) (Figs 15.6C and D). When the invagination is complete, the myoepicardial mantle completely surrounds the heart tube. It gives rise to the cardiac muscle (myocardium) and also to the visceral layer of pericardium (epicardium). The parietal layer of pericardium is derived from somatopleuric mesoderm.

### Molecular basis for laterality sequencing

The molecular basis for laterality sequencing is the accumulation of the signaling molecules the serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)], nodal and fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) on left side and monoamine oxidase (MAO) on right side. The PITX2 is the master gene for left sidedness.

For a good understanding of the relationship between developing heart tube and the pericardial cavity, students are advised to go through the Figures 5.7 to 5.10.

The heart is at first seen in the form of right and left endothelial heart tubes (Figs 15.7A to E) that soon fuse with each other. The single tube thus formed shows a series of dilatations (Fig. 15.8). These are:

- Bulbus cordis
- Ventricle (we will refer to it as the primitive ventricle)
- Atrium (we will refer to it as the primitive atrium or atrial chamber)
- Sinus venosus.

The sinus venosus and atrium are connected by sinoatrial orifice. The atrium and ventricle are in communication through atrioventricular canal (AV canal).

The fate of the various parts of the heart tube is summarized in Figure 15.9. Cardiac septations to form definitive heart occur between 5th and 8th weeks. Simultaneous development of all the chambers takes place though they are considered separately for easy understanding.

## DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS CHAMBERS OF THE HEART

### Development of Atria

### Sinus Venosus and Its Absorption into the Right Atrium

- Parts and tributaries: This is the caudal most (venous end) part of primitive heart tube. It presents a body with two prolongations that are referred to as its right and left horns. One vitelline vein (from the yolk sac), one umbilical vein (from the placenta) and one common

cardinal vein/duct of Cuvier (from the body wall) join each horn of the sinus venosus (Fig. 15.8). Initially both the horns of sinus venosus are of equal size. Due to left to right shunts, most of the blood drains to right horn of sinus venosus.

- Communication with atrium: The sinus venosus and the primitive atrial chamber are at first connected by a wide opening. It is known as sinoatrial orifice. However, they become partially separated by grooves that appear on the lateral wall of the heart tube, at the junction of these two chambers (Figs 15.10A to E).
- Regression of left horn and its tributaries: The right groove remains shallow but the left one becomes very deep (Figs 15.11A to C) with the result that the left part of the sinus venosus becomes completely separated from the atrial chamber. Its blood now enters the atrium through the right half of the sinus. Simultaneously, the left horn of the sinus venosus and its tributaries become much reduced in size, and the left horn now appears to be just another tributary of the right half of the sinus venosus (Fig. 15.11C). The left horn becomes part of the coronary sinus (Fig. 15.12).
- Change in size and orientation of sinoatrial orifice: Initially the sinoatrial orifice is larger in size, transverse in orientation and median in position. Gradually the

Figs 15.10A to E: (A) Sinoatrial orifice in heart tube. (B to E) Changes in the sinoatrial orifice. Note that firstly, the centrally placed orifice (B) shifts to the right (C). Secondly, the orifice that is at first transversely orientated becomes vertical (D). Dotted lines in (D) indicate the outline of the opening in the previous figure to show how the change occurs. (E) The right and left venous valves guarding sinoatrial orifice
opening becomes narrow and shifts to the right and onto the dorsal aspect of primitive atrium. It changes its orientation from transverse to oval and finally to vertical with a narrow slit. The slit has right and left margins called the right and left venous valves. Cranially these two valves fuse to form a structure called the septum
spurium (Figs 15.10 and 15.13). Caudally it forms the sinus septum.

- Fate of tributaries of sinus venosus: Each common cardinal vein receives the venous blood from cranial and caudal parts of embryo through anterior and posterior cardinal veins respectively. The right common

![img-340.jpeg](img-340.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.11A to C: Retrogression of the left horn of sinus venosus
cardinal vein becomes part of the superior vena cava. The vitelline veins receive blood from the yolk sac. The right vitelline vein forms the terminal part of the inferior vena cava (Figs 15.12 and 15.14).

- Fate of right and left venous valves: The right margin of the original sinoatrial orifice (i.e. the right venous valve) expands very greatly and divides into three parts by two muscular bands, the (1) superior and (2) inferior limbic bands. The three parts of right venous valve are the (1) crista terminalis (Figs 15.12A and B), (2) valve of the inferior vena cava and (3) valve of the coronary sinus. The left venous valve gets incorporated into the development of septum secundum.
The embryonic parts and adult derivatives of sinus venosus are presented in Table 15.1.


### Atrioventricular Canal

This is the communication between common atrial chamber and ventricle.
The AV canal divides into right and left halves as follows:

- The AV canal is circular in shape initially and later becomes transverse.
- Two thickenings, the AV endocardial cushions appear on the dorsal and ventral walls of AV canal by proliferation of subendocardial mesenchymal cells around right and left AV canals.
- They grow toward each other and fuse. The fused cushions form the septum intermedium (Fig. 15.16).
- The AV endocardial cushions take part in the formation of interatrial and interventricular septa. They are involved in many congenital heart diseases.


### Formation of Interatrial Septum

The atrial chamber undergoes division into right and left halves by formation of two septa (that later fuse) (Figs 15.13 A to D ).
![img-341.jpeg](img-341.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.12A and B: Sinus venosus—Fate of right and left venous valves. The right venous valve expands greatly and forms the crista terminalis, the valve of the inferior vena cava and the valve of the coronary sinus. The left venous valve remains small and fuses with the interatrial septum. Formation of interatrial septum. Incorporation of pulmonary veins into the left atrium

Appearance of septum primum: Notching of roof and ventral wall of primitive atrium because of pressure of bulbus cordis results formation of a sickle-shaped fold from the roof and dorsal wall of primitive atrium. This fold is called septum primum. It is located exactly in the midline and is to the left of septum spurium. It grows downward toward AV canal and septum intermedium. It ultimately fuses with the septum intermedium (Fig. 15.13A).

However, note the following carefully. Throughout fetal life oxygenated blood reaches the right atrium from the placenta. This blood has to reach the left atrium, and for

TABLE 15.1: Sinus venosus—embryonic parts and adult derivatives

| Embryonic part | Change | Adult structure |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Right horn | Enlargement and incorporation into right atrium | Sinus venarum |
| Left horn and body | Reduces in size | Coronary sinus |
| Right duct of Cuvier/ common cardinal vein | - | Superior vena cava (intrapericardial part) |
| Left duct of Cuvier/ common cardinal vein | Reduction in size | Oblique vein of left atrium |
| Cross communication between right and left anterior cardinal veins | New establishment | Left brachiocephalic vein |
| Right anterior cardinal vein caudal to cross communication | - | Superior vena cava (extrapericardial part) |
| Left anterior cardinal vein caudal to cross communication | Obliteration | Left superior intercostal vein Ligament of left vena cava |
| Suprahepatic part of right vitelline vein | Common hepatic vein | Inferior vena cava (terminal part) |
| Cephalic part of right posterior cardinal vein | - | Arch of azygos vein |

this purpose a communication between right and left atria is essential.
Appearance of ostium primum: Before the septum primum reaches and fuses with the septum intermedium, blood flows through the gap between them. This gap is the foramen primum (Fig. 15.13B).
Appearance of ostium secondum: Before the foramen primum can be closed, it is essential that another path for flow of blood be created. This is achieved by breaking down of the upper part of the septum primum. The new gap is the foramen secundum. The septum primum now has a free upper edge (Fig. 15.13C).
Appearance of septum secundum: The septum secundum grows down from the roof of the atrial chamber, to the right of the septum primum. As it grows, it comes to overlap the free upper edge of the septum primum. The left venous valve and the cephalic attachment of septum primum get incorporated into the septum secondum.
Appearance of foramen ovale: Once the two septa overlap blood has to flow through the interval between the septa. This gap is the foramen ovale. It is an oblique valvular passage that allows blood to flow from right to left, but not from left to right (Fig. 15.13D). This is patent throughout

The gap between them is the foramen primum; (C) Septum primum fuses with AV cushions. At the same time, the upper part of the septum primum degenerates to form the foramen secundum. The septum secundum is formed to the right of the septum primum; (D) Septum secundum overlaps the free edge of septum primum. Blood now flows from left to right through the oblique cleft between the two septa. Incorporation of pulmonary veins into the left atrium

fetal life. The caudal end of septum secondum is sickleshaped (concave ventrocaudally).
Obliteration of foramen ovale: After birth of the baby, the left atrium starts receiving oxygenated blood from the lungs, the pressure of this chamber becomes greater than that of right atrium and there is no need for flow of blood from right atrium to left atrium. The foramen ovale is, therefore, obliterated by fusion of the septum primum and septum secundum. In terms of adult anatomy, the annulus ovalis represents the lower free edge of the septum secundum while the fossa ovalis represents the septum primum.

### Development of Right Atrium

With the understanding of the sinus venosus and its parts, partitioning of AV canal and formation of interatrial septum, the development of right atrium can be summarized.

The main right atrium is derived from three sources. They are:

1. Right half of the primitive atrium: It forms the rough trabeculated part (atrium proper) in front of crista terminalis including right auricle.
2. Absorption of right horn of sinus venosus into the right half of primitive atrium: This forms the smooth part (sinus venarum) behind crista terminalis develops from absorption of right horn of sinus venosus into the right atrium by great enlargement of the sinoatrial orifice (Figs 15.12 and 15.14).
3. Absorption of right half of $A V$ canal: Most ventral smooth part.
After absorption of the sinus venosus into the right atrium, the coronary sinus and the venae cavae are seen opening into the atrium. The expanded right venous valve that is partitioned by the two limbic bands becomes the crista terminalis, valve of Inferior vena cava and valve of coronary sinus. The left venous valve fuses with atrial septum. Note that the crista terminalis lies at the junction of the part of the right atrium derived from the sinus venosus (sinus venarum) and the atrium proper.

### Absorption of Pulmonary Veins into the Left Atrium

- At the time when the septum primum is just beginning to form, a single pulmonary vein opens into the left half of the primitive atrium (Figs 15.10A to E). When traced away from the heart (Figs 15.13 and 15), the vein divides into a right and a left branch each of which again bifurcates, to drain the corresponding lung bud.
- Gradually, the parts of the pulmonary veins nearest to the left atrium are absorbed into the atrium, with the result that four separate veins, two from each side, come to open into it (Figs 15.13 to 15).


### Development of Left Atrium

The left atrium is derived from the following three components (Figs 15.13 to 15.16):

1. Left half of the primitive atrial chamber: This contributes for the rough anterior part and left auricle.
2. Left half of the $A V$ canal: It forms the most anterior smooth part.
3. Absorbed proximal parts of the pulmonary veins: It forms the posterior smooth part between the openings of pulmonary veins that form the anterior boundary for oblique sinus of pericardium.

### Development of Ventricles

The right and left ventricles are formed by partitioning of primitive ventricle and incorporation of bulbus cordis.
![img-343.jpeg](img-343.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.14A and B: Partitioned atrial chambers and sinoatrial orifice and pulmonary veins in partitioned atria

### Bulbus Cordis

The bulbus cordis is the cranial most part (arterial end) of the developing heart tube. It is divisible into three parts, i.e. (1) proximal, (2) middle and (3) distal. The proximal one-third is dilated and does not have any special name; the middle one-third is called the conus, and the distal one-third is called the truncus arteriosus (Fig. 15.8).
![img-344.jpeg](img-344.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.15A to C: (A to C) Absorption of pulmonary veins into the left atrium. At first only one vein from the lungs enters the left atrium. The proximal part of the vein is gradually absorbed and is incorporated into the wall of the atrium. As a result of continued absorption of tributaries, four veins (two right and two left) finally open into the atrium
![img-345.jpeg](img-345.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 15.16: Division of AV canal into right and left orifices

- The proximal one-third of the bulbus cordis merges with the cavity of the primitive ventricle and forms the bulboventricular chamber. It takes part in forming the trabeculated part of the right ventricle (Figs 15.9 and 15.17).
- The middle part (conus cordis) forms the outflow part of both the ventricles. Two septa are formed in relation to the walls of this part. They are the proximal and distal bulbar septa. The proximal bulbar septum contributes for the formation of interventricular septum. The distal bulbar septum separates the conus into aortic vestibule and conus arteriosus/infundibulum (Figs 15.18A to C)
- The distal part (truncus arteriosus) undergoes division by spiral aortopulmonary septum into ascending aorta and plumonary trunk. The spiral septum is formed by union of right superior and left inferior truncus swellings or cushions. Orientation and fusion of these cushions takes place in such a manner that at its lower end, the pulmonary trunk lies ventral to the aorta, but as it is traced upward it comes to lie on its left side. This is because of the difference in the orientation of the spiral septum (Figs 15.18A to C) at different levels.
- Proximal part-coronal orientation and continuous with distal bulbar septum with the result, the pulmonary trunk is anterior and the aorta is posterior.
- Intermediate part-anteroposterior orientation with pulmonary trunk on left and aorta on right.
- Distal part-again coronal orientation with aorta anterior and pulmonary trunk posterior.
- The truncus arteriosus is continuous distally with the aortic sac. The aortic sac is continuous with right and left pharyngeal arch arteries. These arteries arch backward to become continuous with the right and left dorsal aortae.

![img-347.jpeg](img-347.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.18A to C: (A) Two parts of the ventricular chamber. Part 1 lies anterior to the atrioventricular orifice. Part 2 is conical and lies higher up; (B) This is a section across the ventricle in the plane XY, shown in (A). Sections in the plane indicated by the arrow in (A) are shown in Figure 15.19; (C) Aorticopulmonary/ spiral septum

From Figures 15.18A to C, note that the bulboventricular cavity consists of:

- A dilated lower part (1, in figure) that communicates with the atria; and
- A conical upper part (2, in figure) communicating with the truncus arteriosus.
- Part " 1 " is derived from the proximal one-third of the bulbus cordis and the primitive ventricle, while part " 2 " is from the conus.


### Formation of Interventricular Septum

The ventricular cavity formed after the conus and proximal one-third of bulbus cordis has merged into the primitive ventricle and has to be subdivided into right and left halves in such a way that each half communicates with the corresponding atrium.

The right ventricle opens into the pulmonary trunk and the left ventricle into the aorta. This subdivision takes place as follows by the formation of interventricular septum.

The interventricular septum consists of three parts that develop from different sources. They are (1) muscular, (2) bulbar and (3) membranous parts.
Muscular part: A septum, called the interventricular septum, grows upward from the floor of the bulboventricular cavity and divides the lower dilated part of this cavity into right and left halves (Fig. 15.19A). Passive dilatation of bulboventricular cavities on either side of the septum and hemodynamic forces are responsible for its formation. It meets the fused AV cushions (septum intermedium) and partially fuses with them (Figs 15.19A to D and 15.20A and B). On the external surface of the heart, the site of formation of the interventricular septum corresponds to the bulboventricular sulcus (Fig. 15.23A). The cephalic margin of septum is free, concave and twisted. It presents a dorsal and a ventral horn. The dorsal horn fuses with right edge of dorsal AV cushion and the ventral horn fuses with the left edge of ventral AV cushion. An interventricular foramen appears between the two ventricles at the upper margin of interventricular septum. The closure interventricular foramen is facilitated by septum intermedium and proximal bulbar septum (Figs 15.20A and B).
Bulbar part: Two ridges, termed the right and left bulbar ridges, arise in the wall of the bulboventricular cavity (in the part derived from the conus). The right ridge arises from the dorsal and right wall and is cephalic to right AV orifice. The left ridge arises from the ventral and left wall. These ridges grow toward each other and fuse to form a bulbar septum (Figs 15.19A and B, and Fig. 15.20). The right ridge is in line with the dorsal horn and the left ridge with the ventral horn of muscular part of AV septum. Fusion of right and left bulbar ridges forms the proximal bulbar septum. The bulbar septum grows downward toward the muscular part of interventricular septum but does not quite reach it, with the result that a gap is still left between the two.
Membranous part: The gap between the upper edge of the interventricular septum, and the lower edge of the bulbar septum, is filled by proliferation of tissue from the right side of the AV cushions (Figs 15.19 and 15.20) and the right and left bulbar ridges. The membranous part of the interventricular septum is divisible into an anterior part, which separates the right and left ventricles, and a posterior part which separates the left ventricle from the right atrium (also called $A V$ septum). The anterior part is derived from the proliferation of tissue from the endocardial cushions as described above. The derivation of the posterior part is shown in Figures 15.21A and B. It will be seen that the interatrial and interventricular septa do not meet the

Figs 15.21A and B: In Figure (A) note that the interatrial and interventricular septa do not meet the atrioventricular (AV) cushions in the same plane. In Figure (B) note that the membranous part of the interventricular septum is made up of the original. AV cushion between the attachment of the interatrial and interventricular septa, and of the endocardial proliferation from these cushions. The first part separates the left ventricle from the right atrium while the second part separates the two ventricles. The tricuspid valve is attached to the membranous septum at the junction of these parts. These figures are sections in the plane indicated by an arrow in Figure 15.18A

AV cushions in the same line. As a result, a part of these cushions separates the left ventricle from the right atrium. This part of the AV cushions forms the posterior part of the membranous septum.

The interventricular septum is probably formed more by downward enlargement of the right and left ventricular cavities on either side of the septum, rather than by active growth of the septum itself.

### Right and Left Ventricles

They are formed by:

- The inflow (rough) parts of both ventricles are formed by corresponding parts of primitive ventricle.
- The outflow parts (smooth parts), i.e. infundibulum of right ventricle and aortic vestibule of left ventricle are formed by the middle one-third of the bulbus cordis only, i.e. the conus. The conus forms the outflow tracts (smooth parts) of both the right and left ventricles.


## EXTERIOR OF THE HEART

- The heart tube is, for some time, is placed longitudinally and suspended from the dorsal wall of the pericardial cavity by two layers of pericardium that constitute the dorsal mesocardium (Fig. 15.22A).
- This mesocardium soon disappears and the heart tube lies free within the pericardial sac, suspended by its two ends (Figs 22B and C).
- However, at this stage, the caudal part of the heart tube (atrium, sinus venosus) is embedded within the substance of the septum transversum.
- The part of the heart tube lying within the pericardial cavity is thus made up of bulbus cordis and ventricle. This part of the tube grows rapidly and, therefore, becomes folded on itself to form a "U"-shaped bulboventricular loop (Fig. 15.22C). Now, the primitive atrium is to the left and dorsal to primitive ventricle.
- Subsequently, as the atrium and sinus venosus are freed from the septum transversum, they come to lie behind and above the ventricle, and the heart tube is now "S"-shaped (Fig. 15.22D).
- At this stage, the bulbus cordis, and ventricle, are separated by a deep bulboventricular sulcus (Figs 15.22D and 23). This sulcus gradually becomes shallower so that the conus, the proximal part of the bulbus cordis, and the ventricle, come to form one chamber (Figs 15.23A to C), which communicates with the truncus arteriosus.
- The atrial chamber which lies behind the upper part of the ventricle, and of the truncus arteriosus, expands; and as it does so parts of it come to project forward on either side of the truncus. The sinus venosus moves away from the septum transversum and occupies a position dorsal to primitive atrium. As a result of these changes, the exterior of the heart assumes its definitive shape (Figs 15.24A to D).


## VALVES OF THE HEART

- The mitral and tricuspid valves are formed by proliferation of connective tissue under the endocardium of the left and right AV canals.
- The pulmonary and aortic valves are derived from endocardial cushions that are formed at the junction

Figs 15.23A to C: (A to C) Scheme to show incorporation of conus (and proximal dilated part of bulbus cordis) into the ventricle by disappearance of the bulboventricular sulcus. Note that the opening of atrium into ventricle gradually shifts to the center of the posterior wall of the common bulboventricular chamber. The part labeled "conus" includes the dilated part of the bulbus cordis
of the truncus arteriosus and the conus. Two cushions, right and left, appear in the wall of the conus. They grow and fuse with each other (Figs 15.25A to D).

- With the separation of the aortic and pulmonary openings, the right and left cushions are each subdivided into two parts, one part going to each orifice (Figs 15.25A to D).
- Simultaneously, two more cushions, anterior and posterior appear.
- As a result, the aortic and pulmonary openings each have three cushions, from which three cusps of the corresponding valve develop.
- The pulmonary valve is at first ventral to the aortic valve (Figs 15.25A to D).
- Subsequently, there is a rotation so that the pulmonary valve comes to lie ventral and to the left of the aortic valve (Figs 15.25A to D).
- It is only after this rotation that the cusps acquire their definitive relationships (pulmonary trunk: 1 posterior, 2 anterior; aorta: 1 anterior, 2 posterior).


## CONDUCTING SYSTEM OF THE HEART

- At the stage when there are two heart tubes, a pacemaker (which later forms the sinoatrial node) lies in the caudal part of the left tube.
- After fusion of the two tubes, it lies in the sinus venosus.
- When the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium, it comes to lie near the opening of the superior vena cava.
- The AV node and the AV bundle form in the left wall of the sinus venosus, and in the AV canal.
- After the sinus venosus is absorbed into the right atrium, the AV node comes to lie near the interatrial septum.


## PERICARDIAL CAVITY

We have already noted several important facts about the development of the pericardial cavity, and these may be briefly recapitulated as follows:
![img-353.jpeg](img-353.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.24A to D: (A to D) Stages in establishment of external form of the heart

- The pericardial cavity is a derivative of the part of the intraembryonic coelom that lies in the midline, cranial to the prechordal plate (Fig. 5.8).
- After the formation of the head fold, the pericardial cavity comes to lie on the ventral side of the body of the embryo (Fig. 5.10).
- The heart tube invaginates the pericardial sac from the dorsal aspect (Figs 15.6A to D).
- The parietal layer of the serous pericardium, and the fibrous pericardium, are derived from the somatopleuric mesoderm lining the ventral side of the pericardial cavity (Figs 15.6A to D).
- The visceral serous pericardium is derived from the splanchnopleuric mesoderm lining the dorsal side of the pericardial cavity (Fig. 15.6D).
- The heart tube is initially suspended within the pericardial cavity by the dorsal mesocardium, which

![img-354.jpeg](img-354.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.25A to D: Formation of aortic and pulmonary valves. Note that the vessels undergo an anticlockwise rotation [compare axis XY in (C) and (D)]. It is only after this rotation that the cusps of the aortic and pulmonary valves acquire their definitive position
soon disappears (Figs 15.22A and B). We may now consider certain additional facts.

- After disappearance of the dorsal mesocardium, the visceral and parietal layers of pericardium are in continuity only at the arterial and venous ends of the heart tube (Figs 15.26A, B, D and E).
- With the folding of the heart tube, the arterial and venous ends come closer to each other. The space between them becomes the transverse sinus of pericardium (Figs 15.26C and F).
- A number of blood vessels are formed at the two ends of the heart tube. At the arterial end, these are the aorta and the pulmonary trunk. At the venous end, they are the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and four pulmonary veins (Fig. 15.27A).
- The definitive reflections of the pericardium are formed merely by rearrangement of these vessels as shown in Figure 15.27B. Rearrangement of the veins at the venous end results in the formation of an isolated pouch of pericardium, in relation to the four pulmonary veins. This is the oblique sinus of pericardium.


### Clinical correlation

### Congenital anomalies of the heart

### Anomalies of position

- Dextrocardia: The chambers and blood vessels of the heart are reversed from side to side, i.e. all structures that normally lie on the right side are on the left, and vice versa (Fig. 15.28). This may be a part of the condition called situs inversus, in which all organs are transposed. When dextrocardia is not a part of situs inversus, it is usually accompanied by anomalies of the chambers of the heart, and of the great vessels.
- Ectopia cordis: The heart lies exposed, on the front of the chest, and can be seen from the outside, due to defective development of the chest wall.


### Atresia or stenosis

Any of the orifices of the heart may have too narrow an opening (stenosis), or none at all (atresia). The aortic and pulmonary passages may also show supravalvular, or subvalvular, stenosis (Figs 15.30A to C). Alternatively, the openings may be too large as a result of which the valves become incompetent.
In pulmonary stenosis, the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus remain patent. In aortic stenosis also, the ductus arteriosus is patent and blood flows into the aorta through it.

### Abnormal growth

There may be accessory cusps in the valves. Congenital tumors may be formed. The left atrium may be partially subdivided by a transverse septum. The myocardium may be poorly developed (hypoplasia).

### Defective formation of septa

This results in the formation of abnormal passages.
Interatrial septal defects may be of three types:

- The septum primum may fail to reach the AV endocardial cushions, as a result of which the foramen primum persists (Fig. 15.31A). This ostium primum defect can also be caused by defective formation of AV endocardial cushions.
- The septum secundum may fail to develop as a result of which the foramen secundum remains wide open (ostium secundum defect; Fig. 15.31B).
- The septum primum and secundum may develop normally but the oblique valvular passage between them may remain patent (patent foramen ovale; Fig. 15.31C). The patency is significant only if there is shunt of blood through it. In many cases, a probe can be passed through the oblique slit (probe patency) but there is no shunt.
- Occasionally, there is premature closure of the foramen ovale (i.e. before birth). As a result, the right atrium and ventricle undergo great hypertrophy, while the left side of the heart is underdeveloped.
- Interventricular septal defects may be seen either in the membranous or in the muscular part of the septum (Fig. 15.31D). They are the most common congenital anomalies of the heart.
- Defects of the spiral septum: The spiral septum may not be formed at all. This condition is called patent truncus arteriosus (Fig. 15.29). Partial absence of the septum leads to communications (shunts) between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk.

(A), (B) and (C) are lateral views while (D), (E) and (F) show the dorsal aspect of the interior of the pericardial sac at corresponding stages. Disappearance of the mesocardium leads to formation of the transverse sinus of pericardium. Note that with the folding of the heart tube, the arterial and venous ends of the heart tube are brought closer together, and the transverse sinus comes to lie between them

![img-359.jpeg](img-359.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.30A to C: Types of aortic stenosis. (A) Valvular; (B) Supravalvular; (C) Infravalvular

- Atrioventricular canal defect or persistent AV canal: Defective formation of the AV cushions may lead to a condition in which all four chambers of the heart may intercommunicate. The interatrial and interventricular septa are incomplete (as the normal contributions to these septa from the endocardial cushions are lacking).
If fusion of endocardial cushions is too far to the right, it causes tricuspid atresia. As such cushions are not in alignment with the interventricular septum, the upper part of the latter is defective. With tricuspid atresia, there is increased pressure in the right atrium, as a result of which the foramen ovale fails to close. Defective formation of septa, if marked, can lead to a twochambered heart (cor biloculare) in which there is one common ventricle and one common atrium. Alternatively, a threechambered heart (cor triloculare) may be seen; it may consist of a single ventricle with two atria or of a single atrium with two ventricles (cor triloculare biventriculare).


### Combined defects

Two or more of the defects may coexist. One classically recognized condition of this type is known as Fallot's tetralogy. It consists of (Fig. 15.32):

- Interventricular septal defect
- Aorta overriding the free upper edge of the ventricular septum
- Pulmonary stenosis
- Hypertrophy of the right ventricle.


### Other defects

- The pericardium may be partially or completely absent.
- It may be congenital defects in the conducting system of the heart.
Anomalies of relationship of chambers to great vessels
- Transposition of great vessels: The aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk from the left ventricle.
- Taussig-Bing syndrome: The aorta arises from the right ventricle; and the pulmonary trunk overrides both the right and left ventricles, there being an interventricular septal defect.
- The superior or inferior vena cava may end in the left atrium.
- The pulmonary veins may end in the right atrium or in one of its tributaries.


## PART 2: ARTERIES

## PHARYNGEAL ARCH ARTERIES AND THEIR FATE

- The first arteries to appear in the embryo are the right and left primitive aortae. They are continuous with the two endocardial heart tubes.
- Each primitive aorta consists of three parts (Fig. 15.33A): 1. A portion lying ventral to the foregut (ventral aorta) 2. An arched portion lying in the first pharyngeal arch 3. A dorsal portion lying dorsal to the gut (dorsal aorta)
- After the fusion of the two endocardial tubes, the two ventral aortae partially fuse to form the aortic sac, the unfused parts remaining as the right and left horns of the sac (Fig. 15.33B).

![img-360.jpeg](img-360.jpeg.jpg)

![img-361.jpeg](img-361.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 15.32: Four features that constitute Fallot's tetralogy

- Successive arterial arches now appear in the second to sixth pharyngeal arches, each being connected ventrally to the right or left horn of the aortic sac and dorsally to the dorsal aorta (Fig. 15.33C).
- The major arteries of the head and neck, and of the thorax, are derived from these arches as follows:
- The greater part of the first and second arch arteries disappear (Fig. 15.34A). In adult life, the first arch artery is represented by the maxillary artery. The second arch artery persists for some part of fetal life as the stapedial artery: it may contribute to the formation of the external carotid artery.
![img-362.jpeg](img-362.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.33A to C: Relation of first aortic arch to heart tubes. (A) Before fusion of heart tubes; (B) After fusion; (C) Aortic arches. Each arch connects the aortic sac to the dorsal aorta. Note that actually all arches are never present at the same time. The first and second arches have retrogressed by the time the sixth appears

- The fifth arch artery also disappears (Fig. 15.34A).
- Now, the aortic sac is connected only with the arteries of the third, fourth and sixth arches.
- The third and fourth arch arteries open into the ventral part, and the sixth arch artery into the dorsal part, of the aortic sac (Fig. 15.34B).
- The spiral septum that is formed in the truncus arteriosus extends into the aortic sac; and fuses with its posterior wall in such a way that blood from the pulmonary trunk passes only into the sixth arch artery, while that from the ascending aorta passes into the third and fourth arch arteries (Fig. 15.34B).
- Several changes now take place in the arterial arches to produce the adult pattern as follows:
- The two dorsal aortae grow cranially, beyond the point of attachment of the first arch artery (Fig. 15.34B).
- The portion of the dorsal aorta, between the attachment of the third and fourth arch arteries (ductus caroticus), disappears on both sides (Fig. 15.34B).
- The portion of the right dorsal aorta, between the point of attachment of the fourth arch artery and the

point of fusion of the two dorsal aortae, disappears (Fig. 15.34B).

- Each sixth arch artery gives off an artery to the developing lung bud. On the right side, the portion of the sixth arch artery between this bud and the dorsal aorta disappears. On the left side, this part remains patent and forms the ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus carries most of the blood from the right ventricle to the dorsal aorta. It is obliterated after birth and is then seen as the ligamentum arteriosum.
- Each third arch artery gives off a bud that grows cranially to form the external carotid artery (Fig. 15.35G).
- The dorsal aortae give off a series of lateral intersegmental branches to the body wall. One of these, the seventh cervical intersegmental artery supplies the upper limb bud. It comes to be attached to the dorsal aorta near the attachment of the fourth arch artery (Fig. 15.34B).
- The development of the main arteries can now be summarized as follows:
- The ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk are formed from the truncus arteriosus (Fig. 15.34B).
- The arch of the aorta is derived from the ventral part of the aortic sac, its left horn, and the left fourth arch artery (Fig. 15.35A).
- The descending aorta is derived from the left dorsal aorta, below the attachment of fourth arch artery, along with the fused median vessel (Fig. 15.35B).
- The brachiocephalic artery is formed by the right horn of the aortic sac (Fig. 15.35C).
- The proximal part of the right subclavian artery (Fig. 15.35D) is derived from the right fourth arch artery, and the remaining part of the artery being derived from the seventh cervical intersegmental artery.
- Left subclavian artery is derived entirely from the seventh cervical intersegmental artery, which arises from the dorsal aorta opposite the attachment of the fourth arch artery (Fig. 15.35D).
- The common carotid artery is derived, on either side, from part of the third arch artery, proximal to the external carotid bud (Fig. 15.35E).
- The internal carotid artery is formed by the portion of the third arch artery distal to the bud, along with the original dorsal aorta cranial to the attachment of the third arch artery (Fig. 15.35F).
- As the right third and fourth arch arteries arise from the right horn of the aortic sac, the common carotid and subclavian arteries become branches of the brachiocephalic artery.
- As already mentioned, the external carotid artery arises as a bud from the third arch artery (Fig. 15.35G).
- The pulmonary arteries are derived from the part of the sixth arch arteries lying between the pulmonary trunk and the branches to the lung buds (Fig. 15.35H).
- As already stated, the part of the left sixth arch artery, between the branch to the lung bud and the aorta, forms the ductus arteriosus (Fig. 15.35I).
- Relationship of the main nerves of the head and neck to the arteries:
This can be explained on the basis of the development of the arteries.
- The nerves of the pharyngeal arches are, at first, lateral to the corresponding arteries.
- The nerves of the first, second and third arches (V, VII and IX) retain their lateral positions.
- The disappearance of the ductus caroticus enables the nerve of the fourth arch (superior laryngeal) to move medially, and it comes to lie deep to the main arteries of the neck.

![img-364.jpeg](img-364.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.35A to I: (A) The arch of the aorta is derived from the aortic sac, its left horn, and the left 4th arch artery; (B) The descending aorta is derived from the left dorsal aorta, and fused dorsal aortae; (C) The brachiocephalic artery is derived from the right horn of the aortic sac; (D) The right subclavian artery is derived from the right 4th arch artery and from the right 7th cervical intersegmental artery. The left subclavian artery is formed only from the left 7th cervical intersegmental artery; (E) The common carotid artery is derived from the proximal part of the 3rd arch artery; (F) The internal carotid artery is derived from distal part of the 3rd arch artery and dorsal aorta (cranial-most part); (G) The external carotid artery arises as a bud from the 3rd arch artery; (H) The pulmonary arteries arise from the 6th arch arteries; (I) The ductus arteriosus is derived from part of the left 6th arch artery

- The nerve of the sixth arch (recurrent laryngeal) is at first caudal to the artery of this arch (Fig. 15.36A). With the disappearance of part of the sixth arch artery, on the right side, the nerve moves cranially and comes into relationship with the right fourth arch artery (subclavian) (Fig. 15.36B). On the left side, it retains its relationship to that part of the sixth arch which forms the ductus arteriosus. With the elongation of the neck, and the descent of the heart, these nerves are dragged downward and, therefore, have to follow a recurrent course back to the larynx.

Adult derivatives of truncus arteriosus, aortic sac and aortic arches are presented in Table 15.2.

### Clinical correlation

### Anomalous development of pharyngeal arch arteries

We have seen that the development of the normal arterial pattern is dependent upon the disappearance of some parts of the pharyngeal arch arteries. Occasionally, this process is disturbed in that:

- Some parts that normally disappear may persist.
- Some parts that normally persist may disappear.

As a result, several anomalies may be produced. Some of these are as follows:

- Double aortic arch (Fig. 15.37A): The arterial ring can compress the trachea and esophagus.
- Right aortic arch (Fig. 15.37B).
- The ductus arteriosus, which is normally occluded soon after birth, may remain patent (patent ductus arteriosus).
- The right subclavian artery may arise as the last branch of the aortic arch (Fig. 15.37C). Such an artery runs to the right behind the esophagus (Fig. 15.38). Along with the aorta this artery forms an arterial ring enclosing the trachea and esophagus. The ring may press upon and obstruct these tubes. In this abnormality, the right recurrent laryngeal nerve does not hook around the subclavian artery. It passes directly to the larynx. An arterial ring can also be formed if the dorsal aorta persists on both sides.
- The ductus caroticus may persist. As a result, the left internal carotid arises directly from the aortic arch, and the right internal carotid from the subclavian (Fig. 15.37D).
- Interrupted aortic arch: A segment of the aortic arch may be missing. The ascending aorta ends by supplying the left common carotid artery. The left subclavian artery arises from the distal segment which receives blood through a patent ductus arteriosus.
- The aorta may show a localized narrowing of its lumen, leading to partial or even complete obstruction to blood flow. This condition is called coarctation of the aorta. Coarctation is most frequently seen near the attachment of the ductus arteriosus to the aorta. It may be (1) proximal to the attachment (preductal) (Fig. 15.37E) or (2) distal to the attachment of the ductus (postductal) (Fig. 15.37 F ) in which case the right ventricle supplies the distal part of the body through the ductus arteriosus. When coarctation is postductal, numerous anastomoses are established between branches of the aorta taking origin above the constriction and those arising below this level. Coarctation is said to be a result of the process of obliteration of the ductus arteriosus extending into the aorta. It can also occur as an abnormality in the vessel wall.
- Some other anomalies and the mode of origin of the branches of the arch of the aorta are illustrated in Figure 15.37G.


## DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER ARTERIES

The primitive dorsal aortae give off three groups of branches (Fig. 15.39). These are as follows:

- The ventral splanchnic arteries supply the gut. Most of these arteries disappear but three arteries, the celiac, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric remain to

supply the infradiaphragmatic part of the foregut, the midgut, and the hindgut respectively. Other remnants of these vessels are the bronchial and esophageal arteries.

- The lateral or intermediate splanchnic arteries supply structures developing from the intermediate mesoderm. These persist as the renal, suprarenal, phrenic, and spermatic or ovarian arteries.
- The dorsolateral (somatic intersegmental) branches run between two adjacent segments. They retain their original intersegmental arrangement in the thoracic and lumbar regions where they can be recognized as the intercostal and lumbar arteries.
- Each dorsolateral artery divides into a dorsal and a ventral division. The ventral division gives off a lateral branch that is most conspicuous in the region of the limb buds. The dorsal division runs dorsally and supplies the muscles of the back. Each dorsal division gives off a spinal branch that runs medially to supply the spinal cord.
- The branches of the dorsolateral arteries of successive segments become interconnected by the formation of longitudinal anastomoses.
- In the neck, the dorsal branches are connected by anastomoses that are formed in three situations (Fig. 15.40).

1. Precostal, in front of the necks of the ribs (or costal elements). The precostal anastomoses persist as the thyrocervical trunk, ascending cervical and superior intercostal arteries.
2. Postcostal, between the costal elements and the transverse processes. The postcostal anastomoses form the greater part of the vertebral artery.
3. Post-transverse, behind the transverse processes. The post-transverse anastomoses remain as the deep cervical artery.

- The ventral divisions of the somatic intersegmental arteries are interconnected by anastomoses that are formed on the ventral aspect of the body wall, near the midline (Fig. 15.41). These form the internal thoracic, superior epigastric and inferior epigastric arteries.
- At this stage, special mention must be made of the seventh cervical intersegmental artery. The main stem of this artery becomes the subclavian artery. Like other dorsolateral arteries, it divides into dorsal, ventral and lateral divisions. The dorsal division forms the stem of the vertebral artery. The lateral division grows into the upper

- The first part of the artery, from its origin to the point of entry into the foramen transversarium of the sixth cervical vertebra, is formed by the dorsal division of the seventh cervical intersegmental artery.
- The vertical part (second part), lying in the foramina transversaria, is formed from the postcostal anastomoses
between the first to sixth cervical intersegmental arteries.
- The horizontal (third) part, running transversely on the arch of the atlas, is derived from the spinal branch of the first cervical intersegmental artery.


### Development of Internal Thoracic Artery (Fig. 15.41)

- The main stem of the artery is formed by the ventral division of the seventh cervical intersegmental artery.
- The vertical part of the artery (including its superior epigastric branch) is derived from the ventral

anastomoses between the ventral divisions of the thoracic intersegmental arteries (intercostal arteries).

### Umbilical Artery

- Before the fusion of the two dorsal aortae, the umbilical arteries appear as continuations of their distal ends (Fig. 15.43A).
- After fusion of the dorsal aortae, they appear as lateral branches of the single dorsal aorta (Fig. 15.43B).
- Subsequently, each umbilical artery gets linked up with that part of the fifth lumbar intersegmental artery which forms the internal iliac artery (Fig. 15.43C).
- The part of the umbilical artery, between the aorta and the anastomosis with the internal iliac, disappears so that the umbilical artery is now seen as a branch of the internal iliac (Figs 15.43D and E).
- In postnatal life, the proximal part of the umbilical artery becomes the superior vesical artery, while its distal part is obliterated to form the medial umbilical ligament.


### Development of Arteries of Limbs

The limbs are supplied by lateral branches of the somatic intersegmental arteries that belong to the segments from which the limb buds take origin. These vessels form an arterial plexus.

However, each limb soon comes to have one axis artery that runs along the central axis of the limb. Other arteries that are formed as branches of the axis artery or as new formations later take over a considerable part of the arterial supply, as a result of which much of the original axis artery may disappear.

### Axis Artery of the Upper Limb

- It is formed by the seventh cervical intersegmental artery (Fig. 15.44).
- It runs along the ventral axial line and terminates in palmar capillary plexus in hand.
- It persists as the:
- Axillary artery
- Brachial artery
- Anterior interosseous artery
- Deep palmar arch.
- A median artery develops from anterior interosseous artery and grows distally to communicate with palmar capillary plexus.
- The digital arteries of hand develop from the palmar capillary plexus.
- The radial and ulnar arteries appear late in development.
- The left subclavian artery represents the main stem of the seventh cervical intersegmental artery, and the proximal part of its lateral division. This explains the origin of the

vertebral (dorsal division) and internal thoracic (ventral division) arteries from it.

- The distal part of the right subclavian artery has a similar origin, but its proximal part is derived from the right fourth aortic arch.


### Axis Artery of the Lower Limb

- It is derived from the fifth lumbar intersegmental artery.
- It is seen as a branch of the internal iliac and runs on the dorsal aspect of the limb.
- The femoral artery is a new vessel formed on the ventral aspect of the thigh.
- Proximally it gets linked above with the external iliac (which is a branch of the axis artery), and below with the popliteal artery.
- In the adult, the original axis artery is represented by (Fig. 15.45):
- Inferior gluteal artery
- A small artery accompanying the sciatic nerve
- Part of the popliteal artery above the level of the popliteus muscle
- Distal part of the peroneal artery
- Part of the plantar arch.

## PART 3: VEINS

## INTRODUCTION

The main veins of the embryo are three sets/pairs of longitudinally directed veins-categorized into two groups (Fig. 15.46). All drain into sinus venosus.

1. Visceral veins

- Vitelline/omphalomesenteric veins
- Umbilical veins-placenta

2. Somatic veins

- Cardinal veins.

Interconnections between the veins lead to establishment of shortest hemodynamic route by regression and/or enlargement of some veins. This results in the formation of major system of veins of adult.

- Portal system
- Caval system
- Azygos system.


## VISCERAL VEINS

These are as follows:

1. Right and left vitelline veins from the yolk sac. These are also called omphalomesenteric veins.
2. Right and left umbilical veins from the placenta.

The umbilical and vitelline veins open into the corresponding horn of the sinus venosus (Fig. 15.47A). The parts of these veins that are nearest to the heart are embedded in the septum transversum. These veins undergo considerable changes as follows:
![img-375.jpeg](img-375.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 15.46: Primitive veins of the embryo

- With the appearance of hepatic bud in septum transversum, the vitelline veins can be divided into three parts

1. Infrahepatic part
2. Intrahepatic part
3. Suprahepatic part.
- With the development of the liver, in the septum transversum, the proximal parts of the vitelline and umbilical veins become broken up into numerous small channels that contribute to the sinusoids of the liver.

These sinusoids drain into the sinus venosus, through the persisting terminal parts of the vitelline veins that are now called the right and left hepatocardiac channels (Fig. 15.47B). The proximal parts of the umbilical veins lose their communications with the sinus venosus.

- Meanwhile, the left horn of the sinus venosus undergoes retrogression and as result the left hepatocardiac channel disappears. All blood from the umbilical and vitelline veins now enters the sinus venosus through the right hepatocardiac channel (also called common hepatic vein). This vessel later forms the cranial most part of the inferior vena cava (Fig. 15.47C).
- The right umbilical vein disappears, and all blood from the placenta now reaches the developing liver through the left vein (Note: The left vein is "left") (Fig. 15.47D). In order to facilitate the passage of this blood through the liver, some of the sinusoids enlarge to create a direct passage connecting the left umbilical vein to the right hepatocardiac channel. This passage is called the ductus venosus.
- While these changes are occurring within the liver, the parts of the right and left vitelline veins that lie outside
the substance of the liver undergo alterations leading to the formation of the portal vein.


### Development of Portal Vein

- The proximal (infrahepatic) parts of the two vitelline veins lie on the right and left sides of the developing duodenum (Fig. 15.48A).
- The veins soon become interconnected by three transverse anastomoses, two of which lie ventral to the duodenum. The third anastomosis lies dorsal to the duodenum, and is between the two ventral anastomoses (Fig. 15.48B). These anastomoses form a figure of eight around the U-shaped duodenum.
- Cephalic ventral anastomosis
- Middle dorsal anastomosis
- Caudal ventral anastomosis.
- The superior mesenteric and splenic veins (which develop independently) join the left vitelline vein, a short distance caudal to the dorsal anastomosis.
- Some parts of the vitelline veins now disappear. The portal vein and its right and left divisions are derived from the veins that remain (Fig. 15.48C).
![img-376.jpeg](img-376.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.47A to D: Umbilical and vitelline veins. (A) Note the umbilical and vitelline veins passing through the septum transversum to reach the sinus venosus; (B) Growth of liver cells within the septum transversum breaks up part of the umbilical and vitelline veins into capillaries. Blood reaching the liver through the umbilical and vitelline veins now goes to the heart through the right and left hepatocardiac channels; (C) Left hepatocardiac channel disappears; (D) Right hepatocardiac channel (which later forms part of the inferior vena cava) now drains the liver. Right umbilical veins disappear. All blood from the placenta now reaches the liver through the left umbilical vein. Formation of ductus venosus short circuits, this blood to the right hepatocardiac channel

The veins that disappear are:

- Part of the right vitelline vein caudal to the dorsal anastomosis
- Part of the left vitelline vein caudal to the entry of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins
- Caudal ventral anastomosis
- Left vitelline vein between dorsal anastomosis and cranial ventral anastomosis.
The veins that persist to form the stem of the portal vein are (Fig. 15.48C):
- The left vitelline vein between the entry of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins and the dorsal anastomosis (1, in Fig. 15.48C)
- The dorsal anastomosis itself (2, in Fig. 15.48C)
- The right vitelline vein between the dorsal anastomosis and the cranial ventral anastomosis (3, in Fig. 15.48C).
Left branch of portal vein is formed by:
- The cranial ventral anastomosis
- A part of the left vitelline vein cranial to cranial ventral anastomosis (4, in Fig. 15.48C).
Right branch of portal vein is formed by:
- Right vitelline vein cranial to cranial ventral anastomosis (5, in Fig. 15.48C).
Intrahepatic part of vitelline veins breaks down into a network of capillary plexus due to the growing hepatic laminae of cells. These join the hepatic sinusoids that develop in situ between hepatic laminae. The sinusoids that carry the blood of these branches to the liver substance constitute the venae advehentes(intrahepatic branches of portal vein). Those sinusoids that drain this blood to the inferior vena cava are called the venae revehentes (tributaries of the hepatic veins).

The left umbilical vein now ends in the left branch of the portal vein (left end of cephalic ventral anastomosis; Fig. 15.48D), while the ductus venosus connects the left branch of the portal vein to the inferior vena cava (right hepatocellular channel).

The differences between vitelline, umbilical and cardinal veins are summarized in Table 15.3.

## SOMATIC VEINS

The earliest somatic veins are:

- Right and left anterior cardinal veins that drain the cranial part of the embryo, including the brain.
- Right and left posterior cardinal veins that drain the caudal part of the embryo.
The anterior and posterior cardinal veins of each side join to form the corresponding common cardinal vein (or duct of Cuvier), which opens into the corresponding horns of the sinus venosus (Fig. 15.49A).


### Fate of Anterior Cardinal and Common Cardinal Veins

The anterior cardinal veins are joined by the subclavian veins that drain the forelimbs (Fig. 15.49B). Soon thereafter, the anterior cardinal veins become interconnected by a transverse anastomosis (Fig. 15.49C), proximal to their junction with the subclavian veins. The part of the left anterior cardinal vein caudal to this anastomosis retrogresses, and so does the left common cardinal (Fig. 15.49D).
![img-377.jpeg](img-377.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.48A to D: Development of the portal vein. (A) Right and left vitelline veins; (B) Vitelline veins joined by three transverse anastomoses: cranial ventral, caudal ventral and middle dorsal; (C) Some of the veins disappear. The portal vein is formed from: 1. Part of left vitelline vein. 2. Dorsal anastomosis. 3. Part of right vitelline vein. 4. The cranial ventral anastomosis becomes the left branch of the portal vein. 5. Right vitelline cranial to cranial ventral anastomosis forms right branch

Superior vena cava is derived from (Fig. 15.49E):

- Right anterior cardinal vein, caudal to the transverse anastomosis with the left anterior cardinal

TABLE 15.3: Differences between three systems of veins

| Vitelline veins | Umbilical veins | Cardinalveins |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Drains from yolk sac | Drains from placenta through umbilical cord | Drains from body wall |
| Traverses through splanchnopleuric layer of coelom | Traverses through somatopleuric layer of coelom | Common cardinal vein passes along lateral wall of coelomic ducts |
| Terminates in floor of sinus venosus medial to umbilical vein and close to the gut | Terminates in floor of sinus venosus lateral to vitelline vein | Opens into the respective horn of sinus venosus |
| Contains poorly oxygenated blood | Contains well oxygenated blood | Contains poorly oxygenated blood |

- Right common cardinal vein. Note that the right horn of the sinus venosus forms part of the right atrium, and thus the superior vena cava comes to open into this chamber.
Right brachiocephalic vein is derived from the right anterior cardinal vein, between the point of its junction with the subclavian vein and the point of its junction with the transverse anastomosis (Fig. 15.49F).
Left brachiocephalic vein is derived from (Fig. 15.49G):
- The part of the left anterior cardinal vein corresponding to the right brachiocephalic vein
- The transverse intercardinal anastomosis.

Internal jugular veins develop from the parts of the anterior cardinal veins cranial to their junction with the subclavian veins (Fig. 15.49H).

External jugular veins arise as secondary channels and are not derived from the anterior cardinal veins.

![img-384.jpeg](img-384.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.50A and B: Formation of the vein for the forelimb bud. In Figure (A), we see veins from the body wall draining into the anterior and posterior cardinal veins. In Figure (B), we see that one of these veins lying at the level of the limb bud enlarges to drain the limb

The anterior and posterior cardinal veins receive a series of intersegmental veins from the body wall (corresponding to the intersegmental branches of the dorsal aortae. The subclavian veins are formed by considerable enlargement of one of these veins in the region of the upper limb bud (Figs 15.50A and B).
Retrogressing veins of left side: Caudal part of the anterior cardinal vein and the whole of the common cardinal vein of the left side undergo retrogression. The greater part of the posterior cardinal vein of this side disappears, but a small part adjoining the common cardinal vein persists as a small vein. The left horn of the sinus venosus undergoes considerable retrogression and is reduced to a tributary of the right horn. These retrogressing veins of the left side persist into adult life as the left superior intercostal vein and the coronary sinus which are derived as follows:
The left superior intercostal vein is formed by (Fig. 15.51):

- The left anterior cardinal vein caudal to the transverse anastomosis
- The most cranial part of the left posterior cardinal vein. The second and third intercostal veins drain into this vein.
Coronary sinus: The medial part of the coronary sinus is derived from the left horn of the sinus venosus (Fig. 15.52). The lateral part of the coronary sinus is derived from the proximal part of the left common cardinal vein. The remaining part of the left common cardinal vein persists as the oblique vein of the left atrium.


## VEINS OF THE ABDOMEN

The inferior vena cava, the veins of the kidneys, gonads and suprarenals, and the veins draining the walls of the thorax and abdomen, are derived from a series of longitudinal venous channels that appear in the embryo. Some of these are as follows:

- Posterior cardinal veins: At their cranial ends, these veins join the anterior cardinal veins to form the common cardinal veins. Near their caudal ends, they receive the

![img-387.jpeg](img-387.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.53A to D: (A) Posterior cardinal veins; (B) Formation of transverse anastomosis; (C) Formation of subcardinal veins. Note that they drain the developing kidney; (D) The two subcardinal veins become interconnected
veins of the lower limb bud (external iliac) and of the pelvis (internal iliac) (Fig. 15.53A). The caudal ends of the two posterior cardinal veins become interconnected by a transverse anastomosis (Fig. 15.53B).

- Subcardinal veins (green in Figs 15.54A to D) are formed in relation to the mesonephros. Cranially and caudally they communicate with the posterior cardinal veins. The subcardinals receive the veins from the developing kidneys.
At the level of the renal veins, the two subcardinals become connected by a transverse intersubcardinal anastomosis (Figs 15.53C and D).

The cranial part of the right subcardinal vein also establishes an anastomosis with the right hepatocardiac channel (Fig. 15.54A).

- Supracardinal veins (also called thoracolumbar veins) (red in Figs 15.54A to D) communicate cranially and caudally with posterior cardinal veins. They also communicate with the subcardinal veins through anastomoses which join the subcardinals just below the renal veins (Fig. 15.54B).
Many parts of these longitudinal venous channels disappear (Fig. 15.54C). The veins that remain give rise to the inferior vena cava, renal veins, veins of gonads and the suprarenal veins as follows:

Inferior vena cava is derived from the following in caudal to cranial sequence (Fig. 15.54D):

- Lowest part of the right posterior cardinal vein (between its junction with the supracardinal, and the anastomosis between the two posterior cardinals).
- Lower part of the right supracardinal vein (between its junction with the posterior cardinal, and the supracardinal-subcardinal anastomosis).
- Right supracardinal-subcardinal anastomosis.
- Right subcardinal vein (between the supracardinalsubcardinal anastomosis and the anastomosis between the subcardinal vein and the right hepatocardiac channel). This is the renal segment of the vena cava.
![img-388.jpeg](img-388.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.54A to D: (A to D) Development of the inferior vena cava. Subcardinal veins are green; supracardinal veins are orange; the subcardinal-hepatocardiac anastomosis is yellow; the hepatocardiac channel itself is purple; and the supracardinal-subcardinal anastomosis is brown. The inferior vena cava receives contributions from each of these components as indicated by the color in (D)

- Subcardinal-hepatocardiac anastomosis.
- Right hepatocardiac channel. (This is the hepatic segment of the vena cava).
Common iliac veins:
- Right common iliac vein is derived from the most caudal part of the right posterior cardinal vein.
- Left common iliac vein represents the anastomosis between the two posterior cardinal veins.

![img-389.jpeg](img-389.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.55A and B: (A and B) Formation of renal, suprarenal and gonadal veins. The right renal vein is formed as a tributary of the right subcardinal vein. The left renal vein is derived from vein draining left kidney into left subcardinal vein; part of left subcardinal vein itself; and intersubcardinal anastomosis. On each side, the suprarenal veins and gonadal veins represent remnants of the subcardinal veins. From (B), it is seen why these veins drain, on the right side into the inferior vena cava; and on the left side into the left renal vein

### Renal veins:

- The right renal vein is a mesonephric vein that originally drains into the subcardinal vein (Fig. 15.55A). It opens into that part of the vena cava that ${ }^{+}$is derived from the subcardinal vein (Fig. 15.55B).
- The left renal vein is derived from:
- The mesonephric vein that originally drains into the left subcardinal vein (Fig. 15.55A)
- A small part of the left subcardinal vein
- The intersubcardinal anastomosis. As this anastomosis lies in front of the aorta, the left renal vein has a similar relationship (Fig. 15.55B).
The suprarenal veins are remnants of the part of the subcardinal veins above the intersubcardinal anastomosis. It is clear from Figure 15.49B that the termination of the right suprarenal vein in the inferior vena cava, and that of the left suprarenal vein in the left renal vein, is because of their developmental origin.

The testicular or ovarian veins are remnants of the parts of the subcardinal veins below the intersubcardinal anastomosis. The reason for the difference in the manner of termination of the veins of the two sides is obvious from Figure 15.55B.

## AZYGOS SYSTEM OF VEINS

The veins draining the body wall at first drain into the posterior cardinal vein (Fig. 15.56A). Their drainage is soon transferred to longitudinal venous channels called the veins of the azygos line (or medial sympathetic line) (Fig. 15.56B).

Cranially these channels drain into the posterior cardinal veins. The channels of the two sides are brought into communication with each other by vessels that run dorsal to the aorta (Fig. 15.56B).

With the retrogression of the left common cardinal vein, the left azygos line loses its communication with
the posterior cardinal, and the blood of this channel now drains into the right azygos line through the postaortic anastomoses. The development of the azygos system of veins can now be summarized as follows (Fig. 15.56C).

- The azygos vein is formed from:
- The vein of the right azygos line; and
- The most cranial part of the right posterior cardinal vein through which it opens into the superior vena cava (formed from the right common cardinal).
- The vertical parts of the hemiazygos and the accessory hemiazygos veins represent the left azygos line. Their horizontal parts are formed by the postaortic anastomoses between the azygos lines of the two sides.
- The second and third left intercostal veins retain their connection with the left posterior cardinal vein, and are drained through the left superior intercostal vein.
- The abdominal parts of the veins of the azygos line are represented by the ascending lumbar veins.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of veins

Minor anomalies in the mode of formation of various veins are extremely common. Anomalies of major veins are, however, rare. Some of these are as follows:

- Left superior vena cava: This is due to the failure of the left anterior and common cardinal veins to retrogress. The left superior vena cava opens into the right atrium through a large coronary sinus. In this condition, the normal (right) superior vena cava may be reduced in size or may even be absent (Fig. 15.57).
- Double inferior vena cava (Figs 15.58A to D): Generally, the vena cava is double only below the level of the renal veins. Both channels may be present on the right side (Fig. 15.58B). This is caused by persistence of both the subcardinal and supracardinal veins below the level of the kidneys. There may be an additional channel on the left side (Figs 15.58C and D).

- Left inferior vena cava: The infrarenal part of the vena cava may be present on the left side only (Fig. 15.58E).
- Azygos continuation of inferior vena cava: The hepatic segment of the inferior vena cava may be absent. This is due to nondevelopment of the anastomosis between the right subcardinal vein and the right hepatocardiac channel. In such cases the upper part of the inferior vena cava follows the course of the azygos vein and opens into the superior vena cava. The hepatic veins open into the right atrium at the usual site of the inferior vena cava (Figs 15.58F and G).
- Preureteric vena cava: The inferior vena cava normally lies posterior to the right ureter. Sometimes, it may be anterior to the right ureter. The ureter then hooks around the left side of the vena cava. This anomaly is caused when the infrarenal part of the vena cava develops from the subcardinal vein (which lies anterior to the ureter), instead of the supracardinal vein (which lies posterior to the ureter).


## PART 4: FETAL CIRCULATION

The circulation in the fetus is essentially the same as in the adult except for the following (compare Fig. 15.59 with Fig. 15.60).

- Placenta: The source of oxygenated blood is not the lung but the placenta. Gaseous exchange takes place here.
- Umbilical vein: Oxygenated blood from the placenta comes to the fetus through the umbilical vein, which joins the left branch of the portal vein. A small portion of this blood passes through the substance of the liver to the inferior vena cava, but the greater part passes direct to the inferior vena cava through the ductus venosus (Fig. 15.47D).
- Ductus venosus: It is for bypassing hepatic circulation. A sphincter mechanism in the ductus venosus controls blood flow.
![img-390.jpeg](img-390.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 15.56A to C: (A) Veins from the body wall draining into anterior and posterior cardinal veins; (B) With the formation of the azygos venous channel (Az), most of the veins of the body wall now drain into it; (C) Shows the ultimate arrangement. Note that veins from the 1st intercostal space drain into the innominate veins directly (anterior cardinal). The veins of the left 2 nd and 3rd spaces drain into the left superior intercostal vein which is formed partly by the anterior cardinal and partly by the posterior cardinal veins. On the right side, the veins of these spaces drain into the part of the azygos vein representing the terminal part of the right posterior cardinal

Fig. 15.59: Scheme of the circulation in the human adult

- Foramen ovale: It connects the two atria. The oxygenrich blood reaching the right atrium through the inferior vena cava is directed by the valve of the inferior vena cava toward the foramen ovale. Here it is divided into two portions by the lower edge of the septum secundum (crista dividens):

1. Most of it passes through the foramen ovale into the left atrium.
2. The rest of it gets mixed up with the blood returning to the right atrium through the superior vena cava, and passes into the right ventricle.

- Ductus arteriosus: It is for bypassing pulmonary circulation. From the right ventricle, the blood (mostly
![img-394.jpeg](img-394.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 15.60: Scheme of the fetal circulation. The degree of deoxygenation is shown by the intensity of shading. $R A=$ right atrium; $L A=$ left atrium; $R V=$ right ventricle; $L V=$ left ventricle; $\mathrm{FO}=$ foramen ovale
deoxygenated) enters the pulmonary trunk. Only a small portion of this blood reaches the lungs, and passes through it to the left atrium. The greater part is shortcircuited by the ductus arteriosus into the aorta.

- Blood supply to fetus:
- We have seen that the left atrium receives blood from two sources the oxygenated blood from the right atrium and a small amount of deoxygenated blood from the lungs.
- The blood in the left atrium is, therefore, fairly rich in oxygen. This blood passes into the left ventricle and then into the aorta. Some of this oxygen-rich blood passes into the carotid and subclavian arteries to supply the brain, the head and neck, and the upper extremities. The rest of it gets mixed up with poorly oxygenated blood from the ductus arteriosus.
- The parts of the body that are supplied by branches of the aorta arising distal to its junction with the ductus arteriosus, therefore, receive blood with only moderate oxygen content.
- Umbilical arteries: They carry deoxygenated blood from fetus. Much of the blood of the aorta is carried by the umbilical arteries to the placenta where it is again oxygenated and returned to the heart.
- Fetal circulation-peculiarities:
- Three times blood shunts along its course at:
- Ductus venosus-to direct blood to inferior vena cava by passing liver without losing oxygen content
- Foramen ovale-to equalize distribution to each half of heart and more oxygenated blood to upper half vital organs
- Ductus arteriosus-to direct blood to placenta for oxygenation by passing lungs
- More oxygenated blood for upper limb. Hence the length of upper limbs is more than lower limbs in the fetus.
- Sphincteric action at the junction of left umbilical vein and ductus venosus regulates oxygen content of inferior vena cava and excessive load on heart
- Admixture of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood takes place in the liver, terminal part of inferior vena cava, both atria and distal part of arch of aorta.
- Transseptal blood flow throughout fetal life through ostium primum and foramen ovale.


## CHANGES IN THE CIRCULATION AT BIRTH

Soon after birth, several changes take place in the fetal blood vessels. These lead to the establishment of the adult type of circulation. The changes are as follows:

- Contraction of thick muscle wall: The muscle in the wall of the umbilical arteries contracts immediately after birth, and occludes their lumen. This prevents loss of fetal blood into the placenta.

TABLE 15.4: Postnatal occlusion of vessels, their remnants and reasons for their closure

| Vessel | Remnant | Reasons for closure |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Umbilical arteries | Proximal partsuperior vesical artery Distal part-fibrosed-medial umbilical ligament | Contraction of thick muscle wall |
| Left umbilical vein | Ligamentum teres of the liver |  |
| Ductus venosus | Ligamentum venosum | - Functional closure within minutes after birth <br> - Structural closure occurs within 3-7 days <br> - Closure of ductus venosus is caused by strong contraction of its muscle wall |
| Ductus arteriosus | Ligamentum arteriosum | Smooth muscle contraction At birth, opposite direction of blood flow from aorta to pulmonary artery supplies more oxygenated blood than before that causes smooth muscle contraction |

- The lumen of the umbilical veins and the ductus venosus is also occluded, but this takes place a few minutes after birth, so that all fetal blood that is in the placenta has time to drain back to the fetus.
- The ductus arteriosus is occluded, so that all blood from the right ventricle now goes to the lungs, where it is oxygenated. Initial closure of the ductus arteriosus is caused by contraction of muscle in the vessel wall. Later intima proliferation obliterates the lumen.
- The pulmonary vessels increase in size and, consequently, a much larger volume of blood reaches the left atrium from the lungs. As a result, the pressure inside the left atrium is greatly increased. Simultaneously, the pressure in the right atrium is diminished because blood from the placenta no longer reaches it. The net result of these pressure changes is that the pressure in the left atrium now exceeds that in the right atrium causing the valve of the foramen ovale to close.
The vessels that are occluded soon after birth are, in due course, replaced by fibrous tissue, and form the ligaments as shown in Table 15.4.


## PART 5: LYMPHATIC SYSTEM

- The first signs of the lymphatic system are seen in the form of a number of endothelium-lined lymph sacs. Traditionally, these sacs have been considered to be

![img-395.jpeg](img-395.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 15.61: Various lymph sacs
outgrowths from veins. However, they are now regarded to be predominantly independent formations from mesenchyme.

- There are six major lymph sacs that can be recognized. The right and left jugular sacs lie near the junction of the posterior cardinal and subclavian veins (i.e. at the future junction between the internal jugular and subclavian veins). The right and left posterior (or iliac) sacs lie around the corresponding common iliac vein. The retroperitoneal sac (unpaired) lies in relation to the root of the mesentery. The sixth sac (again unpaired) is the cisterna chyli. It lies in the midline some distance caudal to the retroperitoneal sac (Fig. 15.61).
- Lymphatic vessels are formed either by extension from the sacs or may form de novo, and extend into various tissues. Ultimately all the sacs except the cisterna chyli are invaded by connective tissue and lymphocytes, and are converted into groups of lymph nodes.
- The thoracic duct is derived from right and left channels that connect the cisterna chyli to the corresponding jugular sac. The two channels anastomose across the midline. The thoracic duct is formed from the caudal part of the right channel, the anastomosis between the right and left channels, and the cranial part of the left channel. The cranial part of the right channel becomes the right lymphatic duct (Fig. 15.62).

TABLE 15.5: Time table of some developmental events

| Age | Developmental events |
| :--: | :--: |
| 3rd week | Blood and vessels forming cells (angioblastic islands) appear. <br> The cardiogenic area, heart tubes and pericardium are formed |
| 4th week | Heart and pericardium lie ventral to foregut Subdivisions of heart tube are visible Heart begins to beat (becomes functional) Heart septa begin to form Aortic arches begin to establish in cranial to caudal sequence Most of the first aortic arch disappears at the end of 4th week Veins start forming |
| 5th week | The spiral septum is formed Formation of aortic arches is complete Lymphatic sacs form <br> The cardinal, umbilical and vitelline veins are formed Conduction system of heart forms |
| 6th week | Coronary circulation is becoming established Atrioventricular valves and papillary muscles are forming |
| 7th week | Heart septa are completely formed |

Note: The heart is most susceptible to teratogens between 3rd and 6th weeks. It can be affected up to the 8th week.

## EMBRYOLOGICAL BASIS FOR CLINICAL CONDITIONS OR ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS

### Case Scenario 1

A prenatal transabdominal fetal ultrasound presented an abnormal image of fetal four-chambered heart showing a gap (marked with arrow) below the typical crossing as shown in Figure 15.63. What could be the cause for this gap and

Fig. 15.64: Double aortic arch around trachea and esophagus
what structures forming the crossing. Give embryological explanation.

- A four-chambered ultrasound view of fetal heart is shown in Figure 15.63.
- The four-chambered heart is because of the formation of interatrial septum above, interventricular septum below and AV endocardial cushions laterally.
- Fusion of these structures forms the typical crossing seen in ultrasound.
- In this fetus, there is ventricular septal defect in the membranous part of interventricular septum forming patent interventricular foramen.
- Ventricular septal defects are the most common cardiac malformations of which defective membranous part is the most serious defect.

### Case Scenario 2

Give the embryological explanation for the Figure 15.64.

- It is a diagram describing double aortic arch around trachea and esophagus.
- A vascular ring is surrounding the trachea and esophagus.
- In normal development, the right dorsal aorta between the origin of 7th cervical intersegmental artery and its fusion with left dorsal aorta disappears. In the present case, it persisted.
- The right aortic arch was passing behind the trachea and esophagus (foregut derivatives) and the left aortic arch was passing in front of them forming a vascular ring.
- The vascular ring compresses these structures and produces symptoms of dyspnea (difficulty in breathing) and dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing).
