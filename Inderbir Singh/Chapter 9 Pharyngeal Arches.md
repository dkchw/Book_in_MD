# Chapter 9 Pharyngeal Arches

## HIGHLIGHTS

- Pharyngeal arches are rod-like thickenings of mesoderm present in the wall of the foregut.
- At first there are six arches. The fifth arch disappears and only five remain.
- The ventral ends of the arches of the right and left sides meet in the middle line in the floor of the pharynx.
- In the interval between any two arches, the endoderm (lining the pharynx) is pushed outward to form a series of pouches. These are called endodermal, or pharyngeal, pouches.
- Opposite each pouch the surface ectoderm dips inward as an ectodermal cleft.
- Each pharyngeal arch contains a skeletal element (cartilage that may later form bone), striated muscle supplied by the nerve of the arch, and an arterial arch.
- The cartilage of the first arch (Meckel's cartilage) gives origin to the incus and malleus (of middle ear).
- The cartilage of the second arch forms the stapes, the styloid process and part of the hyoid bone.
- The cartilage of the third arch forms the greater part of the hyoid bone.
- The cartilages of the fourth and sixth arches give rise to the cartilages of the larynx.
- The nerves of the pharyngeal arches are as follows: First arch = mandibular; second arch = facial; third arch = glossopharyngeal; fourth arch = superior laryngeal; fifth arch = recurrent laryngeal. The muscles supplied by these nerves are derived from the mesoderm of the arch concerned.
- The external acoustic meatus develops from the first ectodermal cleft.
- The first endodermal pouch (and part of second) gives off a diverticulum called the tubotympanic recess. The middle ear and the auditory tube develop from the tubotympanic recess.
- The palatine tonsil arises from the second pouch.
- The inferior parathyroid gland and the thymus are derived from the third pouch.
- The superior parathyroid gland is derived from the fourth pouch.
- The thyroid gland develops mainly from the thyroglossal duct. This duct is formed as a median diverticulum arising from the floor of the pharynx (at the foramen cecum).


## INTRODUCTION

- The formation of the foregut has been considered in Chapter 5: Further Development of Embryonic Disc. With the establishment of the head fold, part of yolk sac gets incorporated into it and forms the foregut. The foregut is bounded ventrally by the pericardium, and dorsally by the developing brain (Chapter 5: Fig. 5.10 H ). Cranially, it is at first separated from the
stomatodeum by the buccopharyngeal membrane. When this membrane breaks down, the foregut opens to the exterior through the stomatodeum.
- At this stage, the head is represented by the bulging caused by the developing brain (Chapter 5: Fig. 5.10H), while the pericardium may be considered as occupying the region of the future thorax. The two are separated by the stomatodeum which is the future mouth. It is, thus, apparent that a neck is not yet present.

## PHARYNGEAL/BRANCHIAL ARCHES

- The neck is formed by the elongation of the region between the stomatodeum and the pericardium. This is achieved, partly, by a "descent" of the developing heart. However, this elongation is due mainly to the appearance of a series of mesodermal thickenings in the wall of the cranial-most part of the foregut, i.e. future pharynx. These mesodermal thickenings are called the pharyngeal, or branchial, arches (Fig. 9.1).
- The cranial most part of foregut, i.e. pharyngeal part is funnel shaped to begin with. It is compressed dorsoventrally and presents a vental wall or floor, dorsal wall or roof and two lateral walls. A coronal section through the foregut (the part destined to form the pharynx), before the appearance of the pharyngeal arches, is shown in Figure 9.2A. At this stage, the endodermal wall of the foregut is separated from the surface ectoderm by a layer of mesoderm.
- Soon, thereafter, the mesoderm comes to be arranged in the form of six cylindrical bars that run dorsoventrally in the side wall of the foregut in craniocaudal sequence.

Each of these "bars" grows ventrally in the floor of the developing pharynx and fuses with the corresponding "bar" of the opposite side to form a pharyngeal or branchial arch. Each bar when viewed from the front is horse-shoe shaped. The arches are numbered craniocaudally as I-VI. In the interval between any two adjoining arches, the endoderm extends outward in the form of a pouch (endodermal or pharyngeal pouch) to meet the ectoderm which dips into this interval as an ectodermal cleft (Fig. 9.2B).

- The pharyngeal arches are six-curved mesodermal thickenings with each arch having an ectodermal covering and an endodermal lining containing a mesodermal core. These provide support to the ventral and lateral walls of primitive pharynx. By the time that the anterior neuropore closes, the first and second pharyngeal arches are present.
- The mesoderm of the arches is derived from paraxial mesoderm and lateral plate mesoderm. It is invaded by neural crest cells that contribute for skeletal elements and connective tissue of head and neck region.

- The first arch is also called the mandibular arch; and the second, the hyoid arch. The third, fourth and sixth arches do not have special names. The fifth arch disappears soon after its formation, so that only five arches remain. The following structures are formed in the mesoderm of each arch (Fig. 9.3):
- A skeletal element: This is cartilaginous to begin with. It may remain cartilaginous, may develop into bone, ligament or may disappear.
- Striated muscle: This muscle is supplied by the nerve of the arch (see below). In later development, this musculature may, or may not, retain its attachment to the skeletal elements derived from the arch. It may subdivide to form a number of distinct muscles, which may migrate away from the pharyngeal region. When they do so, however, they carry their nerve with them and their embryological origin can thus be determined from their nerve supply.
- An arterial arch: Ventral to the foregut, an artery called the ventral aorta develops. Dorsal to the foregut, another artery called the dorsal aorta, is formed. A series of arterial arches (aortic arches) connect the ventral and dorsal aortae. One such arterial arch lies in each pharyngeal arch. In a subsequent development, the arrangement of these arteries is greatly modified. The fate of the arterial arches is considered in Chapter 15: Cardiovascular System.
- Nerve of the arch: Each pharyngeal arch is supplied by a nerve derived from hind brain. In addition to supplying the skeletal muscle of the arch, it supplies sensory branches to the overlying ectoderm, and endoderm (Fig. 9.3). In some lower animals, each arch is supplied by two nerves (Fig. 9.4). The nerve of the arch itself
![img-169.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-169.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 9.3: Structures to be seen in a pharyngeal arch
runs along the cranial border of the arch. This is called the posttrematic nerve of the arch (trema $=$ trench). Each arch also receives a branch from the nerve of the succeeding arch. This runs along the caudal border of the arch, and is called the pretrematic nerve of the arch. In the human embryo, however, a double innervation is to be seen only in the first pharyngeal arch.

## DERIVATIVES OF SKELETAL ELEMENTS

- The cartilage of the first arch is called Meckel's cartilage (Fig. 9.5). The incus and malleus (of the middle ear) and spine of sphenoid are derived from its dorsal end. The ventral part of the cartilage is surrounded by the mesenchyme that forms the mandible by membranous ossification. The Meckel's
![img-170.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-170.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 9.5: Fate of the cartilages of the pharyngeal arches. The left half of the figure shows an earlier stage of development. The derivatives of the first arch are shown in red, second arch in green, third arch in orange, and fourth, fifth and sixth arches in blue

cartilage is thus trapped in the developing mandible, and is absorbed. The part of the cartilage extending from the region of the middle ear to the mandible disappears, but its sheath (perichondrium) forms the anterior ligament of the malleus and the sphenomandibular ligament.
The mesenchyme of ventral part of first arch forms the mandible and that of dorsal part (maxillary part) forms bones of the face including the maxilla, zygomatic bone, palatine bone and part of temporal bone by membranous ossification.

- The cartilage of the second arch (Reichert's) forms the following:
- Dorsal end of the cartilage forms
- Stapes
- Styloid process.
- Ventral part forms
- Smaller (lesser) cornu of hyoid bone
- Superior part of body of hyoid bone.
- Part between ventral and dorsal parts disappears but its perichondrium forms
- Stylohyoid ligament (from sheath).
(Note that all skeletal structures of second arch listed start with "S").
- The following structures are formed from the ventral part of cartilage of the third arch and the dorsal part disappears:
- Greater cornu of hyoid bone
- Lower part of the body of hyoid bone.
- The cartilages of the larynx are derived from the fourth and sixth arches that get fused with a possible contribution from the fifth arch, but their exact derivation is controversial.
- The skeletal elements of the pharyngeal arches are summarized in Table 9.1.


## NERVES AND MUSCLES OF THE ARCHES

- All the muscles derived from a pharyngeal arch are supplied by the nerve of the arch and can, therefore, be identified by their nerve supply. The nerves of the arches and the muscles supplied by them are given in Table 9.2.
- We have already seen that these nerves not only supply muscles, but also innervate the parts of skin and mucous membrane derived from the arches. Some of the nerves (e.g. glossopharyngeal) have only a small motor component and are predominantly sensory.
- As stated above, the first arch has a double nerve supply. The mandibular nerve is the posttrematic nerve of the first arch, while the chorda tympani (branch of facial nerve) are the pretrematic nerve. This double innervation is reflected in the nerve supply of the anterior two-thirds

of the tongue that are derived from the ventral part of the first arch.

- The other arches have only posttrematic nerves. There is a view that tympanic branch of glossopharyngeal nerve and auricular branch of vagus are pretrematic nerves for second and third arches.

Some recent investigations suggest that mesenchyme giving rise to muscles of the pharyngeal arches is derived from paraxial mesoderm cranial to the occipital somites (i.e. from the region of the preoccipital somites); and that its organization is influenced by neural crest cells. Although paraxial mesoderm here does not form typical somites, it shows partial segmentation into seven masses of mesenchyme called somitomeres. The structures derived from the seven somitomeres and from five occipital somites that follow them, have been described as given in Table 9.3.

If we accept this view of the origin of branchial musculature, there would be no significant reason to distinguish between it and muscle derived from somites.

## FATE OF ECTODERMAL CLEFTS

- After the formation of the pharyngeal arches, the region of the neck is marked on the outside by a series of grooves, or ectodermal clefts.

TABLE 9.2: Nerves, arteries and muscles of pharyngeal arches

| Arch | Nerve of arch | Artery of arch | Muscles of arch |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| First | Maxillary (Sensory) and mandibular (Motor and sensory) branches of trigeminal nerve | Maxillary artery | - Masseter <br> - Temporalis <br> - Medial pterygoid <br> - Lateral pterygoids <br> - Mylohyoid <br> - Anterior belly of digastric <br> - Tensor tympani, and <br> - Tensor palate <br> All are migratory except T. tympani |

| Third | Glossopharyngeal nerve | - Common carotid artery <br> - Internal carotid artery | Stylopharyngeus |
| Fourth | Superior laryngeal branch of vagus nerve | - Arch of aorta (left side) <br> - Subclavian artery (right side) | - Larynx-Cricothyroid <br> - Muscles of pharynx <br> - Intrinsic muscles of soft palate except tensor palati |
| Sixth | Recurrent laryngeal branch of vagus nerve | - Ductus arteriosus (left side) <br> - Pulmonary artery (right side) | All intrinsic muscles of larynx except cricothyroid |

- The dorsal part of the first cleft only persists (between the first and second arches) and develops into the epithelial lining of the external acoustic meatus and cuticular layer of tympanic membrane (Fig. 9.6).
- The pinna (or auricle) is formed from a series of swellings or hillocks that arise on the first and second arches, where they adjoin the first cleft (for the development of pinna refer to Chapter 20: Development of the Ear). The ventral part of this cleft is obliterated.
- Ectodermal derivatives of first arch include skin over upper and lower jaws and tragus of ear, lips, alveolabial sulci and dental lamina (that forms enamel of tooth).
- Epibranchial placodes are specialized, thickened regions of surface ectoderm in the region of head and neck. The cells of these placodes invaginate to contribute, to the formation of sensory ganglia of cranial nerves 5th, 7th, 9th, 10th in relation with 1st arch and 1st, 2nd and 4th clefts.
- Cervical sinus:
- Overgrowth of second arch mesoderm occurs. The second arch mesoderm overgrows the succeeding arches and comes to overhang them (Fig. 9.7). The space between the overhanging second arch

| :--: | :--: |
| Somitomeres 1 and 2 | Muscles supplied by oculomotor nerveSuperior, inferior and medial recti, inferior oblique and levator palpebrae superioris |

and the third, fourth and sixth arches is called the cervical sinus.

Fig. 9.7: Cervical sinus. The left half of the figure shows an earlier stage than the right half

- Subsequently, the lower overhanging border of the second arch fuses with tissues caudal to the arches (epicardial ridge). The side of the neck (which was thus far marked by the ectodermal clefts) now becomes smooth.
- The cavity of the cervical sinus (which is lined by ectoderm) normally gets obliterated. Part of it may persist and give rise to swellings that lie in the neck, along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid. These are called branchial cysts, and are most commonly located just below the angle of the mandible. If such a cyst opens onto the surface, it becomes a branchial sinus. Rarely, a cervical sinus may open into the lumen of the pharynx in the region of the tonsil.


## FATE OF ENDODERMAL POUCHES

- There are five endodermal pouches. The derivatives of the pouches are divided into ventral and lateral.

The ventral derivatives develop in the floor of pharynx and contribute for the development of tongue. Lateral derivatives except that of 1st are divided into those derived from ventral wing and those derived from dorsal wing.

- The endodermal pouches take part in the formation of several important organs (Figs 9.6 and 9.8). These are listed below and in Table.9.4.


### First Pouch

- Its ventral part is obliterated by formation of the tongue.
- Its dorsal part receives a contribution from the dorsal part of the second pouch, and these two together form a diverticulum that grows toward the region of the developing ear. This diverticulum is called the tubotympanic recess. The proximal part of this recess gives rise to the auditory (pharyngotympanic/Eustachian) tube, and the distal part expands to form the middle ear (tympanic) cavity, including the tympanic (mastoid) antrum. The auditory tube is the communication between the nasopharynx and middle ear (Fig. 9.6).


### Second Pouch

- The epithelium of the ventral part of this pouch contributes to the formation of the tonsil.
- The dorsal part takes part in the formation of the tubotympanic recess.


### Third Pouch

The communication of this pouch with the pharynx gradually narrows and is ultimately cut off. This gives rise to the following structures that lie outside the pharynx.

- Parathyroid III or inferior parathyroid glands-from dorsal wing
- Thymus-from ventral wing.

TABLE 9.4: Derivatives of endodermal pouches

| Pouch | Derivatives |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1st pharyngeal pouch | - Tympani cavity |
|  | - Auditory tube |
| 2nd pharyngeal pouch | - Inner surface of the eardrum |
| 3rd pharyngeal pouch | - Palatine tonsil |
|  | - Tonsillar fossa |
| 4th pharyngeal pouch | - Thymus |
|  | - Inferior parathyroid glands |
| 5th pharyngeal pouch | - Superior parathyroid glands |
|  | - Thyroid gland? |
|  | Ultimobranchial body |

![img-174.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-174.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 9.8: Scheme to show the fate of the pharyngeal pouches

### Fourth Pouch

The communication of this pouch with pharynx disappears. The derivatives of this pouch are:

- Dorsal wing forms—Parathyroid IV or superior parathyroid gland
- Ventral wing—may contribute to the thyroid gland.


### Fifth or Ultimobranchial Pouch

A fifth pouch is seen for a brief period during development. In some species, it gives rise to the ultimobranchial body. Its fate in man is controversial.

### Caudal-pharyngeal Complex

The fourth pouch joins with fifth pouch and forms caudal pharyngeal complex. The neural crest cells migrate into this complex.

- The superior parathyroid glands arise from this complex
- Thymic element: Incorporates into developing thymus.
- Lateral thyroid: Fuses with median thyroid element from hypoglossal duct. It arrests further migration of thyroid.
- Ultimobranchial body: It is constant in vertebrates. Incorporates into the substance of thyroid rudiment and gives origin to the parafollicular or C cells of the thyroid gland.


## DEVELOPMENT OF PALATINE TONSIL

During early part of 3rd month the lining epithelium of ventral part of second pouch proliferates and forms solid cords known as tonsillar buds that grow into the surrounding mesoderm. Their central cells degenerate and form the hollow tonsillar crypts. The epithelial lines crypts and surrounding mesoderm forms the palatine tonsil. During 3rd to 5th month lymphatic tissue (in situ or adjacent mesenchyme or circulating blood) infiltrates the mesoderm. Capsule of the tonsil is formed by condensed mesoderm. Inward bulging of tonsil into pharynx occurs. Remnant of the pouch is represented by intratonsillar crypt (Fig. 9.6).

## DEVELOPMENT OF THE THYMUS

The thymus develops from the endoderm of the third pharyngeal pouch (which also gives rise to the inferior parathyroid glands).

- Early in development, this pouch is cut off, both from the pharyngeal wall and from the surface ectoderm. After separation from the inferior parathyroid rudiment, each thymic rudiment has a thinner cranial part and a broader caudal part. The thinner portion forms the cervical part of the thymus. The broader parts, of the two sides, enter the thorax and become united to each

other by connective tissue in front of aortic sac. Descent of heart and aortic sac causes caudal migration of thymic rudiment along with parathyroid III.

- The endodermal cells of the thymus are invaded by vascular mesoderm which contains numerous lymphoblasts. This invading mesenchyme partially breaks up the thymic tissue into isolated masses, and thus gives the organ its lobulated appearance.
- The thymocytes are derived from bone marrow and the cytoreticulum and Hassall's corpuscles are derived from endoderm of 3rd pouch.
- Fragmentation of the cervical part of the thymus may give rise to accessory thymic tissue. Such tissue, present in relation to the superior parathyroid glands, is believed to arise from the fourth pouch.
- The thymus is relatively large at birth. It continues to increase in weight till puberty. Thereafter, it gradually undergoes atrophy.


## DEVELOPMENT OF PARATHYROID GLANDS

- Parathyroid glands are derived as follows:
- Inferior parathyroid glands develop from endoderm of the third pharyngeal pouch (parathyroid III).
- Superior parathyroid glands develop from endoderm of the fourth pharyngeal pouch (parathyroid IV).
- As the third pouch also gives origin to the thymus, this organ is closely related to parathyroid III. When the thymus descends toward the thorax, parathyroid III is carried caudally along with it for some distance.
- Meanwhile, parathyroid IV is prevented from descending caudally, because of the close relationship of the fourth pouch to the developing thyroid gland. As a result, parathyroid III becomes caudal to parathyroid IV.
- Hence, the parathyroid glands derived from the fourth pouch become the superior parathyroid glands and those derived from the third pouch become the inferior parathyroid glands (Fig. 9.6).
- In keeping with their developmental history, the superior parathyroid glands are relatively constant in position, but the inferior parathyroid glands may descend into the lower part of the neck or even into the anterior mediastinum. Alternatively, they may remain at their site of origin and are then seen near the bifurcation of the common carotid artery.


## DEVELOPMENT OF THYROID GLAND

- The thyroid gland develops mainly from the thyroglossal duct.
- Parafollicular cells are derived from the caudal pharyngeal complex (derived from the fourth and fifth pharyngeal pouches).
- After the formation of the pharyngeal arches, the floor of the pharynx has the appearance shown in Figure 9.9. The medial ends of the two mandibular arches are separated by a midline swelling called the tuberculum impar. Immediately behind the tuberculum, the epithelium of the floor of the pharynx shows a thickening in the middle line (Fig. 9.10A). This region is soon depressed below the surface to form a diverticulum called the thyroglossal duct (Fig. 9.10B).
- The site of origin of the diverticulum is now seen as a depression called the foramen cecum. The diverticulum grows down in the midline into the neck. Its tip soon bifurcates (Fig. 9.10C). Proliferation of the cells of this bifid end gives rise to the two lobes of the thyroid gland.
- The developing thyroid comes into intimate relationship with the caudal pharyngeal complex and fuses with it (Fig. 9.10D). Cells arising from this complex are believed to give origin to the parafollicular cells of the thyroid which may represent the ultimobranchial body of lower animals.


### Pharyngeal Apparatus/Branchial Apparatus

It includes:

- Pharyngeal arches (mesoderm)
- Pharyngeal clefts (ectoderm)
- Pharyngeal pouches (endoderm)

Figs 9.10A to D: Stages in the development of the thyroid gland

- Pharyngeal membranes-they are the site of contact of pouches and clefts. Initially, there are four membranes. As most clefts are filled with extension of 2 nd arch mesoderm over the others, only first membrane develops. This lies close to external auditory meatus and develops into the tympanic membrane.
The pharyngeal apparatus contributes for the formation of scalp, face, neck, definitive mouth, pharynx and larynx.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the thyroid gland

- Anomalies of shape:
- The pyramidal lobe is present so often that it is regarded as a normal structure. It may arise from the isthmus (Fig. 9.11A) or from one of the lobes (Figs 9.11B and C). It may have no connection with the rest of the thyroid and may be divided into two or more parts (Fig. 9.11D). In extent, it may vary from a short stump (Fig. 9.11A) to a process reaching the hyoid bone (Fig. 9.11C).
- The isthmus may be absent (Fig. 9.12A).
- One of the lobes of the gland may be very small (Fig. 9.12B), or absent (Fig. 9.12C).
- Anomalies of position (Fig. 9.13):
- Lingual thyroid: The thyroid may lie under the mucosa of the dorsum of the tongue and may form a swelling that may cause difficulty in swallowing.
- Intralingual thyroid: The thyroid may be embedded in the muscular substance of the tongue.
- Suprahyoid thyroid: The gland may lie in the midline of the neck, above the hyoid bone.
- Infrahyoid thyroid: The gland may lie below the hyoid bone, but above its normal position.
- Intrathoracic thyroid: The entire gland, or part of it, may lie in the thorax. Note that when thyroid tissue is present in the anomalous positions described above, an additional thyroid may or may not be present at the normal site.
- Ectopic thyroid tissue: Small masses of thyroid tissue may be present at abnormal sites.
- Thyroid tissue has been observed in the larynx, trachea, esophagus, pons, pleura, pericardium and ovaries.
- Masses of ectopic thyroid tissue have been described in relation to the deep cervical lymph nodes (lateral aberrant thyroids) but these are now believed to represent metastases in the lymph nodes from a carcinoma of the thyroid gland.
- Remnants of the thyroglossal duct: These remnants may persist and lead to the formation of:
- Thyroglossal cysts that may occur anywhere along the course of the duct. They may acquire secondary openings on the surface of the neck to form fistulae.
- Thyroglossal fistula opening at the foramen cecum.
- Carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct.

In the surgical removal of thyroglossal cysts and fistulae, it is important to remove all remnants of the thyroglossal duct. In this connection, it has to be remembered that the duct is intimately related to the hyoid bone (Fig. 9.13).

### Molecular regulation and genetic basis of pharyngeal arch development

The formation of pharyngeal arches is controlled by pharyngeal arch endoderm. Lateral migration of pharyngeal endodermal cells forms the pharyngeal pouches. This migration is controlled by fibroblast growth factor (FGF-8), bone mineral protein (BMP7), paired box gene (PAX-1), and sonic hedgehog (SHH) gene.

### Congenital anomalies because of persistence of cervical sinus:

- Branchial cyst: Persistence of cervical sinus as a cyst along the anterior border of sternomatoid muscle. If the cyst ruptures it results in branchial sinus.
- Branchial sinus: It can be external or internal.
- External: If the cyst opens outside, usually anterior to sternomastoid.
- Internal: Cyst opens into pharynx, usually in the tonsillar region.
- Branchial/Cervical fistula: The cyst opens both externally and internally. Connects pharynx with outside.
First-arch syndrome: These are congenital defects caused by a failure of migration of neural crest cells into the first pharyngeal arch. They usually produce facial anomalies.
- Treacher Collins syndrome (Mandibulo-facial dysostosis):
- It is a rare autosomal dominant disorder with 1:50,000 incidences.
- Clinically, it presents mandibular and malar (zygomatic) hypoplasia, down slanting palpebral fissure and ear defects (external/middle ear, conductive deafness).
- Genetic defect: Mutation of TCOF1 (Treacle) gene located on chromosome 5


### - Pierre Robin syndrome:

- Genetic cause-anomalles in chromosomes 2,11 or 17. Genetic dysregulation of SOX9 gene that controls development of face. The incidence of this condition is 1:8,500.
- Clinical presentation: Unusually small mandible (micrognathia), posterior displacement or retraction of the tongue (glossoptosis) and upper airway obstruction. Cleft palate (incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth) is present in majority of cases. An ultrasound image showing fetus with micrognathia, cleft palate and cleft lip (Fig. 9.14). It can be syndromic or nonsyndromic.


## TIME TABLE OF SOME EVENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHARYNGEAL ARCHES

Time table of some events described in this chapter is shown in Table 9.5.

TABLE 9.5: Time table of developmental events

| Age | Developmental events |
| :-- | :-- |
| 4th week (22nd day) | Appearance of 1st and 2nd arches |
| 5th week (29th day) | Four arches are seen. Thyroid, <br> parathyroid and thymus start <br> forming |
| 7th week | Thyroid gland reaches its definitive <br> position |

## EMBRYOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR CLINICAL CONDITIONS OR ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS

### Case Scenario 1

A child of 5 years was brought to the pediatric surgeon with a complaint of recurrent discharge from an opening in the right lateral neck. On examination of the patient, a small external

opening at the middle of anterior border of sternomastoid muscle was observed with a spontaneous thick discharge. Based on the MRI of neck the pediatric surgeon diagnosed it as a cervical fistula with its direction as shown in Figure 9.6. What is the embryological basis for this condition? Give explanation for the position of the fistula.

- It is a case of branchial or cervical fistula. It is a congenital, abnormal tract connecting the skin of the neck with an internal structure. It results from failure of closure of 2 nd to 4 th branchial clefts.
- Rapid growth of mesenchyme of second arch forms the cervical sinus between the overhanging second arch and subsequent arches. Subsequently, with the obliteration of cervical sinus the subsequent arches are buried and the ectodermal clefts between the arches are obliterated giving a smooth contour to the neck.
- If the cervical sinus persists, it results in the formation of branchial cyst, anywhere along the anterior border of sternomastoid muscle. Rupture of branchial cyst forms the branchial fistula that can open outside. Rarely the fistula opens inside only. It may communicate both inside and outside forming a communication of external opening with the interior of pharynx.
- In the present case, it is a fistula in relation to the 2 nd branchial cleft between 3rd and 4th branchial arches. The 2 nd branchial arch contributes for the formation of hyoid bone and its endodermal pouch forms the tonsil and the cleft forms the tonsillar fossa. The fistula is travelling between internal and external carotid arteries. Internal opening of fistula is at level of tonsillar fossa. External opening is found along the anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle.
