# Chapter 17 Nervous System

## HIGHLIGHTS

- Nervous system develops from the specialized ectoderm overlying the notochord known as neurectoderm.
- Neurectoderm overlying the notochord becomes thickened to form the neural plate.
- Neural plate is converted to neural groove, and then to neural tube.
- Neural tube has an enlarged cranial part that forms the brain, and a narrow caudal part that becomes the spinal cord. Neural tube presents a central cavity (lumen) that contains cerebrospinal fluid and a peripheral wall that forms nervous tissue.
- The cranial part of neural tube shows three dilatations: prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon.
- The prosencephalon divides into diencephalon and telencephalon. The telencephalon forms most of the cerebral hemisphere including the corpus striatum. The lateral ventricle is the cavity of the telencephalon. The diencephalon forms the thalamus, hypothalamus and related structures. Its cavity is the third ventricle.
- The mesencephalon forms the midbrain. Its cavity forms the cerebral aqueduct.
- The rhombencephalon divides into metencephalon and myelencephalon. The metencephalon forms the pons. It also forms the cerebellum. The myelencephalon forms the medulla oblongata. The fourth ventricle is the cavity of the rhombencephalon.
- The neural crest cells are made up of specialized surface ectodermal cells that lie along the lateral edges of the neural plate and later along the dorsolateral aspect of neural tube. Its most important derivatives are cells of sensory ganglia, parasympathetic ganglia and of sympathetic ganglia. It also forms the cells of the adrenal medulla and Schwann cells that form myelin and neurilemmal sheaths for peripheral nerve fibers.
- The wall of neural tube at first has a single layer of cells. They multiply and form three layers/zones. They are ependymal/ matrix, mantle and marginal from the lumen to periphery. Neurons develop in the mantle layer which forms the gray matter and the processes of neurons occupy the marginal layer that becomes the white matter. The mantle layer is divided into a ventral part, the basal lamina/floor plate and a dorsal part, the alar lamina/roof plate. These are separated by a groove, the sulcus limitans.
- In the spinal cord, the alar lamina forms the posterior/dorsal gray column, and the basal lamina forms the anterior/ventral gray column. The marginal layer becomes the white matter.
- In the medulla, pons and midbrain, efferent cranial nerve nuclei develop in the basal lamina and afferent nuclei in the alar lamina.
- The alar lamina of the myelencephalon also forms the olivary nuclei (which migrate ventrally), and the pontine nuclei (which migrate into the pons). The alar lamina of the metencephalon contributes for the development of cerebellum. The alar lamina of the mesencephalon forms the colliculi, the red nucleus and the substantia nigra.


## INTRODUCTION

The formation of neural tissue has been considered in Chapter 7, where we have seen that the ependymal (or
neuroepithelial) cells of the neural tube give rise to neurons and to neuroglia. We have also studied the formation of myelin sheath. We shall now consider the development of individual parts of the nervous system.

## NEURAL TUBE AND ITS SUBDIVISIONS

Apart from its blood vessels and some neuroglial elements (microglia), the whole of the nervous system is derived from surface ectoderm covering the embryo. While the embryo is still in the form of a three-layered (prelaminar) embryonic disc, the surface ectoderm on the dorsal aspect of notochord differentiates. That part of the ectoderm destined to give origin to the brain and spinal cord, can be distinguished as a specialized part called neurectoderm.
Neurulation: It is the process of formation of neural tube by conversion of neural plate. It extends from pre-somite to post time period of development as described below.

- Neurectoderm and neural plate stage (Pre-somite period, 16th-19th day): Neurectoderm is situated on the dorsal (amniotic) aspect of the embryonic disc in the midline. It overlies the notochordal process (Figs 17.1A and B). Under the inductive effect of notochord, the neurectoderm soon becomes thickened to form the neural plate (Figs 17.1A and C). Rapid longitudinal growth along the embryonic axis stretches the neural plate, which extends from the primitive knot caudally to the prochordal plate/ buccopharyngeal membrane rostrally. The neural plate at this stage is slipper shaped with broad cranial and narrow caudal ends that contribute for the formation of brain and spinal cord (Fig. 17.1A) respectively.
- Neural groove and folds stage (Somite period, 20th/21st day): The neural plate becomes depressed along the
midline with raised margins (edges) on either side. This results in the formation of neural groove and folds on the dorsal aspect of the neural plate (Fig. 17.1D). This groove becomes progressively deeper. The surface ectodermal cells at the edges of neural plate differentiate into neural crest cells.
- Neural tube stage (Somite period, 22nd-25th day): The two edges of the neural plate (neural folds) come nearer to each other, and eventually fuse, thus converting the neural groove into the cylindrical neural tube (Fig. 17.1E). The neural tube gets separated from the surface ectoderm.
- Openings of neural tube: The stages in the formation of the neural tube do not proceed simultaneously along the entire length of neural plate. The middle part is the first to become tubular around 21st/22nd day (4th somite stage). For some time, the neural tube is open cranially and caudally. These temporary openings are called the anterior neuropore and posterior neuropore, respectively. These openings facilitate communication between neural tube and amniotic cavity. The amniotic fluid circulates through the developing neural tube through these openings, providing nutrition to the developing neurectodermal cells, before the establishment of circulatory system.
- Closure of neuropores: Fusion of two edges of the neural plate extends cranially, and caudally starting

in its middle. Ultimately, neuropores disappear leaving a closed neural tube.

- Anterior neuropore closes around 25th day (Beginning of 4th week-20th somite stage). The location of anterior neuropore is represented in the adult as lamina terminalis that forms the anterior boundary for the 3rd ventricle.
- Posterior neuropore closes on 28th day (end of 4th week-25th somite stage). In the adult, the posterior neuropore represents the terminal ventricle, present in the proximal 5-6 mm of filum terminale. Non-closure of neural tube results in neural tube defects.
- Differentiation of neural tube: The neural tube presents a central cavity and a peripheral wall. The cavity represents the ventricles of brain and central canal of spinal cord. From the wall of the neural tube, various cells of central and peripheral nervous system develop.
- Separation of neural crest cells: With the closure of neural tube and restoration of surface ectoderm, the neural crest cells form bilateral masses along the dorsolateral aspect of the neural tube deep to surface ectoderm.
- Differential rate of growth and subdivisions of neural tube (Post-somite period-from 5th week): The parts of the brain that are developed from each of these divisions of the neural tube are shown in Figure 17.2 and Table 17.1.
- Even before the neural tube has completely closed, it is divisible into an enlarged cranial part that forms brain and a caudal tubular part that forms spinal cord (Fig. 17.2A). The spinal cord to begin with, is short, but gradually increases in length as the
embryo grows. Later, it is further subdivided into three primary and then into five secondary brain vesicles.
- The cavity of the developing brain soon shows three dilatations (Fig. 17.2B). Craniocaudally, these are the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon.
- The prosencephalon becomes subdivided into telencephalon and diencephalon (Fig. 17.2C). The telencephalon consists of right and left telencephalic vesicles.

![img-444.jpeg](img-444.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 17.3: Development of ventricles of brain

- The mesencephalon contributes for the development of midbrain (Figs 17.2B and C).
- The rhombencephalon also becomes subdivided into a cranial part, the metencephalon, and a caudal part, the myelencephalon. The metencephalon forms the pons and cerebellum. The myelencephalon forms the medulla oblongata (Fig. 17.2C).
- Cavities of brain vesicles: Each of the subdivisions of the developing brain encloses a part of the original cavity of the neural tube (Fig. 17.3). The cavities in relation with the various brain vesicles form the ventricular system of adult brain.
- The cavity of each telencephalic vesicle becomes the lateral ventricle.
- The cavity of the diencephalon (along with the central part of the telencephalon), becomes third ventricle. The two lateral ventricles communicate with the third ventricle through interventricular foramen of Monro.
- The cavity of the mesencephalon remains narrow, and forms the aqueduct of Sylvius through which the third ventricle communicates with fourth ventricle.
- The cavity of rhombencephalon forms the fourth ventricle.
- The cavity of spinal cord, the central canal is the downward continuation of fourth ventricle. The central canal presents a terminal dilatation at its lower end called terminal ventricle.
- Formation and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is formed in the ventricles; mainly in the lateral ventricle by choroid plexuses (infoldings of blood vessels of the pia mater covered by a thin coat of ependymal cells that projection into the ventricles of the brain and secretes the cerebrospinal fluid). CSF flows from lateral ventricles to third ventricle through interventricular foramen and from third ventricle to fourth ventricle through cerebral aqueduct.

It leaves the ventricular system through three foramina (a median foramen of Magendie and two lateral foramina of Luschka) into the subarachnoid space around brain and spinal cord (Fig. 17.4).

- The prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon are at first arranged craniocaudally (Fig. 17.5A). Their relative position is greatly altered by the appearance of a number of flexures. These are:
- Cervical flexure: at the junction of the myelencephalic part of rhombencephalon and the spinal cord (Fig. 17.5B). It is concave ventrally. It makes a $90^{\circ}$ angle between hindbrain and spinal cord.
- Mesencephalic flexure (or cephalic flexure): in the region of the midbrain (Fig. 17.5C) and is concave ventrally.
- Pontine flexure: It is at the middle of rhombencephalon, dividing it into the cranial metencephalon and the caudal myelencephalon (Fig. 17.5D). It is convex ventrally. This flexure changes the shape of this part of neural tube. Its cavity becomes the diamond-shaped fourth

ventricle. This cavity is widest at the point of folding and narrows cranially and caudally.

- Telencephalic flexure: It occurs much later, between the telencephalon and diencephalon.
- These flexures and differential growth of vesicles of brain lead to the orientation of the various parts of the brain as in the adult (Fig. 17.6).


## NEURAL CREST CELLS

At the time of formation of neural plate, some cells at the junction of neural plate and the surface ectoderm become specialized (on either side) to form the primordia of the neural crest (Figs 17.1C and D).

With the separation of the neural tube from the surface ectoderm, the cells of the neural crest appear as groups of
cells lying along the dorsolateral sides of the neural tube (Fig. 17.1E).

The neural crest cells soon become free (by losing the property of cell to cell adhesiveness). They migrate to distance places throughout the body. In subsequent development, several important structures are derived from the neural crest cells. The cells are divided into a dorsal mass and a ventral mass. Various derivatives of neural crest cells are as follows:

- Dorsal Mass
- Neuroblasts
- Pseudounipolar neurons of the posterior (dorsal) nerve root ganglia of spinal nerves
- Neurons of the sensory ganglia of the fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth cranial nerves
- Spongioblasts
- Capsular/satellite cells of all sensory ganglia
- Schwann cells that form the neurilemma and myelin sheaths of all peripheral nerves
- Pluripotent cells
- Mesenchyme of dental papilla, odontoblasts and dentine
- Melanoblasts: Pigment cells of the skin
- Cartilage cells of branchial arches
- Leptomeninges (Pia mater and arachnoid mater)
- Ventral Mass
- Sympathoblasts (Small cells)
- Neurons of the sympathetic ganglia
- Neurons of peripheral parasympathetic ganglia of cranial nerves (3rd, 7th, 9th, 10th)
- Chromaffin cells (Large cells)
- Suprarenal medulla
- Para-aortic body
- Argentaffin cells
- Enterochromaffin cells/APUD cells
- Other structures believed to arise from the neural crest are as follows:
- Bones of the face and part of the vault of skull (frontal, parietal, squamous temporal, part of the sphenoid, maxilla, zygomatic, nasal, vomer, palatine and mandible)
- Dermis, smooth muscle and fat of face and ventral aspect of neck
- Muscles of the ciliary body
- Sclera and choroids of eye
- Substantia propria and posterior epithelium of cornea
- Connective tissues of thyroid, parathyroid, thymus and salivary glands

## SPINAL CORD

The spinal cord develops from caudal cylindrical part of the neural tube. When this part of the neural tube is first formed, its cavity is in the form of a dorsoventral cleft. The lateral walls are thick, but the roof (dorsal) and the floor (ventral) are thin (Fig. 17.7A). The wall of the tube is subdivided into the ependymal or matrix cell layer, the mantle layer and the marginal layer (Fig. 17.7B) as already described in Chapter 7.

The mantle zone grows faster in the ventral part of the neural tube, and becomes thicker, than in the dorsal part. As a result, the ventral part of the lumen of the neural tube becomes compressed. The line separating the compressed ventral part, from the dorsal part, is called the sulcus limitans (Fig. 17.7C). With its formation, the lateral wall of the developing spinal cord can be divided into a dorsal or alar lamina, and a ventral or basal lamina. This division is of considerable functional importance. The cells of basal lamina are motor/efferent in function and that of alar lamina are sensory/afferent. The alar and basal laminae are also called the alar (roof) and basal (floor) plates, respectively.

With continued growth in thickness of the mantle layer, the spinal cord gradually acquires its definitive form (Figs
![img-448.jpeg](img-448.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 17.7A to E: Development of spinal cord. (A) Single layered neural tube; (B) Establishment of ependymal, mantle and marginal layers; (C and D) Division of mantle layer into alar and basal laminae; (E) Establishment of ventral and dorsal gray columns. The dorsal part of the cavity of the neural tube disappears. The ventral part persists as the central canal

17.7D and E). With growth of the alar lamina, the dorsal part of the cavity within the cord becomes obliterated: the posterior median septum is formed in this situation. The ventral part of the cavity remains as the central canal. Further enlargement of the basal lamina causes it to project forwards on either side of the midline, leaving a furrow, the anterior median fissure, between the projecting basal laminae of the two sides.

The nerve cells that develop in the mantle zone of the basal lamina become the neurons of the anterior gray column (Fig. 17.8). The axons of these cells grow out of the ventrolateral angle of the spinal cord to form the anterior/ ventral/motor nerve roots of the spinal nerves. The nerve cells that develop in the mantle layer of the alar lamina form the neurons of the posterior gray column. These are sensory neurons of the second order. Their axons travel predominantly upwards in the marginal layer to form the ascending tracts of the spinal cord. Many of these cells form interneurons.

![img-449.jpeg](img-449.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 17.8: Development of ventral and dorsal spinal nerve roots

The posterior/dorsal/sensory nerve roots are formed by the axons of cells that develop from the neural crest (Figs 17.8 and 17.9). Groups of these cells (pseudounipolar neurons) collect on the dorsolateral aspect of the developing spinal cord to form the dorsal nerve root ganglia (or spinal ganglia). The axons of these cells divide into two processes. The central processes migrate towards the spinal cord, and establish contact with the dorsolateral aspect of the latter, thus forming the dorsal nerve roots. These axons finally synapse with neurons of the posterior gray column developing in the alar lamina. The peripheral processes of the cells of the dorsal nerve root ganglia grow outwards to form the sensory components of the spinal nerves.

As stated above, the axons of neurons in the posterior gray column enter the marginal layer, to form the ascending tracts of the spinal cord. At the same time, axons of cells developing in various parts of the brain grow downwards to enter the marginal layer of the spinal cord and form its descending tracts. These ascending and descending tracts form the white matter of the spinal cord. As the mantle layer takes on the shape of the anterior and posterior gray columns, the white matter becomes subdivided into anterior, lateral and posterior white columns.

![img-450.jpeg](img-450.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 17.9: Traditionally recognized derivatives of the neural crest. Some additional derivatives are now recognized (as mentioned in the text)

Positional changes in spinal cord:

- The spinal cord up to 3rd month of intrauterine life extends throughout the length of the developing vertebral canal (Fig. 17.10A). The length of spinal cord and vertebral canal are equal. The spinal nerves run horizontally from their segment of origin to exit through the corresponding intervertebral foramina.
- Subsequently, due to the differential growth of spinal cord and vertebral column (the vertebral column becomes much longer than the spinal cord) at birth, the lower end of the cord is at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (Figs 17.10B and C). This process of recession of the spinal cord continues after birth as a result of which, in the adult, the cord usually ends at the level of the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra (Fig. 17.10D).
- One effect of this recession (of the cord) is that the intervertebral foramina no longer lie at the level at which the corresponding spinal nerves emerge from the spinal cord (Fig. 17.11). The nerves have, therefore, to follow an

Spinal nerves pass horizontally from the spinal cord to their exit from the vertebral canal; (B) Shows the condition after recession has occurred. The nerves now have to run obliquely downwards to reach the points of exit. The obliquity is greatest in the case of the lowest nerves
oblique downward course to reach the foramina. This obliquity is least for the cervical nerves, and greatest for the sacral and coccygeal nerves.

Functional columns in gray matter of spinal cord: The axons of cells of basal lamina leaving the spinal cord as ventral roots join with the peripheral processes of pseudounipolar neurons of dorsal root ganglia to form mixed spinal nerves. The cells of basal and alar lamina are arranged as two longitudinal functional columns each. They are divided into somatic and visceral columns. Visceral column is close to sulcus limitans (Fig. 17.12). These four functional columns in spinal cord are concerned with general sensations only.

- Afferent columns in alar lamina: They receive the central processes of pseudounipolar neurons present in dorsal root ganglia. The two functional columns in alar lamina are:
- General somatic afferent: It extends throughout the spinal cord and receives exteroceptive and proprioceptive information.
- General visceral afferent: It is restricted to thoracolumbar and sacral regions of spinal cord and receives information from viscera and blood vessels.

Abbreviations: GSA, general somatic afferent; GSE, general somatic efferent; GVE, general visceral efferent; GVA, general visceral afferent

- Efferent columns in basal lamina: The efferent columns in basal lamina give origin to the motor nerve fibers. The two functional columns in basal lamina are:
- General visceral efferent: It is restricted to thoracolumbar and sacral regions of spinal cord. The neurons of this column provide preganglionic sympathetic fibers that synapse in the peripheral nervous system ganglia for supply to cardiac muscle, smooth muscle in the walls of viscera, glands and blood vessels.
- General somatic efferent: It extends throughout the spinal cord and provides fibers that innervate skeletal muscles.


## BRAINSTEM

The medulla oblongata, pons and midbrain together constitute brainstem.

### Medulla Oblongata

The medulla oblongata develops from the myelencephalon. The caudal closed part of the medulla is similar to that of the spinal cord and has a central canal. The appearance of the sulcus limitans divides each lateral wall into a dorsal or alar lamina, and a ventral or basal lamina (Fig. 17.13A). Rostral/ cranial part of medulla is an open part where the thin roof plate becomes greatly widened as a result of which the alar laminae come to lay dorsolateral to the basal laminae. Thus, both these laminae are now in the floor of the developing fourth ventricle (Fig. 17.13B).

Cells developing in the lateral part of each alar lamina migrate ventrally, and reach the marginal layer overlying the ventrolateral aspect of the basal lamina. These cells
constitute the caudal part of the bulb-pontine extension, and develop into the olivary nuclei (Figs 17.13C and 17.14).

The remaining cells of the alar lamina develop into the sensory nuclei of the cranial nerves related to the medulla. The motor nuclei of these nerves are derived from the basal lamina (Figs 17.15, 17.16A and B).

Abbreviations: GSA, general somatic afferent; GSE, general somatic efferent; GVE, general visceral efferent; SSA, special somatic afferent; SVE, special visceral efferent; GVA, general visceral afferent; SVA, special visceral afferent

Functional columns of nuclei in brainstem: The nerve cells of the alar and basal laminae in the brainstem are at first grouped in accordance with their function and are arranged as illustrated in Figure 17.15 and presented in Table 17.2. These nuclei are arranged in seven longitudinal columns instead of four columns of spinal cord. The alar lamina contains four columns and the basal lamina contains three columns. The arrangement of nuclei in relation to sulcus limitans is that the visceral group is closer to sulcus than the somatic and in each group the general group is closer to sulcus limitans than the special.

- Afferent columns in alar lamina: The four functional columns in alar lamina are:
- General visceral afferent (GVA): concerned with visceral sensations conveyed through 9th and 10th cranial nerves.
- Special visceral afferent (SVA): concerned with taste sensation conveyed through 7th, 9th and 10th cranial nerves from the tongue, pharynx and soft palate.
- General somatic afferent (GSA): contains mesencephalic, chief and spinal nuclei of trigeminal nerve concerned with proprioception, touch, and pain and temperature sensations respectively from the head and neck region.

- Special somatic afferent (SSA): contains vestibular and cochlear nuclei concerned with equilibrium and hearing.
- Efferent columns of basal lamina: The three functional columns in basal lamina are:
- General somatic efferent (GSE): contains nuclei of cranial nerves (3rd, 4th, 6th and 12th) that supply the extraocular muscles of eyeball and musculature of tongue
- Special visceral efferent/Branchial efferent (SVE): contains the nuclei of cranial nerves (5th, 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th) that supply to musculature derived from pharyngeal arches
- General visceral efferent (GVE): contains the cranial nerve nuclei of origin for preganglionic neurons of peripheral parasympathetic ganglia.
- Edinger-Westphal nucleus (3rd cranial nerve): Ciliary ganglion
- Superior salivatory nucleus (7th cranial nerve): Pterygopalatine and submandibular ganglia
- Inferior salivatory nucleus (9th cranial nerve): Otic ganglion
- Dorsal nucleus of vagus (10th cranial nerve): for supply of thoracic and abdominal viscera
Subsequently, some of these nuclei migrate ventrally, from their primitive position in the floor of the fourth ventricle. Their ultimate position is indicated in Figure 17.16. The gracile and cuneate nuclei are derived from the lowermost part of the somatic afferent column. The white matter of the medulla is predominantly extraneous in origin, being composed of fibers constituting the ascending and descending tracts that pass through the medulla.


### Pons

The pons arises from the ventral part of the metencephalon. It also receives a contribution from the alar lamina of the myelencephalon, in the form of the cranial part of the bulbopontine extension (Figs 17.16C and D and 17.17). This extension comes to lie ventral to the metencephalon, and gives rise to the pontine nuclei. Axons of cells in these nuclei grow transversely to form the middle cerebellar peduncle.

As in the myelencephalon, the roof of the metencephalon becomes thin and broad (Fig. 17.16). The alar and basal laminae are thus orientated as in the medulla.

The lateral part of each alar lamina (often called the rhombic lip) becomes specialized to form the cerebellum. The ventral part of the alar lamina gives origin to the sensory cranial nerve nuclei, and the basal lamina to the motor cranial nerve nuclei, of the pons (Figs 17.15, 17.16C and D).

The nuclei derived from the basal and alar laminae lie in the dorsal or tegmental part of the pons. The ventral part of the pons is constituted by:

- Cells of the bulbopontine extension (derived from the alar lamina of the myelencephalon), that form the pontine nuclei. Axons of the cells in these nuclei grow transversely and form the middle cerebellar peduncle.
- Corticobulbar and corticospinal fibers that descend from the cerebral cortex, pass through this region on their way to the medulla and spinal cord. Some fibers from the cerebral cortex terminate in relation to the pontine nuclei. These are the corticopontine fibers.


### Midbrain

The midbrain is developed from the mesencephalon. The cavity of the mesencephalon remains narrow and forms the aqueduct. As described in the case of the spinal cord, the mantle layer becomes subdivided into a dorsal or alar lamina and a ventral or basal lamina by the appearance of the sulcus limitans (Table 17.2). The nuclei which develop from the basal lamina are oculomotor nerve nucleus, trochlear nerve nucleus and Edinger-Westphal nucleus.

The alar lamina gives rise to the cells of the colliculi. At first, these form one mass which later becomes subdivided by a transverse fissure into a pair of superior and a pair of inferior colliculi. Some cells of the alar lamina migrate ventrally to form the red nucleus and the substantia nigra (Table 17.2) (Figs 17.16E and F).

The marginal layer of the ventral part of the mesencephalon is invaded by downward growing fibers of the corticospinal, corticobulbar and corticopontine pathways. This region, thus, becomes greatly expanded, and forms the basis pedunculi (crus cerebri).
![img-458.jpeg](img-458.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 17.17: Scheme of the development of medulla and pons

## CEREBELLUM

The cerebellum develops from the dorsolateral part of the alar lamina of metencephalon (Fig. 17.18A). There are at first two primordia of the cerebellum, right and left. These extend medially in the roof plate of the metencephalon to eventually fuse across the midline (Figs 17.18B to D). As the cerebellum increases in size, fissures appear on its surface. The lateral lobes and vermis can soon be distinguished, as a result of differential growth.

The developing cerebellum can be divided into an intraventricular part that bulges into the cavity of the developing fourth ventricle, and an extraventricular part that is seen as a bulging on the surface (Fig. 17.18C). At first, the intraventricular part is the larger of the two, but at a later stage, the extraventricular part becomes much larger than the intraventricular part and constitutes almost the whole of the organ (Figs 17.18D to F).

The cerebellum, at first, consists of the usual matrix cell (neuroepithelial), mantle and marginal layers (Fig. 17.19A). Some cells of the mantle layer migrate into the marginal layer to form the external granular layer in the marginal zone. The cells of the external granular layer actively proliferate, expand and results in folding of the surface leading to the formation of folia. Further proliferation of the neuroepithelial cells and their migration to the deeper part of the marginal layer
forms internal granular layer, which is the definitive granular cortex, consisting of the Purkinje and Golgi neurons. Inward migration of small nerve cells and glial cells from external granular layer towards internal granular layer to intermingle with those cells already present in this layer occurs (Fig. 17.19B). The cells of the mantle layer that are not migrating into the cortex develop into the dentate, emboliform, globose and fastigial nuclei (Fig. 17.19C).

Posterolateral sulcus is the first fissure to appear and separates the flocculonodular lobe from rest of the cerebellum (Fig. 17.19D). During $3^{\text {rd }}$ month, fissura prima, fissura seconda and post-pyramidal fissures appear that separate various lobes of corpus cerebelli (Fig. 17.19E).

The superior cerebellar peduncle is formed chiefly by the axons growing out of the dentate nucleus. The middle cerebellar peduncle is formed by axons growing into the cerebellum from the cells of the pontine nuclei, while the inferior cerebellar peduncle is formed by fibers that grow into the cerebellum from the spinal cord and medulla.

## CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE

The cerebrum is a derivative of the prosencephalon (Figs 17.20A and E). Prosencephalon is divisible into a median diencephalon and two lateral telencephalic vesicles (Figs 17.2C, 17.20B and F). The telencephalic vesicles give origin, on either side, to the cerebral cortex and the corpus striatum. The diencephalon gives rise to the thalamus, hypothalamus and related structures.

![img-460.jpeg](img-460.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 17.19: Histogenesis of cerebellum

The telencephalic vesicles are at first small (Figs 17.20B and F), but rapidly increase in size extending upwards, forwards and backwards (Figs 17.20C, G and 17.21). As a result of these extensions, the telencephalon comes to completely cover the lateral surface of the diencephalon (Figs 17.20D and H) and eventually fuses with it (Fig. 17.21). Thus, the cerebral cortex and corpus striatum will come to lie lateral to the thalamus and hypothalamus.

With further upward, forward and backward extension of the telencephalic vesicles, the vesicles of the two sides come into apposition with each other above, in front of, and behind the diencephalon (Figs 17.20H and 17.21).

Formation of lateral and third ventricles: The cavity of the diencephalon forms the third ventricle, while the cavities of the two telencephalic vesicles form the lateral ventricles (Fig. 17.3). Each lateral ventricle is at first a spherical space within the telencephalic vesicle (Fig. 17.22A). With the forward and backward growth of the vesicle, the ventricle becomes elongated anteroposteriorly (Fig. 17.22B). The posterior end of the telencephalic vesicle now grows downwards and forwards, to form the temporal lobe, and the cavity within it becomes the inferior horn (Figs 17.22C and D). The ventricle thus becomes C-shaped. Finally, as a result of backward growth, the occipital pole of the hemisphere becomes

![img-461.jpeg](img-461.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 17.20A to H: Development of the cerebral hemisphere. This series of figures shows the changes in the relative size and position of the diencephalon and the telencephalic vesicles. Figures (A), (B), (C) and (D) are lateral views. Figures (E), (F), (G) and (H) are corresponding coronal sections along the axes indicated. (A and E) Prosencephalon before appearance of telencephalic vesicles; (B and F) Telencephalic vesicles appear; (C and G) Telencephalic vesicles enlarge and partially cover diencephalon; (D and H) Telencephalon much larger than diencephalon and completely overlapping it
established, the part of the ventricle within it becoming the posterior horn (Fig. 17.22E).

With the enlargement of the telencephalic vesicles, their medial walls become opposed to each other (Fig. 17.20 H ). In this way, a groove bounded by the two medial surfaces is formed, these surfaces being continuous with each other in the floor of the groove. Floor of this groove forms the roof of the third ventricle. Just above the floor of this groove, the medial wall is invaginated laterally into the cavity of the lateral ventricle. The cavity of the invagination is the choroid fissure (Figs 17.22, 17.23A and B). A fold of pia mater extends into this fissure and forms the telachoroidea (Fig. 17.23C). A bunch of capillaries is formed within this fold and forms the choroid plexus (Fig. 17.23D). The original wall of the ventricle lining the choroid plexus remains very thin and forms the ependymal covering of the plexus (Fig. 17.23). Note that the telachoroidea is in intimate relationship to both lateral ventricles and also to the roof of the third ventricle (Fig. 17.23). With the establishment of
![img-462.jpeg](img-462.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 17.21: Two telencephalic vesicles come to be apposed to each other in front of and behind the diencephalon
the temporal pole and the formation of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle, the choroid fissure becomes C-shaped (Fig. 17.22). The inferior part of the fissure now invaginates into the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle (Fig. 17.22E).

Fig. 17.23: Formation of the choroid fissure, telachoroidea (fold of pia mater) and choroid plexus (bunch of capillaries). The wall of the telencephalon remains thin at this site

#### Thalamus and Hypothalamus 

The thalamus and hypothalamus develop from the diencephalon. After the establishment of the telencephalon,
the lateral wall of the diencephalon becomes thickened. It is soon subdivided into three regions by the appearance of two grooves, called the epithalamic and hypothalamic sulci (Fig. 17.24A).

![img-465.jpeg](img-465.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 17.24: Development of thalamus and hypothalamus. The appearance of the epithalamic and hypothalamic sulci divides the diencephalon into thalamus, epithalamus and hypothalamus. The pineal body is formed in relation to the epithalamus, and the neurohypophysis in relation to the hypothalamus

The central part, lying between these two sulci, enlarges to form the thalamus (Figs 17.24B and C). The part above the epithalamic sulcus remains relatively small and forms the epithalamus, which is represented by the habenular nuclei and the pineal body. The part below the hypothalamic sulcus forms the hypothalamus.

The various nuclei of the thalamus and hypothalamus are formed by multiplication of cells in the mantle layer of the wall of the diencephalon.

### Corpus Striatum

The corpus striatum is a derivative of the telencephalon. Early in its development, each telencephalic vesicle can be subdivided into a basal part which is thick, and a superior part which is thin (Figs 17.25A and B). Some of the cells, in the mantle layer of the thick basal part, migrate into the overlying marginal layer to form part of the cerebral cortex. The remaining cells of the mantle layer of this region form the corpus striatum.

The developing corpus striatum soon becomes subdivided into medial and lateral subdivisions, which increase in thickness (Fig. 17.25C). Meanwhile, the cerebral cortex is developing and numerous axons, which are
growing downwards from it or growing towards it, pass through the region of the corpus striatum and divide it into a deeper and a superficial part. These fibers constitute the internal capsule (Fig. 17.26).

The part of the corpus striatum that comes to lie deep to the internal capsule becomes the caudate nucleus, and the superficial part becomes the lentiform nucleus (Figs 17.27 and 17.28). The lentiform nucleus later becomes subdivided into the putamen, and the globus pallidus.

### Cerebral Cortex

The cerebral cortex is formed by migration of cells from the mantle layer into the overlying marginal layer. These cells divide, and subdivide, leading to considerable thickening of the cortex. By full term, several layers of cells can be recognized. Simultaneously, there is considerable side-toside expansion of the cortex as a result of which its surface area is greatly increased.

As the surface expansion is at a greater rate than that of the hemisphere as a whole, the cortex becomes folded on itself. Sulci and gyri are formed as a result of this folding. The region of the insula is relatively slow in growth, and is gradually overgrown by adjacent areas, which form the opercula of the insula.

![img-466.jpeg](img-466.jpeg.jpg)

![img-467.jpeg](img-467.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 17.26: Wall of telencephalon at a stage somewhat later than that shown in Figure 17.32C. The region of the developing corpus striatum is divided (longitudinally) into deep and superficial parts (by nerve fibers growing downwards through it)
![img-468.jpeg](img-468.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 17.27: Deep part of corpus striatum becomes the caudate nucleus. Superficial part becomes the lentiform nucleus. Note relation of these to the thalamus developing in the diencephalon

From a developmental point of view, the cerebral cortex consists of:

- Hippocampal cortex
- Pyriform cortex
- Neocortex.

The neocortex is the most important part. It undergoes very great expansion and forms the whole of the cerebral cortex seen on the superolateral and medial surfaces of the
cerebral hemisphere, and the cortex of the inferior surface excluding the pyriform area (Figs 17.29 and 17.30).

The hippocampal cortex forms the hippocampus, and the indusium griseum. The pyriform cortex gives rise to the part of the cerebral cortex that receives olfactory sensations. It forms the uncus, the anterior part of the parahippocampal gyrus, and the anterior perforated substance.

The developing telencephalon has a medial wall (apposed to its counterpart of the opposite side), a superolateral wall, and a basal striatal region (Fig. 17.25C). The hippocampal cortex develops in the medial wall, the pyriform cortex in the marginal layer superficial to the corpus striatum, and the neocortex in the superolateral region (Fig. 17.30).
![img-469.jpeg](img-469.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 17.28: With enlargement of the telencephalon, the lentiform nucleus comes to lie lateral to the thalamus. The internal capsule passes through the interval between the lentiform nucleus laterally and the caudate nucleus and thalamus medially

From Figures 17.29 and 17.30 it will be seen that the hippocampal cortex is closely related to the choroid fissure. With the establishment of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle, the hippocampal cortex follows the curve of the choroid fissure and thus, assumes a ringlike configuration (Fig. 17.29B). However, the superior part of the hippocampal cortex is soon separated from the fissure by the formation of the corpus callosum. This part of the cortex remains rudimentary and forms the indusium griseum. The lower part of the hippocampal cortex undergoes relatively greater development and becomes the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus (Fig. 17.29 C ). With the expansion of the neocortex, these structures are pushed into the cavity of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle (Fig. 17.30B).

### White Matter of Cerebrum

The bulk of the cerebrum is constituted by its white matter. This is made up of:

- Axons of cortical cells that grow towards other areas of the cortex, either in the same or in the opposite hemisphere.
- Axons of cortical cells that grow downwards through the hemisphere, on their way to the brainstem and spinal cord.
- Axons that connect the thalamus, hypothalamus and basal ganglia to one another and to the cortex.
- Axons that grow into the hemisphere from the brainstem and spinal cord.

![img-471.jpeg](img-471.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 17.30: Development of the cerebral cortex. Most of the cerebral cortex is derived from the neocortex. The hippocampal cortex forms the hippocampus and the indusium griseum

### Cerebral Commissures

The part of the wall of the neural tube that closes the cranial end of the prosencephalon is called the lamina terminalis (Figs 17.31 and 17.32A). After the appearance of the telencephalic vesicles, the lamina terminalis lies in the anterior wall of the third ventricle. Any neuron growing from one hemisphere to the other must pass through this lamina (Fig. 17.31). To facilitate this passage, the lamina terminalis becomes thickened to form the commissural plate (Fig. 17.32B). Three principal commissural fibers pass through lamina terminalis.

- The first commissural fibers to develop form the anterior commissure.
- The second is the hippocampal commissure/fornix.
- The corpus callosum appears later and is the largest commissure. It, at first, lies anterior to the diencephalon, but because of rapid increase in its size, it extends backwards and roofs over this region (Figs 17.32B and C). The part of lamina terminalis that stretches between corpus callosum and fornix persists as septum pellucidum.
- Other commissures that appear are the optic chiasma, the habenular commissure and the posterior commissure.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of brain and spinal cord

Neural tube defects (NTDS)
These are a group of conditions where due to non-approximation of neural folds, they result in an opening in the spinal cord or brain or both from the early human development.
![img-472.jpeg](img-472.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 17.31: Diagram to show how the lamina terminalis serves as a path for nerve fibers passing from one cerebral hemisphere to the other

There are two types of NTDs: open and closed.
Open NTDs are more common. It results when the brain and/or spinal cord are exposed at birth through a defect in the skull or vertebrae. Examples are anencephaly and spina bifida.
Closed NTDs are rare and occur when the spinal defect is covered by skin. It is due to malformation of fat/bone/membranes.

### Outward bulging of neural tube and covering membranes

As a result of non-fusion of the neural tube, or of overlying bones (e.g. spina bifida), neural tissue may lie outside the cranial cavity or vertebral canal. When this happens in the region of the brain, the condition is called encephalocele (Fig. 17.33A), and when it occurs in the spinal region, it is called myelocele (Figs 17.33B).

When the condition is due to non-closure of the neural tube, the nervous tissue is exposed on the surface. Failure of closure of anterior and posterior neuropore results in conditions called anencephaly (Figs 17.33C and D) and spina bifida (Fig. 17.34), respectively. Failure of closure of entire neural tube results in a condition called rachischisis (Fig. 17.33E).

- Anencephaly (Fig. 17.33C and D): Failure of closure of anterior neuropore results in exposure of brain substance to the surface as an irregular degenerated mass. It is characterized by absence of vault of skull exposing the brain that gets degenerated and malformed. There will be absence of swallowing reflex in the fetus and hydramnios in the last trimester. Antenatal diagnosis of this condition is by ultrasonography and estimation of alpha fetoproteins in amniotic fluid. Prevention is by administration of folic acid before and during pregnancy.
- Rachischisis (Figs 17.33E and 17.34A): Failure of closure of neural groove results in exposure of neural tissue onto the surface.
- Spina bifida (Figs 17.34B to E and 17.35)

When the neural tube has closed and the outward bulging of spinal cord or its coverings is a result of a defect of the overlying bones. There are different types of spina bifida depending on the contents of the bulging.

- Spina bifida occulta: where the spinal cord is normal (Fig. 17.34B)
- Meningocele: pia and arachnoid protrude through the gap in the bifid spine forming a cystic swelling covered with skin (Figs 17.34C and 17.35A)
- Meningomyelocele: the cystic swelling includes spinal cord (Figs 17.34D and 17.35B). Meningomyelocele sometimes is associated with downward projection of some part of cerebellum and medulla through foramen magnum and a resulting obstruction leading to hydrocephalus. Such combined malformation is called Amold-Chiari malformation.
- Anterior spina-bifida: rare anomaly. Two halves of vertebral body fails to fuse and the spinal meninges protrude ventrally through the gap (Fig. 17.34E).
- Hydrocephalus (Fig. 17.35C)
- This condition occurs due to accumulation of abnormal quantity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricular system of brain. This can be due to blockage to the circulation of CSF or its excessive production. The pressure of the fluid causes degeneration of nervous tissue. The ventricles become very large and the infant is born with a large head.

The enlargement of central canal and associated abnormal cavities near central canal is called syringomyelia.

- Dandy-Walker syndrome: a form of hydrocephalus resulting from blockage of median and lateral apertures of the fourth ventricle. Enlargement is predominantly in the posterior cranial fossa and the cerebellum is abnormal.


## AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

### Sympathetic Neurons

Any sympathetic pathway consists of two neurons, i.e. a preganglionic and a postganglionic neuron.

- The preganglionic neurons develop in the mantle layer of the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord (segments T1 to L2 or L3). These cells are located near the sulcus limitans, and form the lateral horn of the cord (Fig. 17.36). The axons growing out from them are myelinated. They pass into the ventral nerve roots to enter the spinal nerves. After a very short course through the spinal nerves, they leave them and grow towards the postganglionic neurons. The postganglionic neurons form the various ganglia of the sympathetic trunk. Some postganglionic neurons come to lie near the viscera, and form visceral sympathetic ganglia. The preganglionic fibers meant for them do not relay in the sympathetic trunk but pass through branches of the trunk to reach the visceral ganglia.
- The axons of the postganglionic neurons grow towards the various viscera of the body, to innervate them. Some of them enter spinal nerves and are distributed through them to blood vessels, hair and sweat glands. Postganglionic neurons are generally believed to be derived from cells of the neural crest.

### Parasympathetic Neurons

As in sympathetic pathways, parasympathetic pathways also consist of two neurons (preganglionic and postganglionic).

### Preganglionic Neurons

The preganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic system are formed in two distinct situations.

### Cranial Parasympathetic Outflow

- These neurons are formed in relation to the general visceral efferent nuclear column of the brainstem (Fig. 17.37A). They give rise to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, salivatory and lacrimatory nuclei, and the dorsal nucleus of the vagus.
- The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers taking origin from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus run in the oculomotor nerve to reach the ciliary ganglion.
- The superior salivatory and lacrimatory nuclei give origin to preganglionic fibers, which run in the facial nerve to reach the sphenopalatine and submandibular ganglia.
![img-477.jpeg](img-477.jpeg.jpg)

![img-478.jpeg](img-478.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 17.37A and B: Development of preganglionic and postganglionic parasympathetic neurons. (A) Cranial outflow. (B) Sacral outflow

- The inferior salivatory nucleus gives origin to the fibers which are related to the glossopharyngeal nerve and terminate in the otic ganglion.
- The dorsal nucleus of the vagus gives preganglionic parasympathetic fibers that terminate in various ganglia situated in the walls of viscera supplied by the vagus nerve.


### Sacral Parasympathetic Outflow

The preganglionic neurons are formed in the mantle layer of the sacral part of the spinal cord (S2-S4). These cells lie near the sulcus limitans. Their axons constitute the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers, which terminate by synapsing with postganglionic neurons situated in the walls of pelvic viscera and hindgut (Fig. 17.37B).

### Postganglionic Neurons

- Postganglionic parasympathetic neurons are derived from the neural crest cells.
- In the cranial region, the postganglionic parasympathetic neurons form the ciliary, otic, submandibular and sphenopalatine ganglia. Ganglia are also present in various viscera supplied by the vagus nerve.
- Postganglionic parasympathetic neurons are also present in various ganglia that lie in relation to the hindgut and pelvic viscera. These neurons receive preganglionic fibers of the sacral outflow.
- It should be noted that the entire length of the gut (from esophagus to anal canal) is populated by postganglionic parasympathetic neurons which are of neural crest origin. The neural crest cells within the gut form the enteric nervous system.


### Molecular and genetic basis of neural tube formation

- Varieties of signals are required for induction of surface ectodermal cells to differentiate into neurectoderm.
- Signalling molecules of transforming growth factor B (TGF-B) family and inactivation of morphogenetic protein BMP4 (forms surface ectoderm) is required for formation of neuroectoderm.
- Certain genes, such as PAX5, sonic hedgehog are responsible for the closure of neural tube along with dietary cholesterol and folic acid (Vitamin $B_{12}$ ).
- Change in the expression of cell adhesion molecules by cells that are destined to become neurectodermal cells which start producing N -cadherin and N -CAM adhesion molecules instead of E-cadherin cause separation of neural tube form the surface ectoderm.

## EMBRYOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR CLINICAL CONDITIONS OR ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS OF NERVOUS SYSTEM

### Case Scenario 1

A stillborn baby was delivered with absence of cranial vault and exposure of brain substance which was seen as an irregular degenerated mass. The face appeared abnormal. When the mother is enquired about the obstetric history, she stated about the diagnosis of hydramnios by obstetrician. Explain the reason for hydramnios. State whether this condition can be diagnosed prenatally and if so what investigation has to be advised to the mother. What are the chances for survival of the baby? What preventive measures can be advised for future pregnancies?

- This condition is called anencephaly. In this condition, there is absence of major portion of brain, skull and scalp. It is a type of neural tube defect. Failure of closure of anterior neuropore results in exposure of brain substance to the surface as an irregular degenerated mass. Non-fusion of neural tube is associated with nonclosure of cranium (cranium bifidum) and hence the cranial vault is absent. The characteristic appearance of the fetus is the protruding eyes, and the chin is continuous with neck due to absence of neck.
- The amniotic cavity is filled with clear, watery fluid known as amniotic fluid. It is produced by amniotic cells and maternal blood. At 38 weeks, it is about 500100 mL in quantity. From 5th month of pregnancy, the fetus swallows about 400 mL of amniotic fluid per day. The swallowed fluid is absorbed through fetal gut and passes into maternal blood. Children born with disorder usually lack telencephalon. Because of the absence of brain, the swallowing reflex does not develop in anencephalic fetus resulting in excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid, i.e. hydramnios.
- This anomaly can be diagnosed prenatally by a detailed ultrasonography during 18-20 weeks of pregnancy. Biochemical tests include estimation of alpha-fetoproteins in the blood or in the amniotic fluid (obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis). There will be elevated alpha-fetoproteins in neural tube defects. These investigations should be suggested to the mother for future pregnancies. If the diagnosis of anencephaly is confirmed, termination of pregnancy is advised.
- Infants with this disorder do not survive. These fetuses are stillborn or die within few hours after birth.
- Folic acid supplementation before and during pregnancy reduces the chances of neural tube defects.


### Case Scenario 2

A neonate was presented to the neonatologist with a soft bulging in the lumbosacral region and a large head, with symptoms of dyspnea, dysphagia and noisy breathing. A diminished gag reflex was noted on testing. Based on physical examination and radiological investigations, a diagnosis of Arnold-Chiari malformation was arrived. Give the embryological explanation for this condition.

- Arnold-Chiari malformation is a congenital deformity characterized by meningomyelocele, caudal displacement of medulla and tonsils of cerebellum through foramen magnum and hydrocephalus.
- The soft bulging is due to a posterior gap in vertebrae resulting from non-fusion of laminae to form vertebral spine. This condition is known as spina bifida.
- The soft bulging may contain only meninges (meningocele) or meninges and spinal cord (meningomyelocele). In the present case, it is meningomyelocele covered with skin.
- The large head is due to the accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of brain and is known as hydrocephalus. In the present case, the radiological investigation probably suggested herniation of tonsils of cerebellum and medulla oblongata through foramen magnum into the vertebral canal. This herniation must have led to the blockage of CSF due to obstruction at the foramen magnum resulting in hydrocephalus.
- Due to the compression of medulla and stretching of cranial nerves IX, X, XI, XII that are attached to the medulla, the symptoms of dyspnea, dysphagia, and diminished gag reflex, etc. have resulted.
