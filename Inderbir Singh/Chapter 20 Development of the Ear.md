# Chapter 20 Development of the Ear

## HIGHLIGHTS

- Membranous labyrinth (internal ear) is derived from a thickening of surface ectoderm called the otic placode. The otic placode is converted into the otic vesicle and then to different parts of the labyrinth.
- Bony labyrinth is formed from mesenchyme surrounding the membranous labyrinth.
- Middle ear and auditory tube develop from the tubotympanic recess (from 1st and 2nd pharyngeal pouches).
- Ear ossicles: The malleus and incus are derived from Meckel's cartilage. The stapes is derived from the cartilage of the 2nd pharyngeal arch.
- External acoustic meatus is derived from the first ectodermal cleft.
- Auricle is formed from swellings that appear around the cleft.


## INTRODUCTION

The three morphological subdivisions of the ear are (1) external ear, (2) middle ear and (3) internal ear. Each one has a separate developmental origin (Table 20.1).

- Neuroectoderm of hindbrain region forms the membranous labyrinth. This forms the otic placode and otic vesicle. The otic vesicle differentiates to form vestibular and cochlear parts of internal ear.
- The mesenchyme surrounding the membranous labyrinth forms the bony labyrinth that forms otic capsule, which later gets chondrified leaving a space (periotic space) between membranous labyrinth and bony labyrinth.
- The dorsal part of 1st pharyngeal pouch and part of 2nd pharyngeal pouch (endoderm) form tubotympanic recess that gives rise to pharyngotympanic tube and middle ear cavity.
- The ear ossicles and muscles of middle ear develop from mesoderm of 1st and 2nd arches.
- The external acoustic meatus develops from ectodermal cleft of 1st arch.
- The auricle develops from mesodermal thickenings around 1st ectodermal cleft.
- The tympanic membrane is tridermal in origin as it develops from all the three germ layers.


## INTERNAL EAR

The internal ear is the first part to develop among the three parts of the ear. The developmental components of internal ear are membranous labyrinth and bony labyrinth.

### Membranous Labyrinth

- It is derived from a specialized area of surface ectoderm on either side of the developing myelencephalic part of rhombencephalon. This area is first apparent as a thickening called the otic placode (Fig. 20.1A).
- The otic placode soon becomes depressed below the surface to form the otic pit (Fig. 20.1B).
- The otic pit then becomes rounded to form the otic vesicle/otocyst which separates from the surface ectoderm (Fig. 20.1C).
- The otic vesicle is at first an oval structure. By differential growth of various parts of its wall, it gives rise to the structures comprising the membranous labyrinth.

Figs 20.1A to C: Formation of membranous labyrinth. (A) Otic placode; (B) Otic pit; (C) Otic vesicle surrounded by mesenchyme

- The otic vesicle divides into a vestibular (dorsal) and cochlear (ventral) components.
- The ventral cochlear part gives rise to the saccule, cochlear duct (organ of Corti) and comes into contact with the spiral ganglion of vestibulocochlear nerve (Figs 20.2 and 20.3) derived from neural crest cells. The details are illustrated in Figures 20.2 and 20.3.
- The dorsal part gives rise to the utricle, semicircular ducts, endolymphatic duct and sac and comes into contact with the vestibular ganglion of vestibulocochlear nerve (Figs 20.2 and 3) derived from neural crest cells. The details are illustrated in Figures 20.2 and 20.3.
- Localized areas of epithelium of the membranous labyrinth undergo differentiation to form specialized sensory end organs of equilibrium and hearing. The sensory end organs of equilibrium are cristae of semicircular ducts and macula of utricle. The sensory organs of hearing are macula of saccule and organ of Corti of cochlea. These are innervated by peripheral processes of the cells of the vestibular and cochlear ganglia respectively. These ganglia are derived from the neural crest cells. Its cells are peculiar in that they remain bipolar throughout life (Fig. 20.4).


### Bony Labyrinth

- The bony labyrinth is formed from the mesenchyme surrounding the membranous labyrinth (Fig. 20.5A). This mesenchyme becomes condensed to form the otic capsule. The mesenchymal condensation is soon converted into cartilage.

Figs 20.2A to F: Gradual transformation of a rounded otic vesicle to the highly complicated form of the membranous labyrinth. (A) Otocyst; (B) Formation of endolymphatic sac; (C) Division of otocyst into vestibular and cochlear parts; (D) Division of vestibular part into utricle and semicircular ducts and cochlear part into saccule and cochlear duct; (E and F) Further differentiation of components

- Between this cartilage and the membranous labyrinth, there is a layer of loose periotic tissue (Fig. 20.5B). The spaces of the bony labyrinth are created by the disappearance of this periotic tissue. The membranous labyrinth is filled with a fluid called endolymph, while the periotic spaces surrounding it are filled with perilymph (Fig. 20.5C).
- The periotic tissue, around the utricle and saccule, disappears to form a space called the vestibule (Fig. 20.6). The periotic tissue, around the semicircular ducts, also disappears to form the semicircular canals. Two distinct spaces are formed, one on either side of the cochlear duct. These are the scala tympani and the scala vestibuli. The scala vestibuli communicates with the vestibule while the scala tympani grows toward the tympanic cavity, from which it remains separated by a membrane (Fig. 20.6).
- The cartilaginous labyrinth is subsequently ossified to form the bony labyrinth (Fig. 20.5D).


## MIDDLE EAR

- The epithelial lining of the middle ear and of the pharyngotympanic tube is derived from the
tubotympanic recess. This recess develops from the dorsal part of the 1st pharyngeal pouch, and also receives a contribution from the second pouch (Figs 20.7A and B). The tympanic antrum and mastoid air cells are formed by extensions from the middle ear.
- The malleus and incus are derived from the dorsal end of Meckel's cartilage, while the stapes is formed from the dorsal end of the cartilage of the 2 nd pharyngeal arch (Reichert's cartilage) (Figs 20.8A and B).
- The ossicles are at first outside the mucous membrane of the developing middle ear. Later, they invaginate the mucous membrane, which covers them throughout life (Figs 20.8C to E). The ossicles of the ear fully ossify in the 4th month of intrauterine life. They are the first bones in the body to do so.
- The tensor tympani muscle is derived from the mesoderm of the 1st pharyngeal arch and the stapedius from that of the 2 nd arch.


## EXTERNAL EAR

- The external acoustic meatus is derived from the dorsal part of the first ectodermal cleft (Fig. 20.9A).

(A) Formation of cochlear and vestibular parts, tympanic cavity and pharyngotympanic tube; formation of mesenchymal condensation around the membranous labyrinth; (B) Evaginations of utricle to form semicircular ducts; (C) Coiling of cochlea; (D) Cartilaginous otic capsule, approximation of external acoustic meatus and tubotympanic recess with intervening mesoderm; (E) Formation of ear ossicles, tympanic membrane, petrous temporal bone and connections with vestibular and cochlear nerves

- However, its deeper part is formed by proliferation of its lining epithelium, which grows toward the middle ear (Fig. 20.9B).
- This proliferation is at first solid (meatal plug), but is later canalized (Fig. 20.9C).
- The auricle, or pinna, is formed from about six mesodermal thickenings (called tubercles or hillocks) that appear on the mandibular and hyoid arches, around the opening of the dorsal part of the first ectodermal cleft (i.e. around the opening of the external acoustic meatus) (Figs 20.10A to E).

Figs 20.8A to E: The ossicles of the middle ear develop from the first and second pharyngeal arches. Ossicles of the ear gradually invaginate into the tympanum

The mandibular arch forms only the tragus and a small area around it, the rest of the auricle being formed from the hyoid arch. This is consistent with the fact that the auricular muscles are supplied by the facial nerve.

### Tympanic Membrane

This is formed by apposition of the tubotympanic recess and the first ectodermal cleft, these two forming the inner (endodermal) and outer (ectodermal) epithelial linings of the membrane. The intervening mesoderm forms the connective tissue basis (Fig. 20.9D).
Two points worth noting are as follows:

- The handle of the malleus grows into the connective tissue from above.

Figs 20.10A to E: Development of the auricle. (A) First ectodermal cleft around which the auricle develops; (B) Small swellings or hillocks appear; (C to E) Hillocks gradually fuse with one another to form the various parts of external ear

The chorda tympani nerve is at first outside the membrane but comes to lie within its layers, because of upward extension of the membrane.

### Molecular and genetic basis of ear development

- The proteins Wnt and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) of surrounding region are important for the formation of otic placode.
- Retinoic acid plays an important role in the anteroposterior differentiation of otic vesicle.
- Wnt and Shh are required for the formation of semicircular canals and cochlear duct.
- Defects in Noggin and Pax2 genes result in sensory neural deafness that plays a role in formation of cochlea.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the Ear

### Anomalies of the auricle

- The development of the auricle may get arrested at any stage. As a result of this, it may be totally, or partially, absent; it may be represented by isolated nodules; or it may be very small. Alternatively it may be very large.
- The migration of the auricle from its primitive caudoventral position may remain incomplete. This migration occurs as a result of the growth of the maxillary and mandibular processes. This explains the association of caudoventral displacement of the auricle with mandibulofacial dysostosis.


### Anomalies of the external auditory meatus

- There may be stenosis or atresia of the meatus over its whole length, or over part of it. The lumen may be closed by fibrous tissue, by cartilage, or by bone.
- The normal curvature of the meatus may be accentuated as a result of which the tympanic membrane cannot be fully seen from the outside.


### Anomalies of the middle ear

- The ossicles may be malformed. They may show abnormal fusion to one another or to the wall of the middle ear. The stapes may be fused to the margins of the fenestra vestibuli.
- The facial nerve may bulge into the middle ear and may follow an abnormal course.
- The stapedial artery may persist.


### Anomalies of the internal ear

- Various parts of the membranous labyrinth may remain underdeveloped. In some cases, the cochlea alone is affected. These anomalies lead to congenital deafness.

## EMBRYOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR CLINICAL CONDITIONS OR ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS IN EAR

### Case Scenario 1

A female fetus aborted at 8 months age presented a small peanut-like tag of soft tissue representing the right auricle (Fig. 20.11A) and a normal left auricle. When the head of the fetus is subjected to computed tomography (CT) scan, it revealed normal auricle and external auditory canal on left side and absence of auricle and auditory canal on right side (Fig. 20.11B). Middle ear cavity and ossicles were not visualized on both sides (Fig. 20.11C). Internal auditory canal, cochlea, semicircular canals, mastoid air cells and VII and VIII nerve complexes are normal on both sides. What is the name given to this condition? Explain the embryological basis and causes for this condition.

- It is a case of bilateral middle ear atresia with absence of middle ear cavity and ear ossicles with right-sided microtia.
- Microtia is a congenital abnormality in which auricle of external ear is small and deformed. Atresia is absence or closure of external auditory canal.
- Microtia and atresia of external auditory meatus usually occur together. Usually they are unilateral.
- During the early part of fetal development (5th week), complex processes are involved in the formation and in the movement of the cells for correct position of ear. For unknown reasons, this process is interrupted and results in absence (anotia) or a small (microtia) external ear with associated atresia of external auditory canal.
- Canalization of ectodermal cells of 1st ectodermal cleft results in formation of external acoustic meatus.

Figs 20.11A to C: Aborted fetus with bilateral middle ear atresia and right-sided microtia. (A) Peanut-like tag of right auricle (arrow); (B) CT image showing absence of right auricle and external auditory canal; (C) CT image showing absence of middle ear cavity and ossicles on both sides

- Formation of tubotympanic recess (endodermal) from dorsal part of 1 st and part of 2 nd pharyngeal pouches forms middle ear cavity.
- The mesoderm in between the ends of 1st ectodermal cleft and tubotympanic recess forms the ear ossicles.
- On the right side absence of ectodermal, endodermal and mesodermal components of 1 st and 2 nd pharyngeal arches resulted in microtia, atresia of external auditory canal, absence of ear ossicles and middle ear cavity.
- On the left side absence of endodermal and mesodermal components of 1 st and 2 nd pharyngeal arches resulted in absence of middle ear cavity and ossicles.
- On both sided there is no defect in the formation of internal ear components that are derived from neuroectoderm of hindbrain region.
- The cause for this abnormality can be genetic, environmental exposure to radiation, infections or due to the use of certain medicines taken by the mother.
