## GESTATIONAL PERIOD

### Gestation

The process or period of development inside the womb between conception and birth is called gestation. The length of gestation is 280 days/ 40 weeks/ 9 months $\pm 7$ days. Gestation (Latin) is synonymous with menstrual age. It begins with 1st day of last menstruation prior to conception. If the date of onset of menstrual bleeding in the last menstrual period (LMP) or cycle is known the expected date of delivery (EDD) can be calculated as shown in the following example:

### Calculation of EDD from LMP:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\text { LMP } & 10.09 .2016 \\
\text { GP } & 07.09 .0000 \\
& \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \\
\text { EDD } & 17.06 .2017
\end{array}
$$

Age of embryo: Menstrual age versus fertilization age.
Menstrual age (LMP) or gestational age is based on LMP.
Fertilization age is fetal developmental age and is 14 days less than the gestational age as fertilization takes place 14 days before the onset of next menstrual cycle.

Fertilization age $=$ Menstrual age -14 days

### Gestational Period-Stages

- Germinal period: 1st-3rd week
- Fertilization to differentiation of germ layers
- Embryonic period: 4th-8th week
- Changes in shape/external appearance of embryo
- Individual differentiation of germ layers
- Formation of tissues and organs
- Fetal period: 3rd monthâ€”term
- Rapid growth of fetus
- Complete development of placenta


## GROWTH OF THE EMBRYO

After its formation, the embryonic disc undergoes folding. This folding leads to major changes in body form (during the 4th-8th weeks of fetal life). The embryo acquires the external features of a human being. All organ systems are formed. Changes in external form of the embryo occur during the 4th-8th weeks. At the end of the embryonic period, the embryo can be recognized as human even though its size crown-rump length (CRL) is only about 30 mm .
Criteria used for estimation of age of an embryo are different for embryonic and fetal periods.

This is important for understanding the age of the embryo, i.e. gestational sac in the early stages and the effect of teratogens during this period.

For embryonic period, it is divided into the three stages. They are:

1. Presomite: 15th-20th day of development

- Primitive streak
- Notochord
- Intraembryonic mesoderm (IEM)

2. Somite: 20th-30th day of development
- Mesodermal segments

3. Postsomite: 31st-55th day. By measuring the length and weight of fetus by transabdominal ultrasound.
- The importance of having a knowledge of the timing of embryological events, thus, becomes obvious. In the early stages of development, the age of an embryo is reckoned in days. Later, when events are less dramatic, age can be expressed in weeks or months. However, the exact age of an embryo is not always known. An estimate can be made by observing the size of the embryo (expressed as CRL), or some other features like the number of somites. In most textbooks of embryology, there are numerous references to the timing of embryonic events (most commonly in terms of CRL). The disadvantage of doing so is that it adds yet one more complication to the understanding of an already intricate subject. Because of this reason, references to the timetable of development have been kept to the minimum in the main text.

## DETERMINING THE AGE OF AN EMBRYO

### Gestational Age-Importance

It is important to know the age of a developing embryo because this can affect:

- Clinical procedures-like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.
- Obstetric care:
- Post-term delivery
- Cesarean section.
- Interpretation of antenatal tests:
- Alpha-fetoproteins
- Fetal diseases in pregnancy
- Fetal growth assessment
- Fetal heart rate.

The exact age of a living embryo can be found out only when the date of conception (fertilization) is known. This is almost impossible because fertilization is an internal event. Usually, the age has to be determined indirectly.

Estimation of gestational age from menstrual history may be unreliable as the expectant mother may not know the exact date of the last normal menstrual period, or her menstrual cycles may be irregular.

The somites begin to be seen in embryos about 21 days old. Embryos younger than this are called presomite embryos and their age is reckoned in days. Once the somites appear, the age is described in terms of the number of somites present, e.g. one-somite stage, four-somite stage, etc. When the embryo is about 30 days old, it is large enough to be measured.

However, the measurement of the length of an aborted embryo is not as simple as it sounds, as the embryo is bent on itself and cannot be straightened without fear of damage to it. Hence, instead of measuring its full length we measure what is called the CRL (Fig. 21.1). CRL is measured from the vertex of the skull to the midpoint between the apices of the buttocks.

Fig. 21.1: Measurement of crown-rump length (CRL) of embryo
At the present time, it is possible to measure the CRL of an embryo accurately, within the womb of the mother, with the help of an ultrasound machine. The CRL of a 1-month-old embryo is about 5 mm , and that of a 2 -monthold embryo is about 30 mm . At full term the CRL is about 300 mm . However, because of variations in the degree of curvature of fetuses, CRL is not a very accurate index of fetal age. Various other measurements are also used. For example (with the use of ultrasound), we can measure the dimensions of some parts of the fetus (e.g. head, foot length).

### Carnegie Embryonic Staging System

This system divides the development of an embryo into various stages. It is a numeric system for characterizing developmental stages. This system is used internationally by embryologists and research workers. The stages range from 1 to 23 and cover 1-56 days of embryonic development.

## FURTHER GROWTH OF THE FETUS

At the beginning of the fetal period ( 9 th week to 3rd month), the embryo has developed into a recognizable human being and the primordia of all organ system have formed.

During the fetal period, development is mainly directed toward the rapid growth in body size and toward differentiation of tissues, organs and organ systems.

During this period, the growth of the head is slow as compared to that of the rest of body. At the beginning of 3rd month, the head is half the CRL, while at birth it is about one-fourth of CRL. Fetal weight gain is very rapid in the last month of pregnancy.

A brief summary of growth in the embryonic and fetal periods is given in Tables 21.1 and 21.2.

## DETERMINING THE AGE OF A LIVING FETUS

The ability to find out the age of a living fetus is very important clinically. The age of such a fetus can be determined by making measurements using ultrasound examination.

1. Gestational sac can be identified as an echo-free space containing the amniotic fluid, embryo and extraembryonic structures (umbilical cord, placenta) (Figs 21.7 and 21.8).
2. Between 7 weeks and 14 weeks, the CRL can be measured.
3. Estimation of fetal age in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy is based on the measurements of various body parts. These are:

- Biparietal diameter
- Circumference of the head (Fig. 21.9)
- Circumference of the abdomen (Fig. 21.10)
- Length of femur
- Foot length.

Estimation of fetal age facilitates management of pregnancy. The various congenital anomalies that can be identified include neural tube defects like anencephaly (Fig. 21.11) (Fig. 10.22), encephalocele (Fig. 21.12), spina bifida, abdominal wall defects like omphalocele (Fig. 21.13), facial defects like microcephaly (Fig. 21.14), cleft lip and palate (Fig. 9.14), for identifying growth proportion (Fig. 21.15), growth of limbs (Fig. 21.16), etc.

## CONTROL OF FETAL GROWTH

Intrauterine growth of the fetus is influenced by maternal factors, placental factors and fetal factors.

### Maternal Factors

Adequate availability of nutrition in maternal blood and its transfer across the placenta are essential for normal growth of the fetus. Malnutrition in the mother affects fetal growth and can possibly cause fetal malformations. As a rule, maternal hormones do not pass through the placenta and hence they cannot affect fetal growth. However, they can influence the fetus indirectly by controlling maternal metabolic processes.

### Placental Factors

- Hormones secreted by the placenta can influence the fetus indirectly by influencing maternal metabolism. For example, somatomammotropin secreted by the placenta has an anti-insulin effect leading to increased plasma levels of glucose and amino acids in maternal blood. The availability of these to the fetus is, thereby, increased.
- Placental hormones also have a direct influence on fetal growth. Somatomammotropin increases fetal growth. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulates growth of the fetal testis.


### Fetal Factors

- Fetal growth is influenced by genetic factors. However, genetic factors that determine the height of the individual operate mainly in postnatal life (through the action of the growth hormone and of the thyroid hormone).
- Fetal endocrine glands start functioning near the middle of intrauterine life. The effects of hormones produced by them may be different from those seen in postnatal life, the modifications being necessary for requirements of the fetus.
- For example, the fetal adrenal gland starts producing cortisol in the 9th week. In an adult, cortisol has a catabolic effect. To prevent this, cortisol secreted by the fetus is converted to cortisone (which does not have this effect).
- Growth hormone (produced by the hypophysis cerebri) and thyroid hormones have very little effect on fetal growth. Infants in whom these hormones are deficient do not show growth retardation.
However, sex hormones produced by developing gonads greatly influence differentiation of genital organs in both sexes.


### Fetal Growth Retardation

When the growth of a fetus is less than that seen in $90 \%$ of fetuses (i.e. it is below the 90th percentile), the phenomenon is described as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Such infants are also described as small for gestational age. Such fetuses have an increased risk of congenital malformations, Apart from genetic factors like chromosomal abnormalities, growth retardation can also be caused by infections, poor nutrition, cigarette smoking, alcohol and use of harmful drugs by the mother.

## CAUSATION OF CONGENITAL ANOMALIES (TERATOGENESIS)

- One of the main objectives of the study of embryology, by medical students, is to understand the causation of congenital anomalies.
- If a growing embryo is exposed to certain agents (chemical or physical), abnormalities in development can result. Such agents are called teratogens. The study of congenital malformations constitutes the science of teratology.
- The development of the embryo is dependent primarily on genetic influences. However, environmental conditions can also exert an important effect. It, therefore, follows that congenital anomalies may occur either as a result of genetic or environmental defects, or by a combination of both.
- Embryos with major abnormalities are aborted early in pregnancy, and this may occur even before the mother is aware of the pregnancy. According to some estimates, the total number of abnormal embryos may be as high as $50 \%$ and their spontaneous abortion may be nature's way of reducing the birth of malformed babies.
- In spite of this fact, 2-3\% of infants born alive, show one or more congenital malformations. Some anomalies are not obvious at birth but are discovered later. The total incidence of malformations may, therefore, be as high as $5 \%$ of live births.
These figures are cited to highlight the great importance of the need to understand the causation of congenital abnormalities. The list of known teratogens keeps increasing. It has also been observed that some particular organs are most sensitive to teratogens when they are passing through critical phases in their development. This period of greatest susceptibility to teratogens differs from organ to organ.
Mode of action of teratogens-some general principles may be stated as follows:

1. Stage of action of embryonic development: The susceptibility to a teratogen, and the degree of damage it causes, depends upon the stage of embryonic development at which the embryo or fetus is exposed to the teratogen. When a teratogen acts before differentiation of germ layers, the effects are drastic and often lead to death of the embryo.
2. Period of organogenesis and critical period of development: The organ systems of the fetus are established between 3 weeks and 8 weeks of pregnancy, and this is referred to as the embryonic period or period of organogenesis. Most anomalies are produced during this period. Unfortunately this is an early stage of pregnancy and the mother may not even be aware of her pregnancy. Therefore, she may not take the necessary precautions. She may keep on consuming harmful products like drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. During the fetal period that follows, teratogenic influences become much less severe. The type of malformation produced depends on the exact timing of the teratogenic influence. Each organ seems to have a critical period during which it is most sensitive to teratogens.
3. Genetic and metabolic influences: The susceptibility to a teratogen is influenced by genetic factors. A fetus of one genotype can be much more susceptible to the same teratogen than a fetus of another genotype. Teratogenic agents act by influencing metabolic processes.
4. Dose and duration of exposure: The dose and duration of exposure to teratogen is also important. High concentration and long period of exposure to a teratogen is relatively more harmful.
About $80 \%$ of all congenital malformations are produced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Of the remaining $20 \%$, about half are caused exclusively by genetic or chromosomal factors and the remaining half exclusively by environmental factors.

### Hereditary Causes

- Anomalies may be caused by defects in a specific chromosome or in a specific gene. Chromosomal defects owe their effects to the absence of certain genes, or presence of extraneous ones on them. Hence, all hereditary defects are ultimately caused by failure of the cells to synthesize the right proteins (especially enzymes) at the right time.
- In producing an anomaly, the genetic defect may directly affect the organ, or may have an indirect effect. For example, a genetic defect that leads to agenesis of the testis may indirectly influence the developing external genitalia by interfering with the production of hormones necessary for their development. Similarly, an anomaly of a blood vessel may interfere with the blood supply of an organ and hence adversely affect its development.


### Environmental Causes (Teratogens)

### Infections

Syphilis, chickenpox, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), measles and toxoplasmosis. There is a well-known correlation between a disease known as German measles and congenital anomalies. When the mother suffers from this disease in the early months of pregnancy, the offspring often has cataract (opaque lens of eye), anomalies of the heart, or deafness.

### Malnutrition

Deficiencies of vitamins, minerals (like calcium or phosphorus), certain trace elements, and of some amino acids have been shown to cause anomalies. It is believed
that iodine deficiency causes endemic cretinism. However, the extent to which nutritional deficiencies are responsible for anomalies in humans is controversial.

### Antigenic Reactions

Hemolytic disease of the newborn.

### Drugs and Chemicals

Thalidomide, aminopterin (a folic acid antagonist); diphenylhydantoin and trimethadione (used for epilepsy); phenothiazine, lithium, meprobamate, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam (which are used as tranquilizers). Alcohol in fetal blood produces the fetal alcohol syndrome.

### Hormones

Administration of synthetic estrogens or progestins can cause malformations of external genitalia. Fetuses exposed to diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic estrogen) in intrauterine life, show increased incidence of carcinoma of the vagina and cervix in later life. Maternal diabetes can also cause congenital malformations.

### Physical Factors

- Abnormal intrauterine environment due to an abnormal site of implantation, due to the presence of twins, because of an abnormal position of the fetus within the uterus, because of too much amniotic fluid (hydramnios) or because of too little fluid (oligoamnios).
- Insufficient or excessive availability of oxygen. Too much oxygen leads to a condition called retrolental fibroplasia.
- Hyperthermia or increased body temperature is teratogenic. Increase in temperature may be due to fever secondary to infection, or due to bathing with hot water for long duration. Hyperthermia leads to mental retardation, cleft lip and cleft palate, limb deficiency, spina bifida and anencephaly.


## PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS OF FETAL DISEASES AND MALFORMATIONS

A physician can now detect congenital malformation or disease of the fetus even during early pregnancy. Early detection of severe abnormality helps the patient to decide the desirability of early termination of pregnancy. Many procedures are now available by which we can assess the fetal status within the womb of mother. These procedures are described briefly below.

### Ultrasonography

Ultrasonography is widely used to assess the condition of the developing fetus in utero because the investigation is cheap, readily available, and has no harmful effects. It can be done either by transvaginal or transabdominal method. By this procedure, one can determine:

- Fetal age and age-related growth of the fetus
- Presence or absence of congenital anomalies
- Position of fetus and placenta
- Whether there are multiple gestations
- Amount of amniotic fluid.


### Alpha-fetoprotein Assay

Alpha-fetoprotein is normally produced in the liver and in the gut of a fetus in the second trimester of pregnancy. It reaches amniotic fluid and maternal serum through the placenta. Its concentration increases when the fetus is suffering from congenital malformations like omphalocele, bladder exstrophy and intestinal atresia. However, its concentration decreases in a few chromosomal anomalies like Down syndrome and trisomy 18.

### Amniocentesis

In this procedure, a needle is passed through the abdominal wall of the mother and made to enter the amniotic cavity of the fetus. About 20 mL of amniotic fluid is withdrawn. This procedure is usually performed between the 15 weeks and 18 weeks of gestation. Amniotic fluid obtained is used for chemical analysis (alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase). Amniotic fluid also contains epithelial cells from the skin of the fetus. These can be used for karyotyping. These epithelial cells can also be used for determining the sex of the fetus by the simple procedure of detecting sex chromatin. Such tests are however illegal in India as they often lead to female feticide.

### Chorionic Villus Sampling

In this procedure, a sample of chorionic villus tissue is collected by entering the uterus either by an abdominal route or by a cervical route. The procedure is performed between 10 weeks to 12 weeks of gestation. The biopsies are used for detecting chromosomal abnormalities, inborn errors of metabolism or X-linked disorders.

### Fetoscopy

The fetal body may be directly observed for congenital anomalies by using a fiberoptic lighting instrument. This procedure is usually performed during 17-20 weeks of gestation.

### Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a fetus can be performed to get further information about conditions that have been detected in ultrasonographic images especially for fetal brain and spine for making a decision about the therapies. MRI is safe and provides high soft tissue contrast and resolution.

### Percutaneous Umbilical Cord Blood Sampling

In this procedure, fetal blood is drawn from the umbilical vein for diagnosis of many genetic conditions. The same procedure is also used for blood transfusion into the fetus or for injection of drugs.

## FETALTHERAPIES

Fetal therapies are therapeutic for treating a fetal condition (medical line of management) or correcting an anomaly (surgical line of management). In selected cases, treatment of a third trimester fetus is possible with limited success. Such treatment has been used for fetal anemias, hemolytic disease, fetal cardiac arrhythmia, thyroid dysfunction and surgical corrections.

### Fetal Transfusion

Fetal transfusion is given directly into the umbilical vein by the percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling (PUBS) procedure.

### Fetal Surgery

Surgical correction of some birth defects like congenital diaphragmatic hernias, urinary tract obstruction, etc. in the fetus has become possible. In this procedure, the uterus is opened by cesarean section and the fetus is operated upon directly. After repair of the defect, the fetus is placed back into the uterus. Most of the surgeries in utero are performed after 28th weeks of pregnancy.
