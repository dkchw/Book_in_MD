# Chapter 2 Genetics and Molecular Biology in Embryology

## HIGHLIGHTS

- Genetics is a branch of biology that deals with transmission of inherited characters (traits) from parent to offspring at the time of fertilization. Some of the characters/traits are dominant and some are recessive.
- Characters of parents are transmitted to offspring through codes borne on strands of DNA. Genes are made of such strands of DNA. They are located on chromosomes. Different forms of each gene are called alleles.
- A typical cell contains 46 chromosomes (= diploid number). A gamete contains 23 chromosomes (= haploid number). The diploid number of chromosomes is restored as a result of fertilization.
- The 46 chromosomes in each cell can be divided into 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes. The sex-chromosomes are $X X$ in female and $X Y$ in male.
- Multiplication of cells takes place by cell division. The usual method of cell division, seen in most tissues, is called mitosis. Daughter cells resulting from a mitotic division are similar to the parent cell, and have the same number of chromosomes (46).
- A special kind of cell division takes place in the testis and ovary for formation of gametes. It is called meiosis. The gametes resulting from meiosis have the haploid number of chromosomes (23). The various gametes formed do not have the same genetic content.
- Embryology includes development, differentiation, morphogenetic processes and controlled growth. These processes are controlled by genes. Most of these genes produce transcription factors that control transcription of RNA.
- The parts of a chromosome are two chromatids joined by a centromere. Depending on the position of centromere the chromosomes are classified.
- Karyotyping is the process by which chromosomes can be classified individually.
- Sex-chromatin is the small, dark-staining, condensed mass of inactivated X-chromosome within the nucleus of nondividing cell, i.e. during interphase.
- A pedigree chart is prepared to understand the pattern of occurrence (inheritance) of the disease in the families.


## GENETIC BASIS OF DEVELOPMENTAL ANATOMY

- Embryology includes development, differentiation, morphogenetic processes (cell migration, transformation, folding, invagination, evagination, apoptosis, etc.) and controlled growth.
- Genetics is a branch of biology that deals with transmission of inherited characters (traits) from parent
to offspring at the time of fertilization. Some of the characters/traits are dominant and some are recessive.
- Inheritance of characters is determined by factors (genes) that are passed on from one generation to another. Different forms of each gene are called alleles.
- Genetics is the study of genes. Genetics deals with:
- Inheritance of characters
- Physical and mental
- Normal and abnormal

- In individual and family
- In a race or population
- Mode of transmission of characters from generation to generation
- Hereditary factors (genes) and their expression during development (prenatalâ€”embryonic) and life (postnatal).


## GENES

- Genes are carriers of blueprints for formation of cells, tissues, organs, and organism. Genes are made up of a nucleic acid called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and all information is stored in the molecules of this substance. The genes are strung together to form structures containing long chains of DNA known as chromosomes.
- Genes are involved in the synthesis of proteins. Proteins are the most important constituents of our body. They make up the greater part of each cell and of intercellular substances. Enzymes, hormones and antibodies are also proteins.
- The nature and functions of a cell depend on the proteins synthesized by it. It is, therefore, not surprising that one cell differs from another because of the differences in the proteins that constitute it.
- Genes exert their influence on cellular functions by synthesis of proteins. The proteins synthesized differ from cell to cell and within the same cell at different times. This provides the basic mechanism for control of any process, including embryonic development.
- Proteins are the building blocks and are made of smaller units called amino acids. Differences in genes cause the building of different amino acids and proteins. These differences make individuals with different traits, e.g. hair color, eye color, skin color, blood groups, etc.
- We now know that genes control the development and functioning of cells, by determining what types of proteins will be synthesized within them. Thus, genes play an important role in the development of tissues and organs of an individual.
- A gene gives only the potential for the development of a trait. How this potential is achieved depends partly on the interaction between the genes and the interaction of the gene with the environment. For example, genetic tendency of overweight is influenced by environmental factors like food, exercise, stress, etc.
- Vast amount of information about individual genes and the various factors that are produced by them to control developmental processes step by step is available in the literature.
To understand genetic processes, we have to first know some facts about DNA structure.


### Basic Structure of DNA

- Each of the 100 trillion cells in our body except the red blood cells contains the genetic information (blueprint) of the individual (entire human genome). It is the DNA that contains the entire genetic code for almost every organism and provides template for protein synthesis. Watson and Crick 1953 described the structure of DNA. DNA in a chromosome is in the form of very fine fibers. Each fiber consists of two strands that are twisted spirally to form what is called a double helix resembling a ladder (Fig. 2.1).
- The two strands are linked to each other at regular intervals. Each strand of the DNA fiber consists of a chain of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar, i.e. deoxyribose, a molecule of phosphate and a base (Fig. 2.2). The phosphate of one nucleotide is linked to the sugar of the next nucleotide.
- The deoxyribose and phosphate molecules are always the same and provide for the structure (side of the ladder). The only difference between individuals is the order and arrangement of the four bases (rungs of the ladder). The base that is attached to the sugar molecule may be adenine, guanine, cytosine or thymine.
- The two strands of a DNA fiber are joined together by the linkage of a base on one strand with a base on the opposite strand (Fig. 2.2). This linkage is peculiar in that adenine on one strand is always linked to thymine on the other strand, while cytosine is always linked to guanine. Thus, the two strands are complementary and the arrangement of bases on one strand can be predicted

Fig. 2.2: Linkage of two chains of nucleotides to form part of a DNA molecule
from the other. The order in which these four bases are arranged along the length of a strand of DNA determines the nature of the protein that can be synthesized under its influence.

- Every protein is made up of a series of amino acids; the nature of the protein depending upon the amino acids present, and the sequence in which they are arranged. Amino acids may be obtained from food or may be synthesized within the cell. Under the influence of DNA, these amino acids are linked together in a particular sequence to form proteins.


### Ribonucleic Acid

In addition to DNA, cells contain another important nucleic acid called ribonucleic acid (RNA). The structure of a molecule of RNA corresponds fairly closely to that of one strand of a DNA molecule, with the following important differences.

- RNA contains the sugar ribose instead of deoxyribose.
- Instead of the base thymine, it contains uracil.

Ribonucleic acid is present both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of a cell. It is present in three main forms, namely messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA. Messenger RNA acts as an intermediary between the DNA of the chromosome and the amino acids present in the cytoplasm and play a vital role in the synthesis of proteins from amino acids.

### Synthesis of Protein

- A protein is made up of amino acids that are linked together in a definite sequence. This sequence is determined by the order in which the bases are arranged in a strand of DNA.
- Each amino acid is represented in the DNA molecule by a sequence of three bases (triplet code).
- The four bases in DNA are represented by their first letter, i.e. adenine (A), cytosine (C), thymine (T) and guanine (G). They can be arranged in various combinations so that as many as sixty-four code "words" can be formed from these four bases.
- There are only about 20 amino acids that have to be coded for so that each amino acid has more than one code. The code for a complete polypeptide chain is formed when the codes for its constituent amino acids are arranged in proper sequence. That part of the DNA molecule that bears the code for a complete polypeptide chain constitutes a structural gene or cistron.
- At this stage, it must be emphasized that a chromosome is very long and thread-like. Only short lengths of the fiber are involved in protein synthesis at a particular time. The main steps in the synthesis of a protein may now be summarized as follows.
- The two strands of a DNA fiber separate from each other (over the area bearing a particular cistron) so that the ends of the bases that were linked to the opposite strand are now free.
- A molecule of mRNA is synthesized using one DNA strand as a guide (or template), in such a way that one guanine base is formed opposite each cytosine base of the DNA strand, cytosine is formed opposite guanine, adenine is formed opposite thymine, and uracil is formed opposite adenine. In this way, the code for the sequence in which amino acids are to be linked is passed on from DNA of the chromosome to mRNA. This process is called transcription. That part of the mRNA strand that bears the code for one amino acid is called a codon.
- This molecule of mRNA now separates from the DNA strand and moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (passing through a nuclear pore).
- In the cytoplasm, the mRNA becomes attached to a ribosome.
- The cytoplasm also contains another form of RNA called tRNA. In fact, there are about 20 different types of tRNA each corresponding to one amino acid. On one side, tRNA becomes attached to an amino acid. On the other side, it bears a code of three bases (anticodon) that are complementary to the bases coding for its amino acid on mRNA. Under the influence of the ribosome, several units of tRNA, along with their amino acids, become arranged alongside the strand of mRNA in the sequence determined by the code on mRNA. This process is called translation.

- The amino acids now become linked to each other to form a polypeptide chain. From the above, it will be clear that the amino acids are linked up exactly in the order in which their codes are arranged on mRNA, which in turn, is based on the code on the DNA molecule. Chains of amino acids formed in this way constitute polypeptide chains. Proteins are formed by union of polypeptide chains.
The flow of information from DNA to RNA and finally to protein has been described as the "central dogma of molecular biology".


### Control of Development of Embryo

- Certain regions of the embryo have the ability to influence the differentiation of neighboring regions. For example, the influence exerted by the optic vesicle on the overlying surface ectoderm to differentiate into lens vesicle. If the optic vesicle is removed, the lens vesicle fails to form. Conversely, if the optic vesicle is transplanted elsewhere (e.g. under the skin of abdomen) the overlying skin there forms the lens vesicle. This experiment shows that the optic vesicle induces the differentiation of lens vesicle. The influence exerted by an area (optic vesicle) is called induction whereas the area exerting induction is called organizer. In interactions between tissues, one is inductor and the other is responder. Capacity to respond to the inductor is called competence. The factors that influence the competence to respond are called competence factors.
- Many inductive interactions are between epithelium and mesenchyme, i.e. epithelial mesenchymal interactions. For example, development of liver and pancreas due to interaction between endoderm of gut and adjacent mesoderm and endoderm of ureteric bud and metanephric blastema of mesodermal origin to form nephron. The interaction between optic vesicle (neuroectodermal derivative) and lens vesicle (surface ectodermal derivative) is an example for epithelial to epithelial interaction.
- The blastopore, the primary organizer mentioned in Chapter 1 when removed results in total failure of development of embryo.
- It is now known that the organizers exert their influence by elaborating chemical substances, which are probably complex proteins, including enzymes.
- The chemical substances elaborated by the organizer may be inductors that stimulate tissue differentiation or inhibitors that have a restraining influence on differentiation.
- With the advent of molecular biology, the production of organizers, inductors and inhibitors are controlled by genes.
- A study of controlling mechanisms can be termed as "Genetic control of development" or "Molecular control of development".


### Molecular (Genetic) Control of Growth, Differentiation and Development

- Several genes and gene families play important roles in the development of embryo. Most of these genes produce transcription factors that control transcription of RNA.
- Transcription factors play an important role in gene expression as they can switch genes on and off by activating or repressing them.
- Many transcription factors control other genes, which regulate fundamental embryological processes of induction, segmentation, migration, differentiation and apoptosis (programmed cell death). These fundamental differentiation factors are mediated by growth and differentiation factors, growth factor receptors and various cytoplasmic proteins.


### Components Required for Expression of a Gene

- Several components are required for gene expression. These are:

1. Growth factors-act as cell signaling molecules for induction of cellular differentiation.
2. Receptors-present on cell membrane and they recognize and respond to growth factors.
3. Activation of signal transducing proteins that is present within the cell cytoplasm.
4. Activation of transcription factor, which binds to DNA in the nucleus and finally leads to transcription (gene expression).

- Thus two different categories of molecules play an important role in embryonic development. They are signaling molecules and transcription factors.
- The signaling molecules like growth factors are present outside the cell and exert their effects on neighboring cells, or on cells located at a distance. They act by binding to the receptors on the plasma membrane of the cell and ultimately activate the transcription factors.
- The transcription factors are gene regulatory proteins, which are present in the nucleus and are responsible for gene expression and are therefore important molecules for control of embryonic development.
The various growth and differentiation factors and their functions are presented in Table 2.1.

## CHROMOSOMES

### Haploid and Diploid Chromosomes

- The number of chromosomes in each cell is fixed for a given species and in human beings, it is 46 . This is referred to as the diploid (or double) number.
- However, in spermatozoa and ova, the number of chromosomes is only half the diploid number, i.e. 23. This is called the haploid (or half) number.
- After fertilization, the resulting zygote has 23 chromosomes from the sperm (or father), and 23 from the ovum (or mother). The diploid number is thus restored.


### Autosomes and Sex Chromosomes

- The 46 chromosomes in each cell can be divided into 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes. The sex chromosomes may be of two kinds, X or Y .
- In a male, there are 44 autosomes, one X-chromosome and one Y-chromosome; while in a woman, there are 44 autosomes and two X-chromosomes in each cell (Fig. 2.3).
- When we study the 44 autosomes, we find that they really consist of 22 pairs, the two chromosomes forming a pair being exactly alike (homologous chromosomes).
- In a woman, the two X-chromosomes form another such pair; in a man, this pair is represented by one X - and one Y-chromosome.
- One chromosome of each pair is derived from the mother and the other from the father.
To understand the structure of the gametes and to study how they are formed, it is necessary to first review some facts regarding chromosomes and cell division.


### Chromosome Structure

In a resting cell, chromosomes are not visible under a light microscope, as their chromatin material is highly dispersed. However, during cell division, the chromatin network in the nucleus becomes condensed into a number of chromosomes. The appearance of a typical chromosome is illustrated in Figure 2.4.

It is made up of two rod-shaped structures or chromatids placed more or less parallel to each other. The chromatids are united to each other at a light staining area called
![img-7.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-7.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 2.4: Diagram to show the parts of a typical chromosome

the centromere (or kinetochore). Each chromatid has two arms, one on either side of the centromere. Individual chromosomes differ from one another in total length, in the relative length of the two arms and in various other characteristics; these differences enable us to identify each chromosome individually. Classification of chromosomes in this way is called karyotyping. Karyotyping makes it possible for us to detect abnormalities in chromosome number or in individual chromosomes.

### Significance of Chromosomes

The entire human body develops from the fertilized ovum. It is, therefore, obvious that the fertilized ovum contains all the information necessary for formation of the numerous tissues and organs of the body, and for their orderly assembly and function. Each cell of the body inherits from the fertilized ovum, all the directions that are necessary for it to carry out its functions throughout life. This tremendous volume of information is stored within the chromosomes of each cell.

Each chromosome bears on itself a very large number of structures called genes.

Traits (characters) of an individual are determined by genes carried on his (or her) chromosomes. As we have seen half of these are inherited from the father and half from mother. We have seen above that chromosomes are made up predominantly of a nucleic acid called $D N A$, and all information is stored in molecules of this substance.

When the need arises, this information is used to direct the activities of the cell by synthesizing appropriate proteins. To understand how this becomes possible, we must consider the structure of DNA in some detail.

### Duplication of Chromosomes

One of the most remarkable properties of chromosomes is that they are able to duplicate themselves. Duplication of chromosomes involves the duplication (or replication) of DNA. This takes place as follows (Fig. 2.5):

- The two strands of the DNA molecule to be duplicated unwind and separate from each other so that their bases are "free".
- A new strand is now synthesized opposite each original strand of DNA in such a way that adenine is formed opposite thymine; guanine is formed opposite cytosine, and vice versa.
- This new strand becomes linked to the original strand of DNA to form a new molecule.
- As the same process has taken place in relation to each of the two original strands, we now have two complete molecules of DNA.
- It will be noted that each molecule has one strand that belonged to the original molecule and one strand that is new. It will also be noted that the two molecules formed are identical to the original molecule.


### Structure of Fully Formed Chromosomes

- Each chromosome consists of two parallel rod-like elements that are called chromatids (Fig. 2.6).
- The two chromatids are joined to each other at a narrow area that is light staining and is called the centromere (or kinetochore). In this region, the chromatin of each chromatid is most highly coiled and, therefore, appears to be thinnest. The chromatids appear to the "constricted" here and this region is called the primary constriction.

Fig. 2.6: Diagram to show the terms applied to some parts of a typical chromosome

- Typically, the centromere is not midway between the two ends of the chromatids, but somewhat toward one end (Fig. 2.6). As a result, each chromatid can be said to have a long arm (denoted by letter q) and a short arm (denoted by letter p). Based on the position of centromere the chromosomes (Fig. 2.7) are classified as:

1. Metacentric: Centromere is centrally placed and the two arms are of equal length.
2. Submetacentric: Centromere is slightly away from the center and the two arms are only slightly different in length.
3. Acrocentric: Centromere is nearer to one end and the difference in length of arms is marked.
4. Telocentric: Centromere lies at one end.

- Differences in the total length of chromosomes and in the position of the centromere are important factors in distinguishing individual chromosomes from each other.
- Additional help in identification is obtained by the presence in some chromosomes of secondary constrictions. Such constrictions lie near one end of the chromatid. The part of the chromatid "distal" to the constriction may appear to be a rounded body almost
![img-11.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-11.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 2.7: Nomenclature used for different chromosomes based on differences in lengths of the arms of each chromatid
separate from the rest of the chromatid; such regions are called satellite bodies.

- Secondary constrictions are concerned with the formation of nucleoli and are, therefore, called nucleolar organizing centers.
- Considerable help in identification of individual chromosomes is also obtained by the use of special staining procedures by which each chromatid can be seen to consist of a number of dark and light staining transverse bands.
- Chromosomes are distinguishable only during mitosis. In the interphase (between successive mitoses), the chromosomes elongate and assume the form of long threads. These threads are called chromonemata (singular = chromonema).


### Karyotyping

- It is the procedure by which chromosomes can be mapped individually in an individual by applying the criteria described above.
- For this purpose, a sample of blood from the individual is put into a suitable medium in which lymphocytes can multiply. After a few hours, a drug (colchicine, colcemid) that arrests cell division at a stage when chromosomes are most distinct is added to the medium.
- The dividing cells are then treated with hypotonic saline so that they swell up. This facilitates the proper spreading out of chromosomes.
- A suspension containing the dividing cells is spread out on a slide and suitably stained.
- Cells in which the chromosomes are well spread out (without overlap) are photographed.
- The photographs are cut out and the chromosomes arranged in proper sequence.
- In this way, a map of chromosomes is obtained, and abnormalities in their number or form can be identified.
- In many cases, specific chromosomal abnormalities can be correlated with specific diseases.
According to Denver system of classification, the chromosomes including sex chromosomes are arranged into seven groups based on their length, position of centromere and presence of satellite bodies as shown in Table 2.2. Karyotypes of a normal male and a female are shown in Figures 2.8 and 2.9.


### Sex Chromatin

- Small, dark-staining, condensed mass of inactivated X-chromosome within the nucleus of nondividing cell, i.e. during interphase.
- Usually located just inside the nuclear membrane of the interphase nucleus.

Fig. 2.9: Karyotype-Normal female

- Present in most female mammals in the nuclei of all cells except the germ cells.
- Inactive mammalian X-chromosome is always late-replicating, and in eutherian mammals, it is heterochromatic and hypermethylated.
- The term "sex chromatin" comprises two superficially dissimilar structures:

1. Barr body, present in epithelial (oral, skin, vaginal, urethral, corneal) and other tissue cells (placenta, dental pulp, skin fibroblasts)
2. Drumstick/Davidson body in polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
Study of sex chromatin is a relatively simple diagnostic test for certain genetic abnormalities.

### Barr Body (Fig. 2.10A)

- Barr bodies are most commonly situated at the periphery of the nucleus.
- Count: Sex differences: males 1-2\%; females 20-80\%.
- Measurement: Approximately $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$.
- Barr bodies have several distinct shapes: Planoconvex/ Wedge-shaped/Rectangular.
- Maximum no. of Barr bodies/nucleus $=0$ (or) 1.
- Maximum no. of Barr bodies in diploid cells $=$ No. of X -chromosomes -1 , in tetraploids, it is two less than the no. of X-chromosomes, and in octaploids, it is four less than the no. of X-chromosomes. Patients with 4X-chromosomes have three Barr bodies.


### Drumstick (Davidson Body) (Fig. 2.10B)

- Appears as a deeply stained body attached to the nucleus of the polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
- Appendage is attached to a lobe of nucleus by a filament of variable length and thickness.
- It consists of head of about $1.5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter.
- Seen in all types of polymorphonuclear leukocytes but only that in neutrophils to be considered.
- Incidence: $2-3 \%$ or $6 / 500$ cells in normal females.
- It is a highly condensed X chromosome which, in the presence of another X chromosome, may be extruded from the main body of the nucleus of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.


### Chromosomal Abnormalities

Chromosomal abnormalities are classified broadly into numerical and structural. In each, those involving autosomes and those involving sex chromosomes are included (Tables 2.3 and 2.4).

### Allele

A normal (somatic) cell has two variants (alleles) for a trait/character. A gamete (sperm, egg) contains one allele,

![img-14.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-14.jpeg.jpg)

TABLE 2.3: Structural abnormalities of chromosomes

| Abnormality | Feature | Clinical condition |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Deletion | Loss of segment of a chromosome | - Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome-4p- <br> - Cri-du-chat syndrome-5p- |
| Microdeletion | Deletion detected by high-resolution banding | Proximal part of long arm of 15 q <br> - If paternally inheritedâ€”PraderWilli syndrome <br> - If maternally inheritedâ€”Angelman syndrome |
| Inversion | Detachment of a part of chromosome by 2 breaks | Rarely causes problem |
| Duplication | Abnormal splitting of chromosomes |  |
| Isochromosome | Duplication of one entire chromosome arm and deletion of other chromosome arm | Duplication of genes |
| Ring chromosome | Chromosome is deleted at both ends Deleted sticky ends adhere to each other in the form of a ring | Clinical manifestations depend on deletion of specific genes |
| Translocation | Exchange of segments between nonhomologous chromosomes | - May not always produce abnormal phenotype <br> - But can lead to formation of unbalanced gametes <br> - Carries high risk of abnormal progeny |

randomly chosen from the two somatic alleles. For example, if you have one allele for brown eyes (represented as B) and one for blue eyes (represented as b), somatic cells have alleles for both (Bb) and each gamete will carry one of it (B or b) chosen randomly.

TABLE 2.4: Numerical abnormalities of chromosomes

| Name of the <br> abnormality | Numerical anomaly | Autosomal/Sex <br> chromosomal |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Down syndrome | Trisomy, 21 | Autosomal |
| Edwards' syndrome | Trisomy, 18 | Autosomal |
| Patau syndrome | Trisomy,13 | Autosomal |
| Turner's syndrome | 45, XO | Sex chromosomal |
| Klinefelter's syndrome | 47, XXY | Sex chromosomal |

If the two alleles are different (heterozygous, e.g. Bb), the trait associated with only one of these will be visible (dominant) while the other will be hidden (recessive). For example, B is dominant, b is recessive. If two alleles are same (dominant/recessive) it is homozygous (e.g. BB/bb).

### Punnett Square

- It is a diagram used to predict the result of a genetic cross (Fig. 2.11).
- Used to determine the probability of an offspring having a particular genotype.
- For the above example, it can be shown as follows:
- Genotype: The state of the two alleles at one or more locus associated with a trait/character.
- Phenotype: The state of the observable trait/ character.
Genotype and phenotype for brown and blue eyes have been shown in Table 2.5.


### Symbols Used for Chromosomal Nomenclature

## INHERITANCE OF GENETIC DISORDERS

The pattern of inheritance of genetic disorders facilitates the diagnosis of the disorder, calculation of risk of the disorder in the present and future offspring and for counseling the parents. By obtaining family history, a pedigree chart is prepared to understand the pattern of occurrence (inheritance) of the disease in the families. By drawing a Punnett square the percentage risk can be interpreted.

### Pedigree Chart

It is a pictorial representation of generations of a family showing the information of family members and their relationship to one another, marriages among cousins (consanguineous) including details of live births, stillbirths and abortions, etc. A pedigree chart shows genetic connections among individuals using standardized
symbols. For drawing pedigree charts certain standard symbols are used (Fig. 2.12). Knowledge of probability and Mendelian patterns are required for understanding the basis for a trait. Conclusions are most accurate if they are drawn using large number of pedigrees (generations). A sample pedigree chart is presented in Figure 2.13.

According to the mode of transmission the genetic disorders can be classified as follows:

1. Autosomal dominant inheritance
2. Autosomal recessive inheritance
3. X-linked dominant inheritance
4. X-linked recessive inheritance
5. Y-linked inheritance
6. Multifactorial inheritance.

### Autosomal Dominant Inheritance (Fig. 2.14)

- The mode of transmission is vertical. An affected person has an affected parent.
- There is $50 \%$ of chance of dominant trait being transmitted to offsprings.
- Both males and females are equally affected.

Fig. 2.14: Pedigree chart of autosomal dominant inheritance

- Dominant gene is expressed in heterozygotes.
- Delayed age of onset.
- The trait appears in every generation without skipping.
- An unaffected offspring does not transmit the disease.
- Examples:
- Achondroplasia
- Angioneurotic edema
- Huntington's chorea
- Multiple neurofibromatosis
- Osteogenesis imperfecta.


### Autosomal Recessive Inheritance (Fig. 2.15)

- Horizontal transmission. The trait appears in sibs and parents are normal.
- History of consanguineous marriage. The parents are blood related. Both the couple are carriers of abnormal gene.
- $25 \%$ chance of having an affected child (double dose of abnormal gene) in a carrier couple.
- Early age of onset.
- Both males and females have an equal chance of getting affected.
- Examples:
- Cystic fibrosis
- Inborn errors of metabolism-albinism, phenylketonuria
- Hemoglobinopathies-sickle-cell anemia, thalassemia.


### X-linked Dominant Inheritance (Fig. 2.16A)

- Trait is more frequent in females than in males.
- Affected male transmit the trait to all his daughters not to his sons.
- Affected females if homozygote, transmit to all of her children.
- If affected females are heterozygote, transmit the trait to half her children of either sex.
- Example:
- Vitamin D-resistant rickets
- Xg blood groups.


### X-linked Recessive Inheritance (Fig. 2.16B)

- Females (XX) are the carriers. One X chromosome contains abnormal gene. Allelic gene on other X chromosome is normal.
- Males are the victims. When abnormal gene involves nonhomologous part of single X chromosome of male (XY) disease is expressed. Defective gene has no corresponding allele in Y chromosome to counteract.
- If mother is carrier and father is healthy, $50 \%$ of her sons are affected by the disease and $50 \%$ of her daughters are carriers.
- Examples:
- Hemophilia
- Partial color blindness
- Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
- Duchenne muscular dystrophy.


### Y-linked Inheritance (Fig. 2.15C)

- Y-linked traits are present in all male descendants of affected male.
- The genes that are carried on the Y-chromosome are called holandric genes.

Figs 2.16A to C: Pedigree chart of sex-linked inheritance. (A) X-linked dominant inheritance; (B) X-linked recessive inheritance; (C) Y-linked inheritance

- Dominant and recessive pattern will not apply as only one allele is present.
- Example:
- Hairy pinna.


### Multifactorial Inheritance

- It includes genetic and environmental factors like:
- Drugs-thalidomide, anticancer drugs, antiepileptic drugs and antimalarial drugs.
- Viral infections-rubella virus, papilloma virus
- Ionizing radiation-X-rays and radioactive substances like $\mathrm{I}^{131}$.
- Examples:
- Cleft lip and cleft palate
- Clubfoot
- Congenital heart disease
- Neural tube defects-anencephaly and spina bifida.


## CELL DIVISION

- Multiplication of cells takes place by division of preexisting cells. Such multiplication constitutes an essential feature of embryonic development. Cell multiplication is equally necessary after the birth of the individual for growth and for replacement of dead cells.
- We have seen that chromosomes within the nuclei of cells carry genetic information that controls the development and functioning of various cells and tissues; and, therefore, of the body as a whole. When a cell divides, it is essential that the entire genetic information within it be passed on to both the daughter cells resulting from the division. In other words, the daughter cells must have chromosomes identical in number (and in genetic content) to those in the mother cell. This type of cell division is called mitosis.
- A different kind of cell division called meiosis occurs during the formation of the gametes. This consists of two successive divisions called the first and second meiotic divisions. The cells resulting from these divisions (i.e. gametes) differ from other cells of the body in that
- the number of chromosomes is reduced to half the normal number.
- the genetic information in the various gametes produced is not identical.


### Mitosis

Many cells of the body have a limited span of functional activity, at the end of which they undergo division into two daughter cells. The daughter cells in turn have their own span of activity, followed by another division. The period during which the cell is actively dividing is the phase of
mitosis. The period between two successive divisions is called the interphase.

Mitosis is conventionally divided into a number of stages called prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. The sequence of events of the mitotic cycle is best understood starting with a cell in telophase. At this stage, each chromosome consists of a single chromatid (Fig. 2.17G). With the progress of telophase, the chromatin of the chromosome uncoils and elongates and the chromosome can no longer be identified as such. However, it is believed to retain its identity during the interphase (which follows telophase).
Interphase: This is shown diagrammatically in Figure 2.17A. During a specific period of the interphase, the DNA content of the chromosome is duplicated so that another chromatid identical to the original one is formed; the chromosome is now made up of two chromatids (Fig. 2.17B).
Prophase: When mitosis begins (i.e. during prophase), the chromatin of the chromosome becomes gradually more and more coiled so that the chromosome becomes recognizable as a thread-like structure that gradually acquires a rod-like appearance (Fig. 2.17C). Toward the end of prophase, the two chromatids constituting the chromosome become distinct (Fig. 2.17D) and the chromosome now has the typical structure illustrated in Figure 2.4. While these changes are occurring in chromosomes, a number of other events are also taking place. The two centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. They produce a number of microtubules that pass from one centriole to the other and form a spindle. Meanwhile the nuclear membrane breaks down and nucleoli disappear (Fig. 2.17D).
Metaphase: With the formation of the spindle, chromosomes move to a position midway between the two centrioles (i.e. at the equator of the cell) where each chromosome becomes attached to microtubules of the spindle by its centromere. This stage is referred to as metaphase (Fig. 2.17E).
Anaphase: The centromere of each chromosome splits longitudinally into two so that the chromatids now become independent chromosomes. At this stage, the cell can be said to contain 46 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome of each such pair now moves along the spindle to either pole of the cell (Fig. 2.17F).
Telophase: In this phase, the two daughter nuclei are formed by appearance of nuclear membranes. Chromosomes gradually elongate and become indistinct. Nucleoli reappear. The centriole is duplicated at this stage or in early interphase (Fig. 2.17G). The division of the nucleus is accompanied by the division of the cytoplasm. In this process, the organelles are presumably duplicated and each daughter cell comes to have a full complement of them.

Figs 2.17A to G: Scheme to show the main steps of mitosis

### Meiosis

The meiosis consists of two successive divisions called the first and second meiotic divisions. During the interphase preceding the first division, duplication of the DNA content of chromosomes takes place as in mitosis. As a result, another chromatid identical to the original one is formed. Thus, each chromosome is now made up of two chromatids.

### First Meiotic Division

Prophase: The prophase of the first meiotic division is prolonged and is usually divided into a number of stages as follows:
Leptotene: The chromosomes become visible (as in mitosis). Although each chromosome consists of two chromatids, these cannot be distinguished at this stage (Fig. 2.18A).

Zygotene: The 46 chromosomes in each cell consist of 23 pairs (the X- and Y-chromosomes of a male being taken as a pair). The two chromosomes of each pair come to lie parallel to each other, and are closely apposed. This pairing of chromosomes is also referred to as synapsis or conjugation. The two chromosomes together constitute a bivalent (Fig. 2.18B).
Pachytene: The two chromatids of each chromosome become distinct. The bivalent now has four chromatids in it and is called a tetrad. There are two central and two peripheral chromatids, one from each chromosome (Fig. 2.18C). An important event now takes place. The two central chromatids (one belonging to each chromosome of the bivalent) become coiled over each other so that they cross at a number of points. This is called crossing over. For sake of simplicity only one such crossing is shown in Figure

2.18D. At the site where the chromatids cross, they become adherent; the points of adherence are called chiasmata.
Diplotene: The two chromosomes of a bivalent now try to move apart. As they do so, the chromatids involved in crossing over "break" at the points of crossing and the "loose" pieces become attached to the opposite chromatid. This results in exchange of genetic material between these chromatids. A study of Figure 2.18E will show that each of the four chromatids of the tetrad now has a distinctive genetic content.
Metaphase: As in mitosis the 46 chromosomes become attached to the spindle at the equator, the two chromosomes of a pair being close to each other (Fig. 2.19A).
Anaphase: The anaphase differs from that in mitosis in that there is no splitting of the centromeres. One entire chromosome of each pair moves to each pole of the spindle (Fig. 2.19B). The resulting daughter cells, therefore, have 23 chromosomes, each made up of two chromatids (Fig. 2.19C).

Telophase: The anaphase is followed by the telophase in which two daughter nuclei are formed. The division of the nucleus is followed by division of the cytoplasm.

### Second Meiotic Division

The first meiotic division is followed by a short interphase. This differs from the usual interphase in that there is no duplication of DNA. Such duplication is unnecessary as chromosomes of cells resulting from the first division already possess two chromatids each (Fig. 2.19C).

The second meiotic division is similar to mitosis. However, because of the crossing over that has occurred during the first division, the daughter cells are not identical in genetic content (Fig. 2.20).

### Significance of Meiosis

- In this kind of cell division, there is reduction of the number of chromosomes from diploid to haploid. At the time of fertilization, the diploid number (46) is restored.

Fig. 2.20: Daughter cells resulting from the second meiotic division. These are not alike because of the crossing-over during first meiotic division

This provides consistency of chromosome number from generation to generation.

- The 46 chromosomes of a cell consist of 23 pairs, one chromosome of each pair being derived from the mother and one from the father. During the first meiotic division, the chromosomes derived from the father and those derived from the mother are distributed between the daughter cells entirely at random.
- This, along with the phenomenon of crossing over, results in thorough shuffling of the genetic material so that the cells produced as a result of various meiotic divisions (i.e. ova or spermatozoa); all have a distinctive genetic content.
- A third step in this process of genetic shuffling takes place at fertilization when there is a combination of randomly selected spermatozoa and ova. It is, therefore,
not surprising that no two persons (except identical twins) are alike.


### Clinical correlation

### Nondisjunction

After splitting of centromere one or more chromosomes fail to migrate properly due to abnormal function of achromatic spindle. This results in one daughter with trisomy and one with monosomy.

- Occurs both in mitosis and meiosis
- Involves both sex chromosomes and autosomes
- Autosomal nondisjunction less viable.
- Mitosis: Nondisjunction in first cleavage division of zygote leads to mosaicism
- Meiosis I: 2 disomic (24) + 2 nullisomic (22) gametes (Fig. 3.25)
- Meiosis II: 2 normal monosomic + 1 abnormal disomic + 1 abnormal nullisomic gametes (Fig. 3.26).


### Trisomy

- During gametogenesis:
- Meiosis I: The 2 chromosomes of a pair go to same pole
- Meiosis II: A pair of sister chromatids go to same pole
- Results in a gamete having 24 chromosomes.
- At fertilization:
- Abnormal gamete + Normal gamete $=$ Trisomy, i.e. 24 chromosomes +23 chromosomes $=47$ chromosomes in zygote.


### Monosomy

- During gametogenesis:
- Meiosis I: The 2 chromosomes of a pair go to one gamete
- Meiosis II: A pair of sister chromatids go to same gamete
- Results in a gamete having 22 chromosomes.
- At fertilization:
- Abnormal gamete + Normal gamete $=$ Monosomy, i.e. 22 chromosomes +23 chromosomes $=45$ chromosomes in zygote.
