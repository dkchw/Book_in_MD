# Chapter 19 Development of Eye

## HIGHLIGHTS

- The visual system consists of eyeball, eyelids, extraocular muscles of eyeball and lacrimal apparatus.
- It includes walls/layers, refractive media and optic nerve.
- Developmental primordia of eyeball are optic vesicle, lens placode and the mesoderm surrounding the optic vesicle.
- Optic vesicle is an outgrowth of the prosencephalon. The optic vesicle is converted into the optic cup. Retina, the nervous layer of eyeball develops from the optic cup.
- Lens placode is a thickening of surface ectoderm close to optic vesicle from which the lens develops. Lens placode is converted to lens vesicle.
- Other coats of the eyeball (choroid, sclera) are derived from mesoderm surrounding the optic vesicle. The epithelium covering the superficial surface of the cornea is derived from surface ectoderm.
- The eyelids are formed by reduplication of surface ectoderm above and below the cornea.
- The lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct are derived from ectoderm buried in the naso-optic furrow.


## INTRODUCTION

The various components of the eyeball are derived from the following primordia:

- Neuroectodermal outgrowth of the prosencephalon called the optic vesicle that forms retina, iris, and optic nerve.
- Specialized area of surface ectoderm (called the lens placode) that gives rise to the lens and corneal epithelium.
- Mesoderm surrounding the optic vesicle that forms fibrous and vascular coats of eye.
- Migrating neural crest cells that contribute for choroid, sclera and corneal epithelium.


## FORMATION OF THE OPTIC VESICLE

- The region of the neural plate (Fig. 19.1A) destined to form the diencephalic part of prosencephalon shows a
linear thickened area on either side (Fig. 19.1B) around 22nd day of development (8th somite stage).
- This area soon becomes depressed to form the optic sulcus (Fig. 19.1C).
- Meanwhile, the neural plate becomes converted into the prosencephalic vesicle. As the optic sulcus deepens, the wall of the prosencephalon overlying the sulcus bulges outwards to form the optic vesicle (Fig. 19.1D).
- The proximal part of the optic vesicle becomes constricted, and elongated, to form the optic stalk (Fig. 19.2C).


## FORMATION OF LENS VESICLE

- As the optic vesicle grows laterally, it comes into relation with the surface ectoderm. An area of this surface ectoderm, overlying the optic vesicle, becomes thickened to form the lens placode (Fig. 19.2A).

- The lens placode soon sinks below the surface to form lens pit. The ends of lens pit come closer and form lens vesicle (Figs 19.2B and C).
- The lens vesicle becomes completely separated from the surface ectoderm (Fig. 19.2D) by 33rd day of development.
- The proximal part of optic vesicle elongates into a narrow structure called optic stalk.


## FORMATION OF THE OPTIC CUP

- While the lens vesicle is forming, the optic vesicle becomes converted into a double-layered optic cup (Fig. 19.2C).
- The optic cup is formed not because of the invagination of the developing lens into the optic vesicle. The conversion of the optic vesicle, to the optic cup, is a result of differential growth of the wall of the vesicle.

- The margins of the cup grow over the upper and lateral sides of the lens to enclose it. However, such overgrowth does not take place on the inferior aspect of the lens, as a result of which the wall of the cup shows a deficiency in this situation. This deficiency extends for some distance along the inferior surface of the optic stalk and is called the choroidal or fetal fissure (Fig. 19.3).
- The vascular mesoderm in choroid fissure forms the hyaloid vessels that supply optic cup and lens vesicle. The distal part of hyaloid vessels degenerate whereas the proximal parts persists as central artery and vein of retina.
- The developing neural tube is surrounded by mesoderm, which subsequently condenses to form the meninges. An extension of this mesoderm covers the optic vesicle. Later, this mesoderm differentiates to form a superficial fibrous layer corresponding to the dura mater, and a deeper vascular layer corresponding to the piaarachnoid (Figs 19.2D and 19.4A).
![img-484.jpeg](img-484.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 19.3: Optic cup and stalk seen from below to show the choroidal fissure

- With the formation of the optic cup, part of the inner vascular layer is carried into the cup through the choroidal fissure (Fig. 19.4A). With the closure of fissure, the mesenchyme that is inside the optic cup gives rise to hyaloid system of vessels.
- The outer fibrous layer surrounding anterior part of optic cup forms cornea. The corresponding vascular layer forms the iridopupillary membrane which attaches to anterior part of optic cup and forms iris.


## DERIVATION OF PARTS OF THE EYEBALL

The derivation of the various parts of the eyeball can now be summarized as follows (Table. 19.1):

### Lens

- The lens is formed from the lens vesicle.
- The lens vesicle is at first lined by a single layer of cuboidal cells (Fig. 19.5A).
- The cells in the anterior wall of the vesicle remain cuboidal. Those in the posterior wall gradually become elongated and become columnar (Figs 19.5B to D). As they do so the cavity of the vesicle is encroached upon and is eventually obliterated.
- The elongated cells of the posterior wall lose their nuclei and are converted into the primary fibers of the lens. The anterior layer remains as the epithelium covering this aspect of the lens (Figs 19.4B and 19.5D).
- The cells at the equatorial region of lens form the secondary lens fibers that continue to form from the anterior epithelium during childhood, thus increasing the diameter of the lens.
- While the secondary lens fibers are forming the primary lens, fibers become harder.

Figs 19.5A to D: Stages in the formation of lens of the eye

- In the beginning, the lens is supplied by hyaloid artery. Later with the degeneration of distal part of artery, the lens is deprived of its blood supply and becomes an avascular structure.


### Retina

The retina is derived from the layers of the optic cup.

- The optic cup is divisible into anterior and posterior parts.
- The larger posterior part becomes thick and forms the retina proper (optical part of retina) (Fig. 19.4B).
- The anterior part remains thin and forms an epithelial covering for the ciliary body and iris (ciliary and iridial parts of retina) (Fig. 19.4B).
- There are two layers in the retina.
- The outer wall of the posterior part of the optic cup remains thin. Its cells form the pigmented layer of the retina (Figs 19.6A and B).
- The inner wall of the cup is called the nervous layer that differentiates into matrix, mantle and marginal layers as in the neural tube. After giving origin to the cells of the mantle layer, the cells of the matrix layer form the rods and cones. The cells of the mantle layer form the bipolar cells, the ganglion cells, other neurons of the retina, and also the supporting elements. The axons of the ganglion cells grow into the marginal layer to form the layer of nerve fibers. These fibers grow into the optic stalk by passing through the choroidal fissure. The optic stalk, is thus, convened into the optic nerve (Figs 19.6A and B).
- The space between the pigmented and nervous layers is called intraretinal space that represents the original cavity of optic cup (Figs 19.6A and B). With the proliferation of cells of inner layer, this space gets obliterated before birth, and the rod and cone cells come in contact with pigment epithelium.


### Vitreous

- The vitreous is believed to be derived partly from ectoderm and partly from mesoderm.
- The ectodermal component is derived mainly from the optic cup but the lens vesicle may also contribute to it.
- The mesodermal component comes into the optic cup through the choroidal fissure.


### Choroid

- The choroid is formed from the inner vascular layer of mesoderm that surrounds the optic cup (Figs 19.4A and 19.6A and B).
- According to some authorities, this mesoderm contains cells derived from the neural crest.
- Anteriorly, the choroid is continuous with ciliary body and posteriorly it is continuous with pia-arachnoid around optic nerve.

![img-487.jpeg](img-487.jpeg.jpg)

### Ciliary Body and Iris

- The mesodermal basis of the ciliary body and iris is derived from a forward prolongation of the mesoderm forming the choroid.
- The inner surface of this mesoderm comes to be lined by two layers of epithelium (pigment and nervous layers) derived from the ciliary and iridial parts of the retina.

The two layers of epithelium correspond to the two layers of the optic cup (Fig. 19.6B).

- The ciliary muscle has been generally regarded as mesodermal but the present view is that they are of neural crest origin. The connective tissue of ciliary body is derived from mesoderm. The musculature of the iris (sphincter and dilator pupillae) is of ectodermal origin (neuroectodermal cells of optic cup).

- The extension of iris does not extend up to the center leaving a gap known as the pupil. The color of the iris depends on the concentration of pigments in pigmentcontaining cells (chromatophores) in the iris. The iris is blue if the melanin pigment is concentrated on the posterior surface of the iris and is brown if it is distributed in the stroma.


### Sclera

- The sclera is formed from the posterior part of the outer fibrous layer of mesoderm surrounding the optic cup, and corresponds to the dura (Figs 19.4A and 19.6A and B).
- Some authorities believe that (like the choroid) the mesoderm forming the sclera is infiltrated by cells from the neural crest.


### Cornea

- The Bowman's layer, substantia propria, Descemet's membrane and inner endothelium of the cornea are derived from the neural crest and are formed by the same layer that forms the sclera.
- The superficial surface epithelium of the cornea is derived from the surface ectoderm (Figs 19.6A and B).


### Anterior and Posterior Chambers of Eye

- The anterior and posterior chambers of the eye (aqueous chamber) are formed by a splitting of the mesoderm in the region, and correspond to the subarachnoid space of the brain.
- The cavity of the anterior chamber is formed by vacuolization of mesoderm present anterior to the lens.
- Vacuolization splits the mesenchyme into outer (anterior) and inner (posterior) layers.
- The outer layer becomes continuous with the sclera and with the substantia propria of the cornea.
- The inner layer lies in front of lens and iris and is termed the pupillary membrane (Fig. 19.6A).
- The mesodermal cells lining the cavity give origin to a flattened mesothelium.


### Blood Vessels

- The blood vessels of the eyeball are formed in the mesodermal layer that is a continuation of the piaarachnoid.
- Part of this mesoderm that gets invaginated into the optic cup, forms the retinal vessels. The central artery
and vein of the retina at first lie in the choroidal fissure, but come to be buried in the fibers of the developing optic nerve. As the choroidal fissure extends for some distance along the optic stalk, the central artery of the retina runs through the substance of the distal part of the optic nerve.
- Initially, the lens is completely surrounded by a vascular capsule. The posterior part of the capsule is supplied by the hyaloid artery (Fig. 19.6A). This artery is a continuation of the central artery of the retina and passes through the vitreous. Later in fetal life, the vascular capsule and the hyaloid artery disappear, but the hyaloid canal in the vitreous (through which the artery passes) persists (Fig. 19.6B).
- The anterior part of the vascular capsule of the lens, comes to be lined posteriorly by the iridial part of the retina, and forms the iris (Figs 19.6A and B). The pupil is for some time closed by a part of this vascular tissue, which is termed the iridopupillary membrane. This membrane normally disappears before birth.


## ACCESSORY STRUCTURES OF EYEBALL

### Eyelids

- The eyelids are formed by reduplication of the surface ectoderm above and below the cornea (Figs 19.7A and B).
- The ectodermal folds formed contain some mesoderm that gives rise to muscle and to the tarsal plates.
- As the folds enlarge, their margins approach each other. Ultimately, they meet and fuse together.
- The lids, thus, cut off a space called the conjunctival sac. The conjunctiva is, thus, of ectodermal origin.
- The lids remain united with each other until the 7th month of intrauterine life.
- The eyelashes and glands in the eyelids develop from surface ectoderm.


### Lacrimal Apparatus

- The lacrimal gland is formed from a number of buds that arise from the upper angle of the conjunctival sac (Fig. 19.7D).
- The lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct are derived from the ectoderm of the naso-optic (or nasolacrimal) furrow (Fig. 19.8). This furrow lies along the line of junction of the maxillary process and the lateral nasal process, and extends from the medial angle of the eye to the region of the developing mouth (Fig. 19.9). The ectoderm of

Fig. 19.10: Formation of nasolacrimal duct
the furrow becomes buried to form a solid cord that is subsequently canalized (Fig. 19.10). The upper part of this cord forms the lacrimal sac. The lower part, acquires a secondary connection to the nasal cavity, and forms the nasolacrimal duct.

- The lacrimal canaliculi are formed by canalization of ectodermal buds that arise from the margin of each
eyelid near its medial end and grow to the lacrimal sac.


### Extraocular Muscles of Eyeball

- They are derived from preoccipital myotomes that are supplied by 3rd, 4th and 6th cranial nerves.

### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the eyeball

- Anophthalmos: The entire eyeball may fail to develop.
- Microphthalmos: The entire eyeball may remain very small.
- Cyclopia: The two eyes may fuse completely to form one median eye (Figs 19.11A, C and D).
- Synophthalmos: The two eyes may fuse partially (Fig. 19.11B). There will be associated under development of prosencephalon (holoprosencephaly) and frontonasal process (proboscis).
- The optic vesicle may not be invaginated by the lens and may remain as a cyst.
- Coloboma: It results from failure of the choroidal fissure to obliterate completely. It may lead to deficiencies (clefts) in various layers of the eyeball including the iris, ciliary body and choroid (Fig. 19.12B).
- The cornea may be absent. It may show anomalies of size and shape, and may also show congenital opacities.
- The sclera may be thin with the result that the pigment of the choroid can be seen through it (blue sclera).
- In addition to various types of coloboma, the iris may show anomalies of its histological structure. Very rarely, the sphincter or dilator pupillae muscle may be absent. The pupil may be abnormal in position, shape or size.
- The lens may, very rarely, be absent or may be very small. It may be abnormal in position or shape. It may show congenital opacities (cataract). Congenital cataract may be due to parathyroid deficiency, to avitaminosis or to the infection, German measles (acquired during early pregnancy). Cataract may be genetically determined.
- The hyaloid artery and the vascular capsule of the lens, or their remnants, may persist. When the capsule persists on the anterior aspect of the lens, it may completely occlude the pupil (persistent pupillary membrane).
- The various layers of the eye may show anomalies of pigmentation. There may either be too little pigment as in albinism, or too much.
- The retina may show various congenital anomalies in its structure. These may involve the macula, and may result in visual defects, including those of color vision.
- Retinal detachment takes place along the intraretinal space, which is the plane of cleavage between pigment epithelium and nervous layers of retina.


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of accessory structures of eye

### Anomalies of eyelids and related structures

- The eyelids may very rarely be absent. In these cases, there is no conjunctival sac. The conjunctiva and the cornea are replaced by skin.
- Coloboma of eyelid: Part of the eyelid may be missing (Fig. 19.12A).
- The palpebral fissure may be abnormally wide or narrow. It may be abnormal in orientation and shape. The two lids may be completely, or partially, fused with each other.
- There may be abnormal folds of skin in relation to the lids. Similar folds, e.g. epicanthus (Fig. 19.12C) may be a normal feature in certain races.
- The lid margins may be turned inwards (entropion) (Fig. 19.13B) or outwards (ectropion) (Fig. 19.13C) and rarely, the whole lid may be everted. Normal lid margins are shown in Fig. 19.3A.

Figs 19.11A to D: (A) Synophthalmos (fused median eye); (B) Synophthalmos with proboscis above the median eye; (C) A section through synophthalmos; (D) A fetus with cyclops and proboscis

- The levator palpebrae superioris may fail to develop. This leads to drooping of the lids (ptosis).
- The eyelashes, and eyebrows, may be missing, or may be duplicated. The eyelashes may be abnormal in direction.


### Anomalies of the lacrimal apparatus

- The lacrimal gland may be absent or nonfunctional. The gland may be ectopic in position.
- The lacrimal passages may be absent in whole or in part, or there may be atresia of some part.
- The lacrimal duct may be represented by an open furrow on the face, due to nonobliteration of the naso-optic furrow (see oblique facial cleft, Fig. 11.2A).
- There may be supernumerary puncta, or canaliculi.


### Molecular and genetic basis of eyeball development

- The proteins Wnt, BMP, TGF- $\beta$ and FGF (fibroblast growth factor) are responsible for optic vesicle and PAX6 for lens vesicle differentiation.
- Inhibition of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and expansion of PAX2 expression causes failure of separation of eyes resulting in cyclops. Overexpression of SHH causes a loss of eye structures.
- Vitamin A deficiency during embryonic development can result in anterior segment defects (of cornea and eyelid).

## EMBRYOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR CLINICAL CONDITIONS OR ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS IN EYEBALL

### Case Scenario 1

A newly delivered baby presented cleft in the lower part of iris. What is the name given to this condition? Explain the embryological basis and name the structures that are involved.

This condition is called coloboma of the iris. As the optic cup is approaching the lens vesicle to enclose it, there will be a gap in the inferior surface of optic cup extending onto the optic stalk. This gap is called choroid fissure or fetal fissure. Through this fissure, the hyaloid artery reaches the

![img-494.jpeg](img-494.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 19.13A to C: (A) Normal lid; (B) Entropion; (C) Ectropion
posterior pole of eye. In normal development, the distal part of hyaloid artery degenerates and the choroid fissure fuses. Failure of fusion of choroid fissure results in coloboma. The nonfusion can occur at any part along the length of the choroid fissure. If the failure is in the distal part, it results in coloboma of iris. If it occurs in proximal part, it can cause coloboma of retina/choroid/optic nerve depending on the location of defect. Mutation of PAX2 gene is responsible for this condition. It can be also associated with renal defects and is called renal coloboma syndrome.

### Case Scenario 2

A newly born dead fetus presented with absence of eyes and nose. But on close observation, a median oblique cleft with a tubular appendage was noticed in the middle of forehead region. What is the name given to this condition? Explain the embryological basis and name the structures that are involved. Give the causes for this abnormality. Can it be diagnosed prenatally and if identified what medical advice to be given to the parents?

It is a case of severe craniofacial malformation. This condition is called holoprosencephaly with synophtholmos and proboscis. Holoprosencephaly is a structural malformation of the brain. There will be partial or total nonseparation of prosencephalon (forebrain). Majority of cases of holoprosencephaly are associated with a single completely fused eye (cyclops) in a single orbit or partially fused eyes (synophtholmos), absence of nose (arhinia) and a tubular appendage called proboscis. The cause for this condition can be genetic or there are environmental causes like maternal diabetes, alcohol use, etc. It can be diagnosed by fetal ultrasound or fetal MRI. This condition is not compatible with life and majority die in utero. If diagnosed prenatally, the parents should be advised termination of pregnancy to avoid mental agony.
