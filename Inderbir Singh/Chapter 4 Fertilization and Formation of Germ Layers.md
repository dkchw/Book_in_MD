# Chapter 4 Fertilization and Formation of Germ Layers

## HIGHLIGHTS

- Fertilization of the ovum takes place in the ampulla of the uterine. The fertilized ovum is a large cell. It undergoes a series of divisions (cleavage).
- When there are 16 cells the ovum is called a morula. It has an inner cell mass covered by an outer layer of cells, the trophoblast.
- Fluid partially separates the inner cell mass from trophoblast. The morula now becomes a blastocyst.
- The cells of the inner cell mass multiply, and are rearranged to form an embryonic disc having two layers. These layers are the epiblast and the hypoblast. Later, the epiblast differentiates into three germ layers, the ectoderm (outer), the endoderm (inner) and the mesoderm (middle). Cells of the hypoblast become flattened and line the yolk sac.
- A cavity appears on the ectodermal side of the disc. This is the amniotic cavity. Another cavity appears on the endodermal side. This is the yolk sac.
- At first the walls of the amniotic cavity and yolk sac are in contact with trophoblast. They are soon separated from the latter by extraembryonic mesoderm.
- A cavity, the extraembryonic coelom appears and splits the extraembryonic mesoderm into a somatopleuric layer (in contact with trophoblast) and a splanchnopleuric layer (in contact with yolk sac).
- The trophoblast and underlying somatopleuric mesoderm form a membrane called the chorion. The cells forming the wall of the amniotic cavity form the amnion.
- The amniotic cavity is now attached to trophoblast by mesoderm into which the extraembryonic coelom has not extended. This mesoderm forms the connecting stalk.
- If we view the embryonic disc from the ectodermal side near one edge it has a rounded area called the prochordal plate. Here ectoderm and endoderm are not separated by mesoderm.
- An elevation, the primitive streak, is also seen on the embryonic disc. A line drawn through the prochordal plate and the primitive streak divides the embryonic disc into right and left halves.
- Cells multiplying in the primitive streak move into the interval between ectoderm and endoderm and form the mesoderm (third germ layer).
- Caudal to the primitive streak we see a round area called the cloacal membrane. It is made up only of ectoderm and endoderm.


## INTRODUCTION

In Chapter 3, we have seen that while the ovarian follicle is growing, the oogonium within it undergoes maturation. The oogonium enlarges to form a primary oocyte. The primary oocyte undergoes the first meiotic division to shed
off the first polar body and becomes a secondary oocyte (Figs 4.1A and E).

At the time of ovulation, the second meiotic division is in progress and a spindle has formed for separation of the second polar body (Fig. 4.1B). At this stage, the "ovum" enters the infundibulum of the uterine tube and passes into the ampulla (Fig. 4.2).

## FERTILIZATION

- Definition: Process of fusion of two highly specialized/ highly differentiated/mature, haploid germ cells, an ovum and a spermatozoon resulting in the formation of a most unspecialized/undifferentiated/diploid, mononucleated single cell, the zygote.
- The process of human fertilization is very complicated and comprises of many components and steps. Both
male and female gametes have to complete a number of biological processes prior to actual process of fertilization.
- Fertilization is a signal for completion of second meiotic division. Out of a few hundred capacitated sperms, that surround the ovum, only one pierces the zona pellucida and enters the ovum. As soon as one spermatozoon enters the ovum, the second meiotic division is completed, and the second polar body is extruded.

Fig. 4.2: Path taken by the sperm and ovum, for fertilization
Hence, it is a signal for completion of second meiotic division (Fig. 4.1C).

- Fertilization is fusion of male and female pronuclei (Fig. 4.1D) as the nucleus of the ovum becomes the female pronucleus. The head of the spermatozoon (which is formed from the nucleus) separates from the middle piece and tail, and transforms itself into the male pronucleus. Soon thereafter, the pronuclei lose their nuclear membranes. The 23 chromosomes of the female pronucleus (Fig. 4.3A) and 23 of the male pronucleus get mixed up and form 23 pairs (46 nos; Fig. 4.3B). Hence, fertilization is the fusion of male and female pronuclei/ chromosomes.
- Fertilization is antithesis of cell division. Fusion of haploid chromosomes of male (23 nos.) and female (23 nos.) pronuclei results in 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). These undergo changes like those in a typical mitotic division leading to the formation of an embryo having two cells (Figs 4.3C and D). Strictly speaking, there is no one-cell stage of the embryo. The middle piece and the tail soon separate from the head of the sperm and degenerate. Fertilization initiates mitotic division of zygote resulting in the formation of a multicellular organism. Hence, it is antithesis of cell division.
- Site of fertilization: Fertilization of the ovum occurs in the ampulla or lateral one-third of uterine tube (Fig. 4.2).
- Stages: The various events in fertilization can be described in three stages.

1. Approximation of gametes
2. Contact and fusion of gametes
3. Effects/Results of fertilization.

1. Approximation of gametes: It is by transport of male and female gametes in the female genital tract (Fig. 4.4-stage 1).
a. Spermatozoon transport-following events play an important role in successful fertilization.

- Semen: The semen, also known as seminal fluid, is an organic fluid that contains spermatozoa. It includes secretions of seminal vesicle ( $60 \%$ ), prostate ( $25 \%$ ) and bulbourethral glands ( $5 \%$ ) and the spermatozoa ( $10 \%$ ). The secretions from seminal vesicle are rich in fructose that provides energy for the spermatozoa. The secretions of prostate contain ions, citric acid, acid phosphatase and fibrinogen (clotting of semen). The secretions of bulbourethral glands act as pre-ejaculatory lubricant. The normal amount of semen produced at each ejaculation is about $2-3 \mathrm{~mL}$. The number of spermatozoa released in each ejaculation is 100 million $/ \mathrm{mL}$. The pH of semen is maintained (7.2-7.6) by a base spermine present in it. The semen contains fibrinolysin that liquefies semen in 30 minutes after ejaculation.
- Maturity and motility of sperms: During their passage through male genital tract the spermatozoa mature. Movements of tail are important for their motility. Motility is important for penetration of three barriers surrounding the ovum.
- Transport of sperms: The prostaglandins present in semen stimulate peristaltic contractions of female genital tract at the time of sexual intercourse. During their transport there will be reduction in the number of spermatozoa due to the constrictions in female genital tract. Movements of their tails through uterus and tubes assisted by muscular contraction are responsible for the movement of spermatozoa. Time taken for transport to uterus is $5-45$ minutes.
- Fate of spermatozoa in female genital tract: Around 200-500 million sperms are deposited in the female genital tract and about 300-500 spermatozoa only reach the site of fertilization. The life span/viability of spermatozoa after ejaculation is $24-48$ hours. They have greater motility; hence, they rapidly lose the fertilizing power. Acidic vaginal pH decreases and alkalinity increases motility of spermatozoa. The spermatozoa are attracted to the ovum by a mechanism known as chemotaxis, i.e. release of certain chemicals by the follicular cells.
- Capacitation: Capacitation is the final step in maturation of spermatozoon before actual
fertilization and it takes place in female genital tract. It is a species-specific interaction between sperm and oocyte. The time required for capacitation is 7 hours. It starts in the uterus and continues into the tubes. The mechanism of capacitation is not known. It involves number of changes including changes in the sperm cell membrane and signal transduction (calcium influx, release of acrosomal enzymes, etc.). Certain major changes in surface glycoproteins (removal of glycoprotein cut and exposing zona binding proteins) is caused by secretions of the female genital tract thus allowing sperm-egg binding. An immunological reaction between the fertilizin on ovum and anti-fertilizin on spermatozoon is also proposed. Follicular fluid is thought to enhance the capacitation.
b. Ovum transport: The structure of ovum at ovulation, transport of ovum from ovary to ampulla of uterine tube and the viability of sperm are important for the success of fertilization.
- Structure of ovum at ovulation: At ovulation the ovum contains secondary oocyte with 23 unpaired chromosomes enclosed in vitelline membrane, surrounded by zona pellucida with proteins and corona radiata with matrix rich in hyaluronic acid.
- Transport of ovum from ovary to ampulla of uterine tube: The fimbriae of uterine tube moves over the ovary at ovulation and the ciliary beats of fimbriae sweeps the ovulatory mass into the infundibulum. The ciliary beats of uterine epithelium and muscular contractions of uterine tube are responsible for transcoelomic migration of ovum from the surface of ovary into the ampulla of uterine tube. The ovum reaches ampulla, the site of fertilization in 25 minutes.
- Viability of ovum: The ovum that is released at ovulation is viable for $24-48$ hours. In the absence of fertilization it degenerates.

2. Contact and fusion of gametes: There are three barriers which the sperm has to penetrate before fusing with the ovum (Fig. 4.4-stages 1 and 2). They are:
3. Corona radiata
4. Zona pellucida
5. Vitelline membrane

Four processes are involved in the penetration of these barriers. They are
i. Acrosome reaction
ii. Disintegration of barriers

![img-59.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-59.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 4.4: Stages in penetration of a spermatozoon into an ovum
iii. Calcium wave in oocyte cytoplasm
iv. Nuclear fusion
i. Acrosome reaction:

- Definition: Process of multiple contacts that capacitated sperm head establishes between plasma membrane and outer membrane of acrosomal cap, and discharging chemical substances that facilitate penetration of barriers around oocyte in succession.
- Coverings of sperm head: The head of the sperm has three coverings. From inside out they are nuclear envelope, bilaminar acrosomal membrane containing enzymes for penetration of oocyte and plasma membrane (Fig. 4.5).
- Release of acrosomal enzymes: The acrosome reaction must be completed to facilitate fusion of sperm with the secondary oocyte. It occurs when sperms come into contact with the corona radiata of the oocyte (Figs 4.4-stage 1 and 4.5). Perforations develop in the acrosome. Point fusions of the sperm plasma membrane and the outer acrosomal membrane occur. The acrosome reaction is associated with the release of acrosome enzymes that facilitate penetration of the zona pellucida by the sperm (Figs 4.4 -stages 2 and 3 and 4.5 B and C). The three acrosome enzymes that are released are hyaluronidase, the protease enzyme acrosin and

![img-60.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-60.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 4.5A to C: Covering of acrosome and release of acrosomal enzymes
acid phosphatase. The glycoprotein of the zona pellucida is responsible for induction of the acrosomal reaction.
ii. Disintegration of barriers: The sperm has to pass through the following three barriers in order. Disintegration of each barrier is by enzyme reaction (Fig. 4.4).

- Corona radiata: Penetration of this first barrier depends on the release of hyaluronidase from the acrosome of sperm, tubal mucosal enzymes and movements of tail of spermatozoon also aids in penetration of corona radiata (Fig. 4.4-stage 1). The hyaluronidase digests the cells of corona radiata.
- Zona pellucida: The glycoproteins on the outer surface of sperm head binds with glycoproteins on the zona pellucida of ovum. This is by binding to Zp3 and Zp2 receptors (Fig. 4.4stage 2). Acrosin causes digestion of ZP around sperm head. The reaction of zona is to prevent polyspermy. Alterations in the plasma membrane of oocyte and zona pellucida ensure that no other spermatozoon can enter the oocyte. The zona pellucida is altered due to release of lysosomal enzymes by plasma membrane of the oocyte. This process is called zona reaction.
- Vitelline membrane: When a spermatozoon comes in contact with the oocyte, plasma membranes of the two cells fuse (Fig. 4.4-stages 3 and 4). This probably occurs at receptor sites that are specific for a species. The disintegrin peptide released from sperm head initiates
fusion. The vitelline membrane contains integrin peptides. This process takes 30 minutes.
iii. Calcium wave in oocyte: The contact of sperm with vitelline membrane of oocyte triggers calcium wave (depolarization) in oocyte cytoplasm. This triggers important events at fertilization.
- Secondary oocyte resumes second meiotic division (Fig. 4.1B).
- Contact of cortical granules with plasma membrane in the periphery of ooplasm and release of lysosomal enzymes from cortical granules produce vitelline block and prevent polyspermy.
- Alterations taking place in the plasma membrane of the oocyte, and in the zona pellucida, ensure that no other spermatozoon can enter the oocyte.
- Metabolic activation of egg. Entry of the sperm leads to metabolic changes within the ovum that facilitate its development into an embryo.
iv. Nuclear fusion: Both head and tail of the spermatozoon (excluding plasma membrane) enters the cytoplasm of oocyte. Approximation of pronuclei takes place near the middle of cytoplasm of ovum (Fig. 4.1D).
- Immediately after the entry of sperm head into the cytoplasm of the oocyte the latter completes its second meiotic division, releases ovum with IN DNA and second polar body. Second polar body extruded into perivitelline space (Fig. 4.1C).
- Reconstitution of oocyte chromosomes forms female pronucleus (Fig. 4.1D).
- The sperm head makes a rotation of $180^{\circ}$ within the oocyte cytoplasm with its nucleus swollen, transforms into a male pronucleus (Fig. 4.1D).
- Formation of zygote: Each chromosome in the male and female pronuclei is made up of only one chromatid. Replication of DNA takes place to form a second chromatid in each chromosome (1N-2N DNA) and two centrioles appear. Disappearance of nuclear membranes and splitting of each chromosome into two (as in mitosis) occurs. The ovum is now called zygote. Meanwhile a spindle forms between two centrioles and chromosomes from each pronucleus (Haploid chromosomes with 2N DNA) organizes on the spindle equator. One chromosome of each pair moves to each end of the spindle. This leads to formation of two cells, each having 46 chromosomes (Figs 4.3C and D).

3. Effects/Results of fertilization: From what has been said above, it will be clear that the results of fertilization are:

- Completion of second meiotic division of female gamete (secondary oocyte)
- Restoration of diploid number (46) of chromosomes
- Determination of chromosomal sex of the future individual to be born
- Initiation of cleavage (mitotic) division of zygote
- Determination of polarity and bilateral symmetry of embryo
- Genetic diversity.

Embryo contains only maternal mitochondria-sperm mitochondria are discarded.
The important points to note at this stage are that:

- The two daughter cells are still surrounded by the zona pellucida (Figs 4.1 and 4.3)
- Each daughter cell is much smaller than the ovum
- With subsequent divisions, the cells become smaller and smaller until they acquire the size of most cells of the body.

Important factors in fertilization are:
- Normally functioning reproductive organs
- Chemotaxis
- Coordination of different processes as mentioned below:
- Time interval between insemination and ovulation
- Length of time ovum remains fertilizable
- Length of time sperm retains fertilizing power
- Number of sperms reaching uterine tube
- Time taken by sperm to reach the ovum
- Other factors of semen which influence fertilization.


## SEX DETERMINATION

All ova contain $22+X$ chromosomes. However, the spermatozoa are of two types. Half of them have $22+$

X chromosomes and the other half of them have $22+$ Y chromosomes. These are called as "X-bearing", or "Y-bearing", spermatozoa. An ovum can be fertilized by either type of spermatozoon. If the sperm is X-bearing, the zygote has $44+X+X$ chromosomes and the offspring is a girl. If the sperm is Y-bearing the zygote has $44+X+Y$ chromosomes and the offspring is a boy. Thus the sex of a child is "determined" at the time of fertilization depending on the contribution by the spermatozoon. It will now be clear that one chromosome of each of the 23 pairs is derived from the mother and the other from the father.

## TEST TUBE BABIES/IN VITRO FERTILIZATION

The so-called test tube babies are produced by the technique of in vitro fertilization (in vitro = outside the body, as against in vivo $=$ within the body). This technique is resorted to when normal in vivo fertilization could not be achieved for any one or more reasons mentioned subsequently. It is a form of assisted reproductive technique (ART).
The various steps in this technique are (Fig. 4.6):

- Pretreatment: Gonadotropins or clomiphene citrate are administered to the woman to stimulate growth of ovarian follicles.
- Collection of ova: Several ova are aspirated from the Graafian follicles by laparoscopy or under ultrasound visualization.
- Collection of sperms: Sperms are collected from the husband/donors semen and processed to make them ready for fertilization.
- Incubation of gametes: Ova and sperm are incubated together in special media and environment to promote fertilization.
- Fertilization and early development of the embryo take place in the culture medium. The process is carefully monitored, up to the 8 -cell stage of cleavage.
- Pretreatment of female with progesterone: To make the endometrium receptive to the cleaving embryo and its implantation.
- Reimplantation: Eight-cell stage embryos (one or more) are introduced into the uterine cavity through cervical canal-embryo transfer. Any remaining embryos are frozen for future use.
The reasons for using the technique can be as follows:
- The number of spermatozoa may be inadequate (Usually about $2-5 \mathrm{~mL}$ of semen is ejaculated. Each milliliter contains about 100 million spermatozoa. If the count of spermatozoa is less than 20 million $/ \mathrm{mL}$, there may be difficulty in fertilization.
- There may be inadequate motility of spermatozoa.
- There may be obstruction of the uterine tube.
- There may be absence of ovulation.

## CLEAVAGE

The two cells formed as described above (Fig. 4.7A) undergo a series of divisions. One cell divides first so that we have a "3-cell" stage of the embryo (Fig. 4.7B) followed by a "4-cell" stage (Figs 4.7C and 4.8A), a "5-cell" stage, etc. This process of subdivision of the ovum into smaller cells is called cleavage.
Definition: It is a process of repeated mitotic divisions of zygote within zona pellucida in rapid succession, giving rise to increasing number of smaller cells called blastomeres.

The cleavage divisions start immediately after fertilization and continue as the zygote is passing through the uterine tube toward uterus. The cleaving zygote is covered by zona pellucida.

This journey is facilitated by ciliary beats of uterine epithelium and contraction of uterine tube musculature.
Duration: The cleavage division lasts for 6 days, i.e. up to 7th day after fertilization.
Stages of cleaving egg: During its journey through uterine tube, the cleaving egg passes through the following stages (Figs 4.7 and 4.8). At the first cleavage division the zygote forms one large cell and one small cell. In the next cleavage the larger cell divides first followed by smaller one (Table 4.1).

Subdivisions of cleavage: There are three subdivisions in cleavage. They are:

1. Stage of compaction
2. Morula
3. Blastocyst
4. Stage of compaction: It starts at third division, i.e. at 8 -cell stage. There will be maximal contact between the cells. Outer cells form tight junctions and exhibit polarity. Inner cells form gap junctions. The nutrition to cleaving egg is the meagre store of food in blastomeres and breakdown products of tubal secretion transferred through zona pellucida.
5. Morula: As cleavage proceeds the ovum comes to have 16 cells, i.e. fourth division. It now looks like a mulberry and is called the morula (Figs 4.7D and 4.8B). It is still surrounded by the zona pellucida. Cells are similar in size and structure. If we cut a section across the morula, we see that it consists of an inner cell mass that is completely surrounded by an outer layer of cells. The cells of the outer layer will later give rise to a structure called the trophoblast that forms the coverings of the embryo (Fig. 4.9A). The inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper and is, therefore, also called the embryoblast. The cells of the trophoblast help to provide nutrition to the embryo.

TABLE 4.1: Relationship of cleavage stages and fertilization

| Cleavage stage | Time after fertilization when it can be observed |
| :-- | :-- |
| One-cell stage | $<24$ hrs |
| Two-cells stage | $24-36$ hrs |
| 3-4 cells stage | $36-48$ hrs |
| 5-8 cells stage | $48-72$ hrs |
| 9-16 cells stage | $72-96$ hrs |

3. Blastocyst: Between 4th and 5th day and 32-64 cells stage some fluid passes into the morula from the uterine cavity, and partially separates the cells of the inner cell mass from those of the trophoblast (Figs 4.8C and D and 4.9B). As the quantity of fluid increases, the morula acquires the shape of a cyst. The cells of the trophoblast become flattened and the inner cell mass gets attached to the inner side of the trophoblast on one side only (Figs 4.8 C and D and 4.9 C ). The morula has now become a blastocyst. The cavity of the blastocyst is the blastocoele. That side of the blastocyst to which the inner cell mass is attached is called the embryonic or animal pole, while the opposite side is the abembryonic pole (Figs 4.8C and D and 4.9B). The trophoblast divides into the one in contact with embryoblast known as polar trophoblast and the rest of it lining the wall of blastocyst is known as mural trophoblast (Figs 4.8C and D and 4.9C).
Hatching of blastocyst: Thinning of zonal pellucida starts on 4th day and it disappears on 5th day of fertilization (Fig. 4.8D). Disappearance of zona pellucida initiates attachment of trophoblastic cells to uterine epithelium known as implantation on 6th or 7th day after fertilization.

### Principal Effects of Cleavage

- There is increase in the number of cells whose size decreases progressively
- Partitioning of cytoplasm of zygote among the blastomeres
- Increased motility of protoplasm facilitating morphogenetic movements and rearrangements in later stages of development
- Approximation in size of cells similar to that of somatic cells characteristic for the species
- Restoration of nuclear cytoplasmic ratio
- There is no increase, rather decrease in protoplasmic volume due to metabolic activity
- Zygote genome is activated on 2nd day after fertilization. Cleavage is the process whereby a unicellular fertilized ovum (zygote) with exceptionally large ratio of cytoplasm

![img-64.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-64.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 4.9A to C: Formation of blastocyst
to nucleus is transformed into a multicellular mass of blastomeres each of which approximates to the ratio found in somatic cells. Thus cleavage facilitates formation of a multicellular organism.

### Clinical correlation

Hydatidiform mole: It is a form of abnormal blastocyst that resulted from development of trophoblast/outer cell mass that forms the placenta. There will be little or no embryonic tissue. The moles secrete high levels of HCG and can produce benign (invasive mole) or malignant (Choriocarcinoma) tumors. Genetic analysis of moles indicates diploid chromosomes of paternal origin. This results from fertilization of an oocyte without nucleus and duplication of paternal chromosomes to maintain diploid state. Paternal genes regulate the development of trophoblast.

### Function of the Zona Pellucida

- The zona pellucida is a specialized extracellular matrix surrounding the developing oocyte. It is formed by secretions from the oocyte and the granulosa cells.
- The trophoblast has the property of being able to stick to the uterine (or other) epithelium and its cells have the capacity to eat up other cells. They can, therefore, invade and burrow into tissues with which they come in contact. As the embryo travels down the uterine tube, and the uppermost part of the uterine cavity, it is prevented from "sticking" to the epithelium by the zona pellucida.
- During its travel in the uterine tube, the embryo receives nutrition, partly from the substances stored within the ovum (e.g. yolk), and partly by diffusion from uterine secretions. By the time a blastocyst is formed, it is necessary for the embryo to acquire additional sources of nutrition. This is achieved when the blastocyst "sticks" to the uterine endometrium, and gets implanted in it.
- However, before implantation, it is necessary for the zona pellucida to disappear. The zona pellucida disappears soon after the morula reaches the uterine lumen. Thus, the function of the zona pellucida is to prevent implantation of the blastocyst at an abnormal site.
- There are four types of zona pellucida glycoproteins ZP1, ZP2, ZP3 and ZP4 which have different roles in different phases of fertilization. ZP2 plays an important role in sperm binding, gamete recognition, penetration and prevention of polyspermy.
- The glycoprotein of the zona pellucida is responsible for induction of the acrosomal reaction. The release of acrosomal enzymes (acrosin) helps the sperm to penetrate the zona. The zona pellucida allows only a sperm of the same species to fertilize the oocyte. Sperms of other species cannot pass through the zona pellucida.
- The zona pellucida is responsible for the zona reaction that prevents any additional spermatozoa from entering the fertilized ovum (zygote).
- The zona pellucida holds the blastomeres of the early embryo together. The developing embryo is genetically different from the mother. This may evoke immunological reactions if embryonic and maternal tissues come in contact. Presence of zona pellucida (which lacks histocompatibility antigens) acts as a barrier that separates maternal tissues from the embryo. After the disappearance of zona pellucida various immunosuppressive cytokines and proteins are produced by the implanting embryo. This blocks the recognition of the embryo as a tissue foreign to the mother.
- To sum up the functions of zona pellucida are: oocyte development, protection of oocyte during its growth and transport in female reproductive tract, spermatozoon binding in fertilization, prevention of polyspermy, development of blastocyst and in preventing ectopic or premature implantation.


## FORMATION OF GERM LAYERS

As the blastocyst develops further, it gives rise not only to the tissues and organs of the embryo but also to a number of structures that support the embryo and help it to acquire nutrition.

At a very early stage in development, the embryo proper acquires the form of a three-layered disc. This is called the embryonic disc (also called embryonic area, embryonic shield, or germ disc).
The three layers that constitute this embryonic disc are:

1. Endoderm (endo = inside)
2. Ectoderm (ecto = outside)
3. Mesoderm (meso = in the middle).

These are the three-germ layers. All tissues of the body are derived from one or more of these layers. Much of the student's study of embryology concerns itself with learning from which of these germ layers particular tissues and organs develop. In the further development of the blastocyst that we will now consider, it is very important to have a clear concept of the formation of germ layers and of their fate.

We have seen that the blastocyst is a spherical cyst lined by flattened trophoblastic cells, and that inside it there is a mass of cells, the inner cell mass, attached eccentrically to the trophoblast. Further changes are as follows:

- Formation of hypoblast: Some cells of the inner cell mass differentiate (i.e. they become different from others) into flattened cells, that come to line its free surface (lower in Fig. 4.10A). This layer is the hypoblast/endoderm.
- Formation of epiblast: The remaining cells of the inner cell mass become columnar (Fig. 4.10B). These cells form the epiblast/ectoderm. The embryo is now in the form of a disc having two layers (Bilaminar germ disc).
- Formation of amniotic cavity: A space appears between the epiblast (below) and the trophoblast (above). This is the amniotic cavity (Fig. 4.10C), filled by amniotic fluid, or liquor amnii. The roof of this cavity is formed by amniogenic cells derived from the trophoblast, while its floor is formed by the epiblast.
- Formation of primary yolk sac: Flattened cells arising from the hypoblast (or, according to some, from trophoblast), spread and line the inside of the blastocystic cavity. (This lining of flattened cells is called "Heuser's membrane"). In this way, a cavity, lined on all sides by cells of endodermal origin, is formed. This cavity is called the primary yolk sac (Fig. 4.10D).
- Formation of extraembryonic mesoderm: The cells of the trophoblast give origin to a mass of cells called the extraembryonic mesoderm (or primary mesoderm). These cells come to lie between the trophoblast and the flattened endodermal cells lining the yolk sac, thus separating them from each other. These cells also separate the wall of the amniotic cavity from the trophoblast (Fig. 4.11A). This mesoderm is called "extraembryonic" because it lies outside the embryonic disc. It does not give rise to any tissues of the embryo.
- Formation of extraembryonic coelom: Small cavities appear in the extraembryonic mesoderm. Gradually, these join together to form larger spaces and, ultimately, one large cavity is formed. This cavity is called the extraembryonic coelom (Fig. 4.11B) (also called the chorionic cavity). With its formation, the extraembryonic mesoderm is split into two layers. The part lining the inside of the trophoblast, and the outside of the amniotic cavity, is called the parietal or somatopleuric extraembryonic mesoderm (It is also referred to as the chorionic plate). The part lining the outside of the yolk sac is called the visceral or splanchnopleuric extraembryonic mesoderm (Fig. 4.11B).

Figs 4.10A to D: Differentiation of endoderm and ectoderm, and the formation of the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac

- Formation of connecting stalk: From Figure 4.11B it is clearly seen that the extraembryonic coelom does not extend into that part of the extraembryonic mesoderm which attaches the wall of the amniotic cavity to the trophoblast. The developing embryo, along with the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac, is now suspended in the extraembryonic coelom, and is attached to the wall of the blastocyst (i.e. trophoblast) only by this unsplit part of the extraembryonic mesoderm. This mesoderm forms a structure called the connecting stalk.
- Formation of chorion and amnion: At this stage, two very important membranes are formed. One is formed by the parietal extraembryonic mesoderm (on the inside) and the overlying trophoblast (on the outside); this is called the chorion (Fig. 4.11B).
The other is the amnion which is constituted by amniogenic cells forming the wall of the amniotic cavity (excluding the ectodermal floor). These cells are derived from the trophoblast.

Figs 4.11A and B: Formation of extraembryonic mesoderm and extraembryonic coelom. Note carefully, the composition of the amnion, and of the chorion

We have already seen that the amnion is covered by the parietal extraembryonic mesoderm, and that the connecting stalk is attached to it.
The chorion and amnion play an important role in childbirth (parturition) and we will refer to them again.

- Formation of secondary yolk sac: With the appearance of the extraembryonic mesoderm, and later of the extraembryonic coelom, the yolk sac becomes much smaller than before and is now called the secondary yolk sac. This alteration in size is accompanied by a change in the nature of the lining cells. They are no longer flattened but become cubical (Fig. 4.11B).
- Circular embryonic disc: At this stage, the embryo proper is a circular disc composed of two layers of cells: (1) the upper layer (toward amniotic cavity) is the epiblast, the cells of which are columnar, while (2) the lower layer (toward yolk sac) is the hypoblast, made up of cubical cells. There is no indication yet of a head or tail end of the embryonic disc (Fig. 4.12).
- Formation of prochordal plate: At one circular area near the margin of the disc, the cubical cells of the endoderm become columnar. This area is called the prochordal plate.
The appearance of the prochordal plate determines the central axis of the embryo (i.e. enables us to divide it into right and left halves), and also enables us to distinguish its future head and tail ends (Fig. 4.13).
- Formation of primitive streak:
- A transient structure that forms in the blastula during the early stages of embryonic development.

Figs 4.12A and B: Embryonic disc before appearance of a central axis. "B" represents a section along the axis XY shown in "A"

- Soon after the formation of the prochordal plate (15th day of development) some of the epiblast cells lying along the central axis, near the tail end of the disc and on the dorsal aspect of the embryo, begin to proliferate, and form an elevation that bulges into the amniotic cavity. This elevation is called the primitive streak (Fig. 4.14).
- The primitive streak is at first a rounded or oval swelling, but with elongation of the embryonic disc it becomes a linear structure lying in the central axis of the disc.
- With the formation of prochordal plate and primitive streak the shape of embryonic disc changes from circular to oval (Fig. 4.15).
- Formation of primitive streak marks the beginning of gastrulation.
- Formation of intraembryonic mesoderm: The cells that proliferate in the region of the primitive streak

Figs 4.14A and B: Appearance of primitive streak. (B) is a section along axis XY shown in (A)

Mesodermal cells spread sidewards from primitive streak pass sideways, pushing themselves between the epiblast and hypoblast (Fig. 4.15). These cells form the intraembryonic mesoderm (or secondary mesoderm). Some cells arising from the primitive streak displace the hypoblast and form the layer that is now known as endoderm. Thus, both endoderm and mesoderm are derived from the epiblast. The remaining cells of the epiblast now form the ectoderm.
![img-70.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-70.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 4.15A and B: Formation of intraembryonic mesoderm. (B) is a section along axis KL in (A)

- Extensions of intraembryonic mesoderm: The intraembryonic mesoderm spreads throughout the disc except in the region of the prochordal plate.

The mesoderm extends cranial to the prochordal plate, and here mesoderm from the two sides becomes continuous across the midline (Fig. 4.16).
In the region of the prochordal plate, the ectoderm and endoderm remain in contact. In later development, the ectoderm and endoderm mostly persist as a lining epithelium.
On the other hand, the bulk of the tissues of the body are formed predominantly from mesoderm.
As there is no mesoderm in the prochordal plate, this region remains relatively thin, and later forms the buccopharyngeal membrane.

- The primitive streak gradually elongates, along the central axis of the embryonic disc. The disc also elongates and becomes pear-shaped (Fig. 4.16).
- Connecting stalk: When the embryonic disc is first formed, it is suspended (along with amniotic cavity and yolk sac) from the trophoblast by the connecting stalk (Figs 4.11 and 4.17).
To begin with, the connecting stalk is very broad compared to the size of the embryo.
As the embryonic disc enlarges in size, and also elongates, the connecting stalk becomes relatively small, and its attachment becomes confined to the region of the tail end of the embryonic disc (Fig. 4.17).
Some intraembryonic mesoderm arising from the primitive streak passes backward into the connecting stalk (Figs 4.16 and 4.17).
As it does so, it leaves an area caudal to the primitive streak, where ectoderm and endoderm remain in contact (i.e. mesoderm does not separate them). This region is, therefore, similar to the prochordal plate, and forms the cloacal membrane (Fig. 4.16).
Trilaminar germ disc: An embryonic disc made up of three layers. These layers are the ectoderm (outer), endoderm (inner) and mesoderm (middle).
Gastrulation: The process of formation of the primitive streak, endoderm and intraembryonic mesoderm (by the streak) is referred to as gastrulation.
Preorganogenesis period: Development of the embryo from fertilization up to the formation of the bilaminar disc is described as the preorganogenesis period as no organs are as yet recognizable. These events take place in the first 14 days of pregnancy. Anomalies produced by teratogens acting during this period usually result in death of the embryo. These anomalies are, therefore, seldom seen in babies reaching full term.
Embryonic period: Establishment of the primitive streak and formation of intraembryonic mesoderm mark the onset of gastrulation. Gastrulation begins in the 3rd week and most of it will be considered in the next chapter. The 3rd week

Fig. 4.16: Spread of intraembryonic mesoderm. Note that the mesoderm comes to lie between ectoderm and endoderm in all parts of the embryonic disc except at the (1) prochordal plate (2) cloacal membrane (3) region of the notochord

Fig. 4.17: Diagram showing the attachment of the connecting stalk to the caudal end of the embryonic disc. Note the cells of the intraembryonic mesoderm passing into the connecting stalk
marks the beginning of what is termed the embryonic period (3rd-8th week). Most congenital anomalies are produced by teratogens acting during this period.

### Clinical correlation

### Use of stem cells in the treatment of diseases

- Embryonic stem cells (ESCs): The cells of inner cell mass have the potential to differentiate into three different germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm). All the cells, tissues and organs of the body are formed from these three layers. Because of this the cells of the inner cell mass are called embryonic stem cells.
- Pluripotent cells: Embryonic stem cells can be maintained and propagated in an undifferentiated state, in culture, and in laboratories. If these cells are exposed to certain specific growth factors, in culture, the stem cells can form various types of adult cells, e.g. neurons, muscle cells, blood cells, and cartilage cells. These cells are therefore said to be pluripotent. It has been observed that when these stem cells are introduced into the living tissues of a person, the local environment helps these stem cells to differentiate into cells similar to those of the tissue in which they are placed.
- Embryonic stem cells therapy: This technique has tremendous potential for treatment of various diseases. Some of these are Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, diabetes, myocardial infarction, blood diseases, severe burns, osteoporosis, spinal cord injury, to name but a few.
- Therapeutic stem cell cloning: However, in the ESC therapy, the complication of immune rejection is always present as the genetic constitution of stem cell is different from that of patient. To overcome this problem scientists are working on "therapeutic stem cell cloning". In this procedure the nucleus of patient cell is introduced in the embryonic stem cell. These cells are then allowed to grow in any tissue of the patient. As the tissues arising from the stem cells are now genetically identical to those of the patient rejection is avoided.
- Adult stem cells: Although the embryonic stem cells are most suitable for therapeutic purposes, stem cells can also be isolated from some adult tissues, e.g. bone marrow, brain and skeletal muscle. However, adult stem cells are difficult to culture in laboratories and have less potential to differentiate in adult tissues.
- Ethical issues in ESC therapy: As human embryos are needed for stem cell research, some authorities object to it on ethical grounds. The main objections are that it is against nature and it treats the embryo with disrespect.


## EMBRYOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR CLINICAL CONDITIONS OR ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS

### Case Scenario 1

A woman of 35 years age with a married life of 8 years and regular menstrual cycles comes with her husband
for consultation for infertility. They were not using any contraceptive methods. The doctor advised the following investigations for the couple after a detailed physical examination of both. With your basic knowledge of embryology give explanation for each of these investigations.

- Seminal analysis of male
- Hysterosalpingography of female
- Follicular study of female
- Blood test for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) estimation.
- It is a case of infertility. To exclude male factor in infertility the husband was advised to undergo seminal analysis for the quantity and pH of semen and for sperm count and morphology.
- To rule out obstruction for the passage of sperms/ovum/ fertilized egg in the uterine tube hysterosalpingography was advised.
- Ultrasound-guided follicular study for the number, the size and appearance of antral follicles was advised on 3rd-5th day of menstrual cycle along with blood FSH estimation. During each menstrual cycle around 15 primordial follicles start maturing and pass through the stages of primary, secondary and antral follicles, and one becomes the mature Graafian follicle, which has the potential to be released from the surface of the ovary (ovulation) and enters the uterine tube and remains fertilizable. An antral follicle count of less than 4 indicates poor ovarian reserve and that of more than 10 suggests good ovarian reserve which is favorable for fertilization.
- Follicle-stimulating hormone is advised to correlate the influence of pituitary gonadotropin in the maturity of follicles.
In the above case the seminal analysis is suggestive of low sperm count (less than 20 million $/ \mathrm{mL}$ ) with normal structure and motility of spermatozoa and tubal block on hysterosalpingography and an antral follicular count of 7 and a lower FSH value. What advice is to be given to the couple who wanted to have children?

The couple should be advised about the in vitro fertilization (IVF) technique, as there are no chances for natural method of conception. Because of low antral follicle count, FSH value and the advanced age of the woman (decrease in follicular reserve) the couple should be advised to go for IVF technique.
