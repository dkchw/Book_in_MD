# Chapter 11 Face, Nose and Palate

## HIGHLIGHTS

- The stomatodeum (future mouth) is a depression bounded cranially by a bulging produced by the brain, and caudally by a bulging produced by the pericardial cavity.
- Three prominences appear around the stomatodeum. These are the frontonasal process (above), and the right and left mandibular arches (first pharyngeal arches)
- The mandibular arch divides into a maxillary process and a mandibular process.
- The right and left mandibular processes meet in the midline and fuse. They form the lower lip and lower jaw.
- The upper lip is formed by fusion of the frontonasal process with the right and left maxillary processes. Failure to fuse completely leads to various forms of harelp.
- The cheeks are formed by fusion of (the posterior parts of) the maxillary and mandibular processes.
- The nose is derived from the frontonasal process.
- The nasal cavity is formed from an ectodermal thickening, the nasal placode, appears over the frontonasal process. The placode gets depressed below the surface to form the nasal pit. The nasal pits enlarge to form the nasal cavity.
- Paranasal sinuses appear as outgrowths from the nasal cavity.
- The palate is formed by fusion of three components. These are the right and left palatal processes (arising from the maxillary process); and the primitive palate (derived from the frontonasal process). Deficiency in fusion leads to various forms of cleft palate.


## INTRODUCTION

- During the 4th week of development, after the formation of the head fold, two prominent bulgings appear on the ventral aspect of the developing embryo, separated by the stomatodeum (Fig. 11.1). They are:
- Developing brain cranially
- Pericardium caudally
- The floor of the stomatodeum is formed by the buccopharyngeal membrane, which separates it from the foregut. On each side, the stomatodeum is bounded by first arch.
- Soon, mesoderm covering the developing forebrain proliferates and forms a downward projection that overlaps the upper part of the stomatodeum. This
downward projection is called the frontonasal process (Fig. 11.2).
- The pharyngeal arches are laid down in the lateral and ventral walls of the most cranial part of the foregut (Chapter 9, Fig. 9.1B). These are also, therefore, in very close relationship to the stomatodeum.


## DEVELOPMENT OF THE FACE

- It will now be readily appreciated that the face is derived from the structures that lie around the stomatodeum
- Unpaired: Frontonasal process from above.
- Paired: First pharyngeal (or mandibular) arch of each side (Fig. 11.3A).

- Each mandibular arch forms the lateral wall of the stomatodeum (Fig. 11.3A). This arch gives off a bud from its dorsal end. This bud is called the maxillary process (Fig. 11.3B). It grows ventromedially cranial to the main part of the arch which is now called the mandibular process.
- The five primordia for face development are an unpaired frontonasal process and paired maxillary and mandibular processes.

Fig. 11.2: Formation of frontonasal process

- The ectoderm overlying the frontonasal process soon shows bilateral localized thickenings that are situated a little above the stomatodeum (Fig. 11.4A) on either side of midline. These are called the nasal placodes. The formation of these placodes is induced by the underlying forebrain. The placodes soon sink below the surface to form nasal pits (Fig. 11.4B). The pits are continuous with the stomatodeum below. The edges of each pit are raised above the surface: the medial raised edge is called the medial nasal process and the lateral edge is called the lateral nasal process. Lateral and cranial to the nasal placodes pair of thickenings appear and are called lens placodes.


## DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS PARTS OF FACE

We are now in a position to study the formation of various parts of the face. The various primordia of face, their relation to stomatodeum and the parts derived are shown in Table 11.1.

### Lower Lip

The mandibular processes of the two sides grow toward each other (Fig. 11.3B) and fuse in the midline (Fig. 11.4A). They now form the lower margin of the stomatodeum. If it is remembered that the mouth develops from the stomatodeum, it will be readily understood that the fused mandibular processes give rise to the lower lip, and to the lower jaw (Fig. 11.7).

### Upper Lip

- Each maxillary process now grows medially below the developing eye and fuses, first with the lateral nasal process (Fig. 11.5), and then with the medial nasal process (Fig. 11.6). The medial and lateral nasal processes also fuse with each other. In this way, the
![img-208.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-208.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 11.3A and B: Development of face: Formation of mandibular and maxillary processes

nasal pits (now called external nares) are cut off from the stomatodeum.

- The maxillary processes undergo considerable growth (Fig. 11.6). At the same time, the frontonasal process
becomes much narrower from side to side, with the result that the two external nares come closer together.
- The stomatodeum is now bounded above by the upper lip that is derived as follows (Figs 11.7 and 11.8):
![img-209.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-209.jpeg.jpg)

![img-210.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-210.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 11.5A and B: Development of the face (continued). (A) The right and left nasal pits come close to each other. The lateral nasal process is separated from the maxillary process by the nasooptic furrow; (B) The maxillary process fuses with the lateral nasal process obliterating the nasooptic furrow

- The mesodermal basis of the lateral part of the lip is formed from the maxillary process. The overlying skin is derived from ectoderm covering this process.
- The mesodermal basis of the median part of the lip (called philtrum) is formed from the frontonasal process. The ectoderm of the maxillary process, however, overgrows this mesoderm to meet that of the opposite maxillary process in the midline (Fig. 11.8). As a result, the skin of the entire upper lip is innervated by the maxillary nerves.
- The muscles of the face (including those of the lips) are derived from mesoderm of the second branchial arch and are, therefore, supplied by the facial nerve.
![img-211.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-211.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 11.6A and B: Development of the face (continued). (A) The maxillary process extends below the nasal pit and fuses with the medial nasal process. In this way, the nasal pit is separated from the stomatodeum; (B) The maxillary and mandibular processes partly fuse to form the cheek. With growth of the maxillary processes the nasal pits come closer to each other

### Cheeks

- After formation of the upper and lower lips, the stomatodeum (which can now be called the mouth) is very broad. In its lateral part, it is bounded above by the maxillary process and below by the mandibular process. These processes undergo progressive fusion with each other to form the cheeks (compare Figs 11.6A and B; also see Figs 11.9 and 11.10).
- The maxillary process fuses with the lateral nasal process. This fusion not only occurs in the region of the lip but also extends from the stomatodeum to the medial angle of the developing eye (Figs 11.6 and 11.9B). For some time, this line of fusion is marked by a groove called the nasooptic furrow or nasolacrimal sulcus (Fig. 11.5A). A strip of ectoderm becomes buried along this furrow and gives rise to the nasolacrimal duct (Chapter 19: Development of Eye).


### Eye

- The development of the eye itself will be dealt with later (Chapter 19), but a brief reference to it is necessary to form a complete idea of the development of the face.
- The region of the eye is first seen as an ectodermal thickening, the lens placode, which appears on the ventrolateral side of the developing forebrain, lateral and cranial to the nasal placode (Fig. 11.4A).
- The lens placode sinks below the surface and is eventually cut off from the surface ectoderm. The developing eyeball produces a bulging in this situation (Fig. 11.5).
- The bulgings of the eyes are at first directed laterally (Figs 11.5 and 11.6), and lie in the angles between the maxillary processes and the lateral nasal processes.
- With the narrowing of the frontonasal process, they come to face forward (Figs 11.6 and 11.7).
- The eyelids are derived from folds of ectoderm that are formed above and below the eyes, and by mesoderm enclosed within the folds.
![img-212.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-212.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 11.7: Derivation of parts of the face

### Nose

- The nose receives contributions from the frontonasal process and from the medial and lateral nasal processes of the right and left sides.
![img-213.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-213.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 11.8: Formation of upper lip: Scheme to show how the maxillary process "overgrows" the frontonasal process

- External nares are formed when the nasal pits are cut off from the stomatodeum by the fusion of the maxillary process with the medial nasal process.
- External nares gradually approach each other. This is a result of the fact that the frontonasal process becomes progressively narrower and its deeper part ultimately forms the nasal septum.
- Mesoderm becomes heaped up in the median plane to form the prominence of the nose. Simultaneously, a groove appears between the region of the nose and the bulging forebrain (which may now be called the forehead) (Fig. 11.10).
- As the nose becomes prominent, the external nares come to open downward instead of forward (Fig. 11.10).
- The external form of the nose is thus established with the fusion of five processes as follows:
- Frontonasal process forms the bridge of the nose.
- Fused medial nasal processes form the dorsum and tip of nose.
- Lateral nasal processes form the alae of the nose. The development of the nasal cavity is considered later.

### Clinical correlation

### Developmental anomalies of the face

It has been seen that the formation of various parts of the face involves fusion of diverse components. This fusion is occasionally incomplete and gives rise to various anomalies.

- Harelip: The upper lip of the hare normally has a cleft. Hence, the term harelip is used for defects of the lips.
- Unilateral harelip: Failure of fusion of maxillary process with medial nasal process on one side (Figs 11.11A to C).
- Bilateral harelip: Failure of fusion of both maxillary processes with the medial nasal process (Fig. 11.11D).
- Midline cleft of upper lip: Defective development of the lowermost part of the frontonasal process may give rise to a midline defect of the upper lip (Fig. 11.11E).
- Cleft of lower lip: When the two mandibular processes do not fuse with each other the lower lip shows a defect in the midline. The defect usually extends into the jaw (Fig. 11.11F).
- Oblique facial cleft: Nonfusion of the maxillary and lateral nasal process gives rise to a cleft running from the medial angle of the eye to the mouth (Fig.11.12A). The nasolacrimal duct is not formed.
- Inadequate fusion of the mandibular and maxillary processes with each other may lead to an abnormally wide mouth (macrostomia) (Fig. 11.12B). Lack of fusion may be unilateral; this leads to formation of a lateral facial cleft. Too much fusion may result in a small mouth (microstomia) (Fig. 11.12C).
- The nose may be bifid. This may be associated with median cleft lip. Both these occur due to bifurcation of the frontonasal process. Occasionally one half of it may be absent. Very rarely the nose forms a cylindrical projection, or proboscis (Fig. 11.13, 19.11D) jutting out from just below the forehead. This anomaly may sometimes affect only one half of the nose and is usually associated with fusion of the two eyes (cyclops).
- The entire first arch may remain underdeveloped on one or both sides, affecting the lower eyelid (coloboma type defect), the maxilla, the mandible, and the external ear. The prominence of the cheek is absent and the ear may be displaced ventrally and caudally. There may be presence of cleft palate and of faulty dentition. This condition is called mandibulofacial dysostosis. Treacher Collins syndrome or first arch syndrome. This is a genetic condition inherited as autosomal dominant.
- One half of the face may be under developed or overdeveloped.
- The mandible may be small compared to the rest of the face resulting in a receding chin (retrognathia). In extreme cases, it may fail to develop (agnathia).
- Congenital tumors may be present in relation to the face. These may represent attempts at duplication of some parts.
- The eyes may be widely separated (hypertelorism). The nasal bridge is broad. This condition results from the presence of excessive tissue in the frontonasal process.
- The lips may show congenital pits or fistulae. The lip may be double.


### External Ear

- The external ear is formed around the dorsal part of the first ectodermal cleft (Fig. 11.9B).
- A series of mesodermal thickenings (often called tubercles or hillocks) appear on the mandibular and hyoid arches where they adjoin this cleft.
- The pinna (or auricle) is formed by fusion of these thickenings (Chapter 20: Development of the Ear, Fig. 20.10).
- From a study of Figures 11.9 and 11.10, it will be seen that when first formed, the pinna lies caudal to the developing jaw. It is pushed upward and backward to its definitive position due to the great enlargement of the mandibular process.
- If the mandibular process fails to enlarge, the ears remain low down and it can result in mandibulofacial dysostosis.


### Development of Nasal Cavities

- The nasal cavities are formed by extension of the nasal pits. We have seen that these pits are at first in open communication with the stomatodeum (Fig. 11.14A). The frontonasal process is between nasal pits.
- Soon the medial and lateral nasal processes fuse, and form a partition between the pit and the stomatodeum. This is called the primitive palate (Fig. 11.14B), and is derived from the frontonasal process.
- The nasal pits now deepen to form the nasal sacs which expand both dorsally and caudally (Fig. 11.14C). The dorsal part of this sac is, at first, separated from the stomatodeum by a thin membrane called the bucconasal membrane (or nasal fin). This soon breaks down (Figs 11.14D and 11.15B). The nasal sac now has a ventral orifice that opens on the face (anterior or external nares), and a dorsal orifice that opens into the stomatodeum (primitive posterior nasal aperture).
- The two nasal sacs are at first widely separated from one another by the frontonasal process (Figs 11.15A and B).

![img-220.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-220.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 11.15A to D: Formation of the nasal septum. A and C are coronal sections through the anterior part of the nasal sac. B and $D$ are sections through the posterior part. (A) Right and left nasal sacs are widely separated by the frontonasal process. Anterior part of nasal sac is separated from the stomatodeum by the primitive palate; (B) Posterior part of nasal sac is separated from the stomatodeum by the bucconasal membrane; (C) Nasal sacs enlarge and come close together. The frontonasal process is narrow and forms the nasal septum. The lower edge of the septum reaches the primitive palate; (D) Bucconasal membrane breaks down. As a result the posterior part of the nasal sac opens into the stomatodeum

Later, the frontonasal process becomes progressively narrower. This narrowing of the frontonasal process, and the enlargement of the nasal cavities themselves, brings them closer together. The intervening tissue becomes much thinned to from the nasal septum (Figs 11.15 C and D ). The ventral part of the nasal septum is attached below to the primitive palate (Fig. 11.15C). More posteriorly, the septum is at first attached to the bucconasal membrane (Fig. 11.15D), but on disappearance of this membrane it has a free lower edge. The nasal cavities are separated from the mouth by the development of the palate, as described below.

- The lateral wall of the nose is derived, on each side, from the lateral nasal process. The nasal conchae appear as elevations on the lateral wall of each nasal cavity. The original olfactory placodes form the olfactory epithelium that lies in the roof, and adjoining parts of the walls, of the nasal cavity.
- The development of various components of nose can be summarized as follows:
- Frontonasal process-forms dorsum and tip of nose
- Nasal pit—original site of it forms the anterior nares (nostrils)
- Nasal sacs-the elongation of nasal pits form the nasal cavity
- Bucconasal membrane-rupture of this membrane forms the posterior nares (Choanae).


### Clinical correlation

### Anomalies of the nasal cavity

- There may be atresia of the cavity at the external nares, at the posterior nasal aperture, or in the cavity proper. This may be unilateral or bilateral. Very rarely, there may be total absence of the nasal passages.
- Congenital defects in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone may lead to a communication between the cranial cavity and the nose.
- The nasal septum may not be in the middle line, i.e. it may be deflected to one side. The septum may be absent.
- The nasal cavity may communicate with the mouth.


### Paranasal Sinuses

- The paranasal sinuses appear as diverticula from the nasal cavity. The diverticula gradually invade the bones after which they are named, i.e. the sphenoid, maxilla, frontal, ethmoid and then expand.
- They are named accordingly into sphenoidal, maxillary, ethmoidal and frontal air sinuses.
- The paranasal sinuses are ectodermal in origin.
- The maxillary and sphenoidal sinuses begin to develop before birth. The other sinuses develop after birth.
- Enlargement of paranasal sinuses is associated with overall enlargement of the facial skeleton, including the jaws. This provides space in the jaws for growth and eruption of teeth.
- Growth of the facial skeleton is responsible for the gradual change in looks of a baby.


## DEVELOPMENT OF PALATE

- To understand the development of the palate, let us have another look at the maxillary process. From Figures 11.6 and 11.10, it will be seen that these processes not only form the upper lip but also extend backward on either side of the stomatodeum. They can, therefore, be diagrammatically illustrated as in Figure 11.16A.
- If we cut a coronal section through the region (along the line XY in Fig. 11.16A) the maxillary processes will be seen as in Figure 11.16B. Finally, if we now correlate Figure 11.16B with Figure 11.15D the relationship of the maxillary processes to the developing nasal cavity and mouth is easily understood (Fig. 11.16C).
- From each maxillary process, a palate like shelf grows medially (Fig. 11.16D). This is called the palatal process of maxilla.
- We now have three components from which the palate will be formed. These are (Figs 11.17 and 11.18):

![img-221.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-221.jpeg.jpg)

Figs 11.16A to D: Development of the palate

- Primary/Primitive palate: Develops from frontonasal process
- Secondary palate/Palatal processes: Develop from maxillary process.
- Primary palate: Fusion of the two medial nasal processes of frontonasal process at a deeper level forms a wedge-shaped mass of mesenchyme opposite upper jaw carrying four incisor teeth. The part of the palate derived from the frontonasal process forms the form premaxilla or primary palate which carries the incisor teeth. This ossifies and represents only small part lying anterior to incisive fossa.
- Secondary palate: Tongue develops in the floor of oral cavity. The palatine processes of maxilla are hook like projections on either side of tongue. Later they assume horizontal position above the tongue and fuse with each other forming the secondary palate. At a later stage, the mesoderm in the palate undergoes intramembranous ossification to form the hard palate. However, ossification does not extend into the most posterior portion, which remains as the soft palate. The secondary palate forms most of the hard palate and whole of soft palate. Soft palate is invaded by muscles migrating from first arch (Tensor palate) and fourth arch (Levator palati, palatoglossus, palatopharyngeus and musculus uvulae).
- The definitive/permanent palate is formed by the fusion of these three parts as follows:

1. Fusion of palatal processes of maxilla with primitive palate: Each palatal process fuses with the posterior margin of the primitive palate (Fig. 11.18) in a Y-shaped manner. Each limb of Y extends between lateral incisor and canine teeth. The junction of these two components in the midline is represented by incisive fossa.
2. Fusion of both palatal processes of maxilla: The two palatal processes fuse with each other in the midline (Fig. 11.19A). Their fusion begins anteriorly and proceeds backward.
![img-222.jpeg](Medical/Preclinical/Human%20Body%20and%20Function/Embryology/Books%20in%20MD/Inderbir%20Singh/Inderbir%20Singh's%20Human%20embryology%20(2018)%20-%20libgen.li_images/img-222.jpeg.jpg)

Fig. 11.18: Embryological subdivisions of the palate and the lines of fusion of these subdivisions
3. Fusion of palatal processes with nasal septum: The medial edges of the palatal processes fuse with the free lower edge of the nasal septum (Fig. 11.19B), thus separating the two nasal cavities from each other, and from the mouth.

- Anterior three-fourths of permanent palate is ossified in membrane and forms the hard palate. Posterior one-fourth is the unossified part that forms the soft palate.


### Clinical correlation

### Cleft palate

Defective fusion of the various components of the palate gives rise to clefts in the palate. These vary considerably in degree as illustrated in Figure 11.20.

### Complete cleft palate:

- Bilateral complete cleft: Failure of fusion of both palatine processes of maxilla with premaxilla. A Y-shaped cleft will be present between primary and secondary palate and between the two halves of secondary palate. It presents bilateral cleft of upper lip also (Fig. 11.20A).
- Unilateral complete cleft:Nonfusion of one side palatine process of maxilla with premaxilla. It presents unilateral cleft of upper lip (Fig. 11.20B).
Incomplete cleft palate:
- Cleft of hard and soft palate: Cleft limited to hard palate (Fig. 11.20C).
- Cleft of soft palate: Cleft limited to hard palate (Fig. 11.20D).
- Bifid uvula: Cleft limited to uvula (Fig. 11.20E).

Figs 11.20A to E: Varieties of cleft palate. (A) Complete cleft with bilateral harelip; (B) Unilateral cleft palate and cleft of upper lip. The left maxillary process has fused with the premaxilla, but not with the right maxillary process. The cleft is accompanied by unilateral harelip; (C) Midline cleft of hard palate and soft palate; (D) Cleft of soft palate; (E) Bifid uvula

## EMBRYOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR CLINICAL CONDITIONS OR ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS

### Case Scenario 1

A mother brings her apparently normal newborn of 20 days old with a complaint of milk coming through nasal passages of the baby during feeding. What could be the cause for nasal regurgitation of fluids? How this condition can be diagnosed. Describe the embryological basis and what are the probable causes for this condition and what advice to be given in this case.

- The cause for nasal regurgitation of fluids is cleft palate.
- It is diagnosed by a physical examination of mouth, nose and palate. In the present case, it is a case of cleft palate. There are different types of cleft palate. It can be associated with the cleft lip. In the present case as the baby is apparently normal, the cleft is ruled out.
- Prenatal ultrasound at 16-20 weeks facilitates diagnosis of this condition.
- The four components that are involved in the development of palate are the paired palatal processes of maxillae, nasal septum and premaxilla. Timing of fusion and extent of fusion of these components plays an important role in the development of normal palate.
- Because of cleft in the palate the newborn is having feeding problems. This can lead to loss of weight. It can lead to repeated ear infections and speech difficulties.
- It is caused by a combination of genetic, viral, toxins and environmental factors. Proper nutrition and prenatal vitamins in antenatal period reduce the incidence of cleft palate. Use of anti-epileptic drugs by the mother especially valproic acid is known to cause this defect. It can be part of a syndrome, e.g. Pierre Robin, DiGeorge, Edwards, and Patau.
- This condition is not life-threatening. This case required surgery to close the cleft within 1st year of life to avoid speech difficulties and hearing problems.
