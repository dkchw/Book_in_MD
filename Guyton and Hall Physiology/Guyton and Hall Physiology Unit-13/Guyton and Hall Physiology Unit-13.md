# General Principles of Gastrointestinal Function-Motility, Nervous Control, and Blood Circulation 

The alimentary tract provides the body with a continual supply of water, electrolytes, vitamins, and nutrients, which requires the following: (1) movement of food through the alimentary tract; (2) secretion of digestive juices and digestion of the food; (3) absorption of water, various electrolytes, vitamins, and digestive products; (4) circulation of blood through the gastrointestinal organs to carry away the absorbed substances; and (5) control of all these functions by local, nervous, and hormonal systems.

Figure 63-1 shows the entire alimentary tract. Each part is adapted to its specific functions - some parts to simple passage of food, such as the esophagus; others to temporary storage of food, such as the stomach; and others to digestion and absorption, such as the small intestine. In this chapter we discuss the basic principles of function in the entire alimentary tract, and in subsequent chapters the specific functions of different segments of the tract will be addressed.

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF GASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY

## Physiologic Anatomy of the Gastrointestinal Wall

Figure 63-2 shows a typical cross section of the intestinal wall, including the following layers from the outer surface inward: (1) the serosa, (2) a longitudinal smooth muscle layer, (3) a circular smooth muscle layer, (4) the submucosa, and (5) the mucosa. In addition, sparse bundles of smooth muscle fibers, the mucosal muscle, lie in the deeper layers of the mucosa. The motor functions of the gut are performed by the different layers of smooth muscle.

The general characteristics of smooth muscle and its function are discussed in Chapter 8, which should be reviewed as a background for the following sections of this chapter.

Gastrointestinal Smooth Muscle Functions as a Syncytium. The individual smooth muscle fibers in the gastrointestinal tract are 200 to 500 micrometers in length and 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter, and they are ar-
ranged in bundles of as many as 1000 parallel fibers. In the longitudinal muscle layer, the bundles extend longitudinally down the intestinal tract; in the circular muscle layer, they extend around the gut.

Within each bundle, the muscle fibers are electrically connected with one another through large numbers of gap junctions that allow low-resistance movement of ions from one muscle cell to the next. Therefore, electrical signals that initiate muscle contractions can travel readily from one fiber to the next within each bundle but more rapidly along the length of the bundle than sideways.

Each bundle of smooth muscle fibers is partly separated from the next by loose connective tissue; however, the muscle bundles fuse with one another at many points, so in reality each muscle layer represents a branching latticework of smooth muscle bundles. Therefore, each muscle layer functions as a syncytium; that is, when an action potential is elicited anywhere within the muscle mass, it generally travels in all directions in the muscle. The distance that it travels depends on the excitability of the muscle; sometimes it stops after only a few millimeters, and at other times it travels many centimeters or even the entire length and breadth of the intestinal tract.

Also, because a few connections exist between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers, excitation of one of these layers often excites the other as well.

## Electrical Activity of Gastrointestinal Smooth Muscle

The smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract is excited by almost continual slow, intrinsic electrical activity along the membranes of the muscle fibers. This activity has two basic types of electrical waves: (1) slow waves and (2) spikes, both of which are shown in Figure 63-3. In addition, the voltage of the resting membrane potential of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle can change to different levels, which can also have important effects in controlling motor activity of the gastrointestinal tract.
"Slow Waves" Caused by Undulating Changes in Resting Membrane Potential. Most gastrointestinal contractions occur rhythmically, and this rhythm is determined mainly by the frequency of so-called "slow

![gu017937568e](gu017937568e.jpg)

waves" of smooth muscle membrane potential. These waves, shown in Figure 63-3, are not action potentials. Instead, they are slow, undulating changes in the resting membrane potential. Their intensity usually varies between 5 and 15 millivolts, and their frequency ranges in different parts of the human gastrointestinal tract from 3 to $12 / \mathrm{min}$-about 3 in the body of the stomach, as much as 12 in the duodenum, and about 8 or 9 in the terminal ileum. Therefore, the rhythm of contraction of the body of the stomach, the duodenum, and the il-
![gu037937568e](gu037937568e.jpg)

Figure 63-3. Membrane potentials in intestinal smooth muscle. Note the slow waves, the spike potentials, total depolarization, and hyperpolarization, all of which occur under different physiological conditions of the intestine.
eum is usually about $3 / \mathrm{min}$, about $12 / \mathrm{min}$, and 8 to $9 /$ min , respectively.

The precise cause of the slow waves is not completely understood, although they appear to be caused by complex interactions among the smooth muscle cells and specialized cells, called the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are believed to act as electrical pacemakers for smooth muscle cells. These interstitial cells form a network with each other and are interposed between the smooth muscle layers, with synaptic-like contacts to smooth muscle cells. The interstitial cells of Cajal undergo cyclic changes in membrane potential due to unique ion channels that periodically open and produce inward (pacemaker) currents that may generate slow wave activity.

The slow waves usually do not by themselves cause muscle contraction in most parts of the gastrointestinal tract, except perhaps in the stomach. Instead, they mainly excite the appearance of intermittent spike potentials, and the spike potentials in turn actually excite the muscle contraction.

Spike Potentials. The spike potentials are true action potentials. They occur automatically when the resting membrane potential of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle becomes more positive than about -40 millivolts (the normal resting membrane potential in the smooth muscle fibers of the gut is between -50 and -60 millivolts). Note in Figure 63-3 that each time the peaks of the slow waves temporarily become more positive than -40 millivolts, spike potentials appear on these peaks. The higher the slow wave potential rises, the greater the frequency of the spike potentials, usually ranging between 1 and 10 spikes per second. The spike potentials last 10 to 40 times as long in gastrointestinal muscle as the action potentials in large nerve fibers, with each gastrointestinal spike lasting as long as 10 to 20 milliseconds.

Another important difference between the action potentials of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle and those of nerve fibers is the manner in which they are

generated. In nerve fibers, the action potentials are caused almost entirely by rapid entry of sodium ions through sodium channels to the interior of the fibers. In gastrointestinal smooth muscle fibers, the channels responsible for the action potentials are somewhat different; they allow especially large numbers of calcium ions to enter along with smaller numbers of sodium ions and therefore are called calcium-sodium channels. These channels are much slower to open and close than are the rapid sodium channels of large nerve fibers. The slowness of opening and closing of the calcium-sodium channels accounts for the long duration of the action potentials. Also, the movement of large amounts of calcium ions to the interior of the muscle fiber during the action potential plays a special role in causing the intestinal muscle fibers to contract, as we discuss shortly.

## Changes in Voltage of the Resting Membrane Poten-

tial. In addition to the slow waves and spike potentials, the baseline voltage level of the smooth muscle resting membrane potential can also change. Under normal conditions, the resting membrane potential averages about -56 millivolts, but multiple factors can change this level. When the potential becomes less negative, which is called depolarization of the membrane, the muscle fibers become more excitable. When the potential becomes more negative, which is called hyperpolarization, the fibers become less excitable.

Factors that depolarize the membrane-that is, make it more excitable-are (1) stretching of the muscle, (2) stimulation by acetylcholine released from the endings of parasympathetic nerves, and (3) stimulation by several specific gastrointestinal hormones.

Important factors that make the membrane potential more negative-that is, that hyperpolarize the membrane and make the muscle fibers less excitable-are (1) the effect of norepinephrine or epinephrine on the fiber membrane and (2) stimulation of the sympathetic nerves that secrete mainly norepinephrine at their endings.

## Entry of Calcium Ions Causes Smooth Muscle Contrac-

tion. Smooth muscle contraction occurs in response to entry of calcium ions into the muscle fiber. As explained in Chapter 8, calcium ions act through a calmodulin control mechanism to activate the myosin filaments in the fiber, causing attractive forces to develop between the myosin filaments and the actin filaments, thereby causing the muscle to contract.

The slow waves do not cause calcium ions to enter the smooth muscle fiber (they only cause entry of sodium ions). Therefore, the slow waves by themselves usually do not cause muscle contraction. Instead, it is during the spike potentials, generated at the peaks of the slow waves, that significant quantities of calcium ions enter the fibers and cause most of the contraction.

Tonic Contraction of Some Gastrointestinal Smooth Muscle. Some smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract exhibits tonic contraction as well as, or instead of, rhythmic contractions. Tonic contraction is continuous; it is not associated with the basic electrical rhythm of the slow waves but often lasts several minutes or even hours. The tonic contraction may increase or decrease in intensity but it continues.

Tonic contraction is sometimes caused by continuous repetitive spike potentials-the greater the frequency, the greater the degree of contraction. At other times, tonic contraction is caused by hormones or other factors that bring about continuous partial depolarization of the smooth muscle membrane without causing action potentials. A third cause of tonic contraction is continuous entry of calcium ions into the interior of the cell brought about in ways not associated with changes in membrane potential. The details of these mechanisms are still unclear.

## NEURAL CONTROL OF GASTROINTESTINAL FUNCTIONENTERIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

The gastrointestinal tract has a nervous system all its own called the enteric nervous system. It lies entirely in the wall of the gut, beginning in the esophagus and extending all the way to the anus. The number of neurons in this enteric system is greater than 100 million, more than the number in the entire spinal cord. This highly developed enteric nervous system is especially important in controlling gastrointestinal movements and secretion.

The enteric nervous system is composed mainly of two plexuses, shown in Figure 63-4: (1) an outer plexus lying between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers, called the myenteric plexus or Auerbach's plexus; and (2) an inner plexus, called the submucosal plexus or Meissner's plexus, which lies in the submucosa. The nervous connections within and between these two plexuses are also shown in Figure 63-4.

The myenteric plexus controls mainly the gastrointestinal movements, and the submucosal plexus controls mainly gastrointestinal secretion and local blood flow.

In Figure 63-4, note especially the extrinsic sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers that connect to both the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. Although the enteric nervous system can function independently of these extrinsic nerves, stimulation by the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems can greatly enhance or inhibit gastrointestinal functions, as we discuss later.

Also shown in Figure 63-4 are sensory nerve endings that originate in the gastrointestinal epithelium or gut wall and send afferent fibers to both plexuses of the enteric system, as well as (1) to the prevertebral ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system, (2) the spinal cord, and (3) in the vagus nerves, all the way to the brain stem. These sensory nerves can elicit local reflexes within the gut wall and still other reflexes that are relayed to the gut from either the prevertebral ganglia or the basal regions of the brain.

Figure 63-4. Neural control of the gut wall, showing the following: (1) the myenteric and submucosal plexuses (black fibers); (2) extrinsic control of these plexuses by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems (red fibers); and (3) sensory fibers passing from the luminal epithelium and gut wall to the enteric plexuses, then to the prevertebral ganglia of the spinal cord and directly to the spinal cord and brain stem (green fibers).

## DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MYENTERIC AND SUBMUCOSAL PLEXUSES

The myenteric plexus consists mostly of a linear chain of many interconnecting neurons that extends the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract. A section of this chain is shown in Figure 63-4.

Because the myenteric plexus extends all the way along the intestinal wall and lies between the longitudinal and circular layers of intestinal smooth muscle, it is concerned mainly with controlling muscle activity along the length of the gut. When this plexus is stimulated, its principal effects are as follows: (1) increased tonic contraction, or "tone," of the gut wall; (2) increased intensity of the rhythmic contractions; (3) slightly increased rate of the rhythm of contraction; and (4) increased velocity of conduction of excitatory waves along the gut wall, causing more rapid movement of the gut peristaltic waves.

The myenteric plexus should not be considered entirely excitatory because some of its neurons are inhibitory; their fiber endings secrete an inhibitory transmitter, possibly vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or some other inhibitory peptide. The resulting inhibitory signals are especially useful for inhibiting some of the intestinal sphincter muscles that impede movement of food along successive segments of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the pyloric sphincter, which controls emptying of the stomach into the duodenum, and the sphincter of the ileocecal valve, which controls emptying from the small intestine into the cecum.

The submucosal plexus, in contrast to the myenteric plexus, is mainly concerned with controlling function in the inner wall of each minute segment of the intestine. For example, many sensory signals originate from the gastrointestinal epithelium and are then integrated in the submucosal plexus to help control local intestinal secretion, local absorption, and local contraction of the submucosal muscle
that causes various degrees of infolding of the gastrointestinal mucosa.

## TYPES OF NEUROTRANSMITTERS SECRETED BY ENTERIC NEURONS

Researchers have identified more than 25 potential neurotransmitter substances that are released by the nerve endings of different types of enteric neurons, including the following: (1) acetylcholine, (2) norepinephrine, (3) adenosine triphosphate, (4) serotonin, (5) dopamine, (6) cholecystokinin, (7) substance P, (8) vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, (9) somatostatin, (10) leu-enkephalin, (11) met-enkephalin, (12) bombesin, (13) neuropeptide Y, and (14) nitric oxide. The specific functions of many of these substances are not known well enough to justify discussion here other than to point out the following characteristics.

Acetylcholine most often excites gastrointestinal activity. Norepinephrine almost always inhibits gastrointestinal activity, as does epinephrine, which reaches the gastrointestinal tract mainly via the blood after it is secreted by the adrenal medullae into the circulation. The other aforementioned transmitter substances are a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory agents, some of which we will discuss in Chapter 64.

## AUTONOMIC CONTROL OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT

Parasympathetic Stimulation Increases Activity of the Enteric Nervous System. The parasympathetic supply to the gut is divided into cranial and sacral divisions, which were discussed in Chapter 61.

Except for a few parasympathetic fibers to the mouth and pharyngeal regions of the alimentary tract, the cranial

parasympathetic nerve fibers are almost entirely in the vagus nerves. These fibers provide extensive innervation to the esophagus, stomach, and pancreas and somewhat less to the intestines down through the first half of the large intestine.

The sacral parasympathetics originate in the second, third, and fourth sacral segments of the spinal cord and pass through the pelvic nerves to the distal half of the large intestine and all the way to the anus. The sigmoidal, rectal, and anal regions are considerably better supplied with parasympathetic fibers than are the other intestinal areas. These fibers function especially to execute the defecation reflexes, discussed in Chapter 64.

The postganglionic neurons of the gastrointestinal parasympathetic system are located mainly in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. Stimulation of these parasympathetic nerves generally increases activity of the entire enteric nervous system, which in turn enhances activity of most gastrointestinal functions.

Sympathetic Stimulation Usually Inhibits Gastrointestinal Tract Activity. The sympathetic fibers to the gastrointestinal tract originate in the spinal cord between segments T5 and L2. Most of the preganglionic fibers that innervate the gut, after leaving the cord, enter the sympathetic chains that lie lateral to the spinal column, and many of these fibers then pass on through the chains to outlying ganglia such as to the celiac ganglion and various mesenteric ganglia. Most of the postganglionic sympathetic neuron bodies are in these ganglia, and postganglionic fibers then spread through postganglionic sympathetic nerves to all parts of the gut. The sympathetics innervate essentially all of the gastrointestinal tract, rather than being more extensive nearest the oral cavity and anus, as is true of the parasympathetics. The sympathetic nerve endings secrete mainly norepinephrine.

In general, stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system inhibits activity of the gastrointestinal tract, causing many effects opposite to those of the parasympathetic system. It exerts its effects in two ways: (1) to a slight extent by direct effect of secreted norepinephrine to inhibit intestinal tract smooth muscle (except the mucosal muscle, which it excites) and (2) to a major extent by an inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on the neurons of the entire enteric nervous system.

Strong stimulation of the sympathetic system can inhibit motor movements of the gut so greatly that this can literally block movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract.

## Afferent Sensory Nerve Fibers From the Gut

Many afferent sensory nerve fibers innervate the gut. Some of the nerve fibers have their cell bodies in the enteric nervous system, and some have them in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord. These sensory nerves can be stimulated by (1) irritation of the gut mucosa,
(2) excessive gut distention, or (3) the presence of specific chemical substances in the gut. Signals transmitted through the fibers can then cause excitation or, under other conditions, inhibition of intestinal movements or intestinal secretion.

In addition, other sensory signals from the gut go all the way to multiple areas of the spinal cord and even to the brain stem. For example, $80 \%$ of the nerve fibers in the vagus nerves are afferent rather than efferent. These afferent fibers transmit sensory signals from the gastrointestinal tract into the brain medulla which, in turn, initiates vagal reflex signals that return to the gastrointestinal tract to control many of its functions.

## Gastrointestinal Reflexes

The anatomical arrangement of the enteric nervous system and its connections with the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems support three types of gastrointestinal reflexes that are essential to gastrointestinal control.

1. Reflexes that are integrated entirely within the gut wall enteric nervous system. These reflexes include, for example, those that control much gastrointestinal secretion, peristalsis, mixing contractions, local inhibitory effects, and so forth.
2. Reflexes from the gut to the prevertebral sympathetic ganglia and then back to the gastrointestinal tract. These reflexes transmit signals long distances to other areas of the gastrointestinal tract, such as signals from the stomach to cause evacuation of the colon (the gastrocolic reflex), signals from the colon and small intestine to inhibit stomach motility and stomach secretion (the enterogastric reflexes), and reflexes from the colon to inhibit emptying of ileal contents into the colon (the colonoileal reflex).
3. Reflexes from the gut to the spinal cord or brain stem and then back to the gastrointestinal tract. These reflexes include especially the following: (1) reflexes from the stomach and duodenum to the brain stem and back to the stomach-via the vagus nervesto control gastric motor and secretory activity; (2) pain reflexes that cause general inhibition of the entire gastrointestinal tract; and (3) defecation reflexes that travel from the colon and rectum to the spinal cord and back again to produce the powerful colonic, rectal, and abdominal contractions required for defecation (the defecation reflexes).

## HORMONAL CONTROL OF GASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY

The gastrointestinal hormones are released into the portal circulation and exert physiological actions on target cells with specific receptors for the hormone. The effects of the hormones persist even after all nervous connections between the site of release and the site of action have been severed. Table 63-1 outlines the actions of each

Table 63-1 Gastrointestinal Hormone Actions, Stimuli for Secretion, and Site of Secretion

| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |

gastrointestinal hormone, as well as the stimuli for secretion and sites at which secretion takes place.

In Chapter 65, we discuss the extreme importance of several hormones for controlling gastrointestinal secretion. Most of these same hormones also affect motility in some parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the motility effects are usually less important than the secretory effects of the hormones, some of the more important motility effects are described in the following paragraphs.

Gastrin is secreted by the "G" cells of the antrum of the stomach in response to stimuli associated with ingestion of a meal, such as distention of the stomach, the products of proteins, and gastrin-releasing peptide, which is released by the nerves of the gastric mucosa during vagal stimulation. The primary actions of gastrin are (1) stimulation of gastric acid secretion and (2) stimulation of growth of the gastric mucosa.

Cholecystokinin (CCK) is secreted by "I" cells in the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum mainly in response to digestive products of fat, fatty acids, and monoglycerides in the intestinal contents. This hormone strongly contracts the gallbladder, expelling bile into the small intestine, where the bile, in turn, plays important roles in emulsifying fatty substances and allowing them to be digested and absorbed. CCK also inhibits stomach contraction moderately. Therefore, at the same time that this hormone causes emptying of the gallbladder, it also slows the emptying of food from the stomach to give adequate time for digestion of the fats in the upper intestinal tract.

CCK also inhibits appetite to prevent overeating during meals by stimulating sensory afferent nerve fibers in the duodenum; these fibers, in turn, send signals by way of the vagus nerve to inhibit feeding centers in the brain as discussed in Chapter 72.

Secretin, the first gastrointestinal hormone discovered, is secreted by the " S " cells in the mucosa of the duodenum in response to acidic gastric juice emptying into the duodenum from the pylorus of the stomach. Secretin has a mild effect on motility of the gastrointestinal tract and acts to promote pancreatic secretion of bicarbonate, which in turn helps to neutralize acid in the small intestine.

Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (also called gastric inhibitory peptide [GIP]) is secreted by the mucosa of the upper small intestine, mainly in response to fatty acids and amino acids but to a lesser extent in response to carbohydrate. It has a mild effect in decreasing motor activity of the stomach and therefore slows emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum when the upper small intestine is already overloaded with food products. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, at blood levels even lower than those needed to inhibit gastric motility, also stimulates insulin secretion.

Motilin is secreted by the stomach and upper duodenum during fasting, and the only known function of this hormone is to increase gastrointestinal motility. Motilin is released cyclically and stimulates waves of gastrointestinal motility called interdigestive myoelectric complexes that move through the stomach and small intestine every

90 minutes in a person who has fasted. Motilin secretion is inhibited after ingestion of food by mechanisms that are not fully understood.

## FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENTS IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT

Two types of movements occur in the gastrointestinal tract: (1) propulsive movements, which cause food to move forward along the tract at an appropriate rate to accommodate digestion and absorption, and (2) mixing movements, which keep the intestinal contents thoroughly mixed at all times.

## PROPULSIVE MOVEMENTS—PERISTALSIS

The basic propulsive movement of the gastrointestinal tract is peristalsis, which is illustrated in Figure 63-5A. A contractile ring appears around the gut and then moves forward; this mechanism is analogous to putting one's fingers around a thin distended tube, then constricting the fingers and sliding them forward along the tube. Any material in front of the contractile ring is moved forward.

Peristalsis is an inherent property of many syncytial smooth muscle tubes; stimulation at any point in the gut can cause a contractile ring to appear in the circular muscle, and this ring then spreads along the gut tube. (Peristalsis also occurs in the bile ducts, glandular ducts, ureters, and many other smooth muscle tubes of the body.)

The usual stimulus for intestinal peristalsis is distention of the gut. That is, if a large amount of food collects at any point in the gut, stretching of the gut wall stimulates the enteric nervous system to contract the gut wall 2 to 3 centimeters behind this point, and a contractile ring appears that initiates a peristaltic movement. Other stimuli that can initiate peristalsis include chemical or physical irritation of the epithelial lining in the gut. Also, strong parasympathetic nervous signals to the gut will elicit strong peristalsis.

Function of the Myenteric Plexus in Peristalsis. Peristalsis occurs only weakly or not at all in any portion of the gastrointestinal tract that has congenital absence of the myenteric plexus. Also, it is greatly depressed or completely blocked in the entire gut when a person is treated with atropine to paralyze the cholinergic nerve endings of the myenteric plexus. Therefore, effectual peristalsis requires an active myenteric plexus.

## Peristaltic Waves Move Toward the Anus With Downstream Receptive Relaxation-"Law of the Gut." Per

istalsis, theoretically, can occur in either direction from a stimulated point, but it normally dies out rapidly in the orad (toward the mouth) direction while continuing for a considerable distance toward the anus. The exact cause of this directional transmission of peristalsis is uncertain, although it probably results mainly from the fact that
A. Peristalsis contractions (esophagus, stomach, small intestine)
![gu047937568e](gu047937568e.jpg)
B. Segmentation contractions (small and large intestines)
![gu057937568e](gu057937568e.jpg)

Figure 63-5. Peristalsis involves contraction and downstream relaxation in the esophagus, stomach and small intestine propel the contents toward the anus. Intermittent segmentation contractions in separate sections of the small and large intestines mix their contents with little forward movement.
the myenteric plexus is "polarized" in the anal direction, which can be explained as follows.

When a segment of the intestinal tract is excited by distention and thereby initiates peristalsis, the contractile ring causing the peristalsis normally begins on the orad side of the distended segment and moves toward the distended segment, pushing the intestinal contents in the anal direction for 5 to 10 centimeters before dying out (Video 63-1). At the same time, the gut sometimes relaxes several centimeters downstream toward the anus, which is called "receptive relaxation," thus allowing the food to be propelled more easily toward the anus than toward the mouth.

This complex pattern does not occur in the absence of the myenteric plexus. Therefore, the complex is called the myenteric reflex or the peristaltic reflex. The peristaltic reflex plus the anal direction of movement of the peristalsis is called the "law of the gut."

## SEGMENTATION CONTRACTIONS— MIXING MOVEMENTS

Mixing movements differ in different parts of the alimentary tract. In some areas, the peristaltic contractions cause most of the mixing. This is especially true when forward progression of the intestinal contents is blocked by

a sphincter so that a peristaltic wave can then only churn the intestinal contents, rather than propelling them forward. At other times, local intermittent segmentation contractions occur every few centimeters in the gut wall (see Figure 63-58). These constrictions usually last only 5 to 30 seconds; new constrictions then occur at other points in the gut, thus "chopping" and "shearing" the contents first here and then there. These peristaltic and constrictive movements are modified in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract for proper propulsion and mixing, as discussed for each portion of the tract in Chapter 64.

## GASTROINTESTINAL BLOOD FLOWSPLANCHNIC CIRCULATION

The blood vessels of the gastrointestinal system are part of a more extensive system called the splanchnic circulation, shown in Figure 63-6. It includes the blood flow through the gut plus blood flows through the spleen, pancreas, and liver. The design of this system is such that all the blood that courses through the gut, spleen, and pancreas then flows immediately into the liver by way of the portal vein. In the liver, the blood passes through millions of minute liver sinusoids and finally leaves the liver via hepatic veins that empty into the vena cava of the general circulation. This flow of blood through the liver, before it empties into the vena cava, allows the reticuloendothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids to remove bacteria and other particulate matter that might enter the blood from the gastrointestinal tract, thus preventing direct transport of potentially harmful agents into the remainder of the body.

The nonfat, water-soluble nutrients absorbed from the gut (e.g., carbohydrates and proteins) are transported in the portal venous blood to the same liver sinusoids. Here, both the reticuloendothelial cells and the principal parenchymal cells of the liver, the hepatic cells, absorb and store temporarily from $50 \%$ to $75 \%$ of the nutrients. Also, much chemical intermediary processing of these nutrients occurs in the liver cells. These nutritional functions of the liver are discussed in Chapters 68 through 72. Almost all of the fats absorbed from the intestinal tract are not carried in the portal blood but instead are absorbed into the intestinal lymphatics and then conducted to the systemic circulating blood by way of the thoracic duct, bypassing the liver.

## ANATOMY OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL BLOOD SUPPLY

Figure 63-7 shows the general features of the arterial blood supply to the gut, including the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries supplying the walls of the small and large intestines via an arching arterial system. Not shown in the figure is the celiac artery, which provides a similar blood supply to the stomach.

On entering the wall of the gut, the arteries branch and send smaller arteries circling in both directions around
![gu067937568e](gu067937568e.jpg)

Figure 63-6. Splanchnic circulation.
the gut, with the tips of these arteries meeting on the side of the gut wall opposite the mesenteric attachment. From the circling arteries, still much smaller arteries penetrate into the intestinal wall and spread (1) along the muscle bundles, (2) into the intestinal villi, and (3) into submucosal vessels beneath the epithelium to serve the secretory and absorptive functions of the gut.

Figure 63-8 shows the special organization of the blood flow through an intestinal villus, including a small arteriole and venule that interconnect with a system of multiple looping capillaries. The walls of the arterioles are highly muscular and highly active in controlling villus blood flow.

## EFFECT OF GUT ACTIVITY AND METABOLIC FACTORS ON GASTROINTESTINAL BLOOD FLOW

Under normal conditions, the blood flow in each area of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as in each layer of the gut wall, is directly related to the level of local activity. For example, during active absorption of nutrients, blood flow in the villi and adjacent regions of the submucosa increases as much as eightfold. Likewise, blood flow in the muscle layers of the intestinal wall increases with increased motor activity in the gut. After a meal, the motor activity, secretory activity, and absorptive activity all increase; likewise, the blood flow increases greatly but then decreases back to the resting level over another 2 to 4 hours.

Mechanisms of Increased Blood Flow During Gastrointestinal Activity. Although the precise causes of the increased blood flow during increased gastrointestinal activity are still unclear, some facts are known.

![gu077937568e](gu077937568e.jpg)

Figure 63-7. Arterial blood supply to the intestines through the mesenteric web.

First, several vasodilator substances are released from the mucosa of the intestinal tract during the digestive process. Most of these substances are peptide hormones, including cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, gastrin, and secretin. These same hormones control specific motor and secretory activities of the gut, as discussed in Chapters 64 and 65.

Second, some of the gastrointestinal glands also release into the gut wall two kinins, kallidin and bradykinin, at the same time that they secrete other substances into the lumen. These kinins are powerful vasodilators that are believed to cause much of the increased mucosal vasodilation that occurs along with secretion.

Third, decreased oxygen concentration in the gut wall can increase intestinal blood flow at least $50 \%$ to $100 \%$; therefore, the increased mucosal and gut wall metabolic rate during gut activity probably lowers the oxygen concentration enough to cause much of the vasodilation. The decrease in oxygen can also lead to as much as a fourfold increase of adenosine, a well-known vasodilator that could be responsible for much of the increased flow.

Thus, the increased blood flow during increased gastrointestinal activity is probably a combination of
many of the aforementioned factors plus still others yet undiscovered.

## "Countercurrent" Blood Flow in the Villi. Note in Figure 63-8 that the arterial flow into the villus and the venous flow out of the villus are in directions opposite to each other and that the vessels lie in close apposition to each other. Because of this vascular arrangement, much of the blood oxygen diffuses out of the arterioles directly into the adjacent venules without ever being carried in the blood to the tips of the villi. As much as $80 \%$ of the oxygen may take this short-circuit route and is therefore not available for local metabolic functions of the villi. This type of countercurrent mechanism in the villi is analogous to the countercurrent mechanism in the vasa recta of the kidney medulla, which was discussed in Chapter 29.

Under normal conditions, this shunting of oxygen from the arterioles to the venules is not harmful to the villi, but in disease conditions in which blood flow to the gut becomes greatly curtailed, such as in circulatory shock, the oxygen deficit in the tips of the villi can become so great that the villus tip or even the whole villus undergoes ischemic death and disintegrates. For this reason and other reasons, in many

gastrointestinal diseases the villi become seriously blunted, leading to greatly diminished intestinal absorptive capacity.

## NERVOUS CONTROL OF GASTROINTESTINAL BLOOD FLOW

Stimulation of the parasympathetic nerves going to the stomach and lower colon increases local blood flow at the same time that it increases glandular secretion. This increased flow probably results secondarily from the increased glandular activity, not as a direct effect of the nervous stimulation.

Sympathetic stimulation, by contrast, has a direct effect on essentially all the gastrointestinal tract to cause intense vasoconstriction of the arterioles and greatly decreased blood flow. After a few minutes of this vasoconstriction, the flow often returns to near normal by means of a mechanism called "autoregulatory escape." That is, the local metabolic vasodilator mechanisms that are elicited by ischemia override the sympathetic vasoconstriction, returning toward normal the necessary nutrient blood flow to the gastrointestinal glands and muscle.

## Importance of Nervous Depression of Gastrointestinal Blood Flow When Other Parts of the Body Need

Extra Blood Flow. A major value of sympathetic vasoconstriction in the gut is that it allows shutoff of gastrointestinal and other splanchnic blood flow for short periods during heavy exercise when the skeletal muscle and heart need increased flow. Also, in circulatory shock, when all the body's vital tissues are in danger of cellular death for lack of blood flow-especially the brain and the heartsympathetic stimulation can decrease splanchnic blood flow to very little for many hours.

Sympathetic stimulation also causes strong vasoconstriction of the large-volume intestinal and mesenteric veins. This vasoconstriction decreases the volume of these veins, thereby displacing large amounts of blood into other parts of the circulation. In persons experiencing hemorrhagic shock or other states of low blood volume, this mechanism can provide as much as 200 to 400 ml of extra blood to sustain the general circulation.

# Propulsion and Mixing of Food in the Alimentary Tract 

The time that food remains in each part of the alimentary tract is critical for optimal processing and absorption of nutrients. In addition, appropriate mixing must be provided. Because the requirements for mixing and propulsion are quite different at each stage of processing, multiple automatic nervous and hormonal mechanisms control the timing of each of these activities so they will occur optimally-not too rapidly and not too slowly.

This chapter discusses these movements, especially the automatic mechanisms of this control.

## INGESTION OF FOOD

The amount of food that a person ingests is determined principally by an intrinsic desire for food called hunger. The type of food that a person preferentially seeks is determined by appetite. These mechanisms are extremely important for maintaining an adequate nutritional supply for the body and are discussed in Chapter 72 in relation to nutrition of the body. The current discussion is confined to the mechanics of food ingestion, especially mastication and swallowing.

## MASTICATION (CHEWING)

The teeth are admirably designed for chewing. The anterior teeth (incisors) provide a strong cutting action, and the posterior teeth (molars) provide a grinding action. All the jaw muscles working together can close the teeth with a force as great as 55 pounds on the incisors and 200 pounds on the molars.

Most of the muscles of chewing are innervated by the motor branch of the fifth cranial nerve, and the chewing process is controlled by nuclei in the brain stem. Stimulation of specific reticular areas in the brain stem taste centers will cause rhythmic chewing movements. In addition, stimulation of areas in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and even the cerebral cortex near the sensory areas for taste and smell can cause chewing.

Much of the chewing process is caused by a chewing reflex. The presence of a bolus of food in the mouth at first initiates reflex inhibition of the muscles of mastication, which allows the lower jaw to drop. This drop in turn
initiates a stretch reflex of the jaw muscles that leads to rebound contraction. This action automatically raises the jaw to cause closure of the teeth, but it also compresses the bolus again against the linings of the mouth, which inhibits the jaw muscles once again, allowing the jaw to drop and rebound another time; this process is repeated again and again.

Chewing is important for digestion of all foods, but it is especially important for most fruits and raw vegetables because they have indigestible cellulose membranes around their nutrient portions that must be broken before the food can be digested. Furthermore, chewing aids the digestion of food for another simple reason-digestive enzymes act only on the surfaces of food particles. Therefore, the rate of digestion depends on the total surface area exposed to the digestive secretions. In addition, grinding the food to a very fine particulate consistency prevents excoriation of the gastrointestinal tract and increases the ease with which food is emptied from the stomach into the small intestine, then into all succeeding segments of the gut.

## SWALLOWING (DEGLUTITION)

Swallowing is a complicated mechanism, principally because the pharynx subserves respiration and swallowing. The pharynx is converted for only a few seconds at a time into a tract for propulsion of food. It is especially important that respiration not be compromised because of swallowing.

In general, swallowing can be divided into the following stages: (1) a voluntary stage, which initiates the swallowing process; (2) a pharyngeal stage, which is involuntary and constitutes passage of food through the pharynx into the esophagus; and (3) an esophageal stage, another involuntary phase that transports food from the pharynx to the stomach.

Voluntary Stage of Swallowing. When the food is ready for swallowing, it is "voluntarily" squeezed or rolled posteriorly into the pharynx by pressure of the tongue upward and backward against the palate, as shown in Figure 64-1. From here on, swallowing becomes entirely-or almost entirely-automatic and ordinarily cannot be stopped.

![gu097937568e](gu097937568e.jpg)

Figure 64-1. Swallowing mechanism.

Involuntary Pharyngeal Stage of Swallowing. As the bolus of food enters the posterior mouth and pharynx, it stimulates epithelial swallowing receptor areas all around the opening of the pharynx, especially on the tonsillar pillars, and impulses from these areas pass to the brain stem to initiate a series of automatic pharyngeal muscle contractions as follows:

1. The soft palate is pulled upward to close the posterior nares to prevent reflux of food into the nasal cavities.
2. The palatopharyngeal folds on each side of the pharynx are pulled medially to approximate each other. In this way, these folds form a sagittal slit through which the food must pass into the posterior pharynx. This slit performs a selective action, allowing food that has been masticated sufficiently to pass with ease. Because this stage of swallowing lasts less than 1 second, any large object is usually impeded too much to pass into the esophagus.
3. The vocal cords of the larynx are strongly approximated, and the larynx is pulled upward and anteriorly by the neck muscles. These actions, combined with the presence of ligaments that prevent upward movement of the epiglottis, cause the epiglottis to swing backward over the opening of the larynx. All these effects acting together prevent passage of food into the nose and trachea. Most essential is the tight approximation of the vocal cords, but the epiglottis helps to prevent food from ever getting as far as the vocal cords. Destruction of the vocal cords or of the muscles that approximate them can cause strangulation.
4. The upward movement of the larynx also pulls up and enlarges the opening to the esophagus. At the same time, the upper 3 to 4 centimeters of the esophageal muscular wall, called the upper esophageal sphincter (also called the pharyngoesophageal
sphincter), relaxes. Thus, food moves easily and freely from the posterior pharynx into the upper esophagus. Between swallows, this sphincter remains strongly contracted, thereby preventing air from going into the esophagus during respiration. The upward movement of the larynx also lifts the glottis out of the main stream of food flow, so the food mainly passes on each side of the epiglottis rather than over its surface; this action adds still another protection against entry of food into the trachea.
5. Once the larynx is raised and the pharyngoesophageal sphincter becomes relaxed, the entire muscular wall of the pharynx contracts, beginning in the superior part of the pharynx, then spreading downward over the middle and inferior pharyngeal areas, which propels the food by peristalsis into the esophagus.
To summarize the mechanics of the pharyngeal stage of swallowing: The trachea is closed, the esophagus is opened, and a fast peristaltic wave initiated by the nervous system of the pharynx forces the bolus of food into the upper esophagus, with the entire process occurring in less than 2 seconds.

Nervous Initiation of the Pharyngeal Stage of Swallowing. The most sensitive tactile areas of the posterior mouth and pharynx for initiating the pharyngeal stage of swallowing lie in a ring around the pharyngeal opening, with greatest sensitivity on the tonsillar pillars. Impulses are transmitted from these areas through the sensory portions of the trigeminal and glossopharyngeal nerves into the medulla oblongata, either into or closely associated with the tractus solitarius, which receives essentially all sensory impulses from the mouth.

The successive stages of the swallowing process are then automatically initiated in orderly sequence by neuronal areas of the reticular substance of the medulla and lower portion of the pons. The sequence of the swallowing reflex is the same from one swallow to the next, and the timing of the entire cycle also remains constant from one swallow to the next. The areas in the medulla and lower pons that control swallowing are collectively called the deglutition or swallowing center.

The motor impulses from the swallowing center to the pharynx and upper esophagus that cause swallowing are transmitted successively by the fifth, ninth, tenth, and twelfth cranial nerves and even a few of the superior cervical nerves.

In summary, the pharyngeal stage of swallowing is principally a reflex act. It is almost always initiated by voluntary movement of food into the back of the mouth, which in turn excites involuntary pharyngeal sensory receptors to elicit the swallowing reflex.

The Pharyngeal Stage of Swallowing Momentarily Interrupts Respiration. The entire pharyngeal stage of swallowing usually occurs in less than 6 seconds, there-

by interrupting respiration for only a fraction of a usual respiratory cycle. The swallowing center specifically inhibits the respiratory center of the medulla during this time, halting respiration at any point in its cycle to allow swallowing to proceed. Yet, even while a person is talking, swallowing interrupts respiration for such a short time that it is hardly noticeable.

The Esophageal Stage of Swallowing Involves Two Types of Peristalsis. The esophagus functions primarily to conduct food rapidly from the pharynx to the stomach, and its movements are organized specifically for this function.

The esophagus normally exhibits two types of peristaltic movements: primary peristalsis and secondary peristalsis. Primary peristalsis is simply continuation of the peristaltic wave that begins in the pharynx and spreads into the esophagus during the pharyngeal stage of swallowing. This wave passes all the way from the pharynx to the stomach in about 8 to 10 seconds. Food swallowed by a person who is in the upright position is usually transmitted to the lower end of the esophagus even more rapidly than the peristaltic wave itself, in about 5 to 8 seconds, because of the additional effect of gravity pulling the food downward.

If the primary peristaltic wave fails to move all the food that has entered the esophagus into the stomach, secondary peristaltic waves result from distention of the esophagus by the retained food; these waves continue until all the food has emptied into the stomach. The secondary peristaltic waves are initiated partly by intrinsic neural circuits in the myenteric nervous system and partly by reflexes that begin in the pharynx and are then transmitted upward through vagal afferent fibers to the medulla and back again to the esophagus through glossopharyngeal and vagal efferent nerve fibers.

The musculature of the pharyngeal wall and upper third of the esophagus is striated muscle. Therefore, the peristaltic waves in these regions are controlled by skeletal nerve impulses from the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. In the lower two-thirds of the esophagus, the musculature is smooth muscle, but this portion of the esophagus is also strongly controlled by the vagus nerves that act through connections with the esophageal myenteric nervous system. When the vagus nerves to the esophagus are cut, the myenteric nerve plexus of the esophagus becomes excitable enough after several days to cause strong secondary peristaltic waves even without support from the vagal reflexes. Therefore, even after paralysis of the brain stem swallowing reflex, food fed by tube or in some other way into the esophagus still passes readily into the stomach.

Receptive Relaxation of the Stomach. When the esophageal peristaltic wave approaches the stomach, a wave of relaxation, transmitted through myenteric inhibitory neurons, precedes the peristalsis. Furthermore, the entire
stomach and, to a lesser extent, even the duodenum become relaxed as this wave reaches the lower end of the esophagus and thus are prepared ahead of time to receive the food propelled into the esophagus during the swallowing act.

Function of the Lower Esophageal Sphincter (Gastroesophageal Sphincter). At the lower end of the esophagus, extending upward about 3 centimeters above its juncture with the stomach, the esophageal circular muscle functions as a broad lower esophageal sphincter, also called the gastroesophageal sphincter. This sphincter normally remains tonically constricted with an intraluminal pressure at this point in the esophagus of about 30 mm Hg , in contrast to the midportion of the esophagus, which normally remains relaxed. When a peristaltic swallowing wave passes down the esophagus, "receptive relaxation" of the lower esophageal sphincter occurs ahead of the peristaltic wave, which allows easy propulsion of the swallowed food into the stomach. Rarely, the sphincter does not relax satisfactorily, resulting in a condition called achalasia. This condition is discussed in Chapter 67.

The stomach secretions are highly acidic and contain many proteolytic enzymes. The esophageal mucosa, except in the lower one-eighth of the esophagus, is not capable of resisting the digestive action of gastric secretions for long. Fortunately, the tonic constriction of the lower esophageal sphincter helps prevent significant reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus except under abnormal conditions.

Prevention of Esophageal Reflux by Valvelike Closure of the Distal End of the Esophagus. Another factor that helps prevent reflux is a valvelike mechanism of a short portion of the esophagus that extends slightly into the stomach. Increased intra-abdominal pressure caves the esophagus inward at this point. Thus, this valvelike closure of the lower esophagus helps to prevent high intra-abdominal pressure from forcing stomach contents backward into the esophagus. Otherwise, whenever we walk, cough, or breathe hard, stomach acid might be expelled into the esophagus.

## MOTOR FUNCTIONS OF THE STOMACH

The motor functions of the stomach are threefold: (1) storage of large quantities of food until the food can be processed in the stomach, duodenum, and lower intestinal tract; (2) mixing of this food with gastric secretions until it forms a semifluid mixture called chyme; and (3) slow emptying of the chyme from the stomach into the small intestine at a rate suitable for proper digestion and absorption by the small intestine.

Figure 64-2 shows the basic anatomy of the stomach. Anatomically, the stomach is usually divided into two major parts: (1) the body and (2) the antrum. Physiologically, it is more appropriately divided into (1) the "orad"

![gu107937568e](gu107937568e.jpg)

Figure 64-2. Physiological anatomy of the stomach.
portion, comprising about the first two-thirds of the body, and (2) the "caudad" portion, comprising the remainder of the body plus the antrum.

## STORAGE FUNCTION OF THE STOMACH

As food enters the stomach, it forms concentric circles of the food in the orad portion of the stomach, with the newest food lying closest to the esophageal opening and the oldest food lying nearest the outer wall of the stomach. Normally, when food stretches the stomach, a "vagovagal reflex" from the stomach to the brain stem and then back to the stomach reduces the tone in the muscular wall of the body of the stomach so that the wall bulges progressively outward, accommodating greater and greater quantities of food up to a limit in the completely relaxed stomach of 0.8 to 1.5 liters. The pressure in the stomach remains low until this limit is approached.

## FOOD MIXING AND PROPULSION IN THE STOMACH—BASIC ELECTRICAL RHYTHM OF THE STOMACH WALL

The digestive juices of the stomach are secreted by gastric glands, which are present in almost the entire wall of the body of the stomach except along a narrow strip on the lesser curvature of the stomach. These secretions come immediately into contact with that portion of the stored food lying against the mucosal surface of the stomach. As long as food is in the stomach, weak peristaltic constrictor waves, called mixing waves, begin in the mid to upper portions of the stomach wall and move toward the antrum about once every 15 to 20 seconds. These waves are initiated by the gut wall basic electrical rhythm, which was discussed in Chapter 63, consisting of electrical "slow waves" that occur spontaneously in the stomach wall. As the constrictor waves progress from the body of
the stomach into the antrum, they become more intense, some becoming extremely intense and providing powerful peristaltic action potential-driven constrictor rings that force the antral contents under higher and higher pressure toward the pylorus.

These constrictor rings also play an important role in mixing the stomach contents in the following way: Each time a peristaltic wave passes down the antral wall toward the pylorus, it digs deeply into the food contents in the antrum. Yet, the opening of the pylorus is still small enough that only a few milliliters or less of antral contents are expelled into the duodenum with each peristaltic wave. Also, as each peristaltic wave approaches the pylorus, the pyloric muscle often contracts, which further impedes emptying through the pylorus. Therefore, most of the antral contents are squeezed upstream through the peristaltic ring toward the body of the stomach, not through the pylorus. Thus, the moving peristaltic constrictive ring, combined with this upstream squeezing action, called "retropulsion," is an exceedingly important mixing mechanism in the stomach.

Chyme. After food in the stomach has become thoroughly mixed with the stomach secretions, the resulting mixture that passes down the gut is called chyme. The degree of fluidity of the chyme leaving the stomach depends on the relative amounts of food, water, and stomach secretions and on the degree of digestion that has occurred. The appearance of chyme is that of a murky semifluid or paste.

Hunger Contractions. Besides the peristaltic contractions that occur when food is present in the stomach, another type of intense contractions, called hunger contractions, often occurs when the stomach has been empty for several hours or more. These contractions are rhythmic peristaltic contractions in the body of the stomach. When the successive contractions become extremely strong, they often fuse to cause a continuing tetanic contraction that sometimes lasts for 2 to 3 minutes.

Hunger contractions are most intense in young, healthy people who have high degrees of gastrointestinal tonus; they are also greatly increased by the person's having lower than normal levels of blood sugar. When hunger contractions occur in the stomach, the person sometimes experiences mild pain in the pit of the stomach, called hunger pangs. Hunger pangs usually do not begin until 12 to 24 hours after the last ingestion of food; in people who are in a state of starvation, they reach their greatest intensity in 3 to 4 days and gradually weaken in succeeding days.

## STOMACH EMPTYING

Stomach emptying is promoted by intense peristaltic contractions in the stomach antrum. At the same time, emptying is opposed by varying degrees of resistance to passage of chyme at the pylorus.

Intense Antral Peristaltic Contractions During Stomach Emptying-"Pyloric Pump." Most of the time, the rhythmic stomach contractions are weak and function mainly to cause mixing of food and gastric secretions. However, for about $20 \%$ of the time while food is in the stomach, the contractions become intense, beginning in midstomach and spreading through the caudad stomach. These contractions are strong peristaltic, very tight ringlike constrictions that can cause stomach emptying. As the stomach becomes progressively more and more empty, these constrictions begin farther and farther up the body of the stomach, gradually pinching off the food in the body of the stomach and adding this food to the chyme in the antrum. These intense peristaltic contractions often create 50 to 70 centimeters of water pressure, which is about six times as powerful as the usual mixing type of peristaltic waves.

When pyloric tone is normal, each strong peristaltic wave forces up to several milliliters of chyme into the duodenum. Thus, the peristaltic waves, in addition to causing mixing in the stomach, also provide a pumping action called the "pyloric pump."

Role of the Pylorus in Controlling Stomach Emptying. The distal opening of the stomach is the pylorus. Here the thickness of the circular wall muscle becomes $50 \%$ to $100 \%$ greater than in the earlier portions of the stomach antrum, and it remains slightly tonically contracted almost all the time. Therefore, the pyloric circular muscle is called the pyloric sphincter.

Despite normal tonic contraction of the pyloric sphincter, the pylorus usually is open enough for water and other fluids to empty from the stomach into the duodenum with ease. Yet, the constriction usually prevents passage of food particles until they have become mixed in the chyme to almost fluid consistency. The degree of constriction of the pylorus is increased or decreased under the influence of nervous and hormonal signals from both the stomach and the duodenum, as discussed shortly.

## REGULATION OF STOMACH EMPTYING

The rate at which the stomach empties is regulated by signals from the stomach and the duodenum. However, the duodenum provides far more potent signals, controlling the emptying of chyme into the duodenum at a rate no greater than the rate at which the chyme can be digested and absorbed in the small intestine.

## Gastric Factors That Promote Emptying

Effect of Gastric Food Volume on Rate of Emptying. Increased food volume in the stomach promotes increased emptying from the stomach. However, it is not increased storage pressure of the food in the stomach that causes the increased emptying because, in the usual normal range of volume, the increase in volume does not increase the pressure much. However, stretching of the
stomach wall does elicit local myenteric reflexes in the wall that greatly accentuate activity of the pyloric pump and at the same time inhibit the pylorus.

The Hormone Gastrin Promotes Stomach Emptying. In Chapter 65, we discuss how stretching of the stomach wall and the presence of certain types of foods in the stomach-particularly digestive products of meat-elicit release of the hormone gastrin from the $G$ cells of the antral mucosa. This has potent effects to cause secretion of highly acidic gastric juice by the stomach glands. Gastrin also has mild to moderate stimulatory effects on motor functions in the body of the stomach. Most important, it seems to enhance the activity of the pyloric pump. Thus, gastrin likely promotes stomach emptying.

## Powerful Duodenal Factors That Inhibit Stomach Emptying

Duodenum Enterogastric Nervous Reflexes Inhibit Stomach Emptying. When food enters the duodenum, multiple nervous reflexes are initiated from the duodenal wall. These reflexes pass back to the stomach to slow or even stop stomach emptying if the volume of chyme in the duodenum becomes too much. These reflexes are mediated by three routes: (1) directly from the duodenum to the stomach through the enteric nervous system in the gut wall; (2) through extrinsic nerves that go to the prevertebral sympathetic ganglia and then back through inhibitory sympathetic nerve fibers to the stomach; and (3) probably to a slight extent through the vagus nerves all the way to the brain stem, where they inhibit the normal excitatory signals transmitted to the stomach through the vagi. All these parallel reflexes have two effects on stomach emptying. First, they strongly inhibit the "pyloric pump" propulsive contractions, and second, they increase the tone of the pyloric sphincter.

The types of factors that are continually monitored in the duodenum and can initiate enterogastric inhibitory reflexes include the following:

1. Distention of the duodenum
2. The presence of any irritation of the duodenal mucosa
3. Acidity of the duodenal chyme
4. Osmolality of the chyme
5. The presence of certain breakdown products in the chyme, especially breakdown products of proteins and, perhaps to a lesser extent, of fats
The enterogastric inhibitory reflexes are especially sensitive to the presence of irritants and acids in the duodenal chyme, and they often become strongly activated in as little as 30 seconds. For example, whenever the pH of the chyme in the duodenum falls below about 3.5 to 4 , the reflexes frequently block further release of acidic stomach contents into the duodenum until the duodenal chyme can be neutralized by pancreatic and other secretions.

Breakdown products of protein digestion also elicit inhibitory enterogastric reflexes; by slowing the rate of

stomach emptying, sufficient time is ensured for adequate protein digestion in the duodenum and small intestine.

Finally, either hypotonic fluids or, especially, hypertonic fluids elicit the inhibitory reflexes. Thus, flow of nonisotonic fluids into the small intestine at too rapid a rate is prevented, thereby also preventing rapid changes in electrolyte concentrations in the whole-body extracellular fluid during absorption of the intestinal contents.

Hormonal Feedback From the Duodenum Inhibits Gastric Emptying-Role of Fats and the Hormone Cholecystokinin. Hormones released from the upper intestine also inhibit stomach emptying. The stimulus for releasing these inhibitory hormones is mainly fats entering the duodenum, although other types of foods can increase the hormones to a lesser degree.

On entering the duodenum, the fats extract several different hormones from the duodenal and jejunal epithelium, either by binding with "receptors" on the epithelial cells or in some other way. In turn, the hormones are carried via the blood to the stomach, where they inhibit the pyloric pump and at the same time increase the strength of contraction of the pyloric sphincter. These effects are important because fats are much slower to be digested than most other foods.

The most potent of these hormones appears to be cholecystokinin (CCK), which is released from the mucosa of the jejunum in response to fatty substances in the chyme. This hormone acts as an inhibitor to block increased stomach motility caused by gastrin.

Other possible inhibitors of stomach emptying are the hormones secretin and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, also called gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). Secretin is released mainly from the duodenal mucosa in response to gastric acid passed from the stomach through the pylorus. GIP has a general but weak effect of decreasing gastrointestinal motility.

GIP is released from the upper small intestine mainly in response to fat in the chyme, but also to a lesser extent in response to carbohydrates. Although GIP inhibits gastric motility under some conditions, its main effect at physiological concentrations is probably mainly to stimulate secretion of insulin by the pancreas.

These hormones are discussed at greater length elsewhere in this text, especially in Chapter 65 in relation to control of gallbladder emptying and control of the rate of pancreatic secretion.

In summary, hormones, especially CCK, scan inhibit gastric emptying when excess quantities of chyme, especially acidic or fatty chyme, enter the duodenum from the stomach.

## Summary of the Control of Stomach Emptying

Emptying of the stomach is controlled only to a moderate degree by stomach factors such as the degree of filling in the stomach and the excitatory effect of gastrin on
stomach peristalsis. Probably the more important control of stomach emptying resides in inhibitory feedback signals from the duodenum, including both enterogastric inhibitory nervous feedback reflexes and hormonal feedback by CCK. These feedback inhibitory mechanisms work together to slow the rate of emptying when (1) too much chyme is already in the small intestine or (2) the chyme is excessively acidic, contains too much unprocessed protein or fat, is hypotonic or hypertonic, or is irritating. In this way, the rate of stomach emptying is limited to the amount of chyme that the small intestine can process.

## MOVEMENTS OF THE SMALL INTESTINE

Movements of the small intestine, like those elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract, can be divided into mixing contractions and propulsive contractions. To a great extent, this separation is artificial because essentially all movements of the small intestine cause at least some degree of both mixing and propulsion. The usual classification of these processes is described in the following sections.

## MIXING CONTRACTIONS (SEGMENTATION CONTRACTIONS)

When a portion of the small intestine becomes distended with chyme, stretching of the intestinal wall elicits localized concentric contractions spaced at intervals along the intestine and lasting a fraction of a minute. The contractions cause "segmentation" of the small intestine, as shown in Figure 64-3 and Figure 63-5-that is, they divide the intestine into spaced segments that have the appearance of a chain of sausages. As one set of segmentation contractions relaxes, a new set often begins, but the contractions this time occur mainly at new points between the previous contractions. Therefore, the segmentation contractions "chop" the chyme two to three times per minute, in this way promoting progressive mixing of the food with secretions of the small intestine.

The maximum frequency of the segmentation contractions in the small intestine is determined by the frequency
![gu117937568e](gu117937568e.jpg)

Figure 64-3. Segmentation movements of the small intestine.

of electrical slow waves in the intestinal wall, which is the basic electrical rhythm described in Chapter 63. Because this frequency normally is not greater than 12 per minute in the duodenum and proximal jejunum, the maximum frequency of the segmentation contractions in these areas is also about 12 per minute, but this maximum frequency occurs only under extreme conditions of stimulation. In the terminal ileum, the maximum frequency is usually eight to nine contractions per minute.

The segmentation contractions become exceedingly weak when the excitatory activity of the enteric nervous system is blocked by the drug atropine. Therefore, even though it is the slow waves in the smooth muscle that cause the segmentation contractions, these contractions are not effective without background excitation mainly from the myenteric nerve plexus.

## PROPULSIVE MOVEMENTS

Peristalsis in the Small Intestine. Chyme is propelled through the small intestine by peristaltic waves, as discussed in Chapter 63 and illustrated in Figure 63-5. These waves can occur in any part of the small intestine and move toward the anus at a velocity of 0.5 to $2.0 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{sec}$ faster in the proximal intestine and slower in the terminal intestine. They are normally weak and usually die out after traveling only 3 to 5 centimeters. The waves rarely travel farther than 10 centimeters, so forward movement of the chyme is very slow-so slow that net movement along the small intestine normally averages only $1 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{min}$. This rate of travel means that 3 to 5 hours are required for passage of chyme from the pylorus to the ileocecal valve.

Control of Peristalsis by Nervous and Hormonal Signals. Peristaltic activity of the small intestine increases markedly after a meal. This increased activity is caused partly by the beginning entry of chyme into the duodenum, causing stretch of the duodenal wall. In addition, peristaltic activity is increased by the gastroenteric reflex that is initiated by distention of the stomach and conducted principally through the myenteric plexus from the stomach down along the wall of the small intestine.

In addition to the nervous signals that may affect small intestinal peristalsis, several hormonal factors also affect peristalsis. These factors include gastrin, CCK, insulin, motilin, and serotonin, all of which enhance intestinal motility and are secreted during various phases of food processing. Conversely, secretin and glucagon inhibit small intestinal motility. The physiological importance of each of these hormonal factors for controlling motility is still questionable.

The function of the peristaltic waves in the small intestine is not only to cause progression of chyme toward the ileocecal valve but also to spread out the chyme along the intestinal mucosa. As the chyme enters the intestines from the stomach and elicits peristalsis, the peristalsis immediately spreads the chyme along the intestine, and this process
intensifies as additional chyme enters the duodenum. On reaching the ileocecal valve, the chyme is sometimes blocked for several hours until the person eats another meal; at that time, a gastroileal reflex intensifies peristalsis in the ileum and forces the remaining chyme through the ileocecal valve into the cecum of the large intestine.

## Propulsive Effect of the Segmentation Movements.

The segmentation movements, although lasting for only a few seconds at a time, often also travel 1 centimeter or so in the anal direction, and during that time they help propel the food down the intestine. The difference between the segmentation and the peristaltic movements is not as great as might be implied by their separation into these two classifications.

Powerful, Rapid Peristalsis-"Peristaltic Rush." Although peristalsis in the small intestine is normally weak, intense irritation of the intestinal mucosa, as occurs in some severe cases of infectious diarrhea, can cause both powerful and rapid peristalsis, called the peristaltic rush. This phenomenon is initiated partly by nervous reflexes that involve the autonomic nervous system and brain stem and partly by intrinsic enhancement of the myenteric plexus reflexes in the gut wall. The powerful peristaltic contractions travel long distances in the small intestine within minutes, sweeping the contents of the intestine into the colon and thereby relieving the small intestine of irritative chyme and excessive distention.

## THE ILEOCECAL VALVE PREVENTS BACKFLOW FROM THE COLON TO THE SMALL INTESTINE

As shown in Figure 64-4, the ileocecal valve protrudes into the lumen of the cecum and therefore is forcefully closed when excess pressure builds up in the cecum and tries to push cecal contents backward against the valve lips. The valve usually can resist reverse pressure of at least 50 to 60 centimeters of water.

In addition, the wall of the ileum for several centimeters immediately upstream from the ileocecal valve has a thickened circular muscle called the ileocecal sphincter. This sphincter normally remains mildly constricted and


[^0]:    Movements Caused by the Muscularis Mucosae and Muscle Fibers of the Villi. The muscularis mucosae can cause short folds to appear in the intestinal mucosa. In addition, individual fibers from this muscle extend into the intestinal villi and cause them to contract intermittently. The mucosal folds increase the surface area exposed to the chyme, thereby increasing absorption. Also, contractions of the villi-shortening, elongating, and shortening again"milk" the villi so that lymph flows freely from the central lacteals of the villi into the lymphatic system. These mucosal and villous contractions are initiated mainly by local nervous reflexes in the submucosal nerve plexus that occur in response to chyme in the small intestine.

slows emptying of ileal contents into the cecum. However, immediately after a meal, a gastroileal reflex (described earlier) intensifies peristalsis in the ileum, and emptying of ileal contents into the cecum proceeds.

Resistance to emptying at the ileocecal valve prolongs the stay of chyme in the ileum and thereby facilitates absorption. Normally, only 1500 to 2000 ml of chyme empty into the cecum each day.

Feedback Control of the Ileocecal Sphincter by Reflexes From the Cecum. The degree of contraction of the ileocecal sphincter and the intensity of peristalsis in the terminal ileum are controlled significantly by reflexes from the cecum. When the cecum is distended, contraction of the ileocecal sphincter becomes intensified and ileal peristalsis is inhibited, both of which greatly delay emptying of additional chyme into the cecum from the ileum. Also, any irritant in the cecum delays emptying. For example, when a person has an inflamed appendix, the irritation of this vestigial remnant of the cecum can cause such intense spasm of the ileocecal sphincter and partial paralysis of the ileum that these effects together block emptying of the ileum into the cecum. The reflexes from the cecum to the ileocecal sphincter and ileum are mediated both by way of the myenteric plexus in the gut wall and of the extrinsic autonomic nerves, especially by way of the prevertebral sympathetic ganglia.

## MOVEMENTS OF THE COLON

The principal functions of the colon are (1) absorption of water and electrolytes from the chyme to form solid feces and (2) storage of fecal matter until it can be expelled. The proximal half of the colon, shown in Figure 64-5, is concerned principally with absorption, and the distal half with storage. Because intense colon
![gu137937568e](gu137937568e.jpg)

Figure 64-5. Absorptive and storage functions of the large intestine.
wall movements are not required for these functions, the movements of the colon are normally sluggish. Yet, in a sluggish manner, the movements still have characteristics similar to those of the small intestine and can be divided once again into mixing movements and propulsive movements.

Mixing Movements-"Haustrations." In the same manner that segmentation movements occur in the small intestine, large circular constrictions occur in the large intestine. At each of these constrictions, about 2.5 centimeters of the circular muscle contract, sometimes constricting the lumen of the colon almost to occlusion. At the same time, the longitudinal muscle of the colon, which is aggregated into three longitudinal strips called the teniae coli, contracts. These combined contractions of the circular and longitudinal strips of muscle cause the unstimulated portion of the large intestine to bulge outward into baglike sacs called haustrations.

Each haustration usually reaches peak intensity in about 30 seconds and then disappears during the next 60 seconds. At times they also move slowly toward the anus during contraction, especially in the cecum and ascending colon, and thereby provide a minor amount of forward propulsion of the colonic contents. After another few minutes, new haustral contractions occur in other areas nearby. Therefore, the fecal material in the large intestine is slowly dug into and rolled over in much the same manner that one spades the earth. In this way, all the fecal material is gradually exposed to the mucosal surface of the large intestine, and fluid and dissolved substances are progressively absorbed until only 80 to 200 ml of feces are expelled each day.

Propulsive Movements-"Mass Movements." Much of the propulsion in the cecum and ascending colon results from the slow but persistent haustral contractions,

requiring as many as 8 to 15 hours to move the chyme from the ileocecal valve through the colon, while the chyme becomes fecal in quality-a semisolid instead of a semifluid slush.

From the cecum to the sigmoid, mass movements can, for many minutes at a time, take over the propulsive role. These movements usually occur only one to three times each day, in many people especially for about 15 minutes during the first hour after eating breakfast.

A mass movement is a modified type of peristalsis characterized by the following sequence of events. First, a constrictive ring occurs in response to a distended or irritated point in the colon, usually in the transverse colon. Then, rapidly, the 20 or more centimeters of colon distal to the constrictive ring lose their haustrations and instead contract as a unit, propelling the fecal material in this segment en masse further down the colon. The contraction develops progressively more force for about 30 seconds, and relaxation occurs during the next 2 to 3 minutes. Another mass movement then occurs, this time perhaps farther along the colon.

A series of mass movements usually persists for 10 to 30 minutes. They then cease but return perhaps a half day later. When they have forced a mass of feces into the rectum, the desire for defecation is felt.

Initiation of Mass Movements by Gastrocolic and Duodenocolic Reflexes. The appearance of mass movements after meals is facilitated by gastrocolic and duodenocolic reflexes. These reflexes result from distention of the stomach and duodenum. They occur either not at all or hardly at all when the extrinsic autonomic nerves to the colon have been removed; therefore, the reflexes almost certainly are transmitted by way of the autonomic nervous system.

Irritation in the colon can also initiate intense mass movements. For example, a person who has an ulcerated condition of the colon mucosa (ulcerative colitis) frequently has mass movements that persist almost all the time.

## DEFECATION

Most of the time, the rectum is empty of feces, partly because a weak functional sphincter exists about 20 centimeters from the anus at the juncture between the sigmoid colon and the rectum. A sharp angulation is also present here that contributes additional resistance to filling of the rectum.

When a mass movement forces feces into the rectum, the desire for defecation occurs immediately, including reflex contraction of the rectum and relaxation of the anal sphincters.

Continual dribble of fecal matter through the anus is prevented by tonic constriction of the following: (1) an internal anal sphincter, which is a several-centimeterslong thickening of the circular smooth muscle that lies immediately inside the anus; and (2) an external anal
![gu147937568e](gu147937568e.jpg)

Figure 64-6. Afferent and efferent pathways of the parasympathetic mechanism for enhancing the defecation reflex.
sphincter, composed of striated voluntary muscle that both surrounds the internal sphincter and extends distal to it. The external sphincter is controlled by nerve fibers in the pudendal nerve, which is part of the somatic nervous system and therefore is under voluntary, conscious, or at least subconscious control; subconsciously, the external sphincter is usually kept continuously constricted unless conscious signals inhibit the constriction.

Defecation Reflexes. Ordinarily, defecation is initiated by defecation reflexes. One of these reflexes is an intrinsic reflex mediated by the local enteric nervous system in the rectal wall. When feces enter the rectum, distention of the rectal wall initiates afferent signals that spread through the myenteric plexus to initiate peristaltic waves in the descending colon, sigmoid, and rectum, forcing feces toward the anus. As the peristaltic wave approaches the anus, the internal anal sphincter is relaxed by inhibitory signals from the myenteric plexus; if the external anal sphincter is also consciously, voluntarily relaxed at the same time, defecation occurs.

Normally when the intrinsic myenteric defecation reflex is functioning by itself, it is relatively weak. To be effective in causing defecation, it usually must be fortified by another type of defecation reflex called a parasympathetic defecation reflex that involves the sacral segments of the spinal cord, shown in Figure 64-6. When the nerve endings in the rectum are stimulated, signals are transmitted first into the spinal cord and then reflexly back to the descending colon, sigmoid, rectum, and anus via parasympathetic nerve fibers in the pelvic nerves. These parasympathetic signals greatly intensify the peristaltic waves and relax the internal anal sphincter, thus converting the intrinsic myenteric defecation reflex from a weak effort into a powerful process of defecation that is sometimes

effective in emptying the large bowel all the way from the splenic flexure of the colon to the anus.

Defecation signals entering the spinal cord initiate other effects, such as taking a deep breath, closure of the glottis, and contraction of the abdominal wall muscles to force the fecal contents of the colon downward, and at the same time they cause the pelvic floor to relax downward and pull outward on the anal ring to evaginate the feces.

When it becomes convenient for the person to defecate, the defecation reflexes can purposely be activated by taking a deep breath to move the diaphragm downward and then contracting the abdominal muscles to increase the pressure in the abdomen, thus forcing fecal contents into the rectum to cause new reflexes. Reflexes initiated in this way are almost never as effective as those that arise naturally, and thus people who too often inhibit their natural reflexes are likely to become severely constipated.

In newborns and in some people with transected spinal cords, the defecation reflexes cause automatic emptying of the lower bowel at inconvenient times during the day because of lack of conscious control exercised through voluntary contraction or relaxation of the external anal sphincter.

## OTHER AUTONOMIC REFLEXES THAT AFFECT BOWEL ACTIVITY

Aside from the duodenocolic, gastrocolic, gastroileal, enterogastric, and defecation reflexes that have been discussed in this chapter, several other important nervous reflexes also can affect the overall degree of bowel activity. They are the peritoneointestinal reflex, renointestinal reflex, and vesicointestinal reflex.

The peritoneointestinal reflex results from irritation of the peritoneum; it strongly inhibits the excitatory enteric nerves and thereby can cause intestinal paralysis, especially in patients with peritonitis. The renointestinal and vesicointestinal reflexes inhibit intestinal activity as a result of kidney or bladder irritation, respectively.

# Secretory Functions of the Alimentary Tract 

Throughout the gastrointestinal tract, secretory glands subserve two primary functions: (1) digestive enzymes are secreted in most areas of the alimentary tract, from the mouth to the distal end of the ileum; and (2) mucous glands located from the mouth to the anus provide mucus for lubrication and protection of all parts of the alimentary tract.

Most digestive secretions are formed in response to the presence of food in the alimentary tract, and the quantity secreted in each segment of the tract is usually the amount needed for proper digestion. Furthermore, in some portions of the gastrointestinal tract, even the types of enzymes and other constituents of the secretions are varied in accordance with the types of food present. In this chapter we describe the different alimentary secretions, their functions, and regulation of their production.

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ALIMENTARY TRACT SECRETION

## TYPES OF ALIMENTARY TRACT GLANDS

Several types of glands provide the different types of alimentary tract secretions. First, on the surface of the epithelium in most parts of the gastrointestinal tract are billions of single-cell mucous glands called simply mucous cells or sometimes goblet cells because they look like goblets. They function mainly in response to local irritation of the epithelium: They extrude mucus directly onto the epithelial surface to act as a lubricant that also protects the surfaces from excoriation and digestion.

Second, many surface areas of the gastrointestinal tract are lined by pits that represent invaginations of the epithelium into the submucosa. In the small intestine, these pits, called crypts of Lieberkühn, are deep and contain specialized secretory cells. One of these cells is shown in Figure 65-1.

Third, in the stomach and upper duodenum are large numbers of deep tubular glands. A typical tubular gland can be seen in Figure 65-4, which shows an acid- and pepsinogen-secreting gland of the stomach (oxyntic gland).

Fourth, also associated with the alimentary tract are several complex glands-the salivary glands, pancreas, and liver-that provide secretions for digestion or emulsification of food. The liver has a highly specialized structure that is discussed in Chapter 71. The salivary glands and the pancreas are compound acinous glands of the type shown in Figure 65-2. These glands lie outside the walls of the alimentary tract and, in this aspect, they differ from all other alimentary glands. They contain millions of acini lined with secreting glandular cells; these acini feed into a system of ducts that finally empty into the alimentary tract.

## BASIC MECHANISMS OF STIMULATION OF THE ALIMENTARY TRACT GLANDS Contact of Food With Gut Epithelium Activates the Enteric Nervous System and Stimulates Secretion

The presence of food in a particular segment of the gastrointestinal tract usually stimulates the glands of that region and adjacent regions to secrete moderate to large quantities of juices. Part of this local effect, especially the secretion of mucus by mucous cells, results from direct contact stimulation of the surface glandular cells by the food.

![gu167937568e](gu167937568e.jpg)

Figure 65-2. Formation and secretion of saliva by a submandibular salivary gland.

In addition, local epithelial stimulation also activates the enteric nervous system of the gut wall. The types of stimuli that activate this system are (1) tactile stimulation, (2) chemical irritation, and (3) distention of the gut wall. The resulting nervous reflexes stimulate the mucous cells on the gut epithelial surface and the deep glands in the gut wall to increase their secretion.

## Autonomic Stimulation of Secretion

## Parasympathetic Stimulation Increases Alimentary

Tract Glandular Secretion Rate. Stimulation of the parasympathetic nerves to the alimentary tract almost invariably increases the rates of alimentary glandular secretion. This increased secretion rate is especially true of the glands in the upper portion of the tract (innervated by the glossopharyngeal and vagus parasympathetic nerves) such as the salivary glands, esophageal glands, gastric glands, pancreas, and Brunner's glands in the duodenum. It is also true of some glands in the distal portion of the large intestine, which are innervated by pelvic parasympathetic nerves. Secretion in the remainder of the small intestine and in the first two-thirds of the large intestine occurs mainly in response to local neural and hormonal stimuli in each segment of the gut.

Sympathetic Stimulation Has a Dual Effect on Alimentary Tract Glandular Secretion Rate. Stimulation of the sympathetic nerves going to the gastrointestinal tract causes a slight to moderate increase in secretion by some of the local glands. However, sympathetic stimulation also constricts the blood vessels that supply the glands. Therefore, sympathetic stimulation can have a dual effect: (1) sympathetic stimulation alone usually slightly increases secretion, and (2) if parasympathetic or hormonal stimulation is already causing copious secretion by the glands, superimposed sympathetic stimulation usually reduces secretion, sometimes significantly, mainly because of vasoconstrictive reduction of the blood supply.

Regulation of Glandular Secretion by Hormones. In the stomach and intestine, several different gastrointestinal hormones help regulate the volume and composition of the secretions. These hormones are liberated from the gastrointestinal mucosa in response to the presence of food in the lumen of the gut. The hormones are then absorbed into the blood and carried to the glands, where they stimulate secretion. This type of stimulation is particularly valuable to increase the output of gastric juice and pancreatic juice when food enters the stomach or duodenum.

Chemically, the gastrointestinal hormones are polypeptides or polypeptide derivatives and will be discussed in more detail later.

## BASIC MECHANISM OF SECRETION BY GLANDULAR CELLS

Secretion of Organic Substances. Although all the basic mechanisms by which glandular cells function are not known, experimental evidence points to the following principles of secretion, as shown in Figure 65-1.

1. The nutrient material needed for formation of the secretion must first diffuse or be actively transported by the blood in the capillaries into the base of the glandular cell.
2. Many mitochondria located inside the glandular cell near its base use oxidative energy to form adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
3. Energy from the ATP, along with appropriate substrates provided by the nutrients, is then used to synthesize the organic secretory substances; this synthesis occurs almost entirely in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex of the glandular cell. Ribosomes adherent to the reticulum are specifically responsible for formation of proteins that are secreted.
4. The secretory materials are transported through the tubules of the endoplasmic reticulum, passing in about 20 minutes all the way to the vesicles of the Golgi complex.
5. In the Golgi complex, the materials are modified, added to, concentrated, and discharged into the cytoplasm in the form of secretory vesicles, which are stored in the apical ends of the secretory cells.
6. These vesicles remain stored until nervous or hormonal control signals cause the cells to extrude the vesicular contents through the cells' surface. This action probably occurs in the following way. The hormone binds to its receptor and, through one of several possible cell signaling mechanisms, increases the cell membrane permeability to calcium ions. Calcium enters the cell and causes many of the vesicles to fuse with the apical cell membrane. The apical cell membrane then breaks open, thus emptying the vesicles to the exterior; this process is called exocytosis.

Water and Electrolyte Secretion. A second necessity for glandular secretion is secretion of sufficient water and electrolytes to go along with the organic substances. Secretion by the salivary glands, discussed in more detail later, provides an example of how nervous stimulation causes water and salts to pass through the glandular cells in great profusion, washing the organic substances through the secretory border of the cells at the same time. Hormones acting on the cell membrane of some glandular cells also cause secretory effects similar to those caused by nervous stimulation.

## Lubricating and Protective Properties of Mucus in the Gastrointestinal Tract

Mucus is a thick secretion composed mainly of water, electrolytes, and a mixture of several glycoproteins that are composed of large polysaccharides bound with much smaller quantities of protein. Mucus is slightly different in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract, but in all locations it has several important characteristics that make it both an excellent lubricant and a protectant for the gut wall:

1. Mucus has adherent qualities that make it adhere tightly to the food or other particles and to spread as a thin film over the surfaces.
2. It has sufficient body that it coats the wall of the gut and prevents actual contact of most food particles with the mucosa.
3. Mucus has a low resistance for slippage, so the particles can slide along the epithelium with great ease.
4. Mucus causes fecal particles to adhere to one another to form the feces that are expelled during a bowel movement.
5. Mucus is strongly resistant to digestion by the gastrointestinal enzymes.
6. The glycoproteins of mucus have amphoteric properties, which means that they are capable of buffering small amounts of either acids or alkalies; also, mucus often contains moderate quantities of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, which specifically neutralize acids.
Thus, mucus has the ability to allow easy slippage of food along the gastrointestinal tract and to prevent excoriative or chemical damage to the epithelium. A person becomes acutely aware of the lubricating qualities of mucus when the salivary glands fail to secrete saliva, because then it is difficult to swallow solid food even when it is eaten along with large amounts of water.

## SECRETION OF SALIVA

Saliva Contains a Serous Secretion and a Mucus Secretion. The principal glands of salivation are the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands; in addition, there are many tiny buccal glands. Daily secretion of saliva normally ranges between 800 and 1500 ml , as shown by the average value of 1000 ml in Table 65-1.

Saliva contains two major types of protein secretion: (1) a serous secretion that contains ptyalin (an $\alpha$-amylase), which is an enzyme for digesting starches, and (2) mucus

Table 65-1 Daily Alimentary Tract Secretions Juices

| Type of Secretion | Daily Volume (ml) | pH |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Saliva | 1000 | $6.0-7.0$ |
| Gastric secretion | 1500 | $1.0-3.5$ |
| Pancreatic secretion | 1000 | $8.0-8.3$ |
| Bile | 1000 | 7.8 |
| Small intestine secretion | 1800 | $7.5-8.0$ |
| Brunner's gland secretion | 200 | $8.0-8.9$ |
| Large intestinal secretion | 200 | $7.5-8.0$ |
| Total | 6700 |  |

secretion that contains mucin for lubricating and for surface protective purposes.

The parotid glands secrete almost entirely the serous type of secretion, whereas the submandibular and sublingual glands secrete both serous secretion and mucus. The buccal glands secrete only mucus. Saliva has a pH between 6.0 and 7.0 , which is a favorable range for the digestive action of ptyalin.

Secretion of Ions in Saliva. Saliva contains especially large quantities of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$. Conversely, the concentrations of both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$are several times less in saliva than in plasma. One can understand these special concentrations of ions in the saliva from the following description of the mechanism for secretion of saliva.

Figure 65-2 shows secretion by the submandibular gland, a typical compound gland that contains acini and salivary ducts. Salivary secretion is a two-stage operation. The first stage involves the acini, and the second stage involves the salivary ducts. The acini secrete a primary secretion that contains ptyalin and/or mucin in a solution of ions with concentrations not greatly different from those of typical extracellular fluid. As the primary secretion flows through the ducts, two major active transport processes take place that markedly modify the ionic composition of the fluid in the saliva.

First, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is actively reabsorbed from all the salivary ducts and $K^{+}$is actively secreted in exchange for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Therefore, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration of the saliva becomes greatly reduced, whereas $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentration becomes increased. However, there is excess $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption compared with $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion, which creates electrical negativity of about -70 millivolts in the salivary ducts; this negativity in turn causes $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$to be reabsorbed passively. Therefore, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$concentration in the salivary fluid falls to a very low level, matching the ductal decrease in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration.

Second, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is secreted by the ductal epithelium into the lumen of the duct. This secretion is at least partly caused by passive exchange of bicarbonate for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, but it may also result partly from an active secretory process.

The net result of these transport processes is that under resting conditions, the concentrations of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$in saliva are only about $15 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ each, about one-seventh to one-tenth their concentrations in plasma. Conversely,

$\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentration is about $30 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, seven times as great as in plasma, and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration is 50 to $70 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, about two to three times that of plasma.

During maximal salivation, the salivary ionic concentrations change considerably because the formation rate of primary secretion by the acini can increase as much as 20 -fold. This acinar secretion then flows through the ducts so rapidly that the ductal reconditioning of the secretion is considerably reduced. Therefore, when copious quantities of saliva are being secreted, the sodium chloride concentration is about one-half or two-thirds that of plasma, and potassium concentration rises to only four times that of plasma.

Function of Saliva for Oral Hygiene. Under basal awake conditions, about 0.5 ml of saliva, almost entirely of the mucous type, is secreted each minute; however, during sleep, little secretion occurs. This secretion plays an exceedingly important role for maintaining healthy oral tissues. The mouth is loaded with pathogenic bacteria that can easily destroy tissues and cause dental caries. Saliva helps prevent the deteriorative processes in several ways:

1. The flow of saliva helps wash away pathogenic bacteria, as well as food particles that provide their metabolic support.
2. Saliva contains several factors that destroy bacteria. One of these is thiocyanate ions and another is several proteolytic enzymes-most important, lysozyme-that (a) attack the bacteria, (b) aid thiocyanate ions in entering the bacteria where these ions in turn become bactericidal, and (c) digest food particles, thus helping further to remove the bacterial metabolic support.
3. Saliva often contains significant amounts of antibodies that can destroy oral bacteria, including some that cause dental caries. In the absence of salivation, oral tissues often become ulcerated and otherwise infected, and caries of the teeth can become rampant.

## NERVOUS REGULATION OF SALIVARY SECRETION

Figure 65-3 shows the parasympathetic nervous pathways for regulating salivation and demonstrates that the salivary glands are controlled mainly by parasympathetic nervous signals all the way from the superior and inferior salivatory nuclei in the brain stem.

The salivatory nuclei are located approximately at the juncture of the medulla and pons and are excited by both taste and tactile stimuli from the tongue and other areas of the mouth and pharynx. Many taste stimuli, especially the sour taste (caused by acids), elicit copious secretion of saliva-often 8 to 20 times the basal rate of secretion. Also, certain tactile stimuli, such as the presence of smooth objects in the mouth (e.g., a pebble), cause marked salivation, whereas rough objects cause less salivation and occasionally even inhibit salivation.

Salivation can also be stimulated or inhibited by nervous signals arriving in the salivatory nuclei from higher centers of the central nervous system. For example,
![gu177937568e](gu177937568e.jpg)

Figure 65-3. Parasympathetic nervous regulation of salivary secretion.
when a person smells or eats favorite foods, salivation is greater than when food that is disliked is smelled or eaten. The appetite area of the brain, which partially regulates these effects, is located in proximity to the parasympathetic centers of the anterior hypothalamus, and it functions to a great extent in response to signals from the taste and smell areas of the cerebral cortex or amygdala.

Salivation also occurs in response to reflexes originating in the stomach and upper small intestines-particularly when irritating foods are swallowed or when a person is nauseated because of some gastrointestinal abnormality. The saliva, when swallowed, helps to remove the irritating factor in the gastrointestinal tract by diluting or neutralizing the irritant substances.

Sympathetic stimulation can also increase salivation a slight amount-much less so than parasympathetic stimulation. Also, the saliva formed in response to sympathetic activity is thicker compared to saliva produced during increased parasympathetic activity. The sympathetic nerves originate from the superior cervical ganglia and travel along the surfaces of the blood vessel walls to the salivary glands.

A secondary factor that also affects salivary secretion is the blood supply to the glands because secretion always requires adequate nutrients from the blood. The parasympathetic nerve signals that induce copious salivation also moderately dilate the blood vessels. In addition, salivation directly dilates the blood vessels, thus providing increased salivatory gland nutrition as needed by the secreting cells. Part of this additional vasodilator effect is caused by kallikrein secreted by the activated salivary cells, which in turn acts as an enzyme to split one of the blood proteins, an $\alpha_{2}$-globulin, to form bradykinin, a strong vasodilator.

## Esophageal Secretion

Esophageal secretions are entirely mucous and mainly provide lubrication for swallowing. The main body of the esophagus is lined with many simple mucous glands. At the gastric end and to a lesser extent in the initial portion of the esophagus, many compound mucous glands can also be found. The mucus secreted by the compound glands in the upper esophagus prevents mucosal excoriation by newly entering food, whereas the compound glands located near the esophagogastric junction protect the esophageal wall from digestion by acidic gastric juices that often reflux from the stomach back into the lower esophagus. Despite this protection, a peptic ulcer at times can still occur at the gastric end of the esophagus.

## GASTRIC SECRETION

In addition to mucus-secreting cells that line the entire surface of the stomach, the stomach mucosa has two important types of tubular glands-oxyntic glands (also called gastric glands) and pyloric glands. The oxyntic (acid-forming) glands secrete hydrochloric acid, pepsinogen, intrinsic factor, and mucus. The pyloric glands secrete mainly mucus for protection of the pyloric mucosa from the stomach acid. They also secrete the hormone gastrin.

The oxyntic glands are located on the inside surfaces of the body and fundus of the stomach-the proximal $80 \%$ of the stomach. The pyloric glands are located in the antral portion of the stomach-the distal $20 \%$ of the stomach.

## Secretions From the Gastric (Oxyntic) Glands

A typical stomach oxyntic gland is shown in Figure 65-4. It is composed of three main types of cells: (1) mucous neck cells, which secrete mainly mucus; (2) peptic (or chief) cells, which secrete large quantities of pepsinogen; and (3) parietal (or oxyntic) cells, which secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor. Oxyntic glands also contain some additional cells types, including the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells that secrete histamine.

Secretion of hydrochloric acid by the parietal cells involves special mechanisms, as follows.

## Basic Mechanism of Hydrochloric Acid Secretion.

When stimulated, the parietal cells secrete an acid solution that contains about $160 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ of hydrochloric acid, which is nearly isotonic with the body fluids. The pH of this acid is about 0.8 , demonstrating its extreme acidity. At this pH , the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration is about 3 million times that of the arterial blood. To concentrate the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$this tremendous amount requires more than 1500 calories of energy/L of gastric juice. At the same time that $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is secreted, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$diffuses into the blood so that gastric venous blood has a higher pH than arterial blood when the stomach is secreting acid.

Figure 65-5 shows schematically the functional structure of a parietal cell (also called an oxyntic cell), demonstrating that it contains large branching intracellular

canaliculi. The hydrochloric acid is formed at the villuslike projections inside these canaliculi and is then conducted through the canaliculi to the secretory end of the cell.

Figure 65-6. Postulated mechanism for secretion of hydrochloric acid. (The points labeled "ATP" [adenosine triphosphate] indicate active pumps, and the dashed lines represent free diffusion and osmosis.)

The main driving force for hydrochloric acid secretion by the parietal cells is a hydrogen-potassium pump ( $\mathrm{H}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ adenosine triphosphatase [ATPase]). The chemical mechanism of hydrochloric acid formation is shown in Figure 65-6 and consists of the following steps:

1. Water inside the parietal cell becomes dissociated into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and hydroxide $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)$in the cell cytoplasm. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is then actively secreted into the canaliculus in exchange for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, an active exchange process that is catalyzed by $\mathrm{H}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase. Potassium ions transported into the cell by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump on the basolateral (extracellular) side of the membrane tend to leak into the lumen but are recycled back into the cell by the $\mathrm{H}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase. The basolateral $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase creates low intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, which contributes to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption from the lumen of the canaliculus. Thus, most of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in the canaliculus is reabsorbed into the cell cytoplasm, and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$takes their place in the canaliculus.
2. The pumping of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$out of the cell by the $\mathrm{H}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase permits $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to accumulate and form $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, either formed during metabolism in the cell or while entering the cell from the blood. This reaction is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. The $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is then transported across the basolateral membrane into the extracellular fluid in exchange for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions, which enter the cell and are secreted through chloride channels into the canaliculus, giving a strong solution of hydrochloric acid in the canaliculus. The hydrochloric acid is then secreted outward through the open end of the canaliculus into the lumen of the gland.
3. Water passes into the canaliculus by osmosis because of extra ions secreted into the canaliculus.

Thus, the final secretion from the canaliculus contains water, hydrochloric acid at a concentration of about 150 to $160 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, potassium chloride at a concentration of $15 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, and a small amount of sodium chloride.
To produce a concentration of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$as great as that found in gastric juice requires minimal backleak into the mucosa of the secreted acid. A major part of the stomach's ability to prevent backleak of acid can be attributed to the gastric barrier due to the formation of alkaline mucus and to tight junctions between epithelia cells, as described later. If this barrier is damaged by toxic substances, such as occurs with excessive use of aspirin or alcohol, the secreted acid does leak down an electrochemical gradient into the mucosa, causing stomach mucosal damage.

The Basic Factors That Stimulate Gastric Secretion Are Acetylcholine, Gastrin, and Histamine. Acetylcholine released by parasympathetic stimulation excites secretion of pepsinogen by peptic cells, hydrochloric acid by parietal cells, and mucus by mucous cells. In comparison, both gastrin and histamine strongly stimulate acid secretion by parietal cells but have little effect on the other cells.

Secretion and Activation of Pepsinogen. Several slightly different types of pepsinogen are secreted by the peptic and mucous cells of the gastric glands, but all the pepsinogens perform the same basic functions.

When pepsinogen is first secreted, it has no digestive activity. However, as soon as it comes in contact with hydrochloric acid, it is activated to form active pepsin. In this process, the pepsinogen molecule, having a molecular weight of about 42,500 , is split to form a pepsin molecule, having a molecular weight of about 35,000 .

Pepsin functions as an active proteolytic enzyme in a highly acidic medium (optimum $\mathrm{pH}, 1.8-3.5$ ), but above a pH of about 5 it has almost no proteolytic activity and becomes completely inactivated in a short time. Hydrochloric acid is as necessary as pepsin for protein digestion in the stomach, as discussed in Chapter 66.

Secretion of Intrinsic Factor by Parietal Cells. The substance intrinsic factor, which is essential for vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ absorption in the ileum, is secreted by the parietal cells along with the secretion of hydrochloric acid. When the acid-producing parietal cells of the stomach are destroyed, which frequently occurs in persons with chronic gastritis, not only does achlorhydria (lack of stomach acid secretion) develop, but pernicious anemia also often develops because of failure of red blood cell maturation in the absence of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ stimulation of the bone marrow. This condition is discussed in Chapter 33.

## PYLORIC GLANDS SECRETE MUCUS AND GASTRIN

The pyloric glands are structurally similar to the oxyntic glands but contain few peptic cells and almost no parietal cells. Instead, they contain mostly mucous cells that

are identical with the mucous neck cells of the oxyntic glands. These cells secrete a small amount of pepsinogen, as discussed earlier, and an especially large amount of thin mucus that helps to lubricate food movement, as well as to protect the stomach wall from digestion by the gastric enzymes. The pyloric glands also secrete the hormone gastrin, which plays a key role in controlling gastric secretion, as we discuss shortly.

## SURFACE MUCOUS CELLS

The entire surface of the stomach mucosa between glands has a continuous layer of a special type of mucous cells called simply "surface mucous cells." They secrete large quantities of viscid mucus that coats the stomach mucosa with a gel layer of mucus often more than 1 millimeter thick, thus providing a major shell of protection for the stomach wall, as well as contributing to lubrication of food transport.

Another characteristic of this mucus is that it is alkaline. Therefore, the normal underlying stomach wall is not directly exposed to the highly acidic, proteolytic stomach secretion. Even the slightest contact with food or any irritation of the mucosa directly stimulates the surface mucous cells to secrete additional quantities of this thick, alkaline, viscid mucus.

## STIMULATION OF GASTRIC ACID SECRETION

Parietal Cells of the Oxyntic Glands Are the Only Cells That Secrete Hydrochloric Acid. As noted earlier in the chapter, the acidity of the fluid secreted by the parietal cells of the oxyntic glands can be great, with pH as low as 0.8 . However, secretion of this acid is under continuous control by both endocrine and nervous signals. Furthermore, parietal cells operate in close association with another type of cell called enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL cells), the primary function of which is to secrete histamine.

The ECL cells lie in the deep recesses of the oxyntic glands and therefore release histamine in direct contact with the parietal cells of the glands. The formation and secretion rates of hydrochloric acid by the parietal cells are directly related to the amount of histamine secreted by the ECL cells. In turn, the ECL cells are stimulated to secrete histamine by the hormone gastrin, which is formed almost entirely in the antral portion of the stomach mucosa in response to proteins in the foods being digested. The ECL cells may also be stimulated by hormones secreted by the enteric nervous system of the stomach wall. We will first discuss the gastrin mechanism for control of the ECL cells and their subsequent control of parietal cell secretion of hydrochloric acid.

Stimulation of Acid Secretion by Gastrin. Gastrin is a hormone secreted by gastrin cells, also called $G$ cells. These cells are located in the pyloric glands in the distal
end of the stomach. Gastrin is a large polypeptide secreted in two forms-a large form called G-34, which contains 34 amino acids, and a smaller form, G-17, which contains 17 amino acids. Although both of these forms are important, the smaller form is more abundant.

When meats or other foods containing protein reach the antral end of the stomach, some of the proteins from these foods have a special stimulatory effect on the gastrin cells in the pyloric glands to cause release of gastrin into the blood to be transported to the ECL cells of the stomach. The vigorous mixing of the gastric juices transports the gastrin rapidly to the ECL cells in the body of the stomach, causing release of histamine directly into the deep oxyntic glands. The histamine then acts quickly to stimulate gastric hydrochloric acid secretion.

## REGULATION OF PEPSINOGEN SECRETION

Stimulation of pepsinogen secretion by the peptic cells in the oxyntic glands occurs in response to two main types of signals: (1) acetylcholine released from the vagus nerves or from the gastric enteric nervous plexus, and (2) acid in the stomach. The acid probably does not stimulate the peptic cells directly but instead elicits additional enteric nervous reflexes that support the original nervous signals to the peptic cells. Therefore, the rate of secretion of pepsinogen, the precursor of the enzyme pepsin that causes protein digestion, is strongly influenced by the amount of acid in the stomach. In people who have lost the ability to secrete normal amounts of acid, secretion of pepsinogen is also decreased, even though the peptic cells may otherwise appear to be normal.

## Phases of Gastric Secretion

Gastric secretion is said to occur in three "phases" (as shown in Figure 65-7): a cephalic phase, a gastric phase, and an intestinal phase.

Cephalic Phase. The cephalic phase of gastric secretion occurs even before food enters the stomach, especially while it is being eaten. It results from the sight, smell, thought, or taste of food, and the greater the appetite, the more intense is the stimulation. Neurogenic signals that cause the cephalic phase of gastric secretion originate in the cerebral cortex and in the appetite centers of the amygdala and hypothalamus. They are transmitted through the dorsal motor nuclei of the vagi and thence through the vagus nerves to the stomach. This phase of secretion normally accounts for about $30 \%$ of the gastric secretion associated with eating a meal.

Gastric Phase. Once food enters the stomach, it excites the following: (1) long vagovagal reflexes from the stomach to the brain and back to the stomach; (2) local enteric reflexes; and (3) the gastrin mechanism, all of which cause secretion of gastric juice during several hours while food remains in the stomach. The gastric phase of secretion accounts for about $60 \%$ of the total gastric secretion associated with eating a meal and therefore accounts for most of the total daily gastric secretion of about 1500 ml .

![gu217937568e](gu217937568e.jpg)

Intestinal Phase. The presence of food in the upper portion of the small intestine, particularly in the duodenum, will continue to cause stomach secretion of small amounts of gastric juice, probably partly because of small amounts of gastrin released by the duodenal mucosa. This secretion accounts for about $10 \%$ of the acid response to a meal.

## Inhibition of Gastric Secretion by Other Intestinal Factors

Although intestinal chyme slightly stimulates gastric secretion during the early intestinal phase of stomach secretion, it paradoxically inhibits gastric secretion at other times. This inhibition results from at least two influences.

1. The presence of food in the small intestine initiates a reverse enterogastric reflex, transmitted through the myenteric nervous system and extrinsic sympathetic and vagus nerves, that inhibits stomach secretion. This reflex can be initiated by (a) distending the small bowel, (b) the presence of acid in the upper intestine, (c) the presence of protein breakdown products, or (d) irritation of the mucosa. This reflex is part of the complex mechanism discussed in Chapter 64 for slowing stomach emptying when the intestines are already filled.
2. The presence of acid, fat, protein breakdown products, hyperosmotic or hypo-osmotic fluids, or any irritating factor in the upper small intestine causes release of several intestinal hormones. One of these hormones is secretin, which is especially important for control of pancreatic secretion. However, secretin opposes stomach secretion. Three other hormones-glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (gastric inhibitory peptide), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and somatostatin-also have slight to moderate effects in inhibiting gastric secretion.
The purpose of intestinal factors that inhibit gastric secretion is presumably to slow passage of chyme from the stomach when the small intestine is already filled or already overactive. In fact, the enterogastric inhibitory reflexes plus
inhibitory hormones usually also reduce stomach motility at the same time that they reduce gastric secretion, as discussed in Chapter 64.

Gastric Secretion During the Interdigestive Period. The stomach secretes a few milliliters of gastric juice each hour during the "interdigestive period," when little or no digestion is occurring anywhere in the gut. The secretion that does occur is usually almost entirely of the nonoxyntic type, composed mainly of mucus but little pepsin and almost no acid.

Emotional stimuli may increase interdigestive gastric secretion (which is highly peptic and acidic) to 50 ml or more per hour, in much the same way that the cephalic phase of gastric secretion excites secretion at the onset of a meal. This increase of secretion in response to emotional stimuli may contribute to the development of peptic ulcers, as discussed in Chapter 67.

## Chemical Composition of Gastrin and Other Gastrointestinal Hormones

Gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and secretin are all large polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 2000, 4200, and 3400, respectively. The terminal five amino acids in the gastrin and CCK molecular chains are the same. The functional activity of gastrin resides in the terminal four amino acids, and the activity for CCK resides in the terminal eight amino acids. All the amino acids in the secretin molecule are essential.

A synthetic gastrin, pentagastrin, is composed of the terminal four amino acids of natural gastrin plus the amino acid alanine, has all the same physiological properties as the natural gastrin.

## PANCREATIC SECRETION

The pancreas, which lies parallel to and beneath the stomach (illustrated in Figure 65-10), is a large compound

gland, and most of its internal structure is similar to that of the salivary glands shown in Figure 65-2. The pancreatic digestive enzymes are secreted by pancreatic acini, and large volumes of sodium bicarbonate solution are secreted by the small ductules and larger ducts leading from the acini. The combined product of enzymes and sodium bicarbonate then flows through a long pancreatic duct that normally joins the hepatic duct immediately before it empties into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater, surrounded by the sphincter of Oddi.

Pancreatic juice is secreted most abundantly in response to the presence of chyme in the upper portions of the small intestine, and the characteristics of pancreatic juice are determined to some extent by the types of food in the chyme. The pancreas also secretes insulin, but it is not secreted by the same pancreatic tissue that secretes intestinal pancreatic juice. Instead, insulin is secreted directly into the blood-not into the intestineby the islets of Langerhans that occur in islet patches throughout the pancreas. These structures are discussed in Chapter 79.

## PANCREATIC DIGESTIVE ENZYMES

Pancreatic secretion contains multiple enzymes for digesting all of the three major types of food-proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. It also contains large quantities of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, which play an important role in neutralizing the acidity of the chyme emptied from the stomach into the duodenum.

The most important of the pancreatic enzymes for digesting proteins are trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypolypeptidase. By far the most abundant of these is trypsin.

Trypsin and chymotrypsin split whole and partially digested proteins into peptides of various sizes but do not cause release of individual amino acids. However, carboxypolypeptidase splits some peptides into individual amino acids, thus completing digestion of some proteins all the way to the amino acid state.

The pancreatic enzyme for digesting carbohydrates is pancreatic amylase, which hydrolyzes starches, glycogen, and most other carbohydrates (except cellulose) to form mostly disaccharides and a few trisaccharides.

The main enzymes for fat digestion are the following: (1) pancreatic lipase, which is capable of hydrolyzing neutral fat into fatty acids and monoglycerides; (2) cholesterol esterase, which causes hydrolysis of cholesterol esters; and (3) phospholipase, which splits fatty acids from phospholipids.

When first synthesized in the pancreatic cells, the proteolytic digestive enzymes are in their enzymatically inactive forms-trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and procarboxypolypeptidase. They become activated only after they are secreted into the intestinal tract. Trypsinogen is activated by an enzyme called enterokinase, which is secreted by the intestinal mucosa when chyme comes in
contact with the mucosa. Trypsinogen also can be autocatalytically activated by trypsin that has already been formed from previously secreted trypsinogen. Chymotrypsinogen is activated by trypsin to form chymotrypsin, and procarboxypolypeptidase is activated in a similar manner.

## Secretion of Trypsin Inhibitor Prevents Digestion of

the Pancreas. It is important that the proteolytic enzymes of the pancreatic juice not become activated until after they have been secreted into the intestine because the trypsin and the other enzymes would digest the pancreas. Fortunately, the same cells that secrete proteolytic enzymes into the acini of the pancreas simultaneously secrete another substance called trypsin inhibitor. This substance, which is formed in the cytoplasm of the glandular cells, prevents activation of trypsin inside the secretory cells and in the acini and ducts of the pancreas. In addition, because it is trypsin that activates the other pancreatic proteolytic enzymes, trypsin inhibitor prevents activation of the other enzymes as well.

When the pancreas becomes severely damaged or when a duct becomes blocked, large quantities of pancreatic secretion sometimes become pooled in the damaged areas of the pancreas. Under these conditions, the effect of trypsin inhibitor is often overwhelmed, in which case the pancreatic secretions rapidly become activated and can literally digest the entire pancreas within a few hours, giving rise to the condition called acute pancreatitis. This condition is sometimes lethal because of accompanying circulatory shock; even if it is not lethal, it usually leads to a lifetime of pancreatic insufficiency.

## SECRETION OF BICARBONATE IONS

Although the enzymes of the pancreatic juice are secreted entirely by the acini of the pancreatic glands, the other two important components of pancreatic juice, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ and water, are secreted mainly by the epithelial cells of the ductules and ducts that lead from the acini. When the pancreas is stimulated to secrete copious quantities of pancreatic juice, the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration can rise to as high as $145 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, a value about five times that of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$in the plasma. This high concentration provides a large quantity of alkali in the pancreatic juice that serves to neutralize the hydrochloric acid emptied into the duodenum from the stomach.

The basic steps in the cellular mechanism for secreting sodium bicarbonate solution into the pancreatic ductules and ducts, shown in Figure 65-8, are as follows:

1. Carbon dioxide diffuses to the interior of the cell from the blood and, under the influence of carbonic anhydrase, combines with water to form carbonic acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)$. The carbonic acid dissociates into $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Additional $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$enters the cell through the basolateral membrane by co-transport with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. The $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is then exchanged for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$by secondary active transport through the luminal

![gu227937568e](gu227937568e.jpg)

border of the cell into the lumen of the duct. The $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$that enters the cell is recycled back into the lumen by special chloride channels.
2. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$formed by dissociation of carbonic acid inside the cell is exchanged for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$through the basolateral membrane of the cell by secondary active transport. Sodium ions also enter the cell by cotransport with $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$across the basolateral membrane. Sodium ions are then transported across the luminal border into the pancreatic duct lumen. The negative voltage of the lumen also pulls the positively charged $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$across the tight junctions between the cells.
3. The overall movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$from the blood into the duct lumen creates an osmotic pressure gradient that causes osmosis of water also into the pancreatic duct, thus forming an almost completely isosmotic bicarbonate solution.

## REGULATION OF PANCREATIC SECRETION Basic Stimuli That Cause Pancreatic Secretion

Three basic stimuli are important in causing pancreatic secretion:

1. Acetylcholine, which is released from the parasympathetic vagus nerve endings and from other cholinergic nerves in the enteric nervous system
2. Cholecystokinin (CCK), which is secreted by the duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa when food enters the small intestine
3. Secretin, which is also secreted by the duodenal and jejunal mucosa when highly acidic food enters the small intestine
The first two of these stimuli, acetylcholine and CCK, stimulate the acinar cells of the pancreas, causing production of large quantities of pancreatic digestive enzymes but relatively small quantities of water and electrolytes to go with the enzymes. Without the water, most of the enzymes remain temporarily stored in the acini and ducts until more fluid secretion comes along to wash them into the duodenum. Secretin, in contrast to the first two basic stimuli, stimulates secretion of large quantities of water solution of sodium bicarbonate by the pancreatic ductal epithelium.
Multiplicative Effects of Different Stimuli. When all the different stimuli of pancreatic secretion occur at once, the total secretion is far greater than the sum of the secretions caused by each one separately. Therefore, the various stimuli are said to "multiply," or "potentiate," one another. Thus, pancreatic secretion normally results from the combined effects of the multiple basic stimuli, not from one alone.

## Phases of Pancreatic Secretion

Pancreatic secretion, as with gastric secretion, occurs in three phases: the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal phase. Their characteristics are described in the following sections.

Cephalic and Gastric Phases. During the cephalic phase of pancreatic secretion, the same nervous signals from the brain that cause secretion in the stomach also cause acetylcholine release by the vagal nerve endings in the pancreas. This signaling causes moderate amounts of enzymes to be secreted into the pancreatic acini, accounting for about $20 \%$ of the total secretion of pancreatic enzymes after a meal. However, little of the secretion flows immediately through the pancreatic ducts into the intestine because only small amounts of water and electrolytes are secreted along with the enzymes.

During the gastric phase, the nervous stimulation of enzyme secretion continues, accounting for another $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of pancreatic enzymes secreted after a meal. However, again, only small amounts reach the duodenum because of continued lack of significant fluid secretion.

Intestinal Phase. After chyme leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine, pancreatic secretion becomes copious, mainly in response to the hormone secretin.

## Secretin Stimulates Copious Secretion of Bicarbonate

Ions, Which Neutralizes Acidic Stomach Chyme. Secretin is a polypeptide containing 27 amino acids (with a molecular weight of $\approx 3400$ ). It is present in an inactive form, prosecretin, in the $S$ cells in the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum. When acid chyme with a pH less than 4.5 to 5.0 enters the duodenum from the stomach, it causes duodenal mucosal release and activation of secre-

tin, which is then absorbed into the blood. The one truly potent constituent of chyme that causes secretin release is hydrochloric acid from the stomach.

Secretin in turn causes the pancreas to secrete large quantities of fluid containing a high concentration of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$(up to $145 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) but a low concentration of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. The secretin mechanism is especially important for two reasons. First, secretin begins to be released from the mucosa of the small intestine when the pH of the duodenal contents falls below 4.5 to 5.0 , and its release increases greatly as the pH falls to 3.0. This mechanism immediately causes copious secretion of pancreatic juice that contains abundant amounts of sodium bicarbonate. The net result is then the following reaction in the duodenum:

$$
\mathrm{HCl}+\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{NaCl}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}
$$

The carbonic acid then immediately dissociates into $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water. The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is absorbed into the blood and expired through the lungs, thus leaving a neutral solution of sodium chloride in the duodenum. In this way, the acid contents that are emptied into the duodenum from the stomach become neutralized, and thus further peptic digestive activity by the gastric juices in the duodenum is immediately blocked. Because the mucosa of the small intestine cannot withstand the digestive action of acid gastric juice, this protective mechanism is essential to prevent the development of duodenal ulcers, as discussed in Chapter 67.

Bicarbonate ion secretion by the pancreas provides an appropriate pH for action of the pancreatic digestive enzymes, which function optimally in a slightly alkaline or neutral medium, at a pH of 7.0 to 8.0. Fortunately, the pH of the sodium bicarbonate secretion averages 8.0.

Cholecystokinin Contributes to Control of Digestive Enzyme Secretion by the Pancreas. The presence of food in the upper small intestine also causes a second hormone, CCK, a polypeptide containing 33 amino acids, to be released from yet another group of cells, the $I$ cells, in the mucosa of the duodenum and upper jejunum. This release of CCK results especially from the presence of proteoses and peptones (products of partial protein digestion) and long-chain fatty acids in the chyme coming from the stomach.

CCK, like secretin, passes via the blood to the pancreas, but instead of causing sodium bicarbonate secretion, it mainly causes secretion of much more pancreatic digestive enzymes by the acinar cells. This effect is similar to that caused by vagal stimulation but is even more pronounced, accounting for $70 \%$ to $80 \%$ of the total secretion of the pancreatic digestive enzymes after a meal.

The differences between the pancreatic stimulatory effects of secretin and CCK are shown in Figure 65-9, which demonstrates the following: (1) intense sodium bicarbonate secretion in response to acid in the duodenum, stimulated by secretin; (2) a dual effect in response

to soap (a fat); and (3) intense digestive enzyme secretion (when peptones enter the duodenum) stimulated by CCK.

Figure 65-10 summarizes the more important factors that regulate pancreatic secretion. The total amount secreted each day is about 1 liter.

## BILE SECRETION BY THE LIVER

One of the many functions of the liver is to secrete bile, normally between 600 and $1000 \mathrm{ml} /$ day. Bile serves two important functions.

First, bile plays an important role in fat digestion and absorption, not because of any enzymes in the bile that cause fat digestion, but because bile acids perform two

Figure 65-11. Liver secretion and gallbladder emptying.
![gu257937568e](gu257937568e.jpg)
functions: (1) they help emulsify large fat particles of the food into many minute particles, the surface of which can then be attacked by lipase enzymes secreted in pancreatic juice, and (2) they aid in absorption of digested fat end products through the intestinal mucosal membrane.

Second, bile serves as a means for excretion of several important waste products from the blood. These waste products include in particular bilirubin, an end product of hemoglobin destruction, and excesses of cholesterol.

## PHYSIOLOGIC ANATOMY OF BILIARY SECRETION

Bile is secreted in two stages by the liver:

1. The initial portion is secreted by the principal functional cells of the liver, the hepatocytes. This initial secretion contains large amounts of bile acids, cholesterol, and other organic constituents. It is secreted into minute bile canaliculi that originate between the hepatic cells (see Figure 71-1).
2. Next, the bile flows in the canaliculi toward the interlobular septa, where the canaliculi empty into terminal bile ducts and then into progressively larger ducts, finally reaching the hepatic duct and common bile duct. From these ducts the bile either empties directly into the duodenum or is diverted for minutes up to several hours through the cystic duct into the gallbladder, shown in Figure 65-11.
In its course through the bile ducts, a second portion of liver secretion is added to the initial bile. This additional secretion is a watery solution of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secreted
by epithelial cells that line the ductules and ducts. This second secretion sometimes increases the total quantity of bile by as much as $100 \%$. The second secretion is stimulated especially by secretin, which causes release of additional quantities of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to supplement the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in pancreatic secretion (for neutralizing acid that empties into the duodenum from the stomach).

The Gallbladder Stores and Concentrates Bile. Bile is secreted continually by the liver cells, but most of it is normally stored in the gallbladder until it is needed in the duodenum. The maximum volume that the gallbladder can hold is only 30 to 60 ml . Nevertheless, as much as 12 hours of bile secretion (usually $\approx 450 \mathrm{ml}$ ) can be stored in the gallbladder because water, sodium, chloride, and most other small electrolytes are continually absorbed through the gallbladder mucosa, concentrating the remaining bile constituents that contain the bile salts, cholesterol, lecithin, and bilirubin.

Most of this gallbladder absorption is caused by active transport of sodium through the gallbladder epithelium, and this transport is followed by secondary absorption of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, water, and most other diffusible constituents. Bile is normally concentrated in this way about 5 -fold, but it can be concentrated up to a maximum of 20 -fold.

Composition of Bile. Table 65-2 lists the composition of bile when it is first secreted by the liver and then after it has been concentrated in the gallbladder. By far the most abundant substances secreted in the bile are bile salts, which account for about one-half of the total solutes also in the bile.

Table 65-2 Composition of Bile

| Substance | Liver Bile | Gallbladder Bile |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Water | $97.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ | $92 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ |
| Bile salts | $1.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ | $6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ |
| Bilirubin | $0.04 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ | $0.3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ |
| Cholesterol | $0.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ | $0.3-0.9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ |
| Fatty acids | $0.12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ | $0.3-1.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ |

| $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ | $145 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ | $130 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ |
| $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ | $5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ | $12 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ |

| $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ | $28 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ | $10 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ |

Also secreted or excreted in large concentrations are bilirubin, cholesterol, lecithin, and the usual electrolytes of plasma.

In the concentrating process in the gallbladder, water and large portions of the electrolytes (except calcium ions) are reabsorbed by the gallbladder mucosa. Essentially all other constituents, especially the bile salts and the lipid substances cholesterol and lecithin, are not reabsorbed and, therefore, become highly concentrated in the gallbladder bile.

Cholecystokinin Stimulates Gallbladder Emptying. When food begins to be digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract, the gallbladder begins to empty, especially when fatty foods reach the duodenum about 30 minutes after a meal. The mechanism of gallbladder emptying is rhythmic contractions of the gallbladder wall, but effective emptying also requires simultaneous relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi, which guards the exit of the common bile duct into the duodenum.

By far the most potent stimulus for causing the gallbladder contractions is the hormone CCK. As discussed previously, CCK also causes increased secretion of digestive enzymes by the acinar cells of the pancreas. The stimulus for CCK entry into the blood from the duodenal mucosa is mainly the presence of fatty foods in the duodenum.

The gallbladder is also stimulated less strongly by acetylcholine-secreting nerve fibers from both the vagi and the intestinal enteric nervous system. They are the same nerves that promote motility and secretion in other parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract.

In summary, the gallbladder empties its store of concentrated bile into the duodenum mainly in response to the CCK stimulus that is initiated mainly by fatty foods. When fat is not in the food, the gallbladder empties poorly, but when significant quantities of fat are present, the gallbladder normally empties completely in about 1 hour. Figure 65-11 summarizes the secretion of bile, its storage in the gallbladder, and its ultimate release from the gallbladder to the duodenum.

## FUNCTION OF BILE SALTS IN FAT DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION

The liver cells synthesize about $6 \mathrm{~g} /$ day of bile salts. The precursor of the bile salts is cholesterol, which is either present in the diet or synthesized in the liver cells during the course of fat metabolism. The cholesterol is first converted to cholic acid or chenodeoxycholic acid in about equal quantities. These acids in turn combine principally with glycine and to a lesser extent with taurine to form glyco-conjugated and tauro-conjugated bile acids. The salts of these acids, mainly sodium salts, are then secreted in the bile.

The bile salts have two important actions in the intestinal tract.

First, they have a detergent action on the fat particles in the food. This action, which decreases surface tension of the particles and allows agitation in the intestinal tract to break the fat globules into minute sizes, is called the emulsifying or detergent function of bile salts.

Second, and even more important than the emulsifying function, bile salts help in the absorption of (1) fatty acids, (2) monoglycerides, (3) cholesterol, and (4) other lipids from the intestinal tract. They help in this absorption by forming small physical complexes with these lipids; the complexes are called micelles, and they are semisoluble in the chyme because of the electrical charges of the bile salts. The intestinal lipids are "ferried" in this form to the intestinal mucosa, where they are then absorbed into the blood, as will be described in detail in Chapter 66. Without the presence of bile salts in the intestinal tract, up to $40 \%$ of the ingested fats are lost into the feces, and a metabolic deficit often develops because of this nutrient loss.

Enterohepatic Circulation of Bile Salts. About 94\% of the bile salts are reabsorbed into the blood from the small intestine, about one half of this by diffusion through the mucosa in the early portions of the small intestine and the remainder by an active transport process through the intestinal mucosa in the distal ileum. They then enter the portal blood and pass back to the liver. On reaching the liver and during first passage through the venous sinusoids, these salts are absorbed almost entirely back into the hepatic cells and are then resecreted into the bile.

In this way, about $94 \%$ of all the bile salts are recirculated into the bile, so on average these salts make the entire circuit some 17 times before being carried out in the feces. The small quantities of bile salts lost into the feces are replaced by new amounts formed continually by the liver cells. This recirculation of the bile salts is called the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts.

The quantity of bile secreted by the liver each day is highly dependent on the availability of bile salts-the greater the quantity of bile salts in the enterohepatic circulation (usually a total of only $\approx 2.5$ grams), the greater the rate of bile secretion. Indeed, ingestion of supplemental bile salts can increase bile secretion by several hundred milliliters per day.

If a bile fistula empties the bile salts to the exterior for several days to several weeks so they cannot be reabsorbed from the ileum, the liver increases its production of bile salts 6- to

10-fold, which increases the rate of bile secretion most of the way back to normal. This demonstrates that the daily rate of liver bile salt secretion is actively controlled by the availability (or lack of availability) of bile salts in the enterohepatic circulation.

Role of Secretin in Controlling Bile Secretion. In addition to the strong stimulating effect of bile acids to cause bile secretion, the hormone secretin-which also stimulates pancreatic secretion-increases bile secretion, sometimes more than doubling its secretion for several hours after a meal. This increase in secretion consists almost entirely of secretion of a sodium bicarbonate-rich watery solution by the epithelial cells of the bile ductules and ducts and does not represent increased secretion by the liver parenchymal cells. The bicarbonate in turn passes into the small intestine and joins the bicarbonate from the pancreas in neutralizing the hydrochloric acid from the stomach. Thus, the secretin feedback mechanism for neutralizing duodenal acid operates not only through its effects on pancreatic secretion but also to a lesser extent through its effect on secretion by the liver ductules and ducts.

## Liver Secretion of Cholesterol and Gallstone Formation

Bile salts are formed in the hepatic cells from cholesterol in the blood plasma. In the process of secreting bile salts, about 1 to 2 grams of cholesterol are removed from the blood plasma and secreted into the bile each day.

Cholesterol is almost completely insoluble in pure water, but the bile salts and lecithin in bile combine physically with the cholesterol to form ultramicroscopic micelles in the form of a colloidal solution, as explained in Chapter 66. When the bile becomes concentrated in the gallbladder, the bile salts and lecithin become concentrated along with the cholesterol, which keeps the cholesterol in solution.

Under abnormal conditions, the cholesterol may precipitate in the gallbladder, resulting in the formation of cholesterol gallstones, as shown in Figure 65-12. The amount of cholesterol in the bile is determined partly by the quantity of fat that the person eats, because liver cells synthesize cholesterol as one of the products of fat metabolism in the body. For this reason, people who are obese and consume a high-fat diet over a period of years are prone to development of gallstones. Other risk factors for gallstones include increasing age and female sex, diabetes mellitus, and genetic susceptibility.

Inflammation of the gallbladder epithelium, often resulting from a low-grade chronic infection, may also change the absorptive characteristics of the gallbladder mucosa, sometimes allowing excessive absorption of water and bile salts but leaving behind the cholesterol in the gallbladder in progressively greater concentrations. The cholesterol then begins to precipitate, first forming many small crystals of cholesterol on the surface of the inflamed mucosa, but then progressing to large gallstones.

## SECRETIONS OF THE SMALL INTESTINE

## SECRETION OF MUCUS BY BRUNNER'S GLANDS IN THE DUODENUM

An extensive array of compound mucous glands, called Brunner's glands, is located in the wall of the first few centimeters of the duodenum, mainly between the pylorus of the
![gu267937568e](gu267937568e.jpg)

Figure 65-12. Formation of gallstones.
stomach and the papilla of Vater, where pancreatic secretion and bile empty into the duodenum. These glands secrete large amounts of alkaline mucus in response to the following: (1) tactile or irritating stimuli on the duodenal mucosa; (2) vagal stimulation, which causes increased Brunner gland secretion concurrently with increase in stomach secretion; and (3) gastrointestinal hormones, especially secretin.

The function of the mucus secreted by Brunner's glands is to protect the duodenal wall from digestion by the highly acidic gastric juice emptying from the stomach. In addition, the mucus contains a large excess of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, which add to the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$from pancreatic secretion and liver bile in neutralizing the hydrochloric acid entering the duodenum from the stomach.

Brunner's glands are inhibited by sympathetic stimulation; therefore, such stimulation in very excitable persons is likely to leave the duodenal bulb unprotected and is perhaps one of the factors that cause this area of the gastrointestinal tract to be the site of peptic ulcers in about $50 \%$ of persons with ulcers.

## SECRETION OF INTESTINAL DIGESTIVE JUICES BY THE CRYPTS OF LIEBERKÜHN

Located over the entire surface of the small intestine are small pits called crypts of Lieberkühn, one of which is illustrated in Figure 65-13. These crypts lie between the intestinal villi. The surfaces of both the crypts and the villi are covered by an epithelium composed of two types of cells: (1) a moderate number of goblet cells, which secrete mucus that lubricates and protects the intestinal surfaces; and (2) a large number of enterocytes, which, in the crypts, secrete large quantities of water and electrolytes and, over the surfaces of adjacent villi, reabsorb the water and electrolytes along with the end products of digestion.

![gu277937568e](gu277937568e.jpg)

Figure 65-13. A crypt of Lieberkühn, found in all parts of the small intestine between the villi, which secretes almost pure extracellular fluid.

The intestinal secretions are formed by the enterocytes of the crypts at a rate of about $1800 \mathrm{ml} /$ day. These secretions are almost pure extracellular fluid and have a slightly alkaline pH in the range of 7.5 to 8.0 . The secretions are also rapidly reabsorbed by the villi. This flow of fluid from the crypts into the villi supplies a watery vehicle for absorption of substances from chyme when it comes in contact with the villi. Thus, the primary function of the small intestine is to absorb nutrients and their digestive products into the blood.

Mechanism of Secretion of the Watery Fluid. The exact mechanism that controls the marked secretion of watery fluid by the crypts of Lieberkühn is still unclear, but it is believed to involve at least two active secretory processes: (1) active secretion of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$into the crypts and (2) active secretion of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$. The secretion of both ions causes electrical drag of positively charged $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions through the membrane and into the secreted fluid as well. Finally, all these ions together cause osmotic movement of water.

## Digestive Enzymes in the Small Intestinal Secretion.

When secretions of the small intestine are collected without cellular debris, they have almost no enzymes. The enterocytes of the mucosa, especially those that cover the villi, contain digestive enzymes that digest specific food substances while they are being absorbed through the epithelium. These enzymes are as follows: (1) several peptidases for splitting small peptides into amino acids; (2) four enzymes-sucrase, maltase, isomaltase, and lactase-for splitting disaccharides into monosaccharides; and (3) small amounts of intestinal lipase for splitting neutral fats into glycerol and fatty acids.

The epithelial cells deep in the crypts of Lieberkühn continually undergo mitosis, and new cells migrate along the basement membrane upward out of the crypts toward the tips of the villi, thus continually replacing the villus epithelium and also forming new digestive enzymes. As the villus cells age, they are finally shed into the intestinal secretions. The life cycle of an intestinal
epithelial cell is about 5 days. This rapid growth of new cells also allows rapid repair of excoriations that occur in the mucosa.

## REGULATION OF SMALL INTESTINE SECRETION—LOCAL STIMULI

By far the most important means for regulating small intestine secretion are local enteric nervous reflexes, especially reflexes initiated by tactile or irritative stimuli from the chyme in the intestines.

## SECRETION OF MUCUS BY THE LARGE INTESTINE

Mucus Secretion. The mucosa of the large intestine, like that of the small intestine, has many crypts of Lieberkühn; however, unlike the small intestine, it contains no villi. The epithelial cells secrete almost no digestive enzymes. Instead, they contain mucous cells that secrete only $m u$ cus. This mucus contains moderate amounts of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ secreted by a few non-mucus-secreting epithelial cells. The rate of mucus secretion is regulated principally by direct, tactile stimulation of the epithelial cells lining the large intestine and by local nervous reflexes to the mucous cells in the crypts of Lieberkühn.

Stimulation of the pelvic nerves from the spinal cord, which carry parasympathetic innervation to the distal one-half to two-thirds of the large intestine, also can cause marked increases in mucus secretion along with increased peristaltic motility of the colon, as discussed in Chapter 64.

During extreme parasympathetic stimulation, often caused by emotional disturbances, so much mucus can occasionally be secreted into the large intestine that the person has a bowel movement of ropy mucus as often as every 30 minutes. This mucus often contains little or no fecal material.

Mucus in the large intestine protects the intestinal wall against excoriation, but in addition, it provides an adherent medium for holding fecal matter together. Furthermore, it protects the intestinal wall from the great amount of bacterial activity that takes place inside the feces, and, finally, the mucus plus the alkalinity of the secretion (a pH of 8.0 caused by large amounts of sodium bicarbonate) provides a barrier to keep acids formed in the feces from attacking the intestinal wall.

## Diarrhea Caused by Excess Secretion of Water and Electrolytes in Response to Irritation. Whenever a segment of the large intestine becomes intensely irritated, as occurs when bacterial infection becomes rampant during enteritis, the mucosa secretes extra large quantities of water and electrolytes in addition to the normal viscid alkaline mucus. This secretion acts to dilute the irritating factors and to cause rapid movement of the feces toward the anus. The result is diarrhea, with loss of large quantities of water and electrolytes. However, the diarrhea also washes away irritant factors, which promotes earlier recovery from the disease than might otherwise occur.

# Digestion and Absorption in the Gastrointestinal Tract 

The major foods on which the body lives (with the exception of small quantities of substances such as vitamins and minerals) are carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. They generally cannot be absorbed in their natural forms through the gastrointestinal mucosa, and for this reason, they are useless as nutrients without preliminary digestion. This chapter discusses the processes by which carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are digested into small enough compounds for absorption and the mechanisms by which the digestive end products, as well as water, electrolytes, and other substances, are absorbed.

## DIGESTION OF VARIOUS FOODS BY HYDROLYSIS

Hydrolysis of Carbohydrates. Almost all the carbohydrates of the diet are either large polysaccharides or disaccharides, which are combinations of monosaccharides bound to one another by condensation. This phenomenon means that a hydrogen ion $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$has been removed from one of the monosaccharides, and a hydroxyl ion $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)$has been removed from the next one. The two monosaccharides then combine with each other at these sites of removal, and the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$then combine to form water $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$.

When carbohydrates are digested, this process is reversed, and the carbohydrates are converted into monosaccharides. Specific enzymes in the digestive juices of the gastrointestinal tract return the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$from $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to the polysaccharides and thereby separate the monosaccharides from each other. This process, called hydrolysis, is the following (in which $\mathrm{R}^{\prime \prime}-\mathrm{R}^{\prime}$ is a disaccharide):

$$
\mathrm{R}^{\prime \prime}-\mathrm{R}^{\prime}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \xrightarrow[\text { enzyme }]{\text { Digestive }} \mathrm{R}^{\prime \prime} \mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{R}^{\prime} \mathrm{H}
$$

Hydrolysis of Fats. Almost the entire fat portion of the diet consists of triglycerides (neutral fats), which are combinations of three fatty acid molecules condensed with a single glycerol molecule. During condensation, three molecules of water are removed.

Hydrolysis (digestion) of the triglycerides consists of the reverse process: the fat-digesting enzymes return three molecules of water to the triglyceride molecule
and thereby split the fatty acid molecules away from the glycerol.

Hydrolysis of Proteins. Proteins are formed from multiple amino acids that are bound together by peptide linkages. At each linkage, a $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$has been removed from one amino acid and a $\mathrm{H}^{+}$has been removed from the succeeding one; thus, the successive amino acids in the protein chain are also bound together by condensation, and digestion occurs by the reverse effect: hydrolysis. That is, the proteolytic enzymes return $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$from water molecules to the protein molecules to split them into their constituent amino acids.

Therefore, the chemistry of digestion is simple because, in the case of all three major types of food, the same basic process of hydrolysis is involved. The only difference lies in the types of enzymes required to promote the hydrolysis reactions for each type of food.

All the digestive enzymes are proteins. Their secretion by the different gastrointestinal glands was discussed in Chapter 65.

## DIGESTION OF CARBOHYDRATES

Carbohydrate Foods of the Diet. Only three major sources of carbohydrates exist in the normal human diet. They are sucrose, which is the disaccharide known popularly as cane sugar; lactose, which is a disaccharide found in milk; and starches, which are large polysaccharides present in almost all nonanimal foods, particularly in potatoes and different types of grains. Other carbohydrates ingested to a slight extent are amylose, glycogen, alcohol, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, pectins, dextrins, and minor quantities of carbohydrate derivatives in meats.

The diet also contains a large amount of cellulose, which is a carbohydrate. However, enzymes capable of hydrolyzing cellulose are not secreted in the human digestive tract. Consequently, cellulose cannot be considered a food for humans.

Digestion of Carbohydrates Begins in the Mouth and Stomach. When food is chewed, it is mixed with

![gu287937568e](gu287937568e.jpg)
saliva, which contains the digestive enzyme ptyalin (an $\alpha$-amylase) secreted mainly by the parotid glands. This enzyme hydrolyzes starch into the disaccharide maltose and other small polymers of glucose that contain three to nine glucose molecules, as shown in Figure 66-1. However, the food remains in the mouth only a short time, so probably not more than $5 \%$ of all the starches become hydrolyzed by the time the food is swallowed.

Starch digestion sometimes continues in the body and fundus of the stomach for as long as 1 hour before the food becomes mixed with the stomach secretions. Activity of the salivary amylase is then blocked by acid of the gastric secretions because the amylase is essentially inactive as an enzyme once the pH of the medium falls below about 4.0. Nevertheless, on average, before food and its accompanying saliva become completely mixed with the gastric secretions, as much as $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ of the starches will have been hydrolyzed, mainly to form maltose.

## DIGESTION OF CARBOHYDRATES IN THE SMALL INTESTINE

Digestion by Pancreatic Amylase. Pancreatic secretion, like saliva, contains a large quantity of $\alpha$-amylase that is almost identical in its function to the $\alpha$-amylase of saliva but is several times as powerful. Therefore, within 15 to 30 minutes after the chyme empties from the stomach into the duodenum and mixes with pancreatic juice, virtually all the carbohydrates will have become digested.

In general, the carbohydrates are almost totally converted into maltose and/or other small glucose polymers before passing beyond the duodenum or upper jejunum.

Hydrolysis of Disaccharides and Small Glucose Polymers Into Monosaccharides by Intestinal Epithelial Enzymes. The enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine contain four enzymes (lactase, sucrase, maltase, and $\alpha$-dextrinase), which are capable of splitting the disaccharides lactose, sucrose, and maltose, plus other small glucose polymers, into their constituent monosaccharides. These enzymes are located in the enterocytes covering the intestinal microvilli brush border, so the disaccharides are digested as they come in contact with these enterocytes.

Lactose splits into a molecule of galactose and a molecule of glucose. Sucrose splits into a molecule of fructose and a molecule of glucose. Maltose and other small
glucose polymers all split into multiple molecules of glucose. Thus, the final products of carbohydrate digestion are all monosaccharides. They are all water soluble and are absorbed immediately into the portal blood.

In the ordinary diet, which contains far more starches than all other carbohydrates combined, glucose represents more than $80 \%$ of the final products of carbohydrate digestion, and galactose and fructose each seldom represent more than $10 \%$.

The major steps in carbohydrate digestion are summarized in Figure 66-1.

## DIGESTION OF PROTEINS

Proteins of the Diet. Dietary proteins are chemically long chains of amino acids bound together by peptide linkages. A typical linkage is the following:
![gu297937568e](gu297937568e.jpg)

The characteristics of each protein are determined by the types of amino acids in the protein molecule and by the sequential arrangements of these amino acids. The physical and chemical characteristics of different proteins important in human tissues are discussed in Chapter 70.

Digestion of Proteins in the Stomach. Pepsin, an important peptic enzyme of the stomach, is most active at a pH of 2.0 to 3.0 and is inactive at a pH above about 5.0. Consequently, for this enzyme to cause digestion of protein, the stomach juices must be acidic. As explained in Chapter 65, the gastric glands secrete a large quantity of hydrochloric acid. This hydrochloric acid is secreted by the parietal (oxyntic) cells in the glands at a pH of about 0.8 , but by the time it is mixed with the stomach contents and with secretions from the non-oxyntic glandular cells of the stomach, the pH then averages around

![gu307937568e](gu307937568e.jpg)

Figure 66-2. Digestion of proteins.
2.0 to 3.0, a highly favorable range of acidity for pepsin activity.

One of the important features of pepsin digestion is its ability to digest the protein collagen, an albuminoid type of protein that is affected little by other digestive enzymes. Collagen is a major constituent of the intercellular connective tissue of meats; therefore, for the digestive enzymes to penetrate meats and digest the other meat proteins, it is necessary that the collagen fibers be digested. Consequently, in people who lack pepsin in the stomach juices, the ingested meats are less well penetrated by the other digestive enzymes and, therefore, may be poorly digested.

As shown in Figure 66-2, pepsin only initiates the process of protein digestion, usually providing only $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of the total protein digestion to convert the protein to proteoses, peptones, and a few polypeptides. This splitting of proteins occurs as a result of hydrolysis at the peptide linkages between amino acids.

Most Protein Digestion Results From Actions of Pancreatic Proteolytic Enzymes. Most protein digestion occurs in the upper small intestine, in the duodenum and jejunum, under the influence of proteolytic enzymes from pancreatic secretion. Immediately upon entering the small intestine from the stomach, the partial breakdown products of the protein foods are attacked by the major proteolytic pancreatic enzymes trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypolypeptidase, and elastase, as shown in Figure 66-2.

Both trypsin and chymotrypsin split proteins into small polypeptides; carboxypolypeptidase then cleaves individual amino acids from the carboxyl ends of the polypeptides. Proelastase, in turn, is converted into elastase, which then digests elastin fibers that partially hold meats together.

Only small percentages of the proteins are digested all the way to their constituent amino acids by the pancreatic juices. Most remain as dipeptides and tripeptides.

Digestion of Peptides by Peptidases in the Enterocytes That Line the Small Intestinal Villi. The last digestive stage of proteins in the intestinal lumen is achieved by enterocytes that line the villi of the small intestine, mainly in the duodenum and jejunum. These cells have a brush border that consists of hundreds of microvilli projecting
![gu317937568e](gu317937568e.jpg)

Figure 66-3. Hydrolysis of neutral fat catalyzed by lipase.
from the surface of each cell. In the membrane of each of these microvilli are multiple peptidases that protrude through the membranes to the exterior, where they come in contact with the intestinal fluids.

Two types of peptidase enzymes are especially important, aminopolypeptidase and several dipeptidases. They split the remaining larger polypeptides into tripeptides and dipeptides and a few into amino acids. The amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides are easily transported through the microvillar membrane to the interior of the enterocyte.

Finally, inside the cytosol of the enterocyte are multiple other peptidases that are specific for the remaining types of linkages between amino acids. Within minutes, virtually all the last dipeptides and tripeptides are digested to the final stage to form single amino acids, which then pass on through to the other side of the enterocyte and thence into the blood.

More than $99 \%$ of the final protein digestive products that are absorbed are individual amino acids, with only rare absorption of peptides and very rare absorption of whole protein molecules. Even these few absorbed molecules of whole protein can sometimes cause serious allergic or immunologic disturbances, as discussed in Chapter 35.

## DIGESTION OF FATS

Fats of the Diet. By far the most abundant fats of the diet are the neutral fats, also known as triglycerides, each molecule of which is composed of a glycerol nucleus and three fatty acid side chains, as shown in Figure 66-3. Neutral fat is a major constituent in food of animal origin but much less so in food of plant origin.

Small quantities of phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters are also present in the usual diet. The phospholipids and cholesterol esters contain fatty acid and therefore can be considered fats. Cholesterol is a sterol compound that contains no fatty acid, but it does exhibit some of the physical and chemical characteristics of fats. In addition, it is derived from fats and is metabolized similarly to fats. Therefore, cholesterol is considered, from a dietary point of view, to be a fat.

Digestion of Fats Occurs Mainly in the Small Intestine. A small amount of triglycerides is digested in the stomach by lingual lipase secreted by lingual glands in the mouth and swallowed with the saliva. This amount of digestion is less than $10 \%$ and is generally unimportant. Instead, essentially all fat digestion occurs in the small intestine, as follows.

The First Step in Fat Digestion Is Emulsification by Bile Acids and Lecithin. The first step in fat digestion is to physically break the fat globules into small sizes so that the water-soluble digestive enzymes can act on the globule surfaces. This process is called emulsification of the fat, and it begins by agitation in the stomach to mix the fat with the products of stomach digestion.

Most of the emulsification then occurs in the duodenum under the influence of bile, the liver secretion that does not contain any digestive enzymes. However, bile does contain a large quantity of bile salts, as well as the phospholipid lecithin. Both of these substances, but especially the lecithin, are extremely important for emulsification of the fat. The polar parts (i.e., the points where ionization occurs in water) of the bile salts and lecithin molecules are highly soluble in water, whereas most of the remaining portions of their molecules are highly soluble in fat. Therefore, the fat-soluble portions of these liver secretions dissolve in the surface layer of the fat globules, with the polar portions projecting. The polar projections, in turn, are soluble in the surrounding watery fluids, which greatly decreases the interfacial tension of the fat and makes it soluble as well.

When the interfacial tension of a globule of nonmiscible fluid is low, this non-miscible fluid, upon agitation, can be broken up into many tiny particles far more easily than it can when the interfacial tension is great. Consequently, a major function of the bile salts and lecithin in the bile is to make the fat globules readily fragmentable by agitation with the water in the small bowel. This action is the same as that of many detergents that are widely used in household cleaners for removing grease.

Each time the diameters of the fat globules are significantly decreased as a result of agitation in the small intestine, the total surface area of the fat increases manyfold. Because the average diameter of the fat particles in the intestine after emulsification has occurred is less than 1 micrometer, this represents an increase of as much as 1000 -fold in total surface areas of the fats caused by the emulsification process.

The lipase enzymes are water-soluble and can attack the fat globules only on their surfaces. Consequently, this detergent function of bile salts and lecithin is very important for digestion of fats.

Triglycerides Are Digested by Pancreatic Lipase. By far the most important enzyme for digestion of the triglycerides is pancreatic lipase, present in enormous quantities in pancreatic juice, enough to digest within 1 minute
![gu327937568e](gu327937568e.jpg)

Figure 66-4. Digestion of fats.
all triglycerides that it can reach. The enterocytes of the small intestine contain additional lipase, known as enteric lipase, but it is usually not needed.

## End Products of Fat Digestion Are Free Fatty Acids.

Most of the triglycerides of the diet are split by pancreatic lipase into free fatty acids and 2-monoglycerides, as shown in Figure 66-4.

## Bile Salts Form Micelles That Accelerate Fat Diges-

tion. The hydrolysis of triglycerides is a highly reversible process; therefore, accumulation of monoglycerides and free fatty acids in the vicinity of digesting fats quickly blocks further digestion. However, the bile salts play the additional important role of removing the monoglycerides and free fatty acids from the vicinity of the digesting fat globules almost as rapidly as these end products of digestion are formed. This process occurs in the following way.

When bile salts are of a high enough concentration in water, they have the propensity to form micelles, which are small spherical, cylindrical globules 3 to 6 nanometers in diameter composed of 20 to 40 molecules of bile salt. These micelles develop because each bile salt molecule is composed of a sterol nucleus that is highly fat-soluble and a polar group that is highly water-soluble. The sterol nucleus encompasses the fat digestate, forming a small fat globule in the middle of a resulting micelle, with polar groups of bile salts projecting outward to cover the surface of the micelle. Because these polar groups are negatively charged, they allow the entire micelle globule to dissolve in the water of the digestive fluids and to remain in stable solution until the fat is absorbed into the blood.

The bile salt micelles also act as a transport medium to carry the monoglycerides and free fatty acids, both of which would otherwise be relatively insoluble, to the brush borders of the intestinal epithelial cells. There the monoglycerides and free fatty acids are absorbed into the blood, as discussed later, but the bile salts are released back into the chyme to be used again and again for this "ferrying" process.

Digestion of Cholesterol Esters and Phospholipids. Most cholesterol in the diet is in the form of cholesterol esters, which are combinations of free cholesterol and one molecule of fatty acid. Phospholipids also contain fatty acid within their molecules. Both the cholesterol esters and the phospholipids are hydrolyzed by two other lipases in the pancreatic secretion that free the fatty acids-the enzyme cholesterol ester hydrolase to hydrolyze the cholesterol ester, and phospholipase $A_{2}$ to hydrolyze the phospholipid.

The bile salt micelles play the same role in "ferrying" free cholesterol and phospholipid molecule digestates that they play in ferrying monoglycerides and free fatty acids. Indeed, essentially no cholesterol is absorbed without this function of the micelles.

## BASIC PRINCIPLES OF GASTROINTESTINAL ABSORPTION

We suggest that the reader review the basic principles of cell membrane transport of substances discussed in Chapter 4. The following paragraphs present specialized applications of these transport processes during gastrointestinal absorption.

Figure 66-5. Longitudinal section of the small intestine, showing the valvulae connivertes (Kerckring folds) covered by villi.

## ANATOMICAL BASIS OF ABSORPTION

The total quantity of fluid that must be absorbed each day by the intestines is equal to the ingested fluid ( $\approx 1.5$ liters) plus that secreted in the various gastrointestinal secretions ( $\approx 7$ liters), which comes to a total of 8 to 9 liters. All but about 1.5 liters of this fluid is absorbed in the small intestine, leaving only 1.5 liters to pass through the ileocecal valve into the colon each day.

The stomach is a poor absorptive area of the gastrointestinal tract because it lacks the typical villus type of absorptive membrane, and also because the junctions between the epithelial cells are tight junctions. Only a few highly lipid-soluble substances, such as alcohol and some drugs (e.g., aspirin) can be absorbed in small quantities.

Folds of Kerckring, Villi, and Microvilli Increase the Mucosal Absorptive Area by Nearly 1000-Fold. Figure 66-5 demonstrates the absorptive surface of the small intestinal mucosa, showing many folds called valvulae conniventes (or folds of Kerckring), which increase the surface area of the absorptive mucosa about threefold. These folds extend circularly most of the way around the intestine and are especially well developed in the duodenum and jejunum, where they often protrude up to 8 millimeters into the lumen.

Also located on the epithelial surface of the small intestine all the way down to the ileocecal valve are millions of small villi. These villi project about 1 millimeter from the surface of the mucosa, as shown on the surfaces of the valvulae conniventes in Figure 66-5 and in individual detail in Figure 66-6. The villi lie so close to one another in the upper small intestine that they touch in most areas, but their distribution is less profuse in the distal small

intestine. The presence of villi on the mucosal surface enhances the total absorptive area another 10 -fold.

Finally, each intestinal epithelial cell on each villus is characterized by a brush border, consisting of as many as 1000 microvilli that are 1 micrometer in length and 0.1 micrometer in diameter and protrude into the intestinal chyme. These microvilli are shown in the electron micrograph in Figure 66-7. This brush border increases the surface area exposed to the intestinal materials at least another 20 -fold.

Thus, the combination of the folds of Kerckring, the villi, and the microvilli increases the total absorptive area of the mucosa perhaps 1000 -fold, making a tremendous total area of 250 or more square meters for the entire small intestine-about the surface area of a tennis court.

Figure 66-6A shows in longitudinal section the general organization of the villus, emphasizing (1) the advantageous arrangement of the vascular system for absorption of fluid and dissolved material into the portal blood and (2) the arrangement of the "central lacteal" lymph vessel for absorption into the lymph. Figure 66-68 shows a cross section of the villus, and Figure 66-7 shows many small pinocytic vesicles, which are pinched-off portions of infolded enterocyte membrane forming vesicles of absorbed fluids that have been entrapped. Small amounts of substances are absorbed by this physical process of pinocytosis.

Extending from the epithelial cell body into each microvillus of the brush border are multiple actin filaments that contract rhythmically to cause continual movement of the microvilli, keeping them constantly exposed to new quantities of intestinal fluid.

## ABSORPTION IN THE SMALL INTESTINE

Absorption from the small intestine each day consists of several hundred grams of carbohydrates, 100 or more grams of fat, 50 to 100 grams of amino acids, 50 to 100 grams of ions, and 7 to 8 liters of water. The absorptive capacity of the normal small intestine is far greater than
this; each day as much as several kilograms of carbohydrates, 500 grams of fat, 500 to 700 grams of proteins, and 20 or more liters of water can be absorbed. The large intestine can absorb still more water and ions, although it can absorb very few nutrients.

## ISOSMOTIC ABSORPTION OF WATER

Water is transported through the intestinal membrane entirely by diffusion. Furthermore, this diffusion obeys the usual laws of osmosis. Therefore, when the chyme is dilute enough, water is absorbed through the intestinal mucosa into the blood of the villi almost entirely by osmosis.

Conversely, water can also be transported in the opposite direction-from plasma into the chyme. This type of transport occurs especially when hyperosmotic solutions are discharged from the stomach into the duodenum. Within minutes, sufficient water usually will be transferred by osmosis to make the chyme isosmotic with the plasma.

## ABSORPTION OF IONS

Sodium Is Actively Transported Through the Intestinal Membrane. Twenty to 30 grams of sodium are secreted in the intestinal secretions each day. In addition, the average person eats 5 to 8 grams of sodium each day. Therefore, to prevent net loss of sodium into the feces, the intestines must absorb 25 to 35 grams of sodium each day, which is equal to about one-seventh of all the sodium present in the body.

Whenever significant amounts of intestinal secretions are lost to the exterior, as in extreme diarrhea, the sodium reserves of the body can sometimes be depleted to lethal levels within hours. Normally, however, less than $0.5 \%$ of the intestinal sodium is lost in the feces each day because it is rapidly absorbed through the intestinal mucosa. Sodium also plays an important role in helping to absorb sugars and amino acids, as subsequent discussions reveal.

The basic mechanism of sodium absorption from the intestine is shown in Figure 66-8. The principles of this mechanism, discussed in Chapter 4, are also essentially the same as for absorption of sodium from the gallbladder and renal tubules, as discussed in Chapter 28.

Sodium absorption is powered by active transport of sodium from inside the epithelial cells through the basal and lateral walls of these cells into paracellular spaces. This active transport obeys the usual laws of active transport. It requires energy, and the energy process is catalyzed by appropriate adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzymes in the cell membrane (see Chapter 4). Part of the sodium is absorbed along with chloride ions; in fact, the negatively charged chloride ions are mainly passively "dragged" by the positive electrical charges of the sodium ions.

Active transport of sodium through the basolateral membranes of the cell reduces the sodium concentration inside the cell to a low value ( $\approx 50 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Because the sodium concentration in the chyme is normally about 142

![gu367937568e](gu367937568e.jpg)

Figure 66-8. Absorption of sodium, chloride, glucose, and amino acids through the intestinal epithelium. Note also osmotic absorption of water (i.e., water "follows" sodium through the epithelial membrane).
$\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ (i.e., about equal to that in plasma), sodium moves down this steep electrochemical gradient from the chyme through the brush border of the epithelial cell into the epithelial cell cytoplasm. Sodium is also co-transported through the brush border membrane by several specific carrier proteins, including the following: (1) the sodiumglucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1); (2) sodium-amino acid co-transporters; and (3) the sodium-hydrogen exchanger. These transporters function similarly as in the renal tubules, described in Chapter 28, and provide still more sodium ions to be transported by the epithelial cells into the interstitial fluid and paracellular spaces. At the same time, they also provide secondary active absorption of glucose and amino acids, powered by the active sodium-potassium $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)$ATPase pump on the basolateral membrane.

Osmosis of the Water. The next step in the transport process is osmosis of water by transcellular and paracellular pathways. This osmosis occurs because a large osmotic gradient has been created by the elevated concentration of ions in the paracellular space. Much of this osmosis occurs through the tight junctions between the apical borders of the epithelial cells (the paracellular pathway), but much also occurs through the cells themselves-the transcellular pathway. Osmotic movement of water creates flow of fluid into and through the paracellular spaces and, finally, into the circulating blood of the villus.

Aldosterone Greatly Enhances Sodium Absorption. When a person becomes dehydrated, large amounts of aldosterone are secreted by the cortices
of the adrenal glands. Within 1 to 3 hours this aldosterone causes increased activation of the enzyme and transport mechanisms for all aspects of sodium absorption by the intestinal epithelium. The increased sodium absorption in turn causes secondary increases in absorption of chloride ions, water, and some other substances.

This effect of aldosterone is especially important in the colon because it allows virtually no loss of sodium chloride in the feces and also little water loss. Thus, the function of aldosterone in the intestinal tract is the same as that achieved by aldosterone in the renal tubules, which also serves to conserve sodium chloride and water in the body when a person becomes depleted of sodium chloride and dehydrated.

Absorption of Chloride Ions in the Small Intestine. In the upper part of the small intestine, chloride ion absorption is rapid and occurs mainly by diffusion (i.e., absorption of sodium ions through the epithelium creates electronegativity in the chyme and electropositivity in the paracellular spaces between the epithelial cells). Chloride ions then move along this electrical gradient to "follow" the sodium ions. Chloride is also absorbed across the brush border membrane of parts of the ileum and large intestine by a brush border membrane chloridebicarbonate exchanger (see Figure 66-8). Chloride exits the cell on the basolateral membrane through chloride channels.

Absorption of Bicarbonate Ions in the Duodenum and Jejunum. Often large quantities of bicarbonate ions $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$must be reabsorbed from the upper small intestine because large amounts of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$have been secreted into the duodenum in both pancreatic secretion and bile. The $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is absorbed in an indirect way as follows: When sodium ions are absorbed, moderate amounts of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$are secreted into the lumen of the gut in exchange for some of the sodium. These $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, in turn, combine with the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to form carbonic acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)$, which then dissociates to form water and carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$. The water remains as part of the chyme in the intestines, but the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is readily absorbed into the blood and subsequently expired through the lungs. This process is the so-called "active absorption of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$." It is the same mechanism that occurs in the tubules of the kidneys (see Chapter 31).

Secretion of Bicarbonate and Absorption of Chloride Ions in the Ileum and Large Intestine. The epithelial cells on the surfaces of the villi in the ileum, as well as on all surfaces of the large intestine, have a special capability of secreting $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in exchange for absorption of chloride ions (see Figure 66-8). This capability is important because it provides alkaline $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ that neutralizes acid products formed by bacteria in the large intestine.

Extreme Secretion of Chloride Ions, Sodium Ions, and Water From the Large Intestine Epithelium in Some Types of Diarrhea. Immature epithelial cells that continually divide to form new epithelial cells are found deep in the spaces between the intestinal epithelial folds. These new epithelial cells spread outward over the luminal surfaces of the intestines. While still in the deep folds, the epithelial cells secrete sodium chloride and water into the intestinal lumen. This secretion, in turn, is reabsorbed by the older epithelial cells outside the folds, thus providing flow of water for absorbing intestinal digestates.

The toxins of cholera and of some other types of diarrheal bacteria can stimulate the epithelial fold secretion so greatly that this secretion often becomes much greater than can be reabsorbed, thus sometimes causing a loss of 5 to 10 liters of water and sodium chloride as diarrhea each day. Within 1 to 5 days, many severely affected patients die of this loss of fluid alone.

Extreme diarrheal secretion is initiated by entry of a subunit of cholera toxin into the epithelial cells. This subunit stimulates formation of excess cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which opens tremendous numbers of chloride channels, allowing chloride ions to flow rapidly from inside the cell into the intestinal crypts. In turn, this action is believed to activate a sodium pump that pumps sodium ions into the crypts to go along with the chloride ions. Finally, all this extra sodium chloride causes extreme osmosis of water from the blood, thus providing rapid flow of fluid along with the salt. All this excess fluid washes away most of the bacteria and is of value in combating the disease, but too much of a good thing can be lethal because of serious dehydration of the whole body that might ensue. In most instances, the life of a person with cholera can be saved by the administration of tremendous amounts of sodium chloride solution to make up for the loss.

Active Absorption of Calcium, Iron, Potassium, Magnesium, and Phosphate. Calcium ions are actively absorbed into the blood, especially from the duodenum, and the amount of calcium ion absorption is exactly controlled to supply the daily need of the body for calcium. One important factor controlling calcium absorption is parathyroid hormone secreted by the parathyroid glands, and another is vitamin D. Parathyroid hormone activates vitamin D , and the activated vitamin D in turn greatly enhances calcium absorption. These effects are discussed in Chapter 80.

Iron ions are also actively absorbed from the small intestine. The principles of iron absorption and regulation of its absorption in proportion to the body's need for iron, especially for the formation of hemoglobin, are discussed in Chapter 33.

Potassium, magnesium, phosphate, and probably still other ions can also be actively absorbed through the intestinal mucosa. In general, the monovalent ions are absorbed with ease and in great quantities. Bivalent ions are normally absorbed in only small amounts; for example, maximum absorption of calcium ions is only $1 / 4$ th as great as the normal absorption of sodium ions. Fortunately, only small quantities of the bivalent ions are normally required daily by the body.

## ABSORPTION OF NUTRIENTS

## Carbohydrates Are Mainly Absorbed as Monosaccharides

Essentially all the carbohydrates in food are absorbed in the form of monosaccharides; only a small fraction is absorbed as disaccharides and almost none is absorbed as larger carbohydrate compounds. By far the most abundant of the absorbed monosaccharides is glucose, which usually accounts for more than $80 \%$ of the carbohydrate calories absorbed. The reason for this high percentage is that glucose is the final digestion product of our most abundant carbohydrate food, the starches. The remaining 20\% of absorbed monosaccharides is composed almost entirely of galactose and fructose-the galactose derived from milk and the fructose as one of the monosaccharides digested from cane sugar.

Virtually all the monosaccharides are absorbed by a secondary active transport process. We will first discuss the absorption of glucose.

Glucose Is Transported by a Sodium Co-Transport Mechanism. In the absence of sodium transport through the intestinal membrane, virtually no glucose can be absorbed because glucose absorption occurs in a co-transport mode with active transport of sodium (Figure 66-9).

The transport of sodium and glucose through the intestinal membrane occurs in two stages. First is active transport of sodium ions through the basolateral membranes of the intestinal epithelial cells into the interstitial fluid, thereby depleting sodium inside the epithelial cells. Second, a decrease of sodium inside the cells causes sodium from the intestinal lumen to move through the brush border of the epithelial cells to the cell interiors by a process of secondary active transport. That is, a sodium ion combines with a transport protein, SGLT1, which will not transport sodium to the cell interior until SGLT1 also combines

with glucose. Intestinal glucose also combines simultaneously with SGLT1 and both the sodium ion and glucose molecule are then transported together to the interior of the cell. Thus, the low concentration of sodium inside the cell literally "drags" sodium to the interior of the cell, and glucose is dragged along with it. Once inside the epithelial cell, another transport protein, glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) facilitates diffusion of the glucose through the cell's basolateral membrane into the paracellular space and from there into the blood (see Figure 66-9).

To summarize, it is the initial active transport of sodium through the basolateral membranes of the intestinal epithelial cells that provides the eventual force for moving glucose through the membranes as well.

Absorption of Other Monosaccharides. Galactose is transported by almost exactly the same mechanism as glucose, using the SGLT1 and GLUT2 transporters to cross the luminal and basolateral membranes, respectively (see Figure 66-9). Fructose transport does not occur by the sodium cotransport mechanism. Instead, fructose is transported by facilitated diffusion all the way through the intestinal epithelium and is not coupled with sodium transport. Transport of fructose from the intestinal lumen to the cell interior is facilitated by GLUT5 and exit of fructose from the cell to the paracellular space is facilitated by GLUT2 (see Figure 66-9).

Some of the fructose, upon entering the cell, becomes phosphorylated. It is then converted to glucose and finally transported in the form of glucose the rest of the way into the blood. Because fructose is not co-transported with sodium, its overall rate of transport is only about one-half that of glucose or galactose.

## Absorption of Proteins as Dipeptides, Tripeptides, or Amino Acids

As explained earlier, most proteins, after digestion, are absorbed through the luminal membranes of the intestinal epithelial cells in the form of dipeptides, tripeptides, and a few free amino acids. The energy for most of this transport is supplied by a sodium co-transport mechanism in the same way that sodium co-transport of glucose occurs. That is, most peptide or amino acid molecules bind in the cell's microvillus membrane with a specific transport protein that requires sodium binding before transport can occur. After binding, the sodium ion then moves down its electrochemical gradient to the interior of the cell and pulls the amino acid or peptide along with it. This process is called co-transport (or secondary active transport) of the amino acids and peptides (see Figure 66-8). A few amino acids do not require this sodium co-transport mechanism but instead are transported by special membrane transport proteins in the same way that fructose is transported, by facilitated diffusion.

At least 10 different types of transport proteins for amino acids and peptides have been found in the intestinal epithelial cells. This multiplicity of transport proteins is required because of the diverse binding properties of different amino acids and peptides.

## Absorption of Fats

Earlier in this chapter, we pointed out that when fats are digested to form monoglycerides and free fatty acids, both of these digestive end products first become dissolved in the central lipid portions of bile micelles. Because the molecular dimensions of these micelles are only 3 to 6 nanometers in diameter, and because of their highly charged exterior, they are soluble in chyme. In this form, the monoglycerides and free fatty acids are carried to the surfaces of the microvilli of the intestinal cell brush border and then penetrate into the recesses among the moving, agitating microvilli. Here, both the monoglycerides and fatty acids diffuse immediately out of the micelles and into the interior of the epithelial cells, which is possible because the lipids are also soluble in the epithelial cell membrane. This process leaves the bile micelles still in the chyme, where they function again and again to help absorb still more monoglycerides and fatty acids.

Thus, the micelles perform a "ferrying" function that is highly important for fat absorption. In the presence of an abundance of bile micelles, about $97 \%$ of the fat is absorbed; in the absence of the bile micelles, only $40 \%$ to $50 \%$ can be absorbed.

After entering the epithelial cell, the fatty acids and monoglycerides are taken up by the cell's smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Here, they are mainly used to form new triglycerides that are subsequently released in the form of chylomicrons through the base of the epithelial cell, to flow upward through the thoracic lymph duct and empty into the circulating blood.

Direct Absorption of Fatty Acids Into the Portal Blood. Small quantities of short- and medium-chain fatty acids, such as those from butterfat, are absorbed directly into the portal blood rather than being converted into triglycerides and absorbed by way of the lymphatics. The cause of this difference between short- and long-chain fatty acid absorption is that the short-chain fatty acids are more water soluble and mostly are not reconverted into triglycerides by the endoplasmic reticulum. This phenomenon allows diffusion of these short-chain fatty acids from the intestinal epithelial cells directly into the capillary blood of the intestinal villi.

## ABSORPTION IN THE LARGE INTESTINE: FORMATION OF FECES

About 1500 ml of chyme normally pass through the ileocecal valve into the large intestine each day. Most of the water and electrolytes in this chyme are absorbed in the colon, usually leaving less than 100 ml of fluid to be excreted in the feces. Also, essentially all the ions are absorbed, leaving only 1 to 5 mEq each of sodium and chloride ions to be lost in the feces.

Most of the absorption in the large intestine occurs in the proximal half of the colon, giving this portion the name absorbing colon, whereas the distal colon functions principally for feces storage until a propitious time for feces excretion and is therefore called the storage colon.

## Absorption and Secretion of Electrolytes and Water.

The mucosa of the large intestine, like that of the small intestine, has a high capability for active absorption of sodium, and the electrical potential gradient created by sodium absorption causes chloride absorption as well. The tight junctions between the epithelial cells of the large intestinal epithelium are much tighter than those of the small intestine. This characteristic prevents significant amounts of back-diffusion of ions through these junctions, thus allowing the large intestinal mucosa to absorb sodium ions far more completely-that is, against a much higher concentration gradient-than can occur in the small intestine. This is especially true when large quantities of aldosterone are available because aldosterone greatly enhances sodium transport capability.

In addition, as occurs in the distal portion of the small intestine, the mucosa of the large intestine secretes $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$while it simultaneously absorbs an equal number of chloride ions in an exchange transport process (already described). The HCO3- helps neutralize the acidic end products of bacterial action in the large intestine.

Absorption of sodium and chloride ions creates an osmotic gradient across the large intestinal mucosa, which in turn causes absorption of water.

Maximum Absorption Capacity of the Large Intestine. The large intestine can absorb a maximum of 5 to 8 liters of fluid and electrolytes each day. When the total quantity entering the large intestine through the ileocecal valve or by way of large intestine secretion exceeds this amount, the excess appears in the feces as diarrhea. As noted earlier, toxins from cholera or certain other bacterial infections often cause the crypts in the terminal ileum and large intestine to secrete 10 or more liters of fluid each day, leading to severe and sometimes lethal diarrhea.

Bacterial Action in the Colon. Numerous bacteria, especially colon bacilli, are present even normally in the absorbing colon. They are capable of digesting small amounts of cellulose, in this way providing a few calories of extra nutrition for the body. In herbivorous animals, this source of energy is significant, although it is of negligible importance in human beings.

Other substances formed as a result of bacterial activity are vitamin K , vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, thiamine, riboflavin, and various gases that contribute to flatus in the colon, especially $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, hydrogen gas, and methane. The bacteria-formed vitamin K is especially important because the amount of this vitamin in the daily ingested foods is normally insufficient to maintain adequate blood coagulation.

Composition of the Feces. The feces normally are about three-fourths water and one-fourth solid matter that is composed of about $30 \%$ dead bacteria, $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ fat, $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ inorganic matter, $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ protein, and $30 \%$ undigested roughage from the food and dried constituents of digestive juices, such as bile pigment and sloughed epithelial cells. The brown color of feces is caused by stercobilin and urobilin, derivatives of bilirubin. The odor is caused principally by products of bacterial action; these products vary from one person to another, depending on each person's colonic bacterial flora and on the type of food eaten. The actual odoriferous products include indole, skatole, mercaptans, and hydrogen sulfide.

# Physiology of Gastrointestinal Disorders 

Effective therapy for most gastrointestinal disorders depends on a basic knowledge of gastrointestinal physiology. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss a few representative types of gastrointestinal malfunction that have special physiological bases or consequences.

## Disorders of Swallowing and the Esophagus

Paralysis of the Swallowing Mechanism. Damage to the fifth, ninth, or tenth cerebral nerve can cause paralysis of significant portions of the swallowing mechanism. In addition, a few diseases, such as poliomyelitis or encephalitis, can prevent normal swallowing by damaging the swallowing center in the brain stem. Paralysis of the swallowing muscles, as occurs in persons with muscle dystrophy or as a result of failure of neuromuscular transmission in persons with myasthenia gravis or botulism, can also prevent normal swallowing.

When the swallowing mechanism is partially or totally paralyzed, the abnormalities that can occur include the following: (1) complete abrogation of the swallowing act so that swallowing cannot occur, (2) failure of the glottis to close so that food passes into the lungs instead of the esophagus, and (3) failure of the soft palate and uvula to close the posterior nares so that food refluxes into the nose during swallowing.

One of the most serious instances of paralysis of the swallowing mechanism occurs when patients are in a state of deep anesthesia. While on the operating table, they sometimes vomit large quantities of materials from the stomach into the pharynx; then, instead of swallowing the materials again, they simply suck them into the trachea because the anesthetic has blocked the reflex mechanism of swallowing. As a result, such patients may choke to death on their own vomitus.

Achalasia and Megaesophagus. Achalasia is a condition in which the lower esophageal sphincter fails to relax during swallowing. As a result, food swallowed into the esophagus fails to pass from the esophagus into the stomach. Pathophysiological studies have shown damage in the neural network of the myenteric plexus in the lower two-thirds of the esophagus. As a result, the musculature of the lower esophagus remains spastically contracted, and the myenteric plexus has lost its ability to transmit a signal to cause "receptive relaxation" of the gastroesophageal sphincter as food approaches this sphincter during swallowing.

When achalasia becomes severe, the esophagus often cannot empty the swallowed food into the stomach for many hours, instead of the few seconds that is the normal time. Over months and years, the esophagus becomes tremendously enlarged until it often can hold as much as 1 liter of food, which often becomes putridly infected during the long periods of esophageal stasis. The infection may also cause ulceration of the esophageal mucosa, sometimes leading to severe substernal pain or even rupture and death. Considerable benefit can be achieved by stretching the lower end of the esophagus with a balloon inflated on the end of a swallowed esophageal tube. Antispasmodic drugs (i.e., drugs that relax smooth muscle) can also be helpful.

## Disorders of the Stomach

## Gastritis-Inflammation of the Gastric Mucosa

Mild to moderate chronic gastritis is especially common in the middle to later years of adult life.

The inflammation of gastritis may be only superficial and therefore not very harmful, or it can penetrate deeply into the gastric mucosa, in many long-standing cases causing almost complete atrophy of the gastric mucosa. In a few cases, gastritis can be acute and severe, with ulcerative excoriation of the stomach mucosa by the stomach's own peptic secretions.

Research suggests that gastritis often is caused by chronic bacterial infection of the gastric mucosa. This condition often can be treated successfully with an intensive regimen of antibacterial therapy.

In addition, certain ingested irritant substances can be especially damaging to the protective gastric mucosal barrier-that is, to the mucous glands and to the tight epithelial junctions between the gastric lining cells-often leading to severe acute or chronic gastritis. Two of the most common of these substances are excesses of alcohol or aspirin.

Increased Permeability of the Gastric Barrier in Gastritis. Absorption of food from the stomach directly into the blood is normally slight. This low level of absorption is mainly due to two specific features of the gastric mucosa: (1) it is lined with highly resistant mucous cells that secrete viscid and adherent mucus, and (2) it has tight junctions between the adjacent epithelial cells. These two features together plus other impediments to gastric absorption are called the "gastric barrier."

The gastric barrier normally is resistant enough to diffusion so that even the highly concentrated hydrogen ions of the gastric juice, averaging about 100,000 times the concentration of hydrogen ions in plasma, seldom diffuse even to the slightest extent through the lining mucus as far as the epithelial membrane. In gastritis, the permeability of the barrier is greatly increased. The hydrogen ions then diffuse into the stomach epithelium, creating additional havoc and leading to a vicious circle of progressive stomach mucosal damage and atrophy. It also makes the mucosa susceptible to digestion by the peptic digestive enzymes, thus frequently resulting in a gastric ulcer.

## Chronic Gastritis Can Lead to Gastric Atrophy and Loss of Stomach Secretions

In many people who have chronic gastritis, the mucosa gradually becomes more and more atrophic until little or no gastric gland digestive secretion remains. It is also believed that in some people autoimmunity develops against the gastric mucosa, which also leads eventually to gastric atrophy. Loss of the stomach secretions in gastric atrophy leads to achlorhydria and, occasionally, to pernicious anemia.

Achlorhydria (and Hypochlorhydria). Achlorhydria means that the stomach fails to secrete hydrochloric acid; it is diagnosed when the pH of the gastric secretions fails to decrease below 6.5 after maximal stimulation. Hypochlorhydria means diminished acid secretion. When acid is not secreted, pepsin also usually is not secreted. Even when it is secreted, the lack of acid prevents it from functioning because pepsin requires an acid medium for activity.

Gastric Atrophy May Cause Pernicious Anemia. Pernicious anemia commonly accompanies gastric atrophy and achlorhydria. Normal gastric secretions contain a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor, secreted by the same parietal cells that secrete hydrochloric acid. Intrinsic factor must be present for adequate absorption of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ from the ileum. That is, intrinsic factor combines with vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ in the stomach and protects it from being digested and destroyed as it passes into the small intestine. Then, when the intrinsic factor-vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ complex reaches the terminal ileum, the intrinsic factor binds with receptors on the ileal epithelial surface, which in turn makes it possible for the vitamin $B_{12}$ to be absorbed.

In the absence of intrinsic factor, only about $1 / 50$ th of the vitamin $B_{12}$ is absorbed. In addition, without intrinsic factor, an adequate amount of vitamin $B_{12}$ is not made available from the foods to cause young, newly forming red blood cells to mature in the bone marrow. The result is pernicious anemia. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 33.

## Peptic Ulcer

A peptic ulcer is an excoriated area of stomach or intestinal mucosa caused principally by the digestive action of gastric juice or upper small intestinal secretions. Figure 67-1 shows the points in the gastrointestinal tract at which peptic ulcers most frequently occur, demonstrating that the most frequent site is within a few centimeters of the pylorus. In addition, peptic ulcers frequently occur along the lesser curvature of the antral end of the stomach or, more rarely, in the lower end of the esophagus where stom-

ach juices frequently reflux. A type of peptic ulcer called a marginal ulcer also often occurs wherever a surgical opening such as a gastrojejunostomy has been made between the stomach and the jejunum of the small intestine.

Basic Cause of Peptic Ulceration. The usual cause of peptic ulceration is an imbalance between the rate of gastric juice secretion and the degree of protection afforded by (1) the gastroduodenal mucosal barrier and (2) the neutralization of the gastric acid by duodenal juices. All areas normally exposed to gastric juice are well supplied with mucous glands, beginning with compound mucous glands in the lower esophagus plus the mucous cell coating of the stomach mucosa, the mucous neck cells of the gastric glands, the deep pyloric glands that secrete mainly mucus, and, finally, the glands of Brunner of the upper duodenum, which secrete a highly alkaline mucus.

In addition to the mucus protection of the mucosa, the duodenum is protected by the alkalinity of the small intestinal secretions. Especially important is pancreatic secretion, which contains large quantities of sodium bicarbonate that neutralize the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, thus also inactivating pepsin and preventing digestion of the mucosa. In addition, large amounts of bicarbonate ions are provided in (1) the secretions of the large Brunner's glands in the first few centimeters of the duodenal wall and (2) bile coming from the liver.

Finally, two feedback control mechanisms normally ensure that this neutralization of gastric juices is complete, as follows:

1. When excess acid enters the duodenum, it inhibits gastric secretion and peristalsis in the stomach, by nervous reflexes and by hormonal feedback from the duodenum, thereby decreasing the rate of gastric emptying.
2. The presence of acid in the small intestine liberates secretin from the intestinal mucosa, which then passes by way of the blood to the pancreas to promote rapid secretion of pancreatic juice. This juice also contains a high concentration of sodium bicarbonate, thus making additional sodium bicarbonate available for neutralization of the acid.
Therefore, a peptic ulcer can be caused in either of two ways: (1) excess secretion of acid and pepsin by the gastric

mucosa or (2) diminished ability of the gastroduodenal mucosal barrier to protect against the digestive properties of the stomach acid-pepsin secretion.

## Specific Causes of Peptic Ulcer

Bacterial Infection by Helicobacter pylori Breaks Down the Gastroduodenal Mucosal Barrier and Stimulates Gastric Acid Secretion. At least $75 \%$ of persons with peptic ulcers have been found to have chronic infection of the terminal portions of the gastric mucosa and initial portions of the duodenal mucosa, most often caused by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Once this infection begins, it can last a lifetime unless it is eradicated by antibacterial therapy. Furthermore, the bacterium is capable of penetrating the mucosal barrier by virtue of its physical capability to burrow through the barrier and by releasing ammonium that liquefies the barrier and stimulates secretion of hydrochloric acid. As a result, the strong acidic digestive juices of the stomach secretions can then penetrate into the underlying epithelium and literally digest the gastrointestinal wall, thus leading to peptic ulceration.

Other Causes of Ulceration. In many people who have peptic ulcers in the initial portion of the duodenum, the rate of gastric acid secretion is greater than normal-sometimes as much as twice normal. Although part of this increased secretion may be stimulated by bacterial infection, studies in both animals and human beings have shown that excess secretion of gastric juices for any reason (e.g., even in psychic disturbances) may cause peptic ulceration.

Other factors that predispose to ulcers include the following: (1) smoking, presumably because of increased nervous stimulation of the stomach secretory glands; (2) excess consumption of alcohol, because it tends to break down the mucosal barrier; and (3) consumption of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that also have a strong propensity for breaking down this barrier.

Treatment of Peptic Ulcers. Since the discovery that much peptic ulceration has a bacterial infectious basis, therapy has changed immensely. Almost all patients with peptic ulceration can be treated effectively by two measures: (1) use of antibiotics along with other agents to kill infectious bacteria; and (2) administration of an acidsuppressant drug, especially ranitidine, which is an antihistaminic agent that blocks the stimulatory effect of histamine on gastric gland histamine ${ }_{2}$ receptors, thus reducing gastric acid secretion by $70 \%$ to $80 \%$.

These physiological approaches to therapy have proven to be effective in most patients. In a few cases, however, the patient's condition is so severe, including massive bleeding from the ulcer, that heroic operative procedures must be used; these procedures include removal of part of the stomach or cutting the two vagus nerves that supply parasympathetic stimulation to the gastric glands.

## Disorders of the Small Intestine

## Abnormal Digestion of Food in the Small IntestinePancreatic Failure

A serious cause of abnormal digestion is failure of the pancreas to secrete pancreatic juice into the small intestine. Lack of pancreatic secretion frequently occurs (1) in persons with pancreatitis (discussed later), (2) when the pan-
creatic duct is blocked by a gallstone at the papilla of Vater, or (3) after the head of the pancreas has been removed because of malignancy.

Loss of pancreatic juice means loss of trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypolypeptidase, pancreatic amylase, pancreatic lipase, and a few other digestive enzymes. Without these enzymes, up to $60 \%$ of the fat entering the small intestine may not be absorbed, along with one-third to one-half of the proteins and carbohydrates. As a result, large portions of the ingested food cannot be used for nutrition and copious, fatty feces are excreted.

Pancreatitis-Infiammation of the Pancreas. Pancreatitis can occur in the form of either acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis.

The most common cause of pancreatitis is drinking excess alcohol, and the second most common cause is blockage of the papilla of Vater by a gallstone. These two causes together account for more than $75 \%$ of all cases of acute pancreatitis.

When a gallstone blocks the papilla of Vater, the main secretory duct from the pancreas and the common bile duct are blocked. The pancreatic enzymes are then dammed up in the ducts and acini of the pancreas. Eventually, so much trypsinogen accumulates that it overcomes the trypsin inhibitor in the secretions, and a small quantity of trypsinogen becomes activated to form trypsin. Once this happens, the trypsin activates additional trypsinogen, as well as chymotrypsinogen and carboxypolypeptidase, resulting in a vicious circle until most of the proteolytic enzymes in the pancreatic ducts and acini become activated. These enzymes rapidly digest large portions of the pancreas, sometimes completely and permanently destroying the ability of the pancreas to secrete digestive enzymes.

Chronic pancreatitis is an ongoing inflammatory and fibrotic condition of the pancreas that may result from relapsing bouts of acute pancreatitis associated with gallstones or excessive alcohol consumption. Other factors than can contribute to chronic pancreatitis include smoking, high levels of triglycerides, or autoimmune-mediate inflammation.

## Malabsorption by the Small Intestinal Mucosa-Sprue

Occasionally, nutrients are not adequately absorbed from the small intestine even though the food has been well digested. Several diseases can cause decreased absorption by the mucosa; they are often classified together under the general term "sprue." Malabsorption also can occur when large portions of the small intestine have been removed.

Nontropical Sprue. One type of sprue, called variously celiac disease, idiopathic sprue, or gluten enteropathy, results from the toxic effects of gluten present in certain types of grains, especially wheat and rye. Only some people are susceptible to this effect, but in those who are susceptible, gluten has a direct destructive effect on intestinal enterocytes. In milder forms of the disease, only the microvilli of the absorbing enterocytes on the villi are destroyed, thus decreasing the absorptive surface area as much as twofold. In the more severe forms, the villi become blunted or disappear altogether, thus still further reducing the absorptive area of the gut. Removal of wheat and rye flour from the diet frequently results in a cure within weeks, especially in children with this disease.

Tropical Sprue. A different type of sprue called tropical sprue frequently occurs in the tropics and can often be treated with antibacterial agents. Even though no specific bacterium has been implicated as the cause, it is believed that this variety of sprue is usually caused by inflammation of the intestinal mucosa resulting from unidentified infectious agents.

Malabsorption in Sprue. In the early stages of sprue, intestinal absorption of fat is more impaired than is absorption of other digestive products. The fat that appears in the stools is almost entirely in the form of salts of fatty acids rather than undigested fat, demonstrating that the problem is one of absorption, not of digestion. In fact, the condition is frequently called steatorrhea, which means simply excess fats in the stools.

In severe cases of sprue, in addition to malabsorption of fats, impaired absorption of proteins, carbohydrates, calcium, vitamin K, folic acid, and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ also occurs. As a result, the person experiences the following: (1) severe nutritional deficiency, which often results in wasting of the body; (2) osteomalacia (i.e., demineralization of the bones because of lack of calcium); (3) inadequate blood coagulation caused by lack of vitamin K; and (4) macrocytic anemia of the pernicious anemia type, resulting from diminished vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folic acid absorption.

## Disorders of the Large Intestine

## Constipation

Constipation means slow movement of feces through the large intestine. Constipation is often associated with large quantities of dry, hard feces in the descending colon that accumulate because of excess absorption of fluid or insufficient fluid intake. Any pathology of the intestines that obstructs movement of intestinal contents, such as tumors, adhesions that constrict the intestines, or ulcers, can cause constipation.

Infants are seldom constipated, but part of their training in the early years of life requires that they learn to control defecation; this control is effected by inhibiting the natural defecation reflexes. Clinical experience shows that if one does not allow defecation to occur when the defecation reflexes are excited or if one overuses laxatives to take the place of natural bowel function, the reflexes become progressively weaker over months or years, and the colon becomes atonic.

Constipation can also result from spasm of a small segment of the sigmoid colon. Motility normally is weak in the large intestine, so even a slight degree of spasm may cause serious constipation. After the constipation has continued for several days and excess feces have accumulated above a spastic sigmoid colon, excessive colonic secretions often then lead to a day or so of diarrhea. After this, the cycle begins again, with repeated bouts of alternating constipation and diarrhea.

Megacolon (Hirschsprung's Disease). Occasionally, constipation is so severe that bowel movements occur only once every several days or sometimes only once a week. This phenomenon allows tremendous quantities of fecal matter to accumulate in the colon, causing the colon sometimes to distend to a diameter of 3 to 4 inches. The condition is called megacolon, or Hirschsprung's disease.

One cause of megacolon is lack of or deficiency of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus in a segment of the sigmoid colon. As a consequence, neither defecation reflexes nor strong peristaltic motility can occur in this area of the large intestine. The sigmoid becomes small and almost spastic while feces accumulate proximal to this area, causing megacolon in the ascending, transverse, and descending colons.

## Diarrhea

Diarrhea results from rapid movement of fecal matter through the large intestine. Several causes of diarrhea with important physiological sequelae are the following.

Enteritis-inflammation of the Intestinal Tract. Enteritis means inflammation usually caused either by viruses or bacteria in the intestinal tract. In usual infectious diarrhea, the infection is most extensive in the large intestine and the distal end of the ileum. Everywhere the infection is present, the mucosa becomes irritated, and its rate of secretion becomes greatly enhanced. In addition, motility of the intestinal wall usually increases markedly. As a result, large quantities of fluid are made available for washing the infectious agent toward the anus, and at the same time strong propulsive movements propel this fluid forward. This mechanism is important for ridding the intestinal tract of a debilitating infection.

Of special interest is diarrhea caused by cholera (and less often by other bacteria such as some pathogenic colon bacilli). As explained in Chapter 66, cholera toxin directly stimulates excessive secretion of electrolytes and fluid from the crypts of Lieberkühn in the distal ileum and colon. The amount can be 10 to 12 liters per day, although the colon can usually reabsorb a maximum of only 6 to 8 liters per day. Therefore, loss of fluid and electrolytes can be so debilitating within several days that death can ensue.

The most important physiological basis of therapy in cholera is to replace the fluid and electrolytes as rapidly as they are lost, mainly by giving the patient intravenous solutions. With proper therapy, along with the use of antibiotics, almost no persons with cholera die, but without therapy, up to $50 \%$ of patients die.

Psychogenic Diarrhea. Most people are familiar with the diarrhea that accompanies periods of nervous tension, such as during examination time or when a soldier is about to go into battle. This type of diarrhea, called psychogenic emotional diarrhea, is caused by excessive stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, which greatly excites both (1) motility and (2) excess secretion of mucus in the distal colon. These two effects added together can cause marked diarrhea.

Ulcerative Colitis. Ulcerative colitis is a disease in which extensive areas of the walls of the large intestine become inflamed and ulcerated. The motility of the ulcerated colon is often so great that mass movements occur much of the day rather than for the usual 10 to 30 minutes. Also, the colon's secretions are greatly enhanced. As a result, the patient has repeated diarrheal bowel movements.

The cause of ulcerative colitis is unclear. Some clinicians believe that it results from an allergic or immune destructive effect, but it also could result from a chronic bacterial infection not yet understood. Whatever the cause, there is a strong hereditary tendency for susceptibility to ulcerative

colitis. Once the condition has progressed far, the ulcers seldom will heal until an ileostomy is performed to allow the small intestinal contents to drain to the exterior rather than to pass through the colon. Even then the ulcers sometimes fail to heal, and the only solution might be surgical removal of the entire colon.

## Paralysis of Defecation in Persons With Spinal Cord Injuries

As discussed in Chapter 64, defecation is normally initiated by accumulating feces in the rectum, which causes a spinal cord-mediated defecation reflex passing from the rectum to the conus medullaris of the spinal cord and then back to the descending colon, sigmoid, rectum, and anus.

When the spinal cord is injured somewhere between the conus medullaris and the brain, the voluntary portion of the defecation act is blocked while the basic cord reflex for defecation is still intact. Nevertheless, loss of the voluntary aid to defecation-that is, loss of the increased abdominal pressure and relaxation of the voluntary anal sphincter-often makes defecation a difficult process in the person with this type of upper cord injury. However, because the cord defecation reflex can still occur, a small enema to excite action of this cord reflex, usually given in the morning shortly after a meal, can often cause adequate defecation. In this way, people with spinal cord injuries that do not destroy the conus medullaris of the spinal cord can usually control their bowel movements each day.

## General Disorders of the Gastrointestinal Tract Vomiting

Vomiting is the means by which the upper gastrointestinal tract rids itself of its contents when almost any part of the upper tract becomes excessively irritated, overdistended, or even overexcitable. Excessive distention or irritation of the duodenum provides an especially strong stimulus for vomiting.

The sensory signals that initiate vomiting originate mainly from the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, and upper portions of the small intestines. As shown in Figure 67-2, the nerve impulses are transmitted by vagal and sympathetic afferent nerve fibers to multiple distributed nuclei in the brain stem, especially the area postrema, that all together are called the "vomiting center." From here, motor impulses that cause the actual vomiting are transmitted from the vomiting center by way of the fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth, and twelfth cranial nerves to the upper gastrointestinal tract, through vagal and sympathetic nerves to the lower tract, and through spinal nerves to the diaphragm and abdominal muscles.

Antiperistalsis, the Prelude to Vomiting. In the early stages of excessive gastrointestinal irritation or overdistention, antiperistalsis begins to occur, often many minutes before vomiting appears. Antiperistalsis means peristalsis up the digestive tract rather than downward. Antiperistalsis may begin as far down in the intestinal tract as the ileum, and the antiperistaltic wave travels backward up the intestine at a rate of 2 to $3 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{sec}$; this process can actually push a large share of the lower small intestine contents all the way back to the duodenum and stomach within 3 to 5 minutes. Then, as these upper portions of the gastrointestinal tract, especially the duodenum, become overly distended, this distention becomes the exciting factor that initiates the actual vomiting act.
![gu397937568e](gu397937568e.jpg)

Figure 67-2. Neutral connections of the "vomiting center." This socalled vomiting center includes multiple sensory, motor, and control nuclei mainly in the medullary and pontile reticular formation but also extending into the spinal cord.

At the onset of vomiting, strong intrinsic contractions occur in both the duodenum and the stomach, along with partial relaxation of the esophageal-stomach sphincter, thus allowing vomitus to begin moving from the stomach into the esophagus. From here, a specific vomiting act involving the abdominal muscles takes over and expels the vomitus to the exterior, as explained below.

Vomiting Act. Once the vomiting center has been sufficiently stimulated and the vomiting act has been instituted, the first effects are the following: (1) a deep breath, (2) raising of the hyoid bone and larynx to pull the upper esophageal sphincter open, (3) closing of the glottis to prevent vomitus flow into the lungs, and (4) lifting of the soft palate to close the posterior nares. Next comes a strong downward contraction of the diaphragm along with simultaneous contraction of all the abdominal wall muscles, which squeezes the stomach between the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles, building the intragastric pressure to a high level. Finally, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes completely, allowing expulsion of the gastric contents upward through the esophagus.

Thus, the vomiting act results from a squeezing action of the muscles of the abdomen associated with simultane-

ous contraction of the stomach wall and opening of the esophageal sphincters so that the gastric contents can be expelled.

Chemoreceptor "Trigger Zone" in the Brain Medulla for Initiation of Vomiting by Drugs or by Motion Sickness. Aside from the vomiting initiated by irritative stimuli in the gastrointestinal tract, vomiting can also be caused by nervous signals arising in areas of the brain. This mechanism is particularly true for a small area called the chemoreceptor trigger zone for vomiting, located in the area postrema on the lateral walls of the fourth ventricle. Electrical stimulation of this area can initiate vomiting, but more importantly, administration of certain drugs, including apomorphine, morphine, and some digitalis derivatives, can directly stimulate this chemoreceptor trigger zone and initiate vomiting. Destruction of this area blocks this type of vomiting but does not block vomiting resulting from irritative stimuli in the gastrointestinal tract.

Furthermore, it is well known that rapidly changing direction or rhythm of motion of the body can cause certain people to vomit. The mechanism for this phenomenon is the following: The motion stimulates receptors in the vestibular labyrinth of the inner ear, and from here impulses are transmitted mainly via the brain stem vestibular nuclei into the cerebellum, then to the chemoreceptor trigger zone, and finally to the vomiting center to cause vomiting.

## Nausea

The sensation of nausea is often a prodrome of vomiting. Nausea is the conscious recognition of subconscious excitation in an area of the medulla closely associated with or part of the vomiting center. It can be caused by (1) irritative impulses coming from the gastrointestinal tract, (2) impulses that originate in the lower brain associated with motion sickness, or (3) impulses from the cerebral cortex to initiate vomiting. Vomiting occasionally occurs without the prodromal sensation of nausea, which indicates that only certain portions of the vomiting center are associated with the sensation of nausea.

## Gastrointestinal Obstruction

The gastrointestinal tract can become obstructed at almost any point along its course, as shown in Figure 67-3. Some common causes of obstruction are the following: (1) cancer, (2) fibrotic constriction resulting from ulceration or from peritoneal adhesions, (3) spasm of a gut segment, and (4) paralysis of a gut segment.

The abnormal consequences of obstruction depend on the point in the gastrointestinal tract that becomes obstructed. If the obstruction occurs at the pylorus, which often results from fibrotic constriction after peptic ulceration, persistent vomiting of stomach contents occurs. This vomiting depresses bodily nutrition; it also causes excessive loss of hydrogen ions from the stomach and can result in various degrees of whole-body metabolic alkalosis.

If the obstruction is beyond the stomach, antiperistaltic reflux from the small intestine causes intestinal juices to flow backward into the stomach, and these juices are vomited along with the stomach secretions. In this case, the person loses large amounts of water and electrolytes. He or she becomes severely dehydrated, but the loss of acid from the stomach and base from the small intestine may be approximately equal, so little change in acid-base balance occurs.
![gu407937568e](gu407937568e.jpg)

Figure 67-3. Obstruction in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract.

If the obstruction is near the distal end of the large intestine, feces can accumulate in the colon for a week or more. The patient develops an intense feeling of constipation, but at first vomiting is not severe. After the large intestine has become completely filled and it finally becomes impossible for additional chyme to move from the small intestine into the large intestine, severe vomiting then occurs. Prolonged obstruction of the large intestine can finally cause rupture of the intestine or dehydration and circulatory shock resulting from the severe vomiting.

## Gases in the Gastrointestinal Tract (Flatus)

Gases, called flatus, can enter the gastrointestinal tract from three sources: (1) swallowed air, (2) gases formed in the gut as a result of bacterial action, or (3) gases that diffuse from the blood into the gastrointestinal tract. Most gases in the stomach are mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen derived from swallowed air. These gases are usually expelled by belching. Only small amounts of gas normally occur in the small intestine, and much of this gas is air that passes from the stomach into the intestinal tract.

In the large intestine, bacterial action generates most of the gases, including especially carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen. When methane and hydrogen become suitably mixed with oxygen, an actual explosive mixture is sometimes formed. Use of the electric cautery during sigmoidoscopy has been known to cause a mild explosion.

Certain foods are known to cause greater expulsion of flatus through the anus than others-beans, cabbage, onion, cauliflower, corn, and certain irritant foods such as vinegar. Some of these foods serve as a suitable medium for gas-forming bacteria, especially unabsorbed fermentable types of carbohydrates. For example, beans contain an indigestible carbohydrate that passes into the colon and becomes a superior food for colonic bacteria. But in other cases, excess expulsion of gas results from irritation of the large intestine, which promotes rapid peristaltic expulsion of gases through the anus before they can be absorbed.

The amount of gases entering or forming in the large intestine each day averages 7 to 10 liters, whereas the average amount expelled through the anus is usually only about 0.6 liter. The remainder is normally absorbed into the blood through the intestinal mucosa and expelled through the lungs.

# Metabolism of Carbohydrates and Formation of Adenosine Triphosphate 

The next few chapters deal with metabolism in the body-the chemical processes that make it possible for the cells to continue living. It is not the purpose of this text to present the chemical details of all the various cellular reactions, which lie in the discipline of biochemistry. Instead, these chapters are devoted to (1) a review of the principal chemical processes of the cell and (2) an analysis of their physiological implications, especially the manner in which they fit into overall body homeostasis.

## Release of Energy From Foods and "Free Energy"

Many of the chemical reactions in the cells are aimed at making the energy in foods available to the various physiological systems of the cell. For example, energy is required for muscle activity, secretion by the glands, maintenance of membrane potentials by the nerve and muscle fibers, synthesis of substances in the cells, absorption of foods from the gastrointestinal tract, and many other functions.

Coupled Reactions. All the energy foods-carbohydrates, fats, and proteins-can be oxidized in the cells, and during this process, large amounts of energy are released. These same foods can also be burned with pure oxygen outside the body in an actual fire, releasing large amounts of energy, but the energy is released suddenly, all in the form of heat. The energy needed by the physiologic processes of the cells is not heat but energy to cause mechanical movement in the case of muscle function, to concentrate solutes in the case of glandular secretion, and to effect many other cell functions. To provide this energy, the chemical reactions must be "coupled" with the systems responsible for these physiologic functions. This coupling is accomplished by special cellular enzymes and energy transfer systems, some of which are explained in this and subsequent chapters.
"Free Energy." The amount of energy liberated by complete oxidation of a food is called the free energy of food oxidation and is generally represented by the symbol $\Delta \mathrm{G}$. Free energy is usually expressed in terms of calories per mole of substance. For example, the amount of free energy liberated by complete oxidation of 1 mole ( 180 grams) of glucose is 686,000 calories.

## Adenosine Triphosphate Is the "Energy Currency" of the Body

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an essential link between energy-utilizing and energy-producing functions of the body (Figure 68-1). For this reason, ATP has been called the "energy currency" of the body, and it can be gained and spent repeatedly.

Energy derived from the oxidation of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats is used to convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to ATP, which is then consumed by the various reactions of the body that are necessary to maintain and propagate life.

ATP is a labile chemical compound that is present in all cells. ATP is a combination of adenine, ribose, and three phosphate radicals, as shown in Figure 68-2. The last two phosphate radicals are connected with the remainder of the molecule by high-energy bonds, which are indicated by the symbol -.

The amount of free energy in each of these highenergy bonds per mole of ATP is about 7300 calories under standard conditions and about 12,000 calories under the usual conditions of temperature and concentrations of the reactants in the body. Therefore, in the body, removal of each of the last two phosphate radicals liberates about 12,000 calories of energy. After loss
