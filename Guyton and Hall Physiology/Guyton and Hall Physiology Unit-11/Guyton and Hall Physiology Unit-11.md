# The Eye: I. Optics of Vision 

## PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES OF OPTICS

Understanding the optical system of the eye requires familiarity with the basic principles of optics, including such factors as the physics of light refraction, focusing, and depth of focus. A brief review of these physical principles is presented in this chapter, followed by discussion of the optics of the eye.

## Refraction of Light

Refractive Index of a Transparent Substance. Light rays travel through air at a velocity of about $300,000 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{sec}$, but they travel much slower through transparent solids and liquids. The refractive index of a transparent substance is the ratio of the velocity of light in air to the velocity in the substance. The refractive index of air is 1.00 . Thus, if light travels through a particular type of glass at a velocity of 200,000 $\mathrm{km} / \mathrm{sec}$, the refractive index of this glass is 300,000 divided by 200,000 , or 1.50 .

Refraction of Light Rays at an Interface Between Two Media With Different Refractive Indices. When light rays traveling forward in a beam (as shown in Figure 50-1A) strike an interface that is perpendicular to the beam, the rays enter the second medium without deviating from their course. The only effect that occurs is decreased velocity of transmission and shorter wavelength, as shown in the figure by the shorter distances between wave fronts.

If the light rays pass through an angulated interface, as shown in Figure 50-1B, the rays bend if the refractive indices of the two media are different from each other. In this figure, the light rays are leaving air, which has a refractive index of 1.00 , and are entering a block of glass having a refractive index of 1.50 . When the beam first strikes the angulated interface, the lower edge of the beam enters the glass ahead of the upper edge. The wave front in the upper portion of the beam continues to travel at a velocity of $300,000 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{sec}$, whereas that which entered the glass travels at a velocity of $200,000 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{sec}$. This difference in velocity causes the upper portion of the wave front to move ahead of the lower portion so that the wave front is no longer vertical but is angulated to the right. Because the direction in which light travels is always perpendicular to the plane of the wave front, the direction of travel of the light beam bends downward.

This bending of light rays at an angulated interface is known as refraction. Note particularly that the degree of refraction increases as a function of the following: (1) the
ratio of the two refractive indices of the two transparent media; and (2) the degree of angulation between the interface and the entering wave front.

## Application of Refractive Principles to Lenses

Convex Lens Focuses Light Rays. Figure 50-2 shows parallel light rays entering a convex lens. The light rays passing through the center of the lens strike the lens exactly perpendicular to the lens surface and, therefore, pass through the lens without being refracted. Toward either edge of the lens, however, the light rays strike a progressively more angulated interface. The outer rays bend more and more toward the center, which is called convergence of

Figure 50-1. Light rays entering a glass surface perpendicular to the light rays (A) and a glass surface angulated to the light rays (B). This figure demonstrates that the distance between waves after they enter the glass is shortened to about two-thirds that in air. It also shows that light rays striking an angulated glass surface are bent.

the rays. Half the bending occurs when the rays enter the lens, and half occurs as the rays exit from the opposite side. If the lens has exactly the proper curvature, parallel light rays passing through each part of the lens will be bent exactly enough so that all the rays will pass through a single point, called the focal point.

Concave Lens Diverges Light Rays. Figure 50-3 shows the effect of a concave lens on parallel light rays. The rays that enter the center of the lens strike an interface that is perpendicular to the beam and, therefore, do not refract. The rays at the edge of the lens enter the lens ahead of the rays in the center. This effect is opposite to the effect in the convex lens, and it causes the peripheral light rays to diverge from the light rays that pass through the center of the lens. Thus, the concave lens diverges light rays, but the convex lens converges light rays.

Cylindrical Lens Bends Light Rays in Only One PlaneComparison With Spherical Lenses. Figure 50-4 shows both a convex spherical lens and a convex cylindrical lens. Note that the cylindrical lens bends light rays from the two sides of the lens but not from the top or the bottom-that is, bending occurs in one plane but not the other. Thus, parallel light rays are bent to a focal line. Conversely, light rays that pass through the spherical lens are refracted at all edges of the lens (in both planes) toward the central ray, and all the rays come to a focal point.

The cylindrical lens is well demonstrated by using a test tube full of water. If the test tube is placed in a beam of sunlight and a piece of paper is brought progressively closer to the opposite side of the tube, a certain distance will be found at which the light rays come to a focal line. The spherical lens is demonstrated by an ordinary magnifying glass. If such a lens is placed in a beam of sunlight, and a piece of paper is brought progressively closer to the lens, the light rays will impinge on a common focal point at an appropriate distance.

Concave cylindrical lenses diverge light rays in only one plane in the same manner that convex cylindrical lenses converge light rays in one plane. Figure 50-5A shows how light is focused from a point source to a line focus by a cylindrical lens.

Combination of Two Cylindrical Lenses at Right Angles Equals a Spherical Lens. Figure 50-5B shows two convex

Figure 50-4. A, Point focus of parallel light rays by a spherical convex lens. B, Line focus of parallel light rays by a cylindrical convex lens.
cylindrical lenses at right angles to each other. The vertical cylindrical lens converges the light rays that pass through the two sides of the lens, and the horizontal lens converges the top and bottom rays. Thus, all the light rays come to a single point focus. In other words, two cylindrical lenses crossed at right angles to each other perform the same function as one spherical lens of the same refractive power.

## Focal Length of a Lens

The distance beyond a convex lens at which parallel rays converge to a common focal point is called the focal length of the lens. The diagram at the top of Figure 50-6 demonstrates this focusing of parallel light rays.

In the middle diagram, the light rays that enter the convex lens are not parallel but are diverging because the origin of the light is a point source not far away from the lens. Because these rays are diverging outward from the point source, they do not focus at the same distance away from the lens as do parallel rays. In other words, when rays of light that are already diverging enter a convex lens, the distance of focus on the other side of the lens is farther from the lens than the focal length of the lens for parallel rays.

The bottom diagram of Figure 50-6 shows light rays diverging toward a convex lens that has far greater curvature than that of the other two lenses in the figure. In this diagram, the distance from the lens at which the light rays come to focus is exactly the same as that from the lens in the first diagram, in which the lens is less convex but the rays

The effect of parallel versus diverging rays on the focal distance is shown. The bottom lens has far more refractive power than either of the other two lenses (i.e., it has a much shorter focal length), demonstrating that the stronger the lens, the nearer to the lens is the focal point.
entering it are parallel. This demonstrates that both parallel rays and diverging rays can be focused at the same distance beyond a lens, provided that the lens changes its convexity.

## Formation of an Image by a Convex Lens

Figure 50-7A shows a convex lens with two point sources of light to the left. Because light rays pass through the center of a convex lens without being refracted in either direction, the light rays from each point source of light are shown to come to a point focus on the opposite side of the lens directly in line with the point source and the center of the lens.

Any object in front of the lens is, in reality, a mosaic of point sources of light. Some of these points are very bright and some are very weak, and they vary in color. Each point source of light on the object comes to a separate point focus on the opposite side of the lens in line with the lens center. If a white sheet of paper is placed at the focus distance from the lens, one can see an image of the object, as demonstrated in Figure 50-7B. However, this image is upside down with respect to the original object, and the two lateral sides of the image are reversed. The lens of a camera focuses images on film via this method.

## Measurement of the Refractive Power of a LensDiopter

The more a lens bends light rays, the greater is its "refractive power." This refractive power is measured in terms of diopters. The refractive power in diopters of a convex lens is equal to 1 meter divided by its focal length. Thus, a spherical lens that converges parallel light rays to a focal point 1 meter beyond the lens has a refractive power of +1 diopter, as shown in Figure 50-8. If the lens is capable of bending parallel light rays twice as much as a lens with a power of +1 diopter, it is said to have a strength of +2 diopters, and the light rays come to a focal point 0.5 meter beyond the lens. A lens capable of converging parallel light rays to a focal point only 10 centimeters ( 0.10 meter) beyond the lens has a refractive power of +10 diopters.

The refractive power of concave lenses cannot be stated in terms of the focal distance beyond the lens because the light rays diverge rather than focus to a point. However, if a concave lens diverges light rays at the same rate that a 1-diopter convex lens converges them, the concave lens is said to have a dioptric strength of -1 . Likewise, if the concave lens diverges light rays as much as a +10 -diopter lens converges them, this lens is said to have a strength of -10 diopters.

Concave lenses "neutralize" the refractive power of convex lenses. Thus, placing a 1-diopter concave lens immediately in front of a 1-diopter convex lens results in a lens system with zero refractive power.

The strengths of cylindrical lenses are computed in the same manner as the strengths of spherical lenses, except that the axis of the cylindrical lens must be stated in addition to its strength. If a cylindrical lens focuses parallel light rays to a line focus 1 meter beyond the lens, it has a strength of +1 diopter. Conversely, if a cylindrical lens of a concave type diverges light rays as much as a +1 -diopter cylindrical lens converges them, it has a strength of -1 diopter. If the focused line is horizontal, its axis is said to be 0 degrees. If it is vertical, its axis is 90 degrees.

## OPTICS OF THE EYE

The lens system of the eye (Figure 50-9) is composed of four refractive interfaces: (1) the interface between air and the anterior surface of the cornea; (2) the interface between the posterior surface of the cornea and the aqueous humor; (3) the interface between the aqueous humor and the anterior surface of the lens of the eye; and (4) the interface between the posterior surface of the lens and the vitreous humor. The internal index of air is 1 , the cornea, 1.38 , the aqueous humor, 1.33 , the crystalline lens (on average), 1.40 , and the vitreous humor, 1.34 .

## Consideration of All Refractive Surfaces of the Eye as a Single Lens-The "Reduced" Eye. If all the refractive

surfaces of the eye are added together algebraically and then considered to be one single lens, the optics of the normal eye may be simplified and represented schematically as a "reduced eye." This representation is useful in simple calculations. In the reduced eye, a single refractive surface
![gu0910682559](gu0910682559.jpg)

Figure 50-9. The eye as a camera. The numbers are the refractive indices.
is considered to exist, with its central point 17 millimeters in front of the retina and a total refractive power of 59 diopters when the lens is accommodated for distant vision.

About two-thirds of the 59 diopters of refractive power of the eye is provided by the anterior surface of the cornea (not by the eye lens). The principal reason for this phenomenon is that the refractive index of the cornea is markedly different from that of air, whereas the refractive index of the eye lens is not greatly different from the indices of the aqueous humor and vitreous humor.

The total refractive power of the internal lens of the eye, as it normally lies in the eye surrounded by fluid on each side, is only 20 diopters, about one third the total refractive power of the eye. However, the importance of the internal lens is that in response to nervous signals from the brain, its curvature can be increased markedly to provide "accommodation," which is discussed later in the chapter.

Formation of an Image on the Retina. In the same manner that a glass lens can focus an image on a sheet of paper, the lens system of the eye can focus an image on the retina.

The image is inverted and reversed with respect to the object. However, the mind perceives objects in the upright position despite the upside-down orientation on the retina because the brain is trained to consider an inverted image as normal.

## MECHANISM OF "ACCOMMODATION"

In children, the refractive power of the lens of the eye can be increased voluntarily from 20 diopters to about 34 diopters, which is an "accommodation" of 14 diopters. To make this accommodation, the shape of the lens is changed from that of a moderately convex lens to that of a very convex lens.

In a young person, the lens is composed of a strong elastic capsule filled with viscous, proteinaceous, but transparent fluid. When the lens is in a relaxed state, with no tension on its capsule, it assumes an almost spherical shape, owing mainly to the elastic retraction of the lens capsule. However, as shown in Figure 50-10, about 70 suspensory ligaments attach radially around the lens, pulling the lens edges toward the outer circle of the eyeball. These ligaments are constantly tensed by their attachments at the anterior border of the choroid and retina. The tension on the ligaments causes the lens to remain relatively flat under normal eye conditions.

Also located at the lateral attachments of the lens ligaments to the eyeball is the ciliary muscle, which has two separate sets of smooth muscle fibers-meridional fibers and circular fibers. The meridional fibers extend from the peripheral ends of the suspensory ligaments to the corneoscleral junction. When these muscle fibers contract, the peripheral insertions of the lens ligaments are pulled medially toward the edges of the cornea, thereby releasing the ligaments' tension on the lens. The circular fibers are arranged circularly all the way around the ligament attachments so that when they contract, a sphincter-like action occurs, decreasing the diameter of the circle of ligament attachments; this action also allows the ligaments to pull less on the lens capsule.

Thus, contraction of either set of smooth muscle fibers in the ciliary muscle relaxes the ligaments to the lens capsule, and the lens assumes a more spherical shape, like that of a balloon, because of the natural elasticity of the lens capsule.

## Accommodation Is Controlled by Parasympathetic

Nerves. Ciliary muscle is controlled almost entirely by parasympathetic nerve signals transmitted to the eye through the third cranial nerve from the third nerve nucleus in the brain stem, as explained in Chapter 52. Stimulation of parasympathetic nerves contracts both sets of ciliary muscle fibers, which relaxes the lens ligaments, thus allowing the lens to become thicker and increase its refractive power. With this increased refractive power, the eye focuses on objects nearer than when the eye has less refractive power. Consequently, as a distant object moves toward the eye, the number of parasympathetic impulses impinging on the ciliary muscle must be progressively increased for the eye
![gu1010682559](gu1010682559.jpg)

Figure 50-10. Mechanism of accommodation (focusing).
to keep the object constantly in focus. Sympathetic stimulation has an additional effect in relaxing the ciliary muscle, but this effect is so weak that it plays almost no role in the normal accommodation mechanism; the neurophysiology of this mechanism is discussed in Chapter 52.
Presbyopia-Loss of Accommodation by the Lens. As a person grows older, the lens grows larger and thicker and becomes far less elastic, partly because of progressive denaturation of the lens proteins. The ability of the lens to change shape decreases with age. The power of accommodation decreases from about 14 diopters in a child to less than 2 diopters by the time a person reaches 45 to 50 years and to essentially 0 diopters at age 70 years. Thereafter, the lens remains almost totally nonaccommodating, a condition known as presbyopia.

Once a person has reached the state of presbyopia, each eye remains focused permanently at an almost constant distance; this distance depends on the physical characteristics of each person's eyes. The eyes can no longer accommodate for both near and far vision. To see clearly both in the distance and nearby, an older person must wear bifocal glasses, with the upper segment focused for far-seeing and the lower segment focused for near-seeing (e.g., for reading).

## PUPILLARY DIAMETER

The major function of the iris is to increase the amount of light that enters the eye during darkness and to decrease the amount of light that enters the eye in daylight. The reflexes for controlling this mechanism are considered in Chapter 52.

The amount of light that enters the eye through the pupil is proportional to the area of the pupil or to the square of the diameter of the pupil. The pupil of the human eye can become as small as about 1.5 millimeters and as large as 8 millimeters in diameter. The quantity of light entering the eye can change about 30 -fold as a result of changes in pupillary aperture.

## "Depth of Focus" of the Lens System Increases With Decreasing Pupillary Diameter. Figure 50-11 shows two

eyes that are exactly alike except for the diameters of the pupillary apertures. In the upper eye, the pupillary aperture is small and, in the lower eye, the aperture is large. In front of each of these two eyes are two small point sources of light; light from each passes through the pupillary aperture and focuses on the retina. Consequently, in both eyes, the retina sees two spots of light in perfect focus. If the retina is moved forward or backward to an out of focus position (dashed lines), the size of each spot will not change much in the upper eye, but in the lower eye the size of each spot will increase greatly, becoming a "blur circle." In other words, the upper lens system has far greater depth of focus than the bottom lens system. When a lens system has great depth of focus, the retina can be displaced considerably from the focal plane, or the lens strength can change considerably from normal, and the image will still remain nearly in sharp focus, whereas when a lens system has a "shallow" depth of focus, moving the retina only slightly away from the focal plane causes extreme blurring.

The greatest possible depth of focus occurs when the pupil is extremely small. The reason for this is that with a very small aperture, almost all the rays pass through the center of the lens, and the central most rays are always in focus, as explained earlier.

## Errors of Refraction

See Video 50-1.
Emmetropia (Normal Vision). As shown in Figure 50-12, the eye is considered to be normal, or emmetropic, if parallel light rays from distant objects are in sharp focus on the retina when the ciliary muscle is completely relaxed. This means that the emmetropic eye can see all distant objects clearly with its ciliary muscle relaxed. However, to focus objects at close range, the eye must contract its ciliary muscle and thereby provide an appropriate degree of accommodation.

Hyperopia (Farsightedness). Hyperopia, also known as "farsightedness," is usually due to either an eyeball that is too short or, occasionally, to a lens system that is too weak. In this condition, as seen in the middle panel of Figure 50-12, parallel light rays are not bent sufficiently by the relaxed lens system to come to focus by the time they reach the retina. To overcome this abnormality, the ciliary muscle must contract to increase the strength of the lens. By using the mechanism of accommodation, a farsighted person is capable of focusing distant objects on the retina. If the person has used only a small amount of strength in the ciliary muscle to accommodate for the distant objects, he or she still has much accommodative power left, and objects

Figure 50-12. Parallel light rays focus on the retina in emmetropia, behind the retina in hyperopia, and in front of the retina in myopia.
closer and closer to the eye can also be focused sharply until the ciliary muscle has contracted to its limit. In old age, when the lens becomes "presbyopic," a farsighted person is often unable to accommodate the lens sufficiently to focus even on distant objects, much less on near objects.

Myopia (Nearsightedness). In myopia, or "nearsightedness," when the ciliary muscle is completely relaxed, the light rays coming from distant objects are focused in front of the retina, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 50-12. This condition is usually due to too long an eyeball but also can result from too much refractive power in the lens system of the eye.

No mechanism exists whereby the eye can decrease the strength of its lens to less than that which exists when the ciliary muscle is completely relaxed. A myopic person has no mechanism to focus distant objects sharply on the retina. However, as an object moves nearer to the person's eye,

it finally gets close enough that its image can be focused. Then, when the object comes still closer to the eye, the person can use the mechanism of accommodation to keep the image focused clearly. A myopic person has a definite limiting "far point" for clear vision.

Correction of Myopia and Hyperopia Through Use of Lenses. If the refractive surfaces of the eye have too much refractive power, as in myopia, this excessive refractive power can be neutralized by placing a concave spherical lens in front of the eye, which will diverge rays. Such correction is shown in the upper diagram of Figure 50-13.

Conversely, in a person who has hyperopia-that is, someone who has too weak a lens system-the abnormal vision can be corrected by adding refractive power using a convex lens in front of the eye. This correction is demonstrated in the lower diagram of Figure 50-13.

One usually determines the strength of the concave or convex lens needed for clear vision by "trial and error"that is, by first trying a strong lens and then a stronger or weaker lens until the one that gives the best visual acuity is found.

Astigmatism. Astigmatism is a refractive error of the eye that causes the visual image in one plane to focus at a different distance from that of the plane at right angles. Astigmatism usually results from too great a curvature of the cornea in one plane of the eye. An example of an astigmatic lens would be a lens surface like that of an egg lying sidewise to the incoming light. The degree of curvature in the plane through the long axis of the egg is not nearly as great as the degree of curvature in the plane through the short axis.

Because the curvature of the astigmatic lens along one plane is less than the curvature along the other plane, light rays striking the peripheral portions of the lens in one plane are not bent nearly as much as the rays striking the peripheral portions of the other plane. This effect is demonstrated in Figure 50-14, which shows rays of light originating from a point source and passing through an oblong, astigmatic lens. The light rays in the vertical plane, indicated by plane BD , are refracted greatly by the astigmatic lens because of the greater curvature in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction. By contrast, the light rays in the horizontal plane, indicated by plane AC, are not bent nearly as much as the light rays in vertical plane BD. Therefore, light rays passing through an astigmatic lens do not all come to a common focal point because the light rays passing through one plane focus far in front of those passing through the other plane.

The accommodative power of the eye can never compensate for astigmatism because, during accommodation, the curvature of the eye lens changes approximately equally in both planes; therefore, in astigmatism, each of the two planes requires a different degree of accommodation. Thus, without the aid of glasses, a person with astigmatism never sees in sharp focus.

Correction of Astigmatism With a Cylindrical Lens. One may consider an astigmatic eye as having a lens system made up of two cylindrical lenses of different strengths and placed at right angles to each other. To correct for astigmatism, the usual procedure is to find a spherical lens by trial and error that corrects the focus in one of the two planes of
![gu1310682559](gu1310682559.jpg)

Figure 50-14. Astigmatism, demonstrating that light rays focus at one focal distance in one focal plane (plane $A C$ ) and at another focal distance in the plane at a right angle (plane BD).
the astigmatic lens. Then, an additional cylindrical lens is used to correct the remaining error in the remaining plane. To do this, both the axis and the strength of the required cylindrical lens must be determined.

Several methods exist for determining the axis of the abnormal cylindrical component of the lens system of an eye. One of these methods is based on the use of parallel black bars of the type shown in Figure 50-15. Some of these parallel bars are vertical, some are horizontal, and some are at various angles to the vertical and horizontal axes. After placing various spherical lenses in front of the astigmatic eye, a strength of lens that causes sharp focus of one set of parallel bars but does not correct the fuzziness of the set of bars at right angles to the sharp bars is usually found. It can be shown from the physical principles of optics discussed earlier in this chapter that the axis of the out of focus cylindrical component of the optical system is parallel to the bars that are fuzzy. Once this axis is found, the examiner tries progressively stronger and weaker positive or negative cylindrical lenses, the axes of which are placed in line with the out of focus bars, until the patient sees all the crossed bars with equal clarity. When this goal has been accomplished, the examiner directs the optician to grind a

special lens combining both the spherical correction and the cylindrical correction at the appropriate axis.

Correction of Optical Abnormalities With Contact Lenses. Glass or plastic contact lenses that fit snugly against the anterior surface of the cornea can be inserted. These lenses are held in place by a thin layer of tear fluid that fills the space between the contact lens and the anterior eye surface.

A special feature of the contact lens is that it nullifies the refraction that normally occurs at the anterior surface of the cornea almost entirely. The reason for this nullification is that the tears between the contact lens and the cornea have a refractive index almost equal to that of the cornea, so the anterior surface of the cornea no longer plays a significant role in the eye's optical system. Instead, the outer surface of the contact lens plays the major role. Thus, the refraction of this surface of the contact lens substitutes for the cornea's usual refraction. This factor is especially important in people whose eye refractive errors are caused by an abnormally shaped cornea, such as those who have an odd-shaped, bulging cornea, a condition called keratoconus. Without the contact lens, the bulging cornea causes such severe abnormality of vision that almost no glasses can correct the vision satisfactorily; when a contact lens is used, however, the corneal refraction is neutralized, and normal refraction by the outer surface of the contact lens is substituted.

The contact lens has several other advantages as well, including the following: (1) the lens turns with the eye and gives a broader field of clear vision than glasses; and (2) the contact lens has little effect on the size of the object the person sees through the lens, whereas lenses placed about 1 centimeter in front of the eye do affect the size of the image in addition to correcting the focus.

Cataracts-Opaque Areas in the Lens. "Cataracts" are an especially common eye abnormality that occurs mainly in older people. A cataract is a cloudy or opaque area (or areas) in the lens. In the early stage of cataract formation, the proteins in some of the lens fibers become denatured. Later, these same proteins coagulate to form opaque areas in place of the normal transparent protein fibers.
![gu1510682559](gu1510682559.jpg)

Figure 50-15. Chart composed of parallel black bars at different angular orientations for determining the axis of astigmatism.

When a cataract has obscured light transmission so greatly that it seriously impairs vision, the condition can be corrected by surgical removal of the lens. When the lens is removed, the eye loses a large portion of its refractive power, which must be replaced by placing a powerful convex lens in front of the eye; usually, however, an artificial plastic lens is implanted in the eye in place of the removed lens.

## VISUAL ACUITY

Theoretically, light from a distant point source, when focused on the retina, should be infinitely small. However, because the lens system of the eye is never perfect, such a retinal spot ordinarily has a total diameter of about 11 micrometers, even with maximal resolution of the normal eye optical system. The spot is brightest in its center and shades off gradually toward the edges, as shown by the two-point images in Figure 50-16.

The average diameter of the cones in the fovea of the ret-ina-the central part of the retina, where vision is most highly developed-is about 1.5 micrometers, which is one-seventh the diameter of the spot of light. Nevertheless, because the spot of light has a bright center point and shaded edges, a person can normally distinguish two separate points if their centers lie up to 2 micrometers apart on the retina, which is slightly greater than the width of a foveal cone. This discrimination between points is also shown in Figure 50-16.

The normal visual acuity of the human eye for discriminating between point sources of light is about 25 seconds of arc. That is, when light rays from two separate points strike the eye with an angle of at least 25 seconds between them, they can usually be recognized as two points instead of one. This means that a person with normal visual acuity looking at two bright pinpoint spots of light 10 meters away can barely distinguish the spots as separate entities when they are 1.5 to 2 millimeters apart.

The fovea is less than 0.5 millimeter ( $<500$ micrometers) in diameter, which means that maximum visual acuity occurs in less than 2 degrees of the visual field. Outside this foveal area, the visual acuity becomes progressively poorer, decreasing more than 10 -fold as the periphery is approached. This is caused by the connection of more and more rods and cones to each optic nerve fiber in the nonfoveal, more peripheral parts of the retina, as discussed in Chapter 52.

Clinical Method for Stating Visual Acuity. The chart for testing eyes usually consists of letters of different sizes placed 20 feet away from the person being tested. If the person can see well the letters of a size that he or she should be able to see at 20 feet, the person is said to have 20/20 vision-that is, normal vision. If the person can see only letters that he or she should be able to see at 200 feet, the person is said to have 20/200 vision. In other words, the clinical method for expressing visual acuity is to use a mathematical fraction that expresses the ratio of two distances, which is also the ratio of a person's visual acuity to that of a person with normal visual acuity.

## DETERMINATION OF DISTANCE OF AN OBJECT FROM THE EYE-"DEPTH PERCEPTION"

A person normally perceives distance by three main means: (1) the sizes of the images of known objects on the retina; (2) the phenomenon of moving parallax; and (3) the phenomenon of stereopsis. This ability to determine distance is called depth perception.

## Determination of Distance by Sizes of Retinal Images of

Known Objects. If one knows that a person being viewed is 6 feet tall, one can determine how far away the person is simply by the size of the person's image on the retina. One does not consciously think about the size, but the brain has learned to calculate automatically from image sizes the distances of objects when the dimensions are known.

Determination of Distance by Moving Parallax. Another important means whereby the eyes determine distance is that of moving parallax, a displacement in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight. If a person looks off into the distance with the eyes completely still, he or she perceives no moving parallax, but when the person moves the head to one side or the other, the images of nearby objects move rapidly across the retinas, whereas the images of distant objects remain almost completely stationary. For example, by moving the head 1 inch to the side when the object is only 1 inch in front of the eye, the image moves almost all the way across the retinas, whereas the image of an object 200 feet away from the eyes does not move perceptibly. Thus, by using this mechanism of moving parallax, one can tell the relative distances of different objects even though only one eye is used.

Determination of Distance by Stereopsis-Binocular Vision. Another method whereby one perceives parallax is that of binocular vision. Because one eye is a little more than 2 inches to one side of the other eye, the images on the two retinas are different from each other. For example, an object 1 inch in front of the nose forms an image on the left side of the retina of the left eye but on the right side of the retina of the right eye, whereas a small object 20 feet in front of the nose has its image at closely corresponding points in the centers of the two retinas. This type of parallax is demonstrated in

Figure 50-17, which shows the images of a red spot and a yellow square actually reversed on the two retinas because they are at different distances in front of the eyes. This gives a type of parallax that is always present when both eyes are being used. It is almost entirely this binocular parallax (or stereopsis) that gives a person with two eyes far greater ability to judge relative distances when objects are nearby than a person who has only one eye. However, stereopsis is virtually useless for depth perception at distances beyond 50 to 200 feet.

## FLUID SYSTEM OF THE EYEINTRAOCULAR FLUID

The eye is filled with intraocular fluid, which maintains sufficient pressure in the eyeball to keep it distended. Figure 50-18 demonstrates that this fluid can be divided into two portions-aqueous humor, which lies in front of the lens, and vitreous humor, which is between the posterior surface of the lens and the retina. The aqueous humor is a freely flowing fluid, whereas the vitreous humor, sometimes called the vitreous body, is a gelatinous mass held together by a fine fibrillar network composed primarily of greatly elongated proteoglycan molecules. Both water and dissolved substances can diffuse slowly in the vitreous humor, but there is little flow of fluid.

Aqueous humor is continually being formed and reabsorbed. The balance between formation and reabsorption of aqueous humor regulates the total volume and pressure of the intraocular fluid.

## FORMATION OF AQUEOUS HUMOR BY THE CILIARY BODY

Aqueous humor is formed in the eye at an average rate of 2 to $3 \mu \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. Essentially all of it is secreted by the ciliary processes, which are linear folds projecting from the ciliary body into the space behind the iris where the lens ligaments and ciliary muscle attach to the eyeball. A cross section of these ciliary processes is shown in Figure 50-19, and their relation to the fluid chambers of the eye can be seen in Figure 50-18. Because of their folded architecture, the total surface area of the ciliary processes is about 6 square centimeters in each eye-a

large area, considering the small size of the ciliary body. The surfaces of these processes are covered by highly secretory epithelial cells, and immediately beneath them is a highly vascular area.

Aqueous humor is formed almost entirely as an active secretion by the epithelium of the ciliary processes. Secretion begins with active transport of sodium ions into the spaces between the epithelial cells. The sodium ions pull chloride and bicarbonate ions along with them to maintain electrical neutrality. Then, all these ions together cause osmosis of water from the blood capillaries lying below into the same epithelial intercellular spaces; the resulting solution washes from the spaces of the ciliary processes into the anterior chamber of the eye. In addition, several nutrients are transported across the epithelium by active transport or facilitated diffusion, including amino acids, ascorbic acid, and glucose.

Figure 50-20. Anatomy of the iridocorneal angle showing the system for outflow of aqueous humor from the eyeball into the conjunctival veins.

## OUTFLOW OF AQUEOUS HUMOR FROM THE EYE

After aqueous humor is formed by the ciliary processes, it first flows, as shown in Figure 50-18, through the pupil into the anterior chamber of the eye. From here, the fluid flows anterior to the lens and into the angle between the cornea and the iris, then through a meshwork of trabeculae, and finally entering the canal of Schlemm, which empties into extraocular veins. Figure 50-20 demonstrates the anatomical structures at this iridocorneal angle, showing that the spaces between the trabeculae extend all the way from the anterior chamber to the canal of Schlemm. The canal of Schlemm is a thin-walled vein that extends circumferentially all the way around the eye. Its endothelial membrane is so porous that even large protein molecules, as well as small particulate matter up to the size of red blood cells, can pass from the anterior chamber into the canal of Schlemm. Even though the canal of Schlemm is actually a venous blood vessel, so much aqueous humor normally flows into it that it is filled only with aqueous humor rather than with blood. The small veins that lead from the canal of Schlemm to the larger veins of the eye usually contain only aqueous humor; they are called aqueous veins.

## INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE

The average normal intraocular pressure is about 15 mm Hg , with a range from 12 to 20 mm Hg .

## Measuring Intraocular Pressure by Tonometry.

Because it is impractical to pass a needle into a patient's eye to measure intraocular pressure, this pressure is measured clinically by using a "tonometer," the principle of which is shown in Figure 50-21. The cornea of the eye is anesthetized with a local anesthetic, and the footplate of the tonometer is placed on the cornea. A small force is then applied to a central plunger, causing the part of the cornea beneath the plunger to be displaced inward. The amount of displacement is recorded on the scale of the tonometer, and this is calibrated in terms of intraocular pressure.

![gu2110682559](gu2110682559.jpg)

Figure 50-21. Principles of the tonometer.

Regulation of Intraocular Pressure. Intraocular pressure remains constant in the normal eye, usually within $\pm 2$ mm Hg of its normal level, which averages about 15 mm Hg . The level of this pressure is determined mainly by the resistance to outflow of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber into the canal of Schlemm. This outflow resistance results from the meshwork of trabeculae through which the fluid must percolate on its way from the lateral angles of the anterior chamber to the wall of the canal of Schlemm. These trabeculae have minute openings of only 2 to 3 micrometers. The rate of fluid flow into the canal increases markedly as the pressure rises. At about 15 mm Hg in the normal eye, the amount of fluid leaving the eye via the canal of Schlemm usually averages $2.5 \mu \mathrm{l} / \mathrm{min}$ and equals the inflow of fluid from the ciliary body. The pressure normally remains at about this level of 15 mm Hg .

Mechanism for Cleansing the Trabecular Spaces and Intraocular Fluid. When large amounts of debris are present in the aqueous humor, as occurs after hemorrhage into the eye or during intraocular infection, the debris is likely to accumulate in the trabecular spaces leading from the anterior chamber to the canal of Schlemm; this debris can prevent adequate reabsorption of fluid from the anterior chamber, sometimes causing "glaucoma," as explained subsequently. However, on the surfaces of the trabecular plates are large numbers of phagocytic cells. Immediately outside the canal of Schlemm is a layer of interstitial gel that contains large numbers of reticuloendothelial cells that have an extremely high capacity for engulfing debris and digesting it into small molecular substances that can then be absorbed. Thus, this phagocytic system keeps the trabecular spaces cleaned. The surface of the iris and other surfaces of the eye behind the iris are covered with an epithelium that can phagocytize proteins and small particles from the aqueous humor, thereby helping maintain a clear fluid.
"Glaucoma" Causes High Intraocular Pressure and Is a Principal Cause of Blindness. Glaucoma, one of the most common causes of blindness, is a disease of the eye in which the intraocular pressure becomes pathologically high, sometimes rising acutely to 60 to 70 mm Hg . Pressures above 25 to 30 mm Hg can cause loss of vision when
maintained for long periods. Extremely high pressures can cause blindness within days or even hours. As the pressure rises, the axons of the optic nerve are compressed where they leave the eyeball at the optic disc. This compression is believed to block axonal flow of cytoplasm from the retinal neuronal cell bodies into the optic nerve fibers leading to the brain. The result is lack of appropriate nutrition of the fibers, which eventually causes death of the involved fibers. It is possible that compression of the retinal artery, which enters the eyeball at the optic disc, also adds to the neuronal damage by reducing nutrition to the retina.

In most cases of glaucoma, the abnormally high pressure results from increased resistance to fluid outflow through the trabecular spaces into the canal of Schlemm at the iridocorneal junction. For example, in acute eye inflammation, white blood cells and tissue debris can block these trabecular spaces and cause an acute increase in intraocular pressure. In chronic conditions, especially in older persons, fibrous occlusion of the trabecular spaces appears to be the likely culprit.

Glaucoma can sometimes be treated by placing drops in the eye that contain a drug that diffuses into the eyeball and reduces the secretion or increases the absorption of aqueous humor. When drug therapy fails, operative techniques to open the spaces of the trabeculae or make channels to allow fluid to flow directly from the fluid space of the eyeball into the subconjunctival space outside the eyeball can often reduce the pressure effectively.

# The Eye: II. Receptor and Neural Function of the Retina 

The retina is the light-sensitive portion of the eye that contains the following: (1) the cones, which are responsible for color vision; and (2) the rods, which can detect dim light and are mainly responsible for black and white vision and vision in the dark. When either rods or cones are excited, signals are transmitted first through successive layers of neurons in the retina and, finally, into optic nerve fibers and the cerebral cortex. In this chapter, we explain the mechanisms whereby the rods and cones detect light and color and convert the visual image into optic nerve signals.

## ANATOMY AND FUNCTION OF THE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE RETINA

The Retina Is Composed of Ten Layers or Boundaries. Figure 51-1 shows the functional components of the
retina, which are arranged in layers or boundaries from the outside to the inside, as follows: (1) pigment layer; (2) photoreceptor layer containing rods and cones projecting to the pigment; (3) outer limiting membrane; (4) outer nuclear layer containing the cell bodies of the rods and cones; (5) outer plexiform layer; (6) inner nuclear layer; (7) inner plexiform layer; (8) ganglionic layer; (9) layer of optic nerve fibers; and (10) inner limiting membrane.

After light passes through the lens system of the eye and then through the vitreous humor, it enters the retina from the inside of the eye (see Figure 51-1); that is, it passes first through the ganglion cells and then through the plexiform and nuclear layers before it finally reaches the layer of rods and cones located all the way on the outer edge of the retina. This distance is a thickness of several hundred micrometers; visual acuity is decreased by this passage through such nonhomogeneous tissue. However, in the central

foveal region of the retina, as discussed subsequently, the inside layers are pulled aside to decrease this loss of acuity.

Foveal Region of the Retina and Its Importance in Acute Vision. The fovea is a minute area in the center of the retina, shown in Figure 51-2; it occupies a total area a little more than 1 square millimeter. It is especially capable of acute and detailed vision. The central fovea, only 0.3 millimeter in diameter, is composed almost entirely of cones. These cones have a special structure that aids their detection of detail in the visual image-that is, the foveal cones have especially long and slender bodies, in contradistinction to the much fatter cones located more peripherally in the retina. Also, in the foveal region, the blood vessels, ganglion cells, inner nuclear layer of cells, and plexiform layers are all displaced to one side rather than resting directly on top of the cones, which allows light to pass unimpeded to the cones.

## Rods and Cones Are Essential Components of Photoreceptors. Figure 51-3 is a diagrammatic representation

of the essential components of a photoreceptor (either a rod or a cone). As shown in Figure 51-4, the outer segment of the cone is conical in shape. In general, the rods are nar-
![gu2410682559](gu2410682559.jpg)

Figure 51-3. Schematic drawing of the functional parts of the rods and cones.
rower and longer than the cones, but this is not always the case. In the peripheral portions of the retina, the rods are 2 to 5 micrometers in diameter, whereas the cones are 5 to 8 micrometers in diameter; in the central part of the retina, in the fovea, there are no rods, and the cones are slender and have a diameter of only 1.5 micrometers.

The major functional segments of either a rod or cone are shown in Figure 51-3: (1) the outer segment; (2) the inner segment; (3) the nucleus; and (4) the synaptic body. The light-sensitive photochemical is found in the outer segment. In the case of the rods, this photochemical is rhodopsin; in the cones, it is one of three "color" photochemicals, usually called simply color pigments, that function almost exactly the same as rhodopsin except for differences in spectral sensitivity.

In the outer segments of the rods and cones in Figures 51-3 and 51-4, note the large numbers of discs. Each disc is actually an infolded shelf of cell membrane. There are as many as 1000 discs in each rod or cone.

Both rhodopsin and the color pigments are conjugated proteins. They are incorporated into the membranes of the discs in the form of transmembrane proteins. The concentrations of these photosensitive pigments in the discs are so great that the pigments themselves constitute about $40 \%$ of the entire mass of the outer segment.

The inner segment of the rod or cone contains the usual cytoplasm, with cytoplasmic organelles. Especially important are the mitochondria, which, as explained later, play the important role of providing energy for function of the photoreceptors.

The synaptic body is the portion of the rod or cone that connects with subsequent neuronal cells, the horizontal

and bipolar cells, which represent the next stages in the vision chain.

Pigment Layer of the Retina. The black pigment melanin in the pigment layer prevents light reflection throughout the globe of the eyeball, which is extremely important for clear vision. This pigment performs the same function in the eye as the black coloring inside the bellows of a camera. Without it, light rays would be reflected in all directions in the eyeball and would cause diffuse lighting of the retina rather than the normal contrast between dark and light spots required to form precise images.

The importance of melanin in the pigment layer is well illustrated by its absence in people with albinism (congenital absence of melanin pigment in all parts of their bodies). When a person with albinism enters a bright room, light that impinges on the retina is reflected in all directions inside the eyeball by the unpigmented surfaces of the retina and by the underlying sclera, so a single discrete spot of light that would normally excite only a few rods or cones is reflected everywhere and excites many receptors. Therefore, the visual acuity of people with albinism, even with the best optical correction, is seldom better than 20/100 to 20/200 rather than the normal 20/20 values.

The pigment layer also stores large quantities of vitamin $A$. This vitamin A is exchanged back and forth through the cell membranes of the outer segments of the rods and cones, which are embedded in the pigment. We discuss later that vitamin A is an important precursor of the photosensitive chemicals of the rods and cones.

Blood Supply of the Retina-The Central Retinal Artery and the Choroid. The nutrient blood supply for the internal layers of the retina is derived from the central retinal artery, which enters the eyeball through the center of the optic nerve and then divides to supply the entire inside retinal
surface. Thus, the inner layers of the retina have their own blood supply, independent of the other structures of the eye.

However, the outermost layer of the retina is adherent to the choroid, which is also a highly vascular tissue lying between the retina and the sclera. The outer layers of the retina, especially the outer segments of the rods and cones, depend mainly on diffusion from the choroid blood vessels for their nutrition, especially for their oxygen.

Retinal Detachment. The neural retina occasionally detaches from the pigment epithelium. In some cases, the cause of such detachment is injury to the eyeball that allows fluid or blood to collect between the neural retina and the pigment epithelium. Detachment is occasionally caused by contracture of fine collagenous fibrils in the vitreous humor, which pull areas of the retina toward the interior of the globe.

Partly because of diffusion across the detachment gap, and partly because of the independent blood supply to the neural retina through the retinal artery, the detached retina can resist degeneration for days and can become functional again if it is surgically replaced in its normal relation with the pigment epithelium. If it is not replaced soon, however, the retina will be destroyed and will be unable to function, even after surgical repair.

## PHOTOCHEMISTRY OF VISION

Both rods and cones contain chemicals that decompose on exposure to light and, in the process, excite the nerve fibers leading from the eye. The light-sensitive chemical in the rods is called rhodopsin; the light-sensitive chemicals in the cones, called cone pigments or color pigments, have compositions only slightly different from that of rhodopsin.

In this section, we discuss principally the photochemistry of rhodopsin, but the same principles can be applied to the cone pigments.

## RHODOPSIN-RETINAL VISUAL CYCLE AND EXCITATION OF THE RODS

## Rhodopsin and Its Decomposition by Light Energy.

The outer segment of the rod that projects into the pigment layer of the retina has a concentration of about $40 \%$ of the light-sensitive pigment called rhodopsin, or visual purple. This substance is a combination of the protein scotopsin and the carotenoid pigment retinal (also called "retinene"). Furthermore, the retinal is a particular type called 11-cis retinal. This cis form of retinal is important because only this form can bind with scotopsin to synthesize rhodopsin.

When light energy is absorbed by rhodopsin, the rhodopsin begins to decompose within a very small fraction of a second, as shown at the top of Figure 51-5. The cause of this rapid decomposition is photoactivation of electrons in the retinal portion of the rhodopsin, which leads to instantaneous change of the cis form of retinal into an all-trans form that has the same chemical structure as the cis form but a different physical structure-it is a straight molecule rather than an angulated molecule. Because the three-dimensional orientation of the reactive sites of the

![gu2610682559](gu2610682559.jpg)

all-trans retinal no longer fits with the orientation of the reactive sites on the protein scotopsin, the all-trans retinal begins to pull away from the scotopsin. The immediate product is bathorhodopsin, which is a partially split combination of the all-trans retinal and scotopsin. Bathorhodopsin is extremely unstable and decays in nanoseconds to lumirhodopsin. This product then decays in microseconds to metarhodopsin I, then in about a millisecond to metarhodopsin II, and finally, much more slowly (in seconds), into the completely split products scotopsin and alltrans retinal.

It is the metarhodopsin II, also called activated rhodopsin, that excites electrical changes in the rods, and the rods then transmit the visual image into the central nervous system in the form of optic nerve action potentials, as we discuss later.

Re-Formation of Rhodopsin. The first stage in reformation of rhodopsin, as shown in Figure 51-5, is to reconvert the all-trans retinal into 11-cis retinal. This process requires metabolic energy and is catalyzed by the enzyme retinal isomerase. Once the 11-cis retinal is formed, it automatically recombines with the scotopsin to re-form rhodopsin, which then remains stable until its decomposition is again triggered by absorption of light energy.

Role of Vitamin A for Formation of Rhodopsin. Note in Figure 51-5 that there is a second chemical route whereby all-trans retinal can be converted into 11-cis retinal. This second route is by conversion of the all-trans retinal first into all-trans retinol, which is one form of vitamin A. Then, the all-trans retinol is converted into 11cis retinol under the influence of the enzyme isomerase. Finally, the 11-cis retinol is converted into 11-cis retinal, which combines with scotopsin to form new rhodopsin.

Vitamin A is present both in the cytoplasm of the rods and in the pigment layer of the retina. Therefore, vitamin A is normally always available to form new retinal when needed. Conversely, when there is excess retinal in the retina, it is converted back into vitamin A, thus reducing the amount of light-sensitive pigment in the retina. We shall see later that this interconversion between retinal and vitamin A is especially important in long-term adaptation of the retina to different light intensities.

Night Blindness Due to Vitamin A Deficiency. Night blindness occurs in persons with severe vitamin A deficiency because, without vitamin A, the amounts of retinal and rhodopsin that can be formed are severely depressed. This condition is called night blindness because the amount of light available at night is too little to permit adequate vision in vitamin A-deficient persons.

For night blindness to occur, a person usually must remain on a vitamin A -deficient diet for months, because large quantities of vitamin A are normally stored in the liver and can be made available to the eyes. Once night blindness develops, it can sometimes be reversed in less than 1 hour by intravenous injection of vitamin A.

## Excitation of the Rod When Rhodopsin Is Activated by Light

The Rod Receptor Hyperpolarizes in Response to Light. Exposure of the rod to light causes increased negativity of the intrarod membrane potential, which is a state of hyperpolarization. This is exactly opposite to the decreased negativity (the process of "depolarization") that occurs in almost all other sensory receptors.

How does activation of rhodopsin cause hyperpolarization? The answer is that when rhodopsin decomposes, it decreases the rod membrane conductance for sodium ions in the outer segment of the rod causing hyperpolarization.

Figure 51-6 shows movement of sodium and potassium ions in a complete electrical circuit through the inner and outer segments of the rod. The inner segment continually pumps sodium from inside the rod to the outside, and potassium ions are pumped to the inside of the cell. Potassium ions leak out of the cell through nongated potassium channels that are confined to the inner segment of the rod. As in other cells, this sodium-potassium pump creates a negative potential on the inside of the entire cell. However, the outer segment of the rod, where the photoreceptor discs are located, is entirely different. Here, the rod membrane, in the dark state, is leaky to sodium ions that flow through cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-gated channels. In the dark state, cGMP levels are high, permitting positively charged sodium ions to continually leak back to the inside of the rod and thereby neutralize much of the negativity on the inside of the entire cell. Thus, under normal dark conditions, when the rod is not excited, there is reduced electronegativity inside the membrane of the rod, measuring about -40 millivolts rather than the usual -70 to -80 millivolts found in most sensory receptors.

![gu2710682559](gu2710682559.jpg)

Figure 51-6. A, Sodium flows into a photoreceptor (e.g., a rod) through cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-gated channels. Potassium flows out of the cell through nongated potassium channels. A sodium-potassium pump maintains steady levels of sodium and potassium inside the cell. B, In the dark, cGMP levels are high, and the sodium channels are open. In the light, cGMP levels are reduced and the sodium channels close, causing the cell to hyperpolarize. ATP, Adenosine triphosphate.

When the rhodopsin in the outer segment of the rod is exposed to light, it is activated and begins to decompose. The cGMP-gated sodium channels are then closed, and the outer segment membrane conductance of sodium to the interior of the rod is reduced by a three-step process (Figure 51-7): (1) light is absorbed by the rhodopsin, causing photoactivation of the electrons in the retinal portion, as previously described; (2) the activated rhodopsin stimulates a G protein called transducin, which then activates cGMP phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of cGMP to $5^{\prime}$-GMP; and (3) the reduction in cGMP closes the cGMP-gated sodium channels and reduces the inward sodium current. Sodium ions continue to be pumped outward through the membrane
![gu2810682559](gu2810682559.jpg)

Figure 51-7. Phototransduction in the outer segment of the photoreceptor (rod or cone) membrane. When light hits the photoreceptor (e.g., a rod cell), the light-absorbing retinal portion of rhodopsin is activated. This activation stimulates transducin, a G protein, which then activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase. This enzyme catalyzes the degradation of cGMP into 5'-GMP. The reduction in cGMP then causes closure of the sodium channels, which, in turn, causes hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor.
of the inner segment. Thus, more sodium ions now leave the rod than leak back in. Because they are positive ions, their loss from inside the rod creates increased negativity inside the membrane, and the greater the amount of light energy striking the rod, the greater the electronegativity becomes-that is, the greater is the degree of hyperpolarization. At maximum light intensity, the membrane potential approaches -70 to -80 millivolts, which is near the equilibrium potential for potassium ions across the membrane.

## Duration of the Receptor Potential, and Logarithmic Relation of the Receptor Potential to Light Intensity.

When a sudden pulse of light strikes the retina, the transient hyperpolarization (receptor potential) that occurs in the rods reaches a peak in about 0.3 second and lasts for more than 1 second. In cones, the change occurs four times as fast as in the rods. A visual image impinged on the rods of the retina for only one-millionth of a second can sometimes cause the sensation of seeing the image for longer than 1 second.

Another characteristic of the receptor potential is that it is approximately proportional to the logarithm of the light intensity. This characteristic is exceedingly important because it allows the eye to discriminate light intensities through a range many thousand times as great as would be possible otherwise.

## Mechanism Whereby Rhodopsin Decomposition De-

creases Membrane Sodium Conductance-The Excitation "Cascade." Under optimal conditions, a single photon of light, the smallest possible quantal unit of light energy, can cause a receptor potential of about 1 millivolt in

a rod. Only 30 photons of light will cause half-saturation of the rod. How can such a small amount of light cause such great excitation? The answer is that the photoreceptors have an extremely sensitive chemical cascade that amplifies the stimulatory effects about a millionfold, as follows:

1. The photon activates an electron in the 11-cis retinal portion of the rhodopsin; this activation leads to the formation of metarhodopsin II, which is the active form of rhodopsin, as shown in Figure 51-5.
2. The activated rhodopsin functions as an enzyme to activate many molecules of transducin, a protein present in an inactive form in the membranes of the discs and cell membrane of the rod.
3. The activated transducin activates many more molecules of phosphodiesterase.
4. Activated phosphodiesterase immediately hydrolyzes many molecules of cGMP, thus destroying it. Before being destroyed, the cGMP had been bound with the sodium channel protein of the rod's outer membrane in a way that "splints" it in the open state. However, in light, hydrolyzation of the cGMP by phosphodiesterase removes the splinting and allows the sodium channels to close. Several hundred channels close for each originally activated molecule of rhodopsin. Because the sodium flux through each of these channels has been extremely rapid, flow of more than 1 million sodium ions is blocked by the channel closure before the channel opens again. This diminution of sodium ion flow is what excites the rod, as already discussed.
5. Within about 1 second, another enzyme, rhodopsin kinase, which is always present in the rod, inactivates the activated rhodopsin (metarhodopsin II), and the entire cascade reverses back to the normal state with open sodium channels.
Thus, the rods have developed an important chemical cascade that amplifies the effect of a single photon of light to cause movement of millions of sodium ions. This mechanism explains the extreme sensitivity of the rods under dark conditions.

The cones are about 30 to 300 times less sensitive than the rods, but even this degree of sensitivity allows color vision at any intensity of light greater than extremely dim twilight.

## Photochemistry of Color Vision by the Cones

We previously pointed out that the photochemicals in the cones have almost exactly the same chemical composition as that of rhodopsin in the rods. The only difference is that the protein portions, or the opsins-called photopsins in the cones-are slightly different from the scotopsin of the rods. The retinal portion of all the visual pigments is exactly the same in the cones and rods. The color-sensitive pigments of the cones, therefore, are combinations of retinal and photopsins.

Only one of three types of color pigments is present in each of the different cones, thus making the cones selectively sensitive to different colors-blue, green, or red. These color pigments are called, respectively, blue-sensitive

pigment, green-sensitive pigment, and red-sensitive pigment. The absorption characteristics of the pigments in the three types of cones show peak absorbencies at light wavelengths of 445,535 , and 570 nanometers, respectively. These wavelengths are also the wavelengths for peak light sensitivity for each type of cone, which begins to explain how the retina differentiates the colors. The approximate absorption curves for these three pigments are shown in Figure 51-8. Also shown is the absorption curve for the rhodopsin of the rods, with a peak at 505 nanometers.

## AUTOMATIC REGULATION OF RETINAL SENSITIVITY—LIGHT AND DARK ADAPTATION

If a person has been in bright light for hours, large portions of the photochemicals in both the rods and the cones will have been reduced to retinal and opsins. Furthermore, much of the retinal of both the rods and the cones will have been converted into vitamin A. Because of these two effects, the concentrations of the photosensitive chemicals remaining in the rods and cones are considerably reduced, and the sensitivity of the eye to light is correspondingly reduced. This process is called light adaptation.

Conversely, if a person remains in darkness for a long time, the retinal and opsins in the rods and cones are converted back into the light-sensitive pigments. Furthermore, vitamin A is converted back into retinal to increase lightsensitive pigments, the final limit being determined by the amount of opsins in the rods and cones to combine with the retinal. This process is called dark adaptation.

Figure 51-9 shows the course of dark adaptation when a person is exposed to total darkness after having been exposed to bright light for several hours. Note that the sensitivity of the retina is very low on first entering the darkness, but within 1 minute, the sensitivity has already increased 10 -fold-that is, the retina can respond to light

![gu3010682559](gu3010682559.jpg)

Figure 51-9. Dark adaptation demonstrating the relation of cone adaptation to rod adaptation.
of one-tenth that of the previously required intensity. At the end of 20 minutes, the sensitivity has increased about 6000 -fold and, at the end of 40 minutes, it has increased about 25,000 -fold.

The resulting curve of Figure 51-9 is called the dark adaptation curve. Note the inflection in the curve. The early portion of the curve is caused by adaptation of the cones because all the chemical events of vision, including adaptation, occur about four times as rapidly in cones as in rods. However, the cones do not achieve anywhere near the same degree of sensitivity change in darkness as the rods. Therefore, despite rapid adaptation, the cones cease adapting after only a few minutes, whereas the slowly adapting rods continue to adapt for many minutes and even hours, with their sensitivity increasing tremendously. Additional sensitivity of the rods is caused by neuronal signal convergence of 100 or more rods onto a single ganglion cell in the retina; these rods summate to increase their sensitivity, as discussed later in the chapter.

Other Mechanisms of Light and Dark Adaptation. In addition to adaptation caused by changes in concentrations of rhodopsin or color photochemicals, the eye has two other mechanisms for light and dark adaptation. The first is a change in pupillary size, as discussed in Chapter 50. This change can cause adaptation of approximately 30fold within a fraction of a second because of changes in the amount of light allowed through the pupillary opening.

The other mechanism is neural adaptation, involving the neurons in the successive stages of the visual chain in the retina and in the brain. That is, when light intensity first increases, the signals transmitted by the bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and ganglion cells are all intense. However, most of these signals decrease rapidly at different stages of transmission in the neural circuit. Although the degree of adaptation is only a fewfold rather than the many thousandfold that occurs during adaptation of the photochemical system, neural adaptation occurs in a fraction of a second, in contrast to the many minutes to hours required for full adaptation by the photochemicals.

Value of Light and Dark Adaptation in Vision. Between the limits of maximal dark adaptation and maximal light adaptation, the eye can change its sensitivity to light as much as 500,000 to 1 million times, with the sensitivity automatically adjusting to changes in illumination.

Because registration of images by the retina requires detection of both dark and light spots in the image, it is essential that the sensitivity of the retina always be adjusted so that the receptors respond to the lighter areas but not to the darker areas. An example of maladjustment of retinal adaptation occurs when a person leaves a movie theater and enters the bright sunlight. Then, even the dark spots in the images seem exceedingly bright, and as a consequence, the entire visual image is bleached, with little contrast among its different parts. This poor vision remains until the retina has adapted sufficiently so that the darker areas of the image no longer stimulate the receptors excessively.

Conversely, when a person first enters darkness, the sensitivity of the retina is usually so slight that even the light spots in the image cannot excite the retina. After dark adaptation, the light spots begin to register. As an example of the extremes of light and dark adaptation, the intensity of sunlight is about 10 billion times that of starlight, yet the eye can function both in bright sunlight after light adaptation and in starlight after dark adaptation.

## COLOR VISION

From the preceding sections, we learned that different cones are sensitive to different colors of light. This section is a discussion of the mechanisms whereby the retina detects the different gradations of color in the visual spectrum.

## TRICOLOR MECHANISM OF COLOR DETECTION

All theories of color vision are based on the well-known observation that the human eye can detect almost all gradations of colors when only red, green, and blue monochromatic lights are appropriately mixed in different combinations.

Spectral Sensitivities of the Three Types of Cones. On the basis of color vision tests, the spectral sensitivities of the three types of cones in humans have proved to be essentially the same as the light absorption curves for the three types of pigment found in the cones. These curves are shown in Figure 51-8 and slightly differently in Figure 51-10. They can explain most of the phenomena of color vision.

Interpretation of Color in the Nervous System. In Figure 51-10, one can see that an orange monochromatic light with a wavelength of 580 nanometers stimulates the red cones to a value of about $99(99 \%$ of the peak stimulation at optimum wavelength); it stimulates the green cones to a value of about 42 , but the blue cones are not

![gu3110682559](gu3110682559.jpg)

Figure 51-10. Demonstration of the degree of stimulation of the different color-sensitive cones by monochromatic lights of four colorsblue, green, yellow, and orange.
stimulated at all. Thus, the ratios of stimulation of the three types of cones in this case are 99:42:0. The nervous system interprets this set of ratios as the sensation of orange. Conversely, a monochromatic blue light with a wavelength of 450 nanometers stimulates the red cones to a stimulus value of 0 , the green cones to a value of 0 , and the blue cones to a value of 97 . This set of ratios-0:0:97is interpreted by the nervous system as blue. Likewise, ratios of 83:83:0 are interpreted as yellow, and ratios of 31:67:36 are interpreted as green.

Perception of White Light. About equal stimulation of all the red, green, and blue cones gives one the sensation of seeing white. Yet, there is no single wavelength of light corresponding to white; instead, white is a combination of all the wavelengths of the spectrum. Furthermore, the perception of white can be achieved by stimulating the retina with a proper combination of only three chosen colors that stimulate the respective types of cones about equally.

## Color Blindness

Red-Green Color Blindness. When a single group of color-receptive cones is missing from the eye, the person is unable to distinguish some colors from others. For example, one can see in Figure 51-10 that green, yellow, orange, and red colors, which are the colors between the wavelengths of 525 and 675 nanometers, are normally distinguished from one another by the red and green cones. If either of these two cones is missing, the person cannot use this mechanism for distinguishing these four colors; the person is especially unable to distinguish red from green and is therefore said to have red-green color blindness.

A person with loss of red cones is called a protanope; the overall visual spectrum is noticeably shortened at the long wavelength end because of a lack of the red cones. A colorblind person who lacks green cones is called a deuteranope; this person has a perfectly normal visual spectral width because red cones are available to detect the long wavelength red color. However, a deuteranope can only distinguish 2 or 3 different hues, whereas somebody with normal vision sees 7 unique hues.

Red-green color blindness is a genetic disorder that occurs almost exclusively in males. That is, genes in the female X chromosome code for the respective cones. Yet, color blindness almost never occurs in females because at least one of the two X chromosomes almost always has a normal gene for each type of cone. Because the male has only one X chromosome, a missing gene can lead to color blindness.

Because the X chromosome in the male is always inherited from the mother, never from the father, color blindness is passed from mother to son, and the mother is said to be a color blindness carrier. About $8 \%$ of all women are color blindness carriers.

Blue Weakness. Only rarely are blue cones missing, although sometimes they are underrepresented in a genetically inherited condition called blue weakness.

Color Test Charts. A rapid method for determining color blindness is based on the use of spot charts such as those shown in Figure 51-11. These charts are arranged with a mixture of spots of several different colors. In the top chart, a person with normal color vision reads " 74 ," whereas a red-green color-blind person reads " 21 ." In the bottom chart, a person with normal color vision reads " 42 ," whereas a red-blind person reads " 2 ," and a greenblind person reads " 4 ."

## NEURAL FUNCTION OF THE RETINA

Figure 51-12 presents the essentials of the retina's neural connections, showing the circuit in the peripheral retina at the left and the circuit in the foveal retina at the right. The different neuronal cell types are as follows:

1. The photoreceptors-the rods and cones-which transmit signals to the outer plexiform layer, where they synapse with bipolar cells and horizontal cells
2. The horizontal cells, which transmit signals horizontally in the outer plexiform layer from the rods and cones to bipolar cells
3. The bipolar cells, which transmit signals vertically from the rods, cones, and horizontal cells to the inner plexiform layer, where they synapse with ganglion cells and amacrine cells
4. The amacrine cells, which transmit signals in two directions, either directly from bipolar cells to ganglion cells or horizontally within the inner plexiform layer from axons of the bipolar cells to dendrites of the ganglion cells or to other amacrine cells
5. The ganglion cells, which transmit output signals from the retina through the optic nerve into the brain
A sixth type of neuronal cell in the retina, which is not very prominent and is not shown in the figure, is the interplexiform cell. This type of cell transmits signals in the retrograde direction from the inner plexiform layer to the outer plexiform layer. These signals are inhibitory and are believed to control lateral spread of visual signals by the horizontal cells in the outer plexiform layer. Their role may be to help control the degree of contrast in the visual image.

Tests for color-blindness. Handaya, Tokyo: Hongo Harukicho, 1917. Note that tests for color blindness cannot be conducted with this material. For accurate testing, the original plates should be used.)

The Visual Pathway From the Cones to the Ganglion Cells Functions Differently From the Rod Pathway. As is true for many of our other sensory systems, the retina has both an old type of vision based on rod vision and a new type of vision based on cone vision. The neurons and nerve fibers that conduct the visual signals for cone vision are considerably larger than those that conduct the visual signals for rod vision, and the signals are conducted to the
![gu3310682559](gu3310682559.jpg)

Figure 51-12. Neural organization of the retina, with the peripheral area to the left and the foveal area to the right.
brain two to five times as rapidly. Also, the circuitry for the two systems is slightly different.

To the right in Figure 51-12 is the visual pathway from the foveal portion of the retina, representing the new, fast cone system. This illustration shows three neurons in the direct pathway: (1) cones; (2) bipolar cells; and (3) ganglion cells. In addition, horizontal cells transmit inhibitory signals laterally in the outer plexiform layer, and amacrine cells transmit signals laterally in the inner plexiform layer.

To the left in Figure 51-12 are the neural connections for the peripheral retina, where both rods and cones are present. Three bipolar cells are shown; the middle of these connects only to rods, representing the type of visual system present in many lower animals. The output from the bipolar cell passes only to amacrine cells, which relay the signals to the ganglion cells. Thus, for pure rod vision, there are four neurons in the direct visual pathway: (1) rods; (2) bipolar cells; (3) amacrine cells; and (4) ganglion cells. In addition, horizontal and amacrine cells provide lateral connectivity.

The other two bipolar cells shown in the peripheral retinal circuitry of Figure 51-12 connect with both rods and cones; the outputs of these bipolar cells pass both directly to ganglion cells and by way of amacrine cells.

Neurotransmitters Released by Retinal Neurons. Not all the neurotransmitter chemical substances used for synaptic transmission in the retina have been entirely delineated. However, both the rods and the cones release glutamate at their synapses with the bipolar cells.

Histological and pharmacological studies have proven the existence of many types of amacrine cells that secrete at least eight types of transmitter substances, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, dopamine, acetylcholine, and indolamine, all of which normally function as inhibitory transmitters. The transmitters of the

bipolar, horizontal, and interplexiform cells are unclear, but at least some of the horizontal cells release inhibitory transmitters.

Transmission of Most Signals Occurs in the Retinal Neurons by Electrotonic Conduction, Not by Action Potentials. The only retinal neurons that always transmit visual signals via action potentials are the ganglion cells, and they send their signals all the way to the brain through the optic nerve. Occasionally, action potentials have also been recorded in amacrine cells, although the importance of these action potentials is questionable. Otherwise, all the retinal neurons conduct their visual signals by electrotonic conduction, not by action potentials.

Electrotonic conduction means direct flow of electric current, not action potentials, in the neuronal cytoplasm and nerve axons from the point of excitation all the way to the output synapses. Even in the rods and cones, conduction from their outer segments to the synaptic bodies is by electrotonic conduction. That is, when hyperpolarization occurs in response to light in the outer segment of a rod or a cone, almost the same degree of hyperpolarization is conducted by direct electric current flow in the cytoplasm all the way to the synaptic body, and no action potential is required. Then, when the transmitter from a rod or cone stimulates a bipolar cell or horizontal cell, once again the signal is transmitted from the input to the output by direct electric current flow, not by action potentials.

The importance of electrotonic conduction is that it allows graded conduction of signal strength. Thus, for the rods and cones, the strength of the hyperpolarizing output signal is directly related to the intensity of illumination; the signal is not all or none, as would be the case for each action potential.

## Lateral Inhibition to Enhance Visual Contrast-Function of the Horizontal Cells

The horizontal cells, shown in Figure 51-12, connect laterally between the synaptic bodies of the rods and cones and with the dendrites of the bipolar cells. The outputs of the horizontal cells are always inhibitory. Therefore, this lateral connection provides the same phenomenon of lateral inhibition that is important in other sensory sys-tems-that is, helping to ensure transmission of visual patterns with proper visual contrast. This phenomenon is demonstrated in Figure 51-13, which shows a minute spot of light focused on the retina. The visual pathway from the central most area where the light strikes is excited, whereas an area to the side is inhibited. In other words, instead of the excitatory signal spreading widely in the retina because of spreading dendritic and axonal trees in the plexiform layers, transmission through the horizontal cells puts a stop to this spread by providing lateral inhibition in the surrounding areas. This process is essential to allow high visual accuracy in transmitting contrast borders in the visual image.
![gu3410682559](gu3410682559.jpg)

Figure 51-13. Excitation and inhibition of a retinal area caused by a small beam of light, demonstrating the principle of lateral inhibition.

Some of the amacrine cells probably provide additional lateral inhibition and further enhancement of visual contrast in the inner plexiform layer of the retina as well.

## Depolarizing and Hyperpolarizing Bipolar Cells

Two types of bipolar cells provide opposing excitatory and inhibitory signals in the visual pathway: (1) the depolarizing bipolar cell; and (2) the hyperpolarizing bipolar cell. That is, some bipolar cells depolarize when the rods and cones are excited, and others hyperpolarize.

There are two possible explanations for this difference. One explanation is that the two bipolar cells are of entirely different types, with one responding by depolarizing in response to the glutamate neurotransmitter released by the rods and cones and the other responding by hyperpolarizing. The other possibility is that one of the bipolar cells receives direct excitation from the rods and cones, whereas the other receives its signal indirectly through a horizontal cell. Because the horizontal cell is an inhibitory cell, this would reverse the polarity of the electrical response.

Regardless of the mechanism for the two types of bipolar responses, the importance of this phenomenon is that it allows half the bipolar cells to transmit positive signals and the other half to transmit negative signals. We shall see later that both positive and negative signals are used in transmitting visual information to the brain.

Another important aspect of this reciprocal relation between depolarizing and hyperpolarizing bipolar cells is that it provides a second mechanism for lateral inhibition, in addition to the horizontal cell mechanism. Because depolarizing and hyperpolarizing bipolar cells lie immediately against each other, this provides a mechanism for separating contrast borders in the visual image, even when the border lies exactly between two adjacent

photoreceptors. In contrast, the horizontal cell mechanism for lateral inhibition operates over a much greater distance.

## Amacrine Cells and Their Functions

About 30 types of amacrine cells have been identified by morphological or histochemical means. The functions of about half a dozen types of amacrine cells have been characterized, and all of them are different:

- One type of amacrine cell is part of the direct pathway for rod vision-that is, from rod to bipolar cells to amacrine cells to ganglion cells.
- Another type of amacrine cell responds strongly at the onset of a continuing visual signal, but the response dies rapidly.
- Other amacrine cells respond strongly at the offset of visual signals but, again, the response fades quickly.
- Still other amacrine cells respond when a light is turned either on or off, signaling simply a change in illumination, irrespective of direction.
- Another type of amacrine cell responds to movement of a spot across the retina in a specific direction; therefore, these amacrine cells are said to be directionally sensitive.
In a sense, many or most amacrine cells are interneurons that help analyze visual signals before they ever leave the retina.


## GANGLION CELLS AND OPTIC NERVE FIBERS

Each retina contains about 100 million rods and 3 million cones, yet the number of ganglion cells is only about 1.6 million. Thus, an average of 60 rods and 2 cones converge on each ganglion cell and the optic nerve fiber leading from the ganglion cell to the brain.

However, major differences exist between the peripheral retina and the central retina. As one approaches the fovea, fewer rods and cones converge on each optic fiber, and the rods and cones also become more slender. These effects progressively increase the acuity of vision in the central retina. In the central fovea, there are only slender cones-about 35,000 of them-and no rods. Also, the number of optic nerve fibers leading from this part of the retina is almost exactly equal to the number of cones, as shown at the right in Figure 51-12. This phenomenon explains the high degree of visual acuity in the central retina in comparison with the much poorer acuity peripherally.

Another difference between the peripheral and central portions of the retina is the much greater sensitivity of the peripheral retina to weak light, which occurs partly because rods are 30 to 300 times more sensitive to light than cones. However, this greater sensitivity is further magnified by the fact that as many as 200 rods converge on a single optic nerve fiber in the more peripheral portions of the retina, so signals from the rods summate to
give even more intense stimulation of the peripheral ganglion cells and their optic nerve fibers.

## Retinal Ganglion Cells and Their Respective Fields

W, X, and Y Cells. Early studies in cats described three distinct types of retinal ganglion cells, designated W, X, and Y cells, based on their differences in structure and function.

The W cells transmit signals in their optic nerve fibers at a slow velocity and receive most of their excitation from rods, transmitted via small bipolar cells and amacrine cells. They have broad fields in the peripheral retina, are sensitive for detecting directional movement in the field of vision, and are probably important for crude rod vision under dark conditions.

The X cells have small fields because their dendrites do not spread widely in the retina, and thus the signals of X cells represent discrete retinal locations and transmit fine details of visual images. In addition, because every X cell receives input from at least one cone, X cell transmission is probably responsible for color vision.

The Y cells are the largest of all and transmit signals to the brain at $50 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$ or faster. Because they have broad dendritic fields, signals are picked up by these cells from widespread retinal areas. The Y cells respond to rapid changes in visual images and apprise the central nervous system almost instantaneously when a new visual event occurs anywhere in the visual field, but they do not specify the location of the event with great accuracy, other than to give clues that make the eyes move toward the exciting vision.
$\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{M}$ Cells. In primates, a different classification of retinal ganglion cells is used, and as many as 20 types of retinal ganglion cells have been described, each responding to a different feature of the visual scene. Some cells respond best to specific directions of motion or orientations, whereas others respond to fine details, increases or decreases in light, or particular colors. The two general classes of retinal ganglion cells that have been studied most extensively in primates, including humans, are designated as magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) cells.

The P cells (also known as beta cells or, in the central retina, as midget ganglion cells) project to the parvocellular (small cells) layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. The M cells (also called alpha or parasol cells) project to the magnocellular (large cells) layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus, which, in turn, relays information from the optic tract to the visual cortex, as discussed in Chapter 52. The main differences between P and M cells are as follows:

1. The receptive fields for P cells are much smaller than for M cells.
2. P-cell axons conduct impulses much more slowly than do M cells.

3. The responses of P cells to stimuli, especially color stimuli, can be sustained, whereas the responses of $M$ cells are much more transient.
4. The P cells are generally sensitive to the color of a stimulus, whereas $M$ cells are not sensitive to color stimuli.
5. The $M$ cells are much more sensitive than are $P$ cells to low-contrast, black and white stimuli.
The main functions of $M$ and $P$ cells are obvious from their differences: The P cells are highly sensitive to visual signals that relate to fine details and to different colors but are relatively insensitive to low-contrast signals, whereas the $M$ cells are highly sensitive to low-contrast stimuli and to rapid movement visual signals.

A third type of photosensitive retinal ganglion cell has been described that contains its own photopigment, melanopsin. Much less is known about this cell type, but these cells appear to send signals mainly to nonvisual areas of the brain, particularly the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, the master circadian pacemaker. Presumably, these signals help control circadian rhythms that synchronize physiological changes with night and day.

## EXCITATION OF THE GANGLION CELLS

Spontaneous, Continuous Action Potentials in the Ganglion Cells. It is from the ganglion cells that the long fibers of the optic nerve lead into the brain. Because of the distance involved, the electrotonic method of conduction employed in the rods, cones, and bipolar cells in the retina is no longer appropriate; therefore, ganglion cells transmit their signals by means of repetitive action potentials instead. Furthermore, even when unstimulated, they still transmit continuous impulses at rates varying between 5 and 40 per second. The visual signals, in turn, are superimposed onto this background ganglion cell firing.

Transmission of Changes in Light Intensity-The OnOff Response. As noted previously, many ganglion cells are specifically excited by changes in light intensity, demonstrated by the records of nerve impulses in Figure 5114. The upper panel shows rapid impulses for a fraction of a second when a light is first turned on, but these impulses decrease rapidly in the next fraction of a second. The lower tracing is from a ganglion cell located laterally to the spot of light; this cell is markedly inhibited when the light is turned on because of lateral inhibition. Then, when the light is turned off, opposite effects occur. The opposite directions of these responses to light are caused, respectively, by the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing bipolar cells, and the transient nature of the responses is probably at least partly generated by the amacrine cells, many of which have similar transient responses themselves.

This capability of the eyes to detect changes in light intensity is strongly developed in the peripheral retina and the central retina. For example, a minute gnat flying across the field of vision is instantaneously detected.
![gu3510682559](gu3510682559.jpg)

The ganglion cell in this area is inhibited by the mechanism of lateral inhibition. (Modified from Granit R: Receptors and Sensory Perception: A Discussion of Aims, Means, and Results of Electrophysiological Research into the Process of Reception. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1955.)

Conversely, the same gnat sitting quietly remains below the threshold of visual detection.

## Transmission of Signals Depicting Contrasts in the Visual Scene-The Role of Lateral Inhibition

Many ganglion cells respond mainly to contrast borders in the scene, which seems to be the major means whereby the pattern of a scene is transmitted to the brain. When flat light is applied to the entire retina, and all the photoreceptors are stimulated equally by the incident light, the contrast type of ganglion cell is neither stimulated nor inhibited. The reason for this is that signals transmitted directly from the photoreceptors through depolarizing bipolar cells are excitatory, whereas the signals transmitted laterally through hyperpolarizing bipolar cells, as well as through horizontal cells, are mainly inhibitory. Thus, the direct excitatory signal through one pathway is likely to be neutralized by inhibitory signals through lateral pathways. One circuit for this process is demonstrated in Figure 51-15, which shows three photoreceptors at the top of the illustration. The central receptor excites a depolarizing bipolar cell. The two receptors on each side are connected to the same bipolar cell through inhibitory horizontal cells that neutralize the direct excitatory signal if all three receptors are stimulated simultaneously by light.

Now, let us examine what happens when a contrast border occurs in the visual scene. Referring again to Figure 51-15, assume that the central photoreceptor is stimulated by a bright spot of light while one of the two lateral receptors is in the dark. The bright spot of light excites the direct pathway through the bipolar cell. The fact that one of the lateral photoreceptors is in the dark causes one of the horizontal cells to remain unstimulated. Therefore, this cell does not inhibit the bipolar cell, which allows extra excitation of the bipolar cell. Thus, where visual contrasts occur, the signals through the direct and lateral pathways accentuate one another.

In summary, the mechanism of lateral inhibition functions in the eye in the same way that it functions in most other sensory systems-to provide contrast detection and enhancement.

![gu3610682559](gu3610682559.jpg)

Figure 51-15. Typical arrangement of rods, horizontal cells (H), a bipolar cell (B), and a ganglion cell (G) in the retina, showing excitation at the synapses between the rods and the bipolar cell and horizontal cells but inhibition from the horizontal cells to the bipolar cell.

## Transmission of Color Signals by the Ganglion Cells

A single ganglion cell may be stimulated by several or only a few cones. When all three types of cones-the red, blue, and green types-stimulate the same ganglion cell, the signal transmitted through the ganglion cell is the same for any color of the spectrum. Therefore, the signal from the ganglion cell plays no role in the detection of different colors. Instead, it is a "white" signal.

Conversely, some of the ganglion cells are excited by only one color type of cone but are inhibited by a second type. For example, this mechanism frequently occurs for the red and green cones, with red causing excitation and green causing inhibition, or vice versa.

The same type of reciprocal effect occurs between blue cones on the one hand and a combination of red and green cones (both of which are excited by yellow) on the other hand, giving a reciprocal excitation-inhibition relation between the blue and yellow colors.

The mechanism of this opposing effect of colors is as follows. One color type of cone excites the ganglion cell by
the direct excitatory route through a depolarizing bipolar cell, whereas the other color type inhibits the ganglion cell by the indirect inhibitory route through a hyperpolarizing bipolar cell.

The importance of these color contrast mechanisms is that they represent a means whereby the retina begins to differentiate colors. Thus, each color contrast type of ganglion cell is excited by one color but inhibited by the "opponent" color. Therefore, color analysis begins in the retina and is not entirely a function of the brain.

# The Eye: III. Central Neurophysiology of Vision 

## VISUAL PATHWAYS

Figure 52-1 shows the principal visual pathways from the two retinas to the visual cortex. The visual nerve signals leave the retinas through the optic nerves. At the optic chiasm, the optic nerve fibers from the nasal halves of the retinas cross to the opposite sides, where they join the fibers from the opposite temporal retinas to form the optic tracts. The fibers of each optic tract then synapse in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and, from there, geniculocalcarine fibers pass via the optic radiation (also called the geniculocalcarine tract) to the primary visual cortex in the calcarine fissure area of the medial occipital lobe.

Visual fibers also pass to several older areas of the brain: (1) from the optic tracts to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, presumably to control circadian rhythms that synchronize various physiological changes of the body with night and day; (2) into the pretectal nuclei in the midbrain to elicit reflex movements of the eyes to focus on objects of importance and activate the pupillary

light reflex; (3) into the superior colliculus to control rapid directional movements of the two eyes; and (4) into the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and surrounding basal regions of the brain, presumably to help control some of the body's behavioral functions.

Thus, the visual pathways can be divided roughly into an old system to the midbrain and base of the forebrain and a new system for direct transmission of visual signals into the visual cortex located in the occipital lobes. In humans, the new system is responsible for perception of virtually all aspects of visual form, colors, and other conscious vision. In many primitive animals, however, even visual form is detected by the older system, using the superior colliculus in the same manner that the visual cortex is used in mammals.

## FUNCTION OF THE DORSAL LATERAL GENICULATE NUCLEUS OF THE THALAMUS

The optic nerve fibers of the new visual system terminate in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, located at the dorsal end of the thalamus and also called the lateral geniculate body, as shown in Figure 52-1. The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus serves two principal functions. First, it relays visual information from the optic tract to the visual cortex by way of the optic radiation. This relay function is so accurate that there is exact point to point transmission with a high degree of spatial fidelity all the way from the retina to the visual cortex.

After passing the optic chiasm, half the fibers in each optic tract are derived from one eye and half are derived from the other eye, representing corresponding points on the two retinas. However, the signals from the two eyes are kept apart in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. This nucleus is composed of six nuclear layers. Layers II, III, and V (from ventral to dorsal) receive signals from the lateral half of the ipsilateral retina, whereas layers I, IV, and VI receive signals from the medial half of the retina of the opposite eye. The respective retinal areas of the two eyes connect with neurons that are superimposed over one another in the paired layers, and similar parallel transmission is preserved all the way to the visual cortex.

The second major function of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is to "gate" the transmission of signals to the visual cortex-that is, to control how much of the signal is allowed to pass to the cortex. The nucleus receives gating control signals from two major sources: (1) corticofugal fibers returning in a backward direction from the primary visual cortex to the lateral geniculate nucleus; and (2) reticular areas of the mesencephalon. Both of these sources are inhibitory and, when stimulated, can turn off transmission through selected portions of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Both of these gating circuits help highlight the visual information that is allowed to pass.

Finally, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is divided in another way:

1. Layers I and II are called magnocellular layers because they contain large neurons. These neurons receive their input almost entirely from the large type $M$ retinal ganglion cells. This magnocellular system provides a rapidly conducting pathway to the visual cortex. However, this system is color blind, transmitting only black-and-white information. Also, its point to point transmission is poor because there are not many M ganglion cells, and their dendrites spread widely in the retina.
2. Layers III through VI are called parvocellular layers because they contain large numbers of small to medium-sized neurons. These neurons receive their input almost entirely from the type $P$ retinal ganglion cells that transmit color and convey accurate point to point spatial information, but at only a moderate velocity of conduction rather than at high velocity.

## ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTION OF THE VISUAL CORTEX

Figures 52-2 and 52-3 show the visual cortex, which is located primarily on the medial aspect of the occipital lobes. Like the cortical representations of the other sensory systems, the visual cortex is divided into a primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas.

Primary Visual Cortex. The primary visual cortex (see Figure 52-2) lies in the calcarine fissure area, extending forward from the occipital pole on the medial aspect of each occipital cortex. This area is the terminus of direct visual signals from the eyes. Signals from the macular area of the retina terminate near the occipital pole, as shown in Figure 52-2, whereas signals from the more peripheral retina terminate at or in concentric half-circles anterior to the pole but still along the calcarine fissure on the medial occipital lobe. The upper portion of the retina is represented superiorly, and the lower portion is represented inferiorly.

Note in the figure the large area that represents the macula. It is to this region that the retinal fovea transmits its signals. The fovea is responsible for the highest

![gu3910682559](gu3910682559.jpg)

Figure 52-3. Transmission of visual signals from the primary visual cortex into secondary visual areas on the lateral surfaces of the occipital and parietal cortices. Note that the signals representing form, third-dimensional (3D) position, and motion are transmitted mainly into the superior portions of the occipital lobe and posterior portions of the parietal lobe. By contrast, the signals for visual detail and color are transmitted mainly into the anteroventral portion of the occipital lobe and the ventral portion of the posterior temporal lobe.
degree of visual acuity. Based on retinal area, the fovea has several hundred times as much representation in the primary visual cortex as do the most peripheral portions of the retina.

The primary visual cortex is also called visual area I or the striate cortex because this area has a grossly striated appearance.

Secondary Visual Areas of the Cortex. The secondary visual areas, also called visual association areas, lie lateral, anterior, superior, and inferior to the primary visual cortex. Most of these areas also fold outward over the lateral surfaces of the occipital and parietal cortex, as shown in Figure 52-3. Secondary signals are transmitted to these areas for analysis of visual meanings. For example, on all

Fast, Black and White Very Accurate, Color
Figure 52-4. Six layers of the primary visual cortex. The connections shown on the left side of the figure originate in the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and transmit rapidly changing black and white visual signals. The pathways to the right originate in the parvocellular layers (layers III-VI) of the LGN; they transmit signals that depict accurate spatial detail, as well as color. Note especially the areas of the visual cortex called color blobs, which are necessary for detection of color.
sides of the primary visual cortex is Brodmann's area 18 (see Figure 52-3), which is where virtually all signals from the primary visual cortex pass next. Therefore, Brodmann's area 18 is called visual area II, or simply V-2. The other, more distant secondary visual areas have specific designations-V-3, V-4, and so forth-up to more than a dozen areas. The importance of all these areas is that various aspects of the visual image are progressively dissected and analyzed.

## THE PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX HAS SIX MAJOR LAYERS

Like almost all other portions of the cerebral cortex, the primary visual cortex has six distinct layers, as shown in Figure 52-4. Also, as is true for the other sensory systems, the geniculocalcarine fibers terminate mainly in layer IV, but this layer is also organized into subdivisions. The rapidly conducted signals from the M retinal ganglion cells terminate in layer IVc $\alpha$, and from there they are relayed vertically, both outward toward the cortical surface and inward toward deeper levels.

The visual signals from the medium-sized optic nerve fibers, derived from the P ganglion cells in the retina, also
terminate in layer IV, but at points different from the M signals. They terminate in layers IVa and IVc $\beta$, the shallowest and deepest portions of layer IV, shown to the right in Figure 52-4. From there, these signals are transmitted vertically both toward the surface of the cortex and to deeper layers. It is these P ganglion pathways that transmit the accurate point to point type of vision, as well as color vision.

Vertical Neuronal Columns in the Visual Cortex. The visual cortex is organized structurally into several million vertical columns of neuronal cells, with each column having a diameter of 30 to 50 micrometers. The same vertical columnar organization is found throughout the cerebral cortex for the other senses as well (and also in the motor and analytical cortical regions). Each column represents a functional unit. One can roughly calculate that each of the visual vertical columns has perhaps 1000 or more neurons.

After the optic signals terminate in layer IV, they are further processed as they spread outward and inward along each vertical column unit. This processing is believed to decipher separate bits of visual information at successive stations along the pathway. The signals that pass outward to layers I, II, and III eventually transmit signals for short distances laterally in the cortex. The signals that pass inward to layers V and VI excite neurons that transmit signals over much greater distances.
"Color Blobs" in the Visual Cortex. Interspersed among the primary visual columns, as well as among the columns of some of the secondary visual areas, are special columnlike areas called color blobs. They receive lateral signals from adjacent visual columns and are activated specifically by color signals. Therefore, these blobs are presumably the primary areas for deciphering color.

Interaction of Visual Signals From the Two Separate Eyes. Recall that visual signals from the two separate eyes are relayed through separate neuronal layers in the lateral geniculate nucleus. These signals remain separated from each other when they arrive in layer IV of the primary visual cortex. In fact, layer IV is interlaced with stripes of neuronal columns, with each stripe about 0.5 millimeter wide; the signals from one eye enter the columns of every other stripe, alternating with signals from the second eye. This cortical area deciphers whether the respective areas of the two visual images from the two separate eyes are "in register" with each other-that is, whether corresponding points from the two retinas fit with each other. In turn, the deciphered information is used to adjust the directional gaze of the separate eyes so that they will fuse with each other (i.e., be brought into "register"). The information observed about degree of register of images from the two eyes also allows a person to distinguish the distance of objects by the mechanism of stereopsis.

Two Major Pathways for Analysis of Visual Information: (1) The Fast "Position" and "Motion" Pathway and (2) the Accurate Color Pathway. Figure 52-3 shows that after leaving the primary visual cortex, the visual information is analyzed in two major pathways in the secondary visual areas.

1. Analysis of Third-Dimensional Position, Gross Form, and Motion of Objects. One of the analytical pathways, demonstrated in Figure 52-3 by the black arrows, analyzes the third-dimensional positions of visual objects in the space around the body. This pathway also analyzes the gross physical form of the visual scene, as well as motion in the scene. This pathway reveals where every object is during each instant and whether it is moving. After leaving the primary visual cortex, the signals flow generally into the posterior midtemporal area and upward into the broad occipitoparietal cortex. At the anterior border of the parietal cortex, the signals overlap with signals from the posterior somatic association areas that analyze threedimensional aspects of somatosensory signals. The signals transmitted in this position-form-motion pathway are mainly from the large M optic nerve fibers of the retinal $M$ ganglion cells, transmitting rapid signals but depicting only black and white with no color.
2. Analysis of Visual Detail and Color. The red arrows in Figure 52-3, passing from the primary visual cortex into secondary visual areas of the inferior, ventral, and medial regions of the occipital and temporal cortex, show the principal pathway for analysis of visual detail. Separate portions of this pathway specifically dissect out color as well. Therefore, this pathway is concerned with such visual feats as recognizing letters, reading, determining the texture of surfaces, determining detailed colors of objects, and deciphering from all this information what the object is and what it means.

## NEURONAL PATTERNS OF STIMULATION DURING ANALYSIS OF VISUAL IMAGES

Analysis of Contrasts in Visual Images. If a person looks at a blank wall, only a few neurons in the primary visual cortex will be stimulated, regardless of whether the illumination of the wall is bright or weak. Therefore, what does the primary visual cortex detect? To answer this question, let us now place on the wall a large solid cross, as shown to the left in Figure 52-5. To the right is shown the spatial pattern of the most excited neurons in the visual cortex. Note that the areas of maximum excitation occur along the sharp borders of the visual pattern. Thus, the visual signal in the primary visual cortex is concerned mainly with contrasts in the visual scene, rather than with noncontrasting areas. We noted in Chapter 51 that this is also true of most of the retinal ganglion because equally
![gu4110682559](gu4110682559.jpg)

Figure 52-5. Pattern of excitation that occurs in the visual cortex in response to a retinal image of a dark cross.
stimulated adjacent retinal receptors mutually inhibit one another. However, at any border in the visual scene where there is a change from dark to light or light to dark, mutual inhibition does not occur, and the intensity of stimulation of most neurons is proportional to the gradient of contrast-that is, the greater the sharpness of contrast and the greater the intensity difference between light and dark areas, the greater the degree of stimulation.

Visual Cortex Also Detects Orientation of Lines and Borders-"Simple" Cells. The visual cortex detects not only the existence of lines and borders in the different areas of the retinal image but also the direction of orientation of each line or border-that is, whether it is vertical or horizontal or lies at some degree of inclination. This capability is believed to result from linear organizations of mutually inhibiting cells that excite second-order neurons when inhibition occurs all along a line of cells where there is a contrast edge. Thus, for each such orientation of a line, specific neuronal cells are stimulated. A line oriented in a different direction excites a different set of cells. These neuronal cells are called simple cells. They are found mainly in layer IV of the primary visual cortex.

## "Complex" Cells Detect Line Orientation When a Line Is Displaced Laterally or Vertically in the Visual Field. As the visual signal progresses farther away from layer IV, some neurons respond to lines that are oriented in the same direction but are not position-specific. That is, even if a line is displaced moderate distances laterally or vertically in the field, the same few neurons will still be stimulated if the line has the same direction. These cells are called complex cells.

Detection of Lines of Specific Lengths, Angles, or Other Shapes. Some neurons in the outer layers of the primary visual columns, as well as neurons in some secondary visual areas, are stimulated only by lines or borders of specific lengths, by specific angulated shapes, or by images that have other characteristics. That is, these neurons detect still higher orders of information from the visual scene. Thus, as one goes farther into the analytical pathway of the visual cortex, progressively more characteristics of each visual scene are deciphered.

## DETECTION OF COLOR

Color is detected in much the same way that lines are detected-by means of color contrast. For example, a red area is often contrasted against a green area, a blue area against a red area, or a green area against a yellow area. All these colors can also be contrasted against a white area within the visual scene. In fact, this contrasting against white is believed to be mainly responsible for the phenomenon called "color constancy"-that is, when the color of an illuminating light changes, the color of the "white" changes with the light, and appropriate computation in the brain allows red to be interpreted as red, even though the illuminating light has changed the color entering the eyes.

The mechanism of color contrast analysis depends on the fact that contrasting colors, called "opponent colors," excite specific neuronal cells. It is presumed that the initial details of color contrast are detected by simple cells, whereas more complex contrasts are detected by complex and hypercomplex cells.

## Effect of Removing the Primary Visual Cortex

Removal of the primary visual cortex in the human being causes loss of conscious vision-that is, blindness. However, psychological studies demonstrate that such "blind" people can still, at times, react subconsciously to changes in light intensity, to movement in the visual scene or, rarely, even to some gross patterns of vision. These reactions include turning the eyes, turning the head, and avoidance. This vision is believed to be subserved by neuronal pathways that pass from the optic tracts mainly into the superior colliculi and other portions of the older visual system.

## Fields of Vision; Perimetry

The field of vision is the visual area seen by an eye at a given instant. The area seen to the nasal side is called the nasal field of vision, and the area seen to the lateral side is called the temporal field of vision.

To diagnose blindness in specific portions of the retina, one charts the field of vision for each eye by a process called perimetry. This charting is performed by having the subject look with one eye toward a central spot directly in front of the eye; the other eye is closed. A small dot of light or a small object is then moved back and forth in all areas of the field of vision, and the subject indicates when the spot of light or object can and cannot be seen. The field of vision for the left eye is plotted as shown in Figure 52-6. In all perimetry charts, a blind spot caused by lack of rods and cones in the retina over the optic disc is found about 15 degrees lateral to the central point of vision, as shown in the figure.

Abnormalities in the Fields of Vision. Occasionally, blind spots are found in portions of the field of vision other than the optic disc area. Such blind spots, called scotomata, are frequently caused by damage to the optic nerve resulting from glaucoma (too much fluid pressure in the eyeball), allergic reactions in the retina, or toxic conditions such as lead poisoning or excessive use of tobacco.
![gu4210682559](gu4210682559.jpg)

Figure 52-6. Perimetry chart showing the field of vision for the left eye. The red circle shows the blind spot.

Another condition that can be diagnosed by perimetry is retinitis pigmentosa. In this disease, portions of the retina degenerate, and excessive melanin pigment is deposited in the degenerated areas. Retinitis pigmentosa usually causes blindness in the peripheral field of vision first and then gradually encroaches on the central areas.

## EYE MOVEMENTS AND THEIR CONTROL

To make full use of the visual abilities of the eyes, almost equally as important as interpretation of the visual signals from the eyes is the cerebral control system for directing the eyes toward the object to be viewed.

Muscular Control of Eye Movements. The eye movements are controlled by three pairs of muscles, shown in Figure 52-7: (1) the medial and lateral recti; (2) the superior and inferior recti; and (3) the superior and inferior obliques. The medial and lateral recti contract to move the eyes from side to side. The superior and inferior recti contract to move the eyes upward or downward. The oblique muscles function mainly to rotate the eyeballs to keep the visual fields in the upright position.

Neural Pathways for Control of Eye Movements. Figure 52-7 also shows brain stem nuclei for the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves and their connections with the peripheral nerves to the ocular muscles. Also shown are interconnections among the brain stem nuclei via the nerve tract called the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Each of the three sets of muscles to each eye is reciprocally innervated so that one muscle of the pair relaxes while the other contracts.

Figure 52-8 illustrates cortical control of the oculomotor apparatus, showing spread of signals from visual areas in the occipital cortex through occipitotectal and

occipitocollicular tracts to the pretectal and superior colliculus areas of the brain stem. From both the pretectal and the superior colliculus areas, the oculomotor control signals pass to the brain stem nuclei of the oculomotor nerves. Strong signals are also transmitted from the body's equilibrium control centers in the brain stem into

the oculomotor system, from the vestibular nuclei via the medial longitudinal fasciculus.

## FIXATION MOVEMENTS OF THE EYES

Perhaps the most important movements of the eyes are those that cause the eyes to "fix" on a discrete portion of the field of vision. Fixation movements are controlled by two neuronal mechanisms. The first of these mechanisms, called the voluntary fixation mechanism, allows a person to move the eyes voluntarily to find the object on which he or she wants to fix the vision. The second is the involuntary fixation mechanism that holds the eyes firmly on the object once it has been found.

The voluntary fixation movements are controlled by a cortical field located bilaterally in the premotor cortical regions of the frontal lobes, as shown in Figure 52-8. Bilateral dysfunction or destruction of these areas makes it difficult for a person to "unlock" the eyes from one point of fixation and move them to another point. It is usually necessary to blink the eyes or put a hand over the eyes for a short time, which then allows the eyes to be moved.

Conversely, the involuntary fixation mechanism that causes the eyes to "lock" on the object of attention once it is found is controlled by secondary visual areas in the occipital cortex, located mainly anterior to the primary visual cortex. When this fixation area is destroyed bilaterally in an animal, the animal has difficulty keeping its eyes directed toward a given fixation point or may become totally unable to do so.

![gu4410682559](gu4410682559.jpg)

![gu4510682559](gu4510682559.jpg)

Figure 52-9. Movements of a spot of light on the fovea, showing sudden "flicking" eye movements that move the spot back toward the center of the fovea whenever it drifts to the foveal edge. The dashed lines represent slow drifting movements, and the solid lines represent sudden flicking movements. (Modified from Whitteridge D: Central control of the eye movements. In: Field J, Magoun HW, Hall VE [eds]: Handbook of Physiology, vol. 2, sec. 1. Washington, DC: American Physiological Society, 1960.)

To summarize, posterior "involuntary" occipital cortical eye fields automatically "lock" the eyes on a given spot of the visual field and thereby prevent movement of the image across the retinas. To unlock this visual fixation, voluntary signals must be transmitted from cortical "voluntary" eye fields located in the frontal cortices.

## Mechanism of Involuntary Locking Fixation—Role

of the Superior Colliculi. The involuntary locking type of fixation discussed in the previous section results from a negative feedback mechanism that prevents the object of attention from leaving the foveal portion of the retina. The eyes normally have three types of continuous but almost imperceptible movements: (1) a continuous tremor at a rate of 30 to 80 cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$ caused by successive contractions of the motor units in the ocular muscles; (2) a slow drift of the eyeballs in one direction or another; and (3) sudden flicking movements that are controlled by the involuntary fixation mechanism.

When a spot of light becomes fixed on the foveal region of the retina, the tremulous movements cause the spot to move back and forth at a rapid rate across the cones, and the drifting movements cause the spot to drift slowly across the cones. Each time the spot drifts as far as the edge of the fovea, a sudden reflex reaction occurs, producing a flicking movement that moves the spot away from this edge back toward the center of the fovea. Thus, an automatic response moves the image back toward the central point of vision.

These drifting and flicking motions are demonstrated in Figure 52-9. The dashed lines show the slow drifting across the fovea, and the solid lines show the flicks that keep the image from leaving the foveal region. This involuntary fixation capability is mostly lost when the superior colliculi are destroyed.

## Saccadic Movement of the Eyes-A Mechanism of Successive Fixation Points. When a visual scene is moving continually before the eyes, such as when a person is riding in a car, the eyes fix on one highlight after another in the visual field, jumping from one to the next at a rate of two to three jumps per second. The jumps are called saccades, and the movements are called opticokinetic movements. The saccades occur so rapidly that no more than $10 \%$ of the total time is spent moving the eyes, with $90 \%$ of the time being allocated to the fixation sites. Also, the brain suppresses the visual image during saccades, so the person is not conscious of the movements from point to point.

Saccadic Movements During Reading. During the process of reading, a person usually makes several saccadic movements of the eyes for each line. In this case, the visual scene is not moving past the eyes, but the eyes are trained to move by means of several successive saccades across the visual scene to extract the important information. Similar saccades occur when a person observes a painting, except that the saccades occur in upward, sideways, downward, and angulated directions one after another from one highlight of the painting to another, and so forth.

Fixation on Moving Objects-"Pursuit Movement." The eyes can also remain fixed on a moving object, which is called pursuit movement. A highly developed cortical mechanism automatically detects the course of movement of an object and then rapidly develops a similar course of movement for the eyes. For example, if an object is moving up and down in a wavelike form at a rate of several times per second, the eyes at first may be unable to fixate on it. However, after a second or so, the eyes begin to jump by means of saccades in approximately the same wavelike pattern of movement as that of the object. Then, after another few seconds, the eyes develop progressively smoother movements and finally follow the wave movement almost exactly. This represents a high degree of automatic subconscious computational ability by the pursuit system for controlling eye movements.

## Superior Colliculi Are Mainly Responsible for Turning the Eyes and Head Toward a Visual Disturbance.

Even after the visual cortex has been destroyed, a sudden visual disturbance in a lateral area of the visual field often causes immediate turning of the eyes in that direction. This turning does not occur if the superior colliculi have also been destroyed. To support this function, the various points of the retina are represented topographically in the superior colliculi in the same way as in the primary visual cortex, although with less accuracy. Even so, the principal direction of a flash of light in a peripheral retinal field is mapped by the colliculi, and secondary signals are transmitted to the oculomotor nuclei to turn the eyes. To help in this directional movement of the eyes, the superior

colliculi also have topological maps of somatic sensations from the body and acoustic signals from the ears.

The optic nerve fibers from the eyes to the colliculi, which are responsible for these rapid turning movements, are branches from the rapidly conducting $M$ fibers, with one branch going to the visual cortex and the other going to the superior colliculi. In addition to causing the eyes to turn toward a visual disturbance, signals are relayed from the superior colliculi through the medial longitudinal fasciculus to other levels of the brain stem to cause turning of the whole head and even of the whole body toward the direction of the disturbance. Other types of nonvisual disturbances, such as strong sounds or even stroking of the side of the body, cause similar turning of the eyes, head, and body, but only if the superior colliculi are intact. Therefore, the superior colliculi play a global role in orienting the eyes, head, and body with respect to external disturbances, whether they are visual, auditory, or somatic.

## "FUSION" OF THE VISUAL IMAGES FROM THE TWO EYES

To make the visual perceptions more meaningful, the visual images in the two eyes normally fuse with each other on "corresponding points" of the two retinas. The visual cortex plays an important role in fusion. We previously discussed that corresponding points of the two retinas transmit visual signals to different neuronal layers of the lateral geniculate body, and these signals, in turn, are relayed to parallel neurons in the visual cortex. Interactions occur between these cortical neurons to cause interference excitation in specific neurons when the two visual images are not "in register"-that is, are not precisely "fused." This excitation presumably provides the signal that is transmitted to the oculomotor apparatus to cause convergence or divergence or rotation of the eyes so that fusion can be re-established. Once the corresponding points of the two retinas are in register, excitation of the specific "interference" neurons in the visual cortex disappears.

## Neural Mechanism of Stereopsis for Judging Distances of Visual Objects

Because the two eyes are more than 2 inches apart, the images on the two retinas are not exactly the same. That is, the right eye sees a little more of the right-hand side of the object, and the left eye sees a little more of the lefthand side; the closer the object, the greater the disparity. Therefore, even when the two eyes are fused with each other, it is still impossible for all corresponding points in the two visual images to be exactly in register at the same time. Furthermore, the nearer the object is to the eyes, the less the degree of register. This degree of nonregister provides the neural mechanism for stereopsis, an important mechanism for judging the distances of visual objects up to about 200 feet ( 61 meters).

The neuronal cellular mechanism for stereopsis is based on the fact that some of the fiber pathways from the retinas to the visual cortex stray 1 to 2 degrees on each
side of the central pathway. Therefore, some optic pathways from the two eyes are exactly in register for objects 2 meters away; still another set of pathways is in register for objects 25 meters away. Thus, the distance is determined by which set or sets of pathways are excited by nonregister or register. This phenomenon is called depth perception, another name for stereopsis.

## Strabismus-Lack of Fusion of the Eyes

Strabismus, also called squint or cross-eye, means lack of fusion of the eyes in one or more of the visual coordinates: horizontal, vertical, or rotational. The basic types of strabismus are shown in Figure 52-10: (1) horizontal strabismus; (2) torsional strabismus; and (3) vertical strabismus. Combinations of two or even all three of the different types of strabismus often occur.

Strabismus is often caused by abnormal "set" of the fusion mechanism of the visual system. That is, in a young child's early efforts to fixate the two eyes on the same object, one of the eyes fixates satisfactorily while the other fails to do so, or they both fixate satisfactorily but never simultaneously. Soon the patterns of conjugate movements of the eyes become abnormally "set" in the neuronal control pathways themselves, so the eyes never fuse.

Suppression of the Visual Image From a Repressed Eye. In a few patients with strabismus, the eyes alternate in fixing on the object of attention. In other patients, one eye alone is used all the time, and the other eye becomes repressed and is never used for precise vision. The visual acuity of the repressed eye develops only slightly, sometimes remaining as $20 / 400$ or less. If the dominant eye then becomes blinded, vision in the repressed eye can develop only to a slight extent in adults but far more in young children. This demonstrates that visual acuity is highly dependent on proper development of central nervous system synaptic connections from the eyes. In fact, even anatomically, the numbers of neuronal connections diminish in the visual cortex areas that would normally receive signals from the repressed eye.

## AUTONOMIC CONTROL OF ACCOMMODATION AND PUPILLARY APERTURE

## AUTONOMIC NERVES TO THE EYES

The eye is innervated by both parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve fibers, as shown in Figure 52-11. The parasympathetic preganglionic fibers arise in the EdingerWestphal nucleus-the visceral nucleus portion of the third cranial nerve-and then pass in the third nerve to

the ciliary ganglion, which lies immediately behind the eye. There, the preganglionic fibers synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic neurons, which in turn send fibers through ciliary nerves into the eyeball. These nerves excite the following: (1) the ciliary muscle that controls focusing of the eye lens; and (2) the sphincter of the iris that constricts the pupil.

The sympathetic innervation of the eye originates in the intermediolateral horn cells of the first thoracic segment of the spinal cord. From there, sympathetic fibers enter the sympathetic chain and pass upward to the superior cervical ganglion, where they synapse with postganglionic neurons. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers from these neurons then spread along the surfaces of the carotid artery and successively smaller arteries until they reach the eye. There, the sympathetic fibers innervate the radial fibers of the iris, which open the pupil, as well as several extraocular muscles of the eye, discussed subsequently in relation to Horner's syndrome.

## CONTROL OF ACCOMMODATION (FOCUSING THE EYES)

The accommodation mechanism-that is, the mechanism that focuses the lens system of the eye-is essential for a high degree of visual acuity. Accommodation results from contraction or relaxation of the eye ciliary muscle. Contraction causes increased refractive power of the lens, as explained in Chapter 50, and relaxation causes decreased
refractive power. How does a person adjust accommodation to keep the eyes in focus all the time?

Accommodation of the lens is regulated by a negative feedback mechanism that automatically adjusts the refractive power of the lens to achieve the highest degree of visual acuity. When the eyes have been focused on some far object and must then suddenly focus on a near object, the lens usually accommodates for best acuity of vision within less than 1 second. Although the precise control mechanism that causes this rapid and accurate focusing of the eye is not fully understood, the following features are known.

First, when the eyes suddenly change distance of the fixation point, the lens changes its strength in the proper direction to achieve a new state of focus within a fraction of a second. Second, different types of clues help change the lens strength in the proper direction, as follows:

1. Chromatic aberration appears to be important. That is, red light rays focus slightly posteriorly to blue light rays because the lens bends blue rays more than red rays. The eyes appear to be able to detect which of these two types of rays is in better focus, and this clue relays information to the accommodation mechanism with regard to whether to make the lens stronger or weaker.
2. When the eyes fixate on a near object, the eyes must converge. The neural mechanisms for convergence cause a simultaneous signal to strengthen the lens of the eye.
3. Because the fovea lies in a hollowed-out depression that is slightly deeper than the remainder of the retina, the clarity of focus in the depth of the fovea is different from the clarity of focus on the edges. This difference may also give clues about which way the strength of the lens needs to be changed.
4. The degree of accommodation of the lens oscillates slightly all the time at a frequency up to twice per second. The visual image becomes clearer when the oscillation of the lens strength is changing in the appropriate direction and becomes poorer when the lens strength is changing in the wrong direction. This could give a rapid clue as to which way the strength of the lens needs to change to provide appropriate focus.
The brain cortical areas that control accommodation closely parallel those that control fixation movements of the eyes. Analysis of the visual signals in Brodmann's cortical areas 18 and 19 and transmission of motor signals to the ciliary muscle occur through the pretectal area in the brain stem, then through the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, and finally via parasympathetic nerve fibers to the eyes.

## CONTROL OF PUPILLARY DIAMETER

Stimulation of the parasympathetic nerves also excites the pupillary sphincter muscle, thereby decreasing the pupillary aperture; this process is called miosis. Conversely, stimulation of the sympathetic nerves excites the radial fibers of the iris and causes pupillary dilation, called mydriasis.

Pupillary Light Reflex. When light is shone into the eyes, the pupils constrict, a reaction called the pupillary light reflex. The neuronal pathway for this reflex is illustrated by the upper two black arrows in Figure 52-11. When light impinges on the retina, a few of the resulting impulses pass from the optic nerves to the pretectal nuclei. From here, secondary impulses pass to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and, finally, back through parasympathetic nerves to constrict the sphincter of the iris. Conversely, in darkness, the reflex becomes inhibited, which results in dilation of the pupil.

The function of the light reflex is to help the eye adapt extremely rapidly to changing light conditions, as explained in Chapter 51. The limits of pupillary diameter are about 1.5 millimeters on the small side and 8 millimeters on the large side. Therefore, because light brightness on the retina increases with the square of pupillary diameter, the range of light and dark adaptation that can be brought about by the pupillary reflex is about 30 to 1 that is, up to as much as 30 times change in the amount of light entering the eye.

## Pupillary Reflexes or Reactions in Central Nervous Sys-

tem Diseases. A few central nervous system diseases damage nerve transmission of visual signals from the retinas to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, thus sometimes blocking the pupillary reflexes. Such blocks may occur as a result of disorders including central nervous system syphilis, alcoholism, and encephalitis. The block usually occurs in the pretectal region of the brain stem, although it can result from destruction of some small fibers in the optic nerves.

The final nerve fibers in the pathway through the pretectal area to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus are mostly of the inhibitory type. When their inhibitory effect is lost, the nucleus becomes chronically active, causing the pupils to remain mostly constricted, in addition to their failure to respond to light.

Yet, the pupils can constrict a little more if the EdingerWestphal nucleus is stimulated through some other pathway. For example, when the eyes fixate on a near object, the signals that cause accommodation of the lens, and those that cause convergence of the two eyes, cause a mild degree of pupillary constriction at the same time. This phenomenon is called the pupillary reaction to accommodation. A pupil that fails to respond to light but does respond to accommodation and is also very small (an Argyll Robertson pupil) is an important diagnostic sign of a central nervous system disease such as syphilis.

Horner's Syndrome. The sympathetic nerves to the eye are occasionally interrupted. Interruption frequently occurs in the cervical sympathetic chain, which causes the
clinical condition called Horner syndrome. This syndrome consists of the following effects:

1. Because of interruption of sympathetic nerve fibers to the pupillary dilator muscle, the pupil remains persistently constricted to a smaller diameter than the pupil of the opposite eye.
2. The superior eyelid droops because it is normally maintained in an open position during waking hours, partly by contraction of smooth muscle fibers embedded in the superior eyelid and innervated by the sympathetics. Therefore, destruction of the sympathetic nerves makes it impossible to open the superior eyelid as widely as normally.
3. The blood vessels on the corresponding side of the face and head become persistently dilated.
4. Sweating (which requires sympathetic nerve signals) cannot occur on the side of the face and head affected by Horner syndrome.

# The Sense of Hearing 

This chapter describes the mechanisms whereby the ear receives sound waves, discriminates their frequencies, and transmits auditory information into the central nervous system, where its meaning is deciphered.

## TYMPANIC MEMBRANE AND THE OSSICULAR SYSTEM

## CONDUCTION OF SOUND FROM THE TYMPANIC MEMBRANE TO THE COCHLEA

Figure 53-1 shows the tympanic membrane (commonly called the eardrum) and the ossicles, which conduct sound from the tympanic membrane through the middle ear to the cochlea (the inner ear). Attached to the tympanic membrane is the handle of the malleus. The malleus is bound to the incus by minute ligaments, so whenever the
malleus moves, the incus moves with it. The opposite end of the incus articulates with the stem of the stapes, and the faceplate of the stapes lies against the membranous labyrinth of the cochlea in the opening of the oval window.

The tip end of the handle of the malleus is attached to the center of the tympanic membrane, and this point of attachment is constantly pulled by the tensor tympani muscle, which keeps the tympanic membrane tensed. This tension allows sound vibrations on any portion of the tympanic membrane to be transmitted to the ossicles, which would not occur if the membrane were lax.

The ossicles of the middle ear are suspended by ligaments in such a way that the combined malleus and incus act as a single lever, having its fulcrum approximately at the border of the tympanic membrane.

The articulation of the incus with the stapes causes the stapes to (1) push forward on the oval window and
![gu4810682559](gu4810682559.jpg)

Figure 53-1. The outer ear, tympanic membrane, and ossicular system of the middle ear and inner ear.

on the cochlear fluid on the other side of window every time the tympanic membrane moves inward; and (2) pull backward on the fluid every time the malleus moves outward.
"Impedance Matching" by the Ossicular System. The amplitude of movement of the stapes faceplate with each sound vibration is only three-fourths as much as the amplitude of the handle of the malleus. Therefore, the ossicular lever system does not increase the movement distance of the stapes, as is commonly believed. Instead, the system actually reduces the distance but increases the force of movement about 1.3 times. In addition, the surface area of the tympanic membrane is about 55 square millimeters, whereas the surface area of the stapes averages 3.2 square millimeters. This 17 -fold difference times the 1.3 -fold ratio of the lever system causes about 22 times as much total force to be exerted on the fluid of the cochlea as is exerted by the sound waves against the tympanic membrane. Because fluid has far greater inertia than air does, increased amounts of force are necessary to cause vibration in the fluid. Therefore, the tympanic membrane and ossicular system provide impedance matching between the sound waves in air and the sound vibrations in the fluid of the cochlea. The impedance matching is about $50 \%$ to $75 \%$ of perfect for sound frequencies between 300 and 3000 cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$, which allows utilization of most of the energy in the incoming sound waves.

In the absence of the ossicular system and tympanic membrane, sound waves can still travel directly through the air of the middle ear and enter the cochlea at the oval window. However, the sensitivity for hearing is then 15 to 20 decibels less than for ossicular transmission-equivalent to a decrease from a medium to a barely perceptible voice level.

## Attenuation of Sound by Contraction of the Tensor

Tympani and Stapedius Muscles. When loud sounds are transmitted through the ossicular system and from there into the central nervous system, a reflex occurs after a latent period of only 40 to 80 milliseconds to cause contraction of the stapedius muscle and, to a lesser extent, the tensor tympani muscle. The tensor tympani muscle pulls the handle of the malleus inward while the stapedius muscle pulls the stapes outward. These two forces oppose each other and thereby cause the entire ossicular system to develop increased rigidity, thus greatly reducing the ossicular conduction of low-frequency sound, mainly frequencies below 1000 cycles/sec.

This attenuation reflex can reduce the intensity of lower frequency sound transmission by 30 to 40 decibels, which is about the same difference as that between a loud voice and a whisper. The function of this mechanism is believed to be twofold-to protect the cochlea from damaging vibrations caused by excessively loud sound and to mask low-frequency sounds in loud environments. Masking usually removes a major share of the background noise and allows a person to concentrate on sounds above 1000 cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$, where most of the pertinent information in voice communication is transmitted.

Another function of the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles is to decrease a person's hearing sensitivity to his or her own speech. This effect is activated by collateral nerve signals transmitted to these muscles at the same time that the brain activates the voice mechanism.

## TRANSMISSION OF SOUND THROUGH BONE

Because the inner ear, the cochlea, is embedded in a bony cavity in the temporal bone, called the bony labyrinth, vibrations of the entire skull can cause fluid vibrations in the cochlea. Therefore, under appropriate conditions, a tuning fork or an electronic vibrator placed on any bony protuberance of the skull, but especially on the mastoid process near the ear, causes the person to hear the sound. However, the energy available even in loud sound in the air is not sufficient to cause hearing via bone conduction unless a special electromechanical sound-amplifying device is applied to the bone.

## COCHLEA

## FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE COCHLEA

The cochlea is a system of coiled tubes, shown in Figure 53-1 and in cross section in Figure 53-2. It consists of three tubes coiled side by side: (1) the scala vestibuli; (2) the scala media; and (3) the scala tympani. The scala vestibuli and scala media are separated from each other by Reissner's membrane (also called the vestibular membrane), shown in Figure 53-2B; the scala tympani and scala media are separated from each other by the basilar membrane. On the surface of the basilar membrane lies the organ of Corti, which contains a series of electromechanically sensitive cells, the hair cells. They are the receptive end organs that generate nerve impulses in response to sound vibrations.

Figure 53-3 diagrams the functional parts of the uncoiled cochlea for conduction of sound vibrations. First, note that Reissner's membrane is missing from this figure. This membrane is so thin and so easily moved that it does not obstruct the passage of sound vibrations from the scala vestibuli into the scala media. Therefore, as far as fluid conduction of sound is concerned, the scala vestibuli and scala media are considered to be a single chamber. As discussed later, Reissner's membrane maintains a special kind of fluid in the scala media that is required for normal function of the sound-receptive hair cells.

Sound vibrations enter the scala vestibuli from the faceplate of the stapes at the oval window. The faceplate covers this window and is connected with the window's edges by a loose annular ligament so that it can move inward and outward with the sound vibrations. Inward movement causes the fluid to move forward in the scala vestibuli and scala media, and outward movement causes the fluid to move backward.

## Basilar Membrane and Resonance in the Cochlea.

The basilar membrane is a fibrous membrane that separates the scala media from the scala tympani. It contains 20,000 to 30,000 basilar fibers that project from the bony center of the cochlea, the modiolus, toward the outer wall. These fibers are stiff, elastic, reedlike structures that are fixed at their basal ends in the central bony structure of the cochlea (the modiolus) but are not fixed at their
distal ends, except that the distal ends are embedded in the loose basilar membrane. Because the fibers are stiff and free at one end, they can vibrate like the reeds of a harmonica.

The lengths of the basilar fibers increase progressively, beginning at the oval window and going from the base of the cochlea to the apex, increasing from a length of about 0.04 millimeter near the oval and round windows to 0.5 millimeter at the tip of the cochlea (the "helicotrema"), a 12 -fold increase in length.

The diameters of the fibers, however, decrease from the oval window to the helicotrema, so their overall stiffness decreases more than 100 -fold. As a result, the stiff, short fibers near the oval window of the cochlea vibrate best at a very high frequency, whereas the long, limber fibers near the tip of the cochlea vibrate best at a low frequency.

Thus, high-frequency resonance of the basilar membrane occurs near the base, where the sound waves enter the cochlea through the oval window. However, low-frequency resonance occurs near the helicotrema, mainly because of the less stiff fibers but also because of increased "loading" with extra masses of fluid that must vibrate along the cochlear tubules.

## TRANSMISSION OF SOUND WAVES IN THE COCHLEA—"TRAVELING WAVE"

When the foot of the stapes moves inward against the oval window, the round window must bulge outward because the cochlea is bounded on all sides by bony walls. The initial effect of a sound wave entering at the oval window is to cause the basilar membrane at the base of the cochlea to bend in the direction of the round window. However, the elastic tension that is built up in the basilar fibers as they bend toward the round window initiates a fluid wave that "travels" along the basilar membrane toward the helicotrema. Figure 53-4A shows movement of a high-frequency wave down the basilar membrane, Figure 53-4B shows a medium-frequency wave, and Figure 53-4C shows a very low-frequency wave. Movement of the wave along the basilar membrane is comparable to the movement of a pressure wave along the arterial walls, discussed in Chapter 15; it is also comparable to a wave that travels along the surface of a pond.

Vibration Patterns of the Basilar Membrane for Different Sound Frequencies. Note in Figure 53-4 the different patterns of transmission for sound waves of different frequencies. Each wave is relatively weak at the outset but becomes strong when it reaches the portion of the basilar membrane that has a natural resonant frequency equal to the respective sound frequency. At this point, the basilar membrane can vibrate back and forth with such ease that the energy in the wave is dissipated. Consequently, the wave dies at this point and fails to travel the remaining distance along the basilar membrane.

![gu5210682559](gu5210682559.jpg)

Figure 53-4. "Traveling waves" along the basilar membrane for high- (A), medium- (B), and low-frequency (C) sounds.

Thus, a high-frequency sound wave travels only a short distance along the basilar membrane before it reaches its resonant point and dies, a medium-frequency sound wave travels about halfway and then dies, and a very lowfrequency sound wave travels the entire distance along the membrane.

Another feature of the traveling wave is that it travels fast along the initial portion of the basilar membrane but becomes progressively slower as it goes farther into the cochlea. The cause of this difference is the high coefficient of elasticity of the basilar fibers near the oval window and a progressively decreasing coefficient farther along the membrane. This rapid initial transmission of the wave allows the high-frequency sounds to travel far enough into the cochlea to spread out and separate from one another on the basilar membrane. Without this rapid initial transmission, all the high-frequency waves would be bunched together within the first millimeter or so of the basilar membrane, and their frequencies could not be discriminated.

Vibration Amplitude Pattern of the Basilar Membrane. The dashed curves of Figure 53-5A show the position of a sound wave on the basilar membrane when the stapes is (a) all the way inward, (b) has moved back to the neutral point, (c) is all the way outward, and (d) has moved back again to the neutral point but is moving inward. The shaded area around these different waves shows the extent of vibration of the basilar membrane during a complete vibratory cycle. This is the amplitude pattern of vibration of the basilar membrane for this particular sound frequency.

Figure 53-5B shows the amplitude patterns of vibration for different frequencies, demonstrating that the maximum amplitude for sound at 8000 cycles/sec occurs near the base of the cochlea, whereas that for frequencies less than 200 cycles/sec is all the way at the tip of the basilar membrane near the helicotrema, the minute opening

whereby the scala tympani and scala vestibuli communicate (Figure 53-2).

The principal method whereby sound frequencies are discriminated from one another is based on the "place" of maximum stimulation of the nerve fibers from the organ of Corti lying on the basilar membrane, as explained in the next section.

## FUNCTION OF THE ORGAN OF CORTI

The organ of Corti, shown in Figure 53-2 and Figure 53-6, is the receptor organ that generates nerve impulses in response to vibration of the basilar membrane. Note that the organ of Corti lies on the surface of the basilar fibers and basilar membrane. The actual sensory receptors in the organ of Corti are two specialized types of nerve cells called hair cells-a single row of internal (or "inner") hair cells, numbering about 3500 and measuring about 12 micrometers in diameter, and three or four rows of external (or "outer") hair cells, numbering about 12,000 and having diameters of only about 8 micrometers. The bases and sides of the hair cells synapse with a network of cochlear nerve endings. Between $90 \%$ and $95 \%$ of these endings terminate on the inner hair cells, emphasizing their special importance for detection of sound.

The nerve fibers stimulated by the hair cells lead to the spiral ganglion of Corti, which lies in the modiolus (center) of the cochlea. The spiral ganglion neuronal cells send axons-a total of about 30,000 -into the cochlear nerve and then into the central nervous system at the level of the upper medulla. The relation of the organ of Corti to the spiral ganglion and to the cochlear nerve is shown in Figure 53-2.

![gu5410682559](gu5410682559.jpg)

Figure 53-6. The organ of Corti, showing especially the hair cells and the tectorial membrane pressing against the projecting hairs.

Excitation of the Hair Cells. Note in Figure 53-6 that minute hairs, or stereocilia, project upward from the hair cells and either touch or are embedded in the surface gel coating of the tectorial membrane, which lies above the stereocilia in the scala media. These hair cells are similar to the hair cells found in the macula and cristae ampullaris of the vestibular apparatus, discussed in Chapter 56. Bending of the hairs in one direction depolarizes the hair cells, and bending in the opposite direction hyperpolarizes them. This in turn excites the auditory nerve fibers synapsing with their bases.

Figure 53-7.4 shows the mechanism whereby vibration of the basilar membrane excites the hair endings. The outer ends of the hair cells are fixed tightly in a rigid structure composed of a flat plate, called the reticular lamina, supported by triangular rods of Corti, which are attached tightly to the basilar fibers. The basilar fibers, the rods of Corti, and the reticular lamina move as a rigid unit.

Upward movement of the basilar fiber rocks the reticular lamina upward and inward toward the modiolus. Then, when the basilar membrane moves downward, the reticular lamina rocks downward and outward. The inward and outward motion causes the hairs on the hair cells to shear back and forth against the tectorial membrane. Thus, the hair cells are excited whenever the basilar membrane vibrates.

Auditory Signals Are Transmitted Mainly by the Inner Hair Cells. Even though there are three to four times as many outer hair cells as inner hair cells, about $90 \%$ of the auditory nerve fibers are stimulated by the inner cells rather than by the outer cells. Nonetheless, if the outer cells are damaged while the inner cells remain fully functional, a large amount of hearing loss occurs. Therefore, it has been proposed that the outer hair cells in some way control the sensitivity of the inner hair cells at different sound pitches, a phenomenon called "tuning" of the receptor system. In support of this concept, a large number of retrograde nerve fibers pass from the brain stem to the
![gu5510682559](gu5510682559.jpg)

Figure 53-7. A, Stimulation of the hair cells by to and fro movement of the hairs projecting into the gel coating of the tectorial membrane. B, Transduction of mechanical energy into neural signals by the hair cells. When the stereocilia are bent in the direction of the longer ones, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are opened, causing depolarization, which in turn opens voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. The influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ augments the depolarization and elicits release of the excitatory transmitter glutamate, which depolarizes the sensory nerve.

vicinity of the outer hair cells. Stimulating these nerve fibers can actually cause shortening of the outer hair cells and possibly also change their degree of stiffness. These effects suggest a retrograde nervous mechanism for control of the ear's sensitivity to different sound pitches, activated through the outer hair cells.

Hair Cell Receptor Potentials and Excitation of Auditory Nerve Fibers. The stereocilia (i.e., the "hairs" protruding from the ends of the hair cells) are stiff structures because each has a rigid protein framework. Each hair cell has about 100 stereocilia on its apical border. These stereocilia become progressively longer on the side of the hair cell away from the modiolus. The tops of the shorter stereocilia are attached by thin filaments to the back sides of their adjacent longer stereocilia. Therefore, whenever the cilia are bent in the direction of the longer ones, the tips of the smaller stereocilia are tugged outward from the surface of the hair cell. This causes a mechanical transduction that opens 200 to 300 cation-conducting channels, allowing for the rapid movement of positively charged potassium ions from the surrounding scala media fluid into the stereocilia, which causes depolarization of the hair cell membrane (see Figure 53-7B). The depolarization opens voltage-sensitive calcium channels and causes influx of calcium ions, which augments the depolarization. Repolarization of the hair cell occurs mainly by exit of potassium ions through calcium ion-sensitive potassium channels.

Thus, when the basilar fibers bend toward the scala vestibuli, the hair cells depolarize, and in the opposite direction they hyperpolarize, thereby generating an alternating hair cell receptor potential that, in turn, stimulates the cochlear nerve endings that synapse with the bases of the hair cells. It is believed that the rapidly acting neurotransmitter glutamate is released by the hair cells at these synapses during depolarization.

Endocochlear Potential. To explain even more fully the electrical potentials generated by the hair cells, we need to explain another electrical phenomenon called the endocochlear potential. The scala media is filled with a fluid called endolymph, in contradistinction to the perilymph present in the scala vestibuli and scala tympani. The scala vestibuli and scala tympani communicate directly with the subarachnoid space around the brain, so the perilymph is almost identical to cerebrospinal fluid. Conversely, the endolymph that fills the scala media is an entirely different fluid secreted by the stria vascularis, a highly vascular area on the outer wall of the scala media. Endolymph contains a high concentration of potassium and a low concentration of sodium, which is exactly opposite to the contents of perilymph.

An electrical potential of about +80 millivolts exists all the time between endolymph and perilymph, with positivity inside the scala media and negativity outside. This is called the endocochlear potential, and it is generated by continual secretion of positive potassium ions into the scala media by the stria vascularis.

The importance of the endocochlear potential is that the tops of the hair cells project through the reticular lamina and are bathed by the endolymph of the scala media, whereas perilymph bathes the lower bodies of the hair cells. Furthermore, the hair cells have a negative intracellular potential of -70 millivolts with respect to the perilymph but -150 millivolts with respect to the endolymph at their upper surfaces, where the hairs project through the reticular lamina and into the endolymph. It is believed that this high electrical potential at the tips of the stereocilia sensitizes the cell an extra amount, thereby increasing its ability to respond to the slightest sound.

## DETERMINATION OF SOUND FREQUENCY—THE "PLACE" PRINCIPLE

From earlier discussions in this chapter, it is apparent that low-frequency sounds cause maximal activation of the basilar membrane near the apex of the cochlea, and high-frequency sounds activate the basilar membrane near the base of the cochlea. Intermediate-frequency sounds activate the membrane at intermediate distances between the two extremes. Furthermore, there is spatial organization of the nerve fibers in the cochlear pathway, all the way from the cochlea to the cerebral cortex. Recording of signals in the auditory tracts of the brain stem and in the auditory receptive fields of the cerebral cortex shows that specific brain neurons are activated by specific sound frequencies. Therefore, the major method used by the nervous system to detect different sound frequencies is to determine the positions along the basilar membrane that are stimulated the most, called the place principle for the determination of sound frequency.

Referring again to Figure 53-5, one can see that the distal end of the basilar membrane at the helicotrema is stimulated by all sound frequencies below 200 cycles/sec. Therefore, it has been difficult to understand from the place principle how one can differentiate between low sound frequencies in the range of 200 down to 20 cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$. These low frequencies have been postulated to be discriminated mainly by the so-called volley or frequency principle. That is, low-frequency sounds, from 20 to 1500 to 2000 cycles/ sec , can cause volleys of nerve impulses synchronized at the same frequencies, and these volleys are transmitted by the cochlear nerve into the cochlear nuclei of the brain. It is further suggested that the cochlear nuclei can distinguish the different frequencies of the volleys. In fact, destruction of the entire apical half of the cochlea, which destroys the basilar membrane where all lower frequency sounds are normally detected, does not totally eliminate discrimination of the lower frequency sounds.

## DETERMINATION OF LOUDNESS

Loudness is determined by the auditory system in at least three ways.

First, as the sound becomes louder, the amplitude of vibration of the basilar membrane and hair cells also increases so that the hair cells excite the nerve endings at more rapid rates.

Second, as the amplitude of vibration increases, it causes more and more of the hair cells on the fringes of the resonating portion of the basilar membrane to become stimulated, thus causing spatial summation of impulsesthat is, transmission through many nerve fibers rather than through only a few.

Third, the outer hair cells do not become stimulated significantly until vibration of the basilar membrane reaches high intensity, and stimulation of these cells presumably apprises the nervous system that the sound is loud.

Detection of Changes in Loudness-The Power Law. As pointed out in Chapter 47, a person interprets changes in intensity of sensory stimuli approximately in proportion to an inverse power function of the actual intensity. In the case of sound, the interpreted sensation changes approximately in proportion to the cube root of the actual sound intensity. To express this concept in another way, the ear can discriminate differences in sound intensity from the softest whisper to the loudest possible noise, representing an approximately 1 trillion times increase in sound energy or 1 million times increase in amplitude of movement of the basilar membrane. Yet, the ear interprets this much difference in sound level as approximately a 10,000-fold change. Thus, the scale of intensity is greatly "compressed" by the sound perception mechanisms of the auditory system, which allows a person to interpret differences in sound intensities over a far wider range than would be possible were it not for compression of the intensity scale.

Decibel Unit. Because of the extreme changes in sound intensities that the ear can detect and discriminate, sound intensities are usually expressed in terms of the logarithm of their actual intensities. A 10 -fold increase in sound energy is called 1 bel , and 0.1 bel is called 1 decibel. One decibel represents an actual increase in sound energy of 1.26 times.

Another reason for using the decibel system to express changes in loudness is that in the usual sound intensity range for communication, the ears can barely distinguish an approximately 1-decibel change in sound intensity.

Threshold for Hearing Sound at Different Frequencies. Figure 53-8 shows the pressure thresholds at which sounds of different frequencies can barely be heard by the ear. This figure demonstrates that a 3,000 cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$ sound can be heard even when its intensity is as low as 70 decibels below 1 dyne $/ \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ sound pressure level, which is one ten-millionth microwatt per square centimeter. Conversely, a 100 cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$ sound can be detected only if its intensity is 10,000 times as great as this.

Frequency Range of Hearing. The frequencies of sound that a young person can hear are between 20 and 20,000 cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$. However, referring again to Figure 53-8, we see that the sound range depends to a great extent on loudness. If the loudness is 60 decibels below 1 dyne $/ \mathrm{cm}^{2}$

Figure 53-8. Relation of the threshold of hearing and of somesthetic perception (pricking and tactual threshold) to the sound energy level at each sound frequency.
sound pressure level, the sound range is 500 to 5000 cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$; only with intense sounds can the complete range of 20 to 20,000 cycles be achieved. In old age, this frequency range is usually shortened to 50 to 8,000 cycles/ sec or less, as discussed later in this chapter.

## CENTRAL AUDITORY MECHANISMS

## AUDITORY NERVOUS PATHWAYS

Figure 53-9 shows the major auditory pathways. Nerve fibers from the spiral ganglion of Corti enter the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei located in the upper part of the medulla. At this point, all the fibers synapse, and secondorder neurons pass mainly to the opposite side of the brain stem to terminate in the superior olivary nucleus. A few second-order fibers also pass to the superior olivary nucleus on the same side.

From the superior olivary nucleus, the auditory pathway passes upward through the lateral lemniscus. Some of the fibers terminate in the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, but many fibers bypass this nucleus and travel on to the inferior colliculus, where all or almost all the auditory fibers synapse. From there, the pathway passes to the medial geniculate nucleus, where all the fibers do synapse. Finally, the pathway proceeds via auditory radiation to the auditory cortex, located mainly in the superior gyrus of the temporal lobe.

Several important points should be noted. First, signals from both ears are transmitted through the pathways of both sides of the brain, with a preponderance of transmission in the contralateral pathway. In at least three places in the brain stem, crossing over occurs between the two pathways: (1) in the trapezoid body; (2) in the commissure between the two nuclei of the lateral lemnisci; and (3) in the commissure connecting the two inferior colliculi.

Second, many collateral fibers from the auditory tracts pass directly into the reticular activating system of the brain stem. This system projects diffusely upward in the brain stem and downward into the spinal cord and

![gu5710682559](gu5710682559.jpg)

activates the entire nervous system in response to loud sounds. Other collaterals go to the vermis of the cerebellum, which is also activated instantaneously in the event of a sudden noise.

Third, a high degree of spatial orientation is maintained in the fiber tracts from the cochlea all the way to the cortex. In fact, there are three spatial patterns for termination of the different sound frequencies in the cochlear nuclei, two patterns in the inferior colliculi, one precise pattern for discrete sound frequencies in the auditory cortex, and at least five other less precise patterns in the auditory cortex and auditory association areas.

Firing Rates at Different Levels of the Auditory Pathways. Single nerve fibers entering the cochlear nuclei from the auditory nerve can fire at rates up to at least 1000/ sec , with the rate being determined mainly by the loudness of the sound. At sound frequencies up to 2000 to 4000 cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$, the auditory nerve impulses are often synchronized with the sound waves, but they do not necessarily occur with every wave.

In the auditory tracts of the brain stem, the firing is usually no longer synchronized with the sound frequency, except at sound frequencies below 200 cycles/sec. Above the level of the inferior colliculi, even this synchronization is mainly lost. These findings demonstrate that the sound signals are not transmitted unchanged directly from the ear to the higher levels of the brain; instead, information from the sound signals begins to be dissected from the impulse traffic at levels as low as the cochlear nuclei. We will have more to say about this subject later, especially in relation to perception of direction from which sound comes.

## FUNCTION OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX IN HEARING

The projection area of auditory signals to the cerebral cortex is shown in Figure 53-10, which demonstrates that the auditory cortex lies principally on the supratemporal plane of the superior temporal gyrus but also extends onto the lateral side of the temporal lobe, over much of the insular cortex, and even onto the lateral portion of the parietal operculum.

Two separate subdivisions are shown in Figure 53-10-the primary auditory cortex and the auditory association cortex (also called the secondary auditory cortex). The primary auditory cortex is directly excited by projections from the medial geniculate body, whereas the auditory association areas are excited secondarily by impulses from the primary auditory cortex, as well as by some projections from thalamic association areas adjacent to the medial geniculate body.

Sound Frequency Perception in the Primary Auditory Cortex. At least six tonotopic maps have been described in the primary auditory cortex and auditory association areas. In each of these maps, high-frequency sounds excite neurons at one end of the map, whereas low-frequency sounds excite neurons at the opposite end. In most maps, the low-frequency sounds are located anteriorly, as shown in Figure 53-10, and the high-frequency sounds are located posteriorly. This setup is not true for all the maps.

Why does the auditory cortex have so many different tonotopic maps? The answer, presumably, is that each of the separate areas dissects out some specific feature of the sounds. For example, one of the large maps in the primary auditory cortex almost certainly discriminates the sound frequencies and gives the person the psychic sensation of sound pitches. Another map is probably used to detect the direction from which the sound comes. Other auditory cortex areas detect special qualities, such as the

![gu5810682559](gu5810682559.jpg)

Figure 53-10. Auditory cortex.
sudden onset of sounds, or perhaps special modulations, such as noise versus pure frequency sounds.

The frequency range to which each individual neuron in the auditory cortex responds is much narrower than that in the cochlear and brain stem relay nuclei. Referring to Figure 53-5B, note that the basilar membrane near the base of the cochlea is stimulated by sounds of all frequencies and, in the cochlear nuclei, this same breadth of sound representation is found. Yet, by the time the excitation has reached the cerebral cortex, most sound-responsive neurons respond only to a narrow range of frequencies rather than to a broad range. Therefore, somewhere along the pathway, processing mechanisms "sharpen" the frequency response. This sharpening effect is believed to be caused mainly by lateral inhibition, discussed in Chapter 47 in relation to mechanisms for transmitting information in nerves. That is, stimulation of the cochlea at one frequency inhibits sound frequencies on both sides of this primary frequency; this inhibition is caused by collateral fibers angling off the primary signal pathway and exerting inhibitory influences on adjacent pathways. This same effect is important in sharpening patterns of somesthetic images, visual images, and other types of sensations.

Many of the neurons in the auditory cortex, especially in the auditory association cortex, do not respond only to specific sound frequencies in the ear. It is believed that these neurons "associate" different sound frequencies with one another or associate sound information with information from other sensory areas of the cortex.

Indeed, the parietal portion of the auditory association cortex partly overlaps somatosensory area II, which could provide an opportunity for the association of auditory information with somatosensory information.

## Discrimination of Sound "Patterns" by the Auditory

Cortex. Complete bilateral removal of the auditory cortex does not prevent a cat or monkey from detecting sounds or reacting in a crude manner to sounds. However, it does greatly reduce or sometimes even abolish the animal's ability to discriminate different sound pitches and especially patterns of sound. For example, an animal that has been trained to recognize a combination or sequence of tones, one following the other in a particular pattern, loses this ability when the auditory cortex is destroyed; furthermore, the animal cannot relearn this type of response. Therefore, the auditory cortex is especially important in the discrimination of tonal and sequential sound patterns.

Destruction of both primary auditory cortices in the human being greatly reduces one's sensitivity for hearing. Destruction of one side only slightly reduces hearing in the opposite ear; it does not cause deafness in the ear because of many crossover connections from side to side in the auditory neural pathway. However, it does affect one's ability to localize the source of a sound because comparative signals in both cortices are required for sound localization.

Lesions that affect the auditory association areas but not the primary auditory cortex do not decrease a person's ability to hear and differentiate sound tones or even to interpret at least simple patterns of sound. However, the person is often unable to interpret the meaning of the sound heard. For example, lesions in the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus, which is called Wernicke's area and is part of the auditory association cortex, often make it impossible for a person to interpret the meanings of words even though he or she hears them perfectly well and can even repeat them. These functions of the auditory association areas and their relation to the overall intellectual functions of the brain are discussed in Chapter 58.

## DETERMINATION OF THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH SOUND COMES

A person determines the horizontal direction from which sound comes by two principal means: (1) the time lag between the entry of sound into one ear and its entry into the opposite ear; and (2) the difference between the intensities of the sounds in the two ears.

The first mechanism functions best at frequencies below 3000 cycles/sec, and the second mechanism operates best at higher frequencies because the head is a greater sound barrier at these frequencies. The time lag mechanism discriminates direction much more exactly than the intensity mechanism because it does not depend on extraneous factors but only on the exact interval of time between two acoustical signals. If a person is looking straight toward the source of the sound, the sound

reaches both ears at exactly the same instant, whereas if the right ear is closer to the sound than the left ear is, the sound signals from the right ear enter the brain ahead of those from the left ear.

These two mechanisms cannot tell whether the sound is emanating from in front of or behind the person or from above or below. This discrimination is achieved mainly by the pinnae (the visible outer part), which act as funnels to direct the sound into the two ears. The shape of the pinna changes the quality of the sound entering the ear, depending on the direction from which the sound comes. It changes the quality by emphasizing specific sound frequencies from the different directions.

Neural Mechanisms for Detecting Sound Direction. Destruction of the auditory cortex on both sides of the brain causes loss of almost all ability to detect the direction from which sound comes. Yet, the neural analyses for this detection process begin in the superior olivary nuclei in the brain stem, even though the neural pathways all the way from these nuclei to the cortex are required for interpretation of the signals. The mechanism is believed to be the following.

The superior olivary nucleus is divided into two sections: (1) the medial superior olivary nucleus; and (2) the lateral superior olivary nucleus. The lateral nucleus is concerned with detecting the direction from which the sound is coming, presumably by simply comparing the difference in intensities of the sound reaching the two ears and sending an appropriate signal to the auditory cortex to estimate the direction.

The medial superior olivary nucleus, however, has a specific mechanism for detecting the time lag between acoustical signals entering the two ears. This nucleus contains large numbers of neurons that have two major dendrites, one projecting to the right and the other to the left. The acoustical signal from the right ear impinges on the right dendrite, and the signal from the left ear impinges on the left dendrite. The intensity of excitation of each neuron is highly sensitive to a specific time lag between the two acoustical signals from the two ears. The neurons near one border of the nucleus respond maximally to a short time lag, whereas those near the opposite border respond to a long time lag; those in between respond to intermediate time lags.

Thus, a spatial pattern of neuronal stimulation develops in the medial superior olivary nucleus, with sound from directly in front of the head stimulating one set of olivary neurons maximally and sounds from different side angles stimulating other sets of neurons on opposite sides. This spatial orientation of signals is then transmitted to the auditory cortex, where sound direction is determined by the locus of the maximally stimulated neurons. All these signals for determining sound direction are believed to be transmitted through a different pathway and excite a different locus in the cerebral cortex from the transmission pathway and termination locus for tonal patterns of sound.

This mechanism for detection of sound direction indicates again how specific information in sensory signals is dissected out as the signals pass through different levels of neuronal activity. In this case, the "quality" of sound direction is separated from the "quality" of sound tones at the level of the superior olivary nuclei.

## Centrifugal Signals From the Central Nervous System to Lower Auditory Centers

Retrograde pathways have been demonstrated at each level of the auditory nervous system from the brain cortex to the cochlea in the ear. The final pathway is mainly from the superior olivary nucleus to the sound-receptor hair cells in the organ of Corti.

These retrograde fibers are inhibitory. Indeed, direct stimulation of discrete points in the olivary nucleus has been shown to inhibit specific areas of the organ of Corti, reducing their sound sensitivities by 15 to 20 decibels. One can readily understand how this mechanism could allow someone to direct their attention to sounds of particular qualities while rejecting sounds of other qualities. This characteristic is readily demonstrated when one listens to a single instrument in a symphony orchestra.

## Types of Deafness

Deafness is usually divided into two types: (1) that caused by impairment of the cochlea, the auditory nerve, or the central nervous system circuits from the ear, which is usually classified as "nerve deafness," and (2) that caused by impairment of the physical structures of the ear that conduct sound itself to the cochlea, which is usually called "conduction deafness."

If either the cochlea or the auditory nerve is destroyed, the person becomes permanently deaf. However, if the cochlea and nerve are still intact but the tympanumossicular system has been destroyed or ankylosed ("frozen" in place by fibrosis or calcification), sound waves can still be conducted into the cochlea by means of bone conduction from a sound generator applied to the skull over the ear.

Audiometer. To determine the nature of hearing disabilities, an audiometer is used. This instrument is an earphone connected to an electronic oscillator capable of emitting pure tones ranging from low frequencies to high frequencies, and it is calibrated so that zero-intensity-level sound at each frequency is the loudness that can barely be heard by the normal ear. A calibrated volume control can increase the loudness above the zero level. If the loudness must be increased to 30 decibels above normal before it can be heard, the person is said to have a hearing loss of 30 decibels at that particular frequency.

In performing a hearing test using an audiometer, one tests about 8 to 10 frequencies covering the auditory spectrum, and the hearing loss is determined for each of these frequencies. Then the so-called audiogram is plotted, as shown in Figure 53-11 and 53-12, depicting hearing loss at each of the frequencies in the auditory spectrum. The audiometer, in addition to being equipped with an earphone for testing air conduction by the ear, is equipped with a mechanical vibrator for testing bone conduction from the mastoid process of the skull into the cochlea.

or the central nervous system circuits from the ear, the person has loss of ability to hear sound as tested by both air conduction and bone conduction. An audiogram depicting partial nerve deafness is shown in Figure 53-11. In this figure, the deafness is mainly for high-frequency sound. Such deafness could be caused by damage to the base of the cochlea. This type of deafness occurs to some extent in almost all older people.

Other patterns of nerve deafness frequently occur as follows: (1) deafness for low-frequency sounds caused by excessive and prolonged exposure to very loud sounds (e.g., a rock band or a jet airplane engine) because low-frequency sounds are usually louder and more damaging to the organ of Corti; and (2) deafness for all frequencies caused by drug sensitivity of the organ of Corti-in particular, sensitivity to some antibiotics such as streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol.

Audiogram for Middle Ear Conduction Deafness. A common type of deafness is caused by fibrosis in the middle ear after repeated infection or by fibrosis that occurs in the hereditary disease called otosclerosis. In either case, the sound waves cannot be transmitted easily through the ossicles from the tympanic membrane to the oval window. Figure 53-12 shows an audiogram from a person with "middle ear air conduction deafness." In this case, bone conduction
is essentially normal, but conduction through the ossicular system is greatly depressed at all frequencies, but more so at low frequencies. In some cases of conduction deafness, the faceplate of the stapes becomes "ankylosed" by bone overgrowth to the edges of the oval window. Here, the person becomes totally deaf for ossicular conduction but can regain almost normal hearing by the surgical removal of the stapes and its replacement with a minute Teflon or metal prosthesis that transmits the sound from the incus to the oval window.

# The Chemical Senses-Taste and Smell 

The senses of taste and smell allow us to separate undesirable or even lethal foods from those that are pleasant to eat and nutritious. They also elicit physiological responses involved in the digestion and utilization of foods. The sense of smell allows animals to recognize the proximity of other animals or even individual animals. Finally, both senses are strongly tied to primitive emotional and behavioral functions of our nervous systems. In this chapter, we discuss how taste and smell stimuli are detected and how they are encoded in neural signals transmitted to the brain.

## SENSE OF TASTE

Taste is mainly a function of the taste buds in the mouth, but it is common experience that one's sense of smell also contributes strongly to taste perception. In addition, the texture of food, as detected by tactual senses of the mouth, and the presence of substances in the food that stimulate pain endings, such as pepper, greatly alter the taste experience. The importance of taste lies in the fact that it allows a person to select food in accord with desires and often in accord with the body tissues' metabolic need for specific substances.

## PRIMARY TASTE SENSATIONS

The identities of the many specific chemicals that excite different taste receptors are not all known. For practical analysis, the primary sensations of taste have been grouped into five general categories-sour, salty, sweet, bitter, and "umami."

A person can perceive hundreds of different tastes. They are all thought to be combinations of the elementary taste sensations, just as all the colors we can see are combinations of the three primary colors, as described in Chapter 51.

Sour Taste. The sour taste is caused by acids-that is, by the hydrogen ion concentration-and the intensity of this taste sensation is approximately proportional to the logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration (i.e., the more acidic the food, the stronger the sour sensation becomes).

Salty Taste. The salty taste is elicited by ionized salts, mainly by the sodium ion concentration. The quality of the taste varies somewhat from one salt to another because some salts elicit other taste sensations in addition to saltiness. The cations of the salts, especially sodium cations, are mainly responsible for the salty taste, but the anions also contribute to a lesser extent.

Sweet Taste. The sweet taste is not caused by any single class of chemicals. Some of the types of chemicals that cause this taste include sugars, glycols, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, amides, esters, some amino acids, some small proteins, sulfonic acids, halogenated acids, and inorganic salts of lead and beryllium. Note specifically that most of the substances that cause a sweet taste are organic chemicals. It is especially interesting that slight changes in the chemical structure, such as the addition of a simple radical, can often change the substance from sweet to bitter.

Bitter Taste. The bitter taste, like the sweet taste, is not caused by any single type of chemical agent. Here again, the substances that give the bitter taste are almost entirely organic substances. Two particular classes of substances are especially likely to cause bitter taste sensations: (1) long-chain organic substances that contain nitrogen; and (2) alkaloids. The alkaloids include many of the drugs used in medicines, such as quinine, caffeine, strychnine, and nicotine.

Some substances that initially taste sweet have a bitter aftertaste. This characteristic is true of saccharin, which makes this substance objectionable to some people. High concentrations of salts may also result in a bitter taste.

The bitter taste, when it occurs in high intensity, usually causes the person or animal to reject the food. This reaction is undoubtedly an important function of the bitter taste sensation because many deadly toxins found in poisonous plants are alkaloids, and virtually all these alkaloids cause an intensely bitter taste, usually followed by rejection of the food.

Umami Taste. Umami, a Japanese word meaning "delicious," designates a pleasant taste sensation that is qualitatively different from sour, salty, sweet, or bitter. Umami is

the dominant taste of food containing L-glutamate, such as meat extracts and aging cheese. The pleasurable sensation of umami taste is thought to be important for nutrition by promoting ingestion of proteins.

## THRESHOLD FOR TASTE

The molar threshold for stimulation of the sour taste by hydrochloric acid averages 0.0009 M , for stimulation of the salty taste by sodium chloride, 0.01 M , for the sweet taste by sucrose, 0.01 M , and for the bitter taste by quinine, 0.000008 M . Note especially that the bitter taste sense is much more sensitive than all the others, which provides an important protective function against many dangerous toxins in food.

Table 54-1 lists the relative taste indices (the reciprocals of the taste thresholds) of different substances. In this table, the intensities of four of the primary sensations of taste are referred, respectively, to the intensities of the taste of hydrochloric acid, quinine, sucrose, and sodium chloride, each of which is arbitrarily chosen to have a taste index of 1 .

Taste Blindness. Some people are taste blind for certain substances, especially for different types of thiourea compounds. A substance used frequently by psychologists for demonstrating taste blindness is phenylthiocarbamide, for which about $15 \%$ to $30 \%$ of all people exhibit taste blindness; the exact percentage depends on the method of testing and the concentration of the substance.

## TASTE BUDS AND THEIR FUNCTION

Figure 54-1B shows a taste bud, which has a diameter of about $1 / 50$ of a millimeter and a length of about $1 / 16$ of a millimeter. The taste bud is composed of epithelial cells; some are supporting cells called sustentacular cells and others are called taste cells. There are about 100
taste cells in each taste bud. The taste cells are continually being replaced by mitotic division of surrounding epithelial cells, so some taste cells are young cells. Others are mature cells that lie toward the center of the bud; these cells soon break up and dissolve. The average life span of each taste cell is estimated to be about 10 days, although there is considerable variation, with some taste cells being eliminated in only 2 days while others may survive for over 3 weeks.

The outer tips of the taste cells are arranged around a minute taste pore, shown in Figure 54-1B. From the tip of each taste cell, several microvilli, or taste hairs, protrude outward into the taste pore to approach the cavity of the mouth. These microvilli provide the receptor surface for taste.

Interwoven around the bodies of the taste cells is a branching terminal network of taste nerve fibers that are stimulated by the taste receptor cells. Some of these fibers invaginate into folds of the taste cell membranes. Many vesicles form beneath the cell membrane near the fibers. These vesicles are believed to contain a neurotransmitter substance that is released through the cell membrane to excite the nerve fiber endings in response to taste stimulation.

Location of the Taste Buds. The taste buds are found on three types of papillae of the tongue, as follows (see Figure 54-1A): (1) a large number of taste buds are on the walls of the troughs that surround the circumvallate papillae, which form a V line on the surface of the posterior tongue; (2) moderate numbers are on the foliate papillae located in the folds along the lateral surfaces of the tongue; and (3) moderate numbers of taste buds are on the fungiform papillae over the flat anterior surface of the tongue. Additional taste buds are located on the palate, and a few are found on the tonsillar pillars,

on the epiglottis, and even in the proximal esophagus. Adults have 3000 to 10,000 taste buds, and children have a few more. Beyond the age of 45 years, many taste buds degenerate, causing taste sensitivity to decrease in old age.

## Specificity of Taste Buds for a Primary Taste Stimulus.

Microelectrode studies from single taste buds show that each taste bud usually responds mostly to one of the five primary taste stimuli when the taste substance is in low concentration. However, at high concentration, most buds can be excited by two or more of the primary taste stimuli, as well as by a few other taste stimuli that do not fit into the "primary" categories.

## Mechanism of Stimulation of Taste Buds

Receptor Potential. The membrane of the taste cell, like that of most other sensory receptor cells, is negatively charged on the inside with respect to the outside. Application of a taste substance to the taste hairs causes partial loss of this negative potential-that is, the taste cell becomes depolarized. In most cases, the decrease in potential, within a wide range, is approximately proportional to the logarithm of concentration of the stimulating substance. This change in electrical potential in the taste cell is called the receptor potential for taste.

The mechanism whereby most stimulating substances react with the taste villi to initiate the receptor potential is by binding of the taste chemical to a protein receptor molecule that lies on the outer surface of the taste receptor cell, near to or protruding through a villus membrane. This action, in turn, opens ion channels, which allows positively charged sodium ions or hydrogen ions to enter and depolarize the normal negativity of the cell. Then, the taste chemical is gradually washed away from the taste villus by the saliva, which removes the stimulus.

The type of receptor protein in each taste villus determines the type of taste that will be perceived. For sodium ions and hydrogen ions, which elicit salty and sour taste sensations, respectively, the receptor proteins open specific ion channels, likely the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), in the apical membranes of the taste cells, thereby activating the receptors. However, for the sweet and bitter taste sensations, the portions of the G-protein coupled receptors that protrude through the apical membranes activate second-messenger transmitter substances inside the taste cells; these second messengers cause intracellular chemical changes that elicit the taste signals.

Sweet-tasting compounds are detected by a combination of two closely related G-protein-coupled taste receptors, T1R2 and T1R3. The receptors responsible for umami taste is believed to be a complex of T1R1 and T1R3 proteins. Thus, T1R3 appears to function as a coreceptor for sweet and umami tastes.

Bitter taste is sensed by another family (T2R) of approximately 30 different G-protein coupled receptors. Individual bitter-sensing taste receptor cells express multiple T2Rs, each of which recognizes a unique set of bitter compounds. This pattern of receptor expression permits detection of a variety of bitter compounds through a single type of taste receptor cell.

Sour taste, associated with acidic food or drink, is believed to be sensed by ion channels that are opened by hydrogen ions although the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent studies suggest that an acidsensitive potassium channel (KIR2.1) and a hydrogen ion-selective ion channel (otopetrin 1) may mediate acid responses in taste receptor cells.

Generation of Nerve Impulses by the Taste Bud. On first application of the taste stimulus, the rate of discharge of the nerve fibers from taste buds rises to a peak in a

small fraction of a second but then adapts within the next few seconds back to a lower steady level as long as the taste stimulus remains. Thus, a strong immediate signal is transmitted by the taste nerve, and a weaker continuous signal is transmitted as long as the taste bud is exposed to the taste stimulus.

## TRANSMISSION OF TASTE SIGNALS INTO THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

Figures 54-1 and 54-2 show the neuronal pathways for transmission of taste signals from the tongue and pharyngeal region into the central nervous system. Taste impulses from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue pass first into the lingual nerve, then through the chorda tympani into the facial nerve, and finally into the tractus solitarius in the brain stem. Taste sensations from the circumvallate papillae on the back of the tongue and from other posterior regions of the mouth and throat are transmitted through the glossopharyngeal nerve also into the tractus solitarius, but at a slightly more posterior level. Finally, a few taste signals are transmitted into the tractus solitarius from the base of the tongue and other parts of the pharyngeal region by way of the vagus nerve.

All taste fibers synapse in the posterior brain stem in the nuclei of the tractus solitarius. These nuclei send second-order neurons to a small area of the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus, located slightly medial to the thalamic terminations of the facial regions of the dorsal column-medial lemniscal system. From

the thalamus, third-order neurons are transmitted to the lower tip of the postcentral gyrus in the parietal cerebral cortex, where it curls deep into the sylvian fissure, and into the adjacent opercular insular area. This area lies slightly lateral, ventral, and rostral to the area for tongue tactile signals in cerebral somatic area I. From this description of the taste pathways, it is evident that they closely parallel the somatosensory pathways from the tongue.
Taste Reflexes Are Integrated in the Brain Stem. From the tractus solitarius, many taste signals are transmitted within the brain stem itself directly into the superior and inferior salivatory nuclei. These areas transmit signals to the submandibular, sublingual, and parotid glands to help control the secretion of saliva during the ingestion and digestion of food.
Rapid Adaptation of Taste. Everyone is familiar with the fact that taste sensations adapt rapidly, often almost completely, within a minute or so of continuous stimulation. Yet, from electrophysiological studies of taste nerve fibers, it is clear that adaptation of the taste buds usually accounts for no more than about half of this rapid taste adaptation. Therefore, the final extreme degree of adaptation that occurs in the sensation of taste almost certainly occurs in the central nervous system, although the mechanisms are not known. This mechanism of adaptation is different from that of many other sensory systems, which adapt mainly at the receptors.

## TASTE PREFERENCE AND CONTROL OF THE DIET

Taste preference simply means that an animal will choose certain types of food in preference to others, and the animal automatically uses this preference to help control what it eats. Furthermore, its taste preferences often change in accord with the body's need for certain specific substances.

The following experiments demonstrate this ability of animals to choose food in accord with the needs of their bodies. First, adrenalectomized, salt-depleted animals automatically select drinking water with a high concentration of sodium chloride in preference to pure water, and the amount of sodium chloride in the water is often sufficient to supply the needs of the body and prevent death due to salt depletion. Second, an animal given injections of excessive amounts of insulin develops a depleted blood sugar level, and the animal automatically chooses the sweetest food from among many samples. Third, calcium-depleted, parathyroidectomized animals automatically choose drinking water with a high concentration of calcium chloride.

The same phenomena are also observed in everyday life. For example, the "salt licks" of desert regions are known to attract animals from far and wide. Also, human beings reject food that has an unpleasant affective sensation, which in many cases protects our bodies from undesirable substances.

The phenomenon of taste preference almost certainly results from some mechanism located in the central nervous system and not from a mechanism in the taste receptors, although the receptors often become sensitized in favor of a needed nutrient. An important reason for believing that taste preference is mainly a central nervous system phenomenon is that previous experience with unpleasant or pleasant tastes plays a major role in determining one's taste preferences. For example, if a person becomes sick soon after eating a particular type of food, the person then generally develops a negative taste preference, or taste aversion, for that particular food; the same effect can be demonstrated in lower animals.

## SENSE OF SMELL

Smell is the least understood of our senses, partly because the sense of smell is a subjective phenomenon that cannot be studied with ease in lower animals. Another complicating problem is that the sense of smell is poorly developed in human beings compared with the sense of smell in many other mammals.

## OLFACTORY MEMBRANE

The olfactory membrane, the histology of which is shown in Figure 54-3, lies in the superior part of the nasal cavity. Medially, the olfactory membrane folds downward along the surface of the superior septum; laterally, it folds over the superior turbinate and even over a small portion of the upper surface of the middle turbinate. The olfactory membrane has a total surface area of about 5 square centimeters in humans.

Olfactory Cells Are the Receptor Cells for Smell Sensation. The olfactory cells (see Figure 53-3) are actually bipolar nerve cells derived originally from the central nervous system. There are about 100 million of these cells in the olfactory epithelium interspersed among sustentacular cells, as shown in Figure 54-3. The mucosal end of the olfactory cell forms a knob from which 4 to 25 olfactory hairs (also called olfactory cilia), measuring 0.3 micrometer in diameter and up to 200 micrometers in length, project into the mucus that coats the inner surface of the nasal cavity. These projecting olfactory cilia form a dense mat in the mucus, and it is these cilia that react to odors in the air and stimulate the olfactory cells, as discussed later. Spaced among the olfactory cells in the olfactory membrane are many small Bowman glands that secrete mucus onto the surface of the olfactory membrane.

## STIMULATION OF THE OLFACTORY CELLS

Mechanism of Excitation of the Olfactory Cells. The portion of each olfactory cell that responds to the olfactory chemical stimuli is the olfactory cilia. The odorant substance, on coming in contact with the olfactory membrane surface, first diffuses into the mucus that covers the
cilia and then it binds with receptor proteins in the membrane of each cilium (Figure 54-4). Each receptor protein is actually a long molecule that threads its way through the membrane about seven times, folding inward and outward.
![gu6310682559](gu6310682559.jpg)

Figure 54-3. Organization of the olfactory membrane and olfactory bulb and connections to the olfactory tract.
![gu6410682559](gu6410682559.jpg)

Figure 54-4. Summary of olfactory signal transduction. Binding of the odorant to a G-protein-coupled receptor causes the activation of adenylate cyclase, which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The cAMP activates a gated sodium channel that increases sodium influx and depolarizes the cell, exciting the olfactory neuron and transmitting action potentials to the central nervous system.

The odorant binds with the portion of the receptor protein that folds to the outside. The inside of the folding protein is coupled to a $G$ protein, itself a combination of three subunits. On excitation of the receptor protein, an alpha subunit breaks away from the G protein and activates adenylyl cyclase, which is attached to the inside of the ciliary membrane near the receptor cell body. The activated cyclase, in turn, converts many molecules of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Finally, this cAMP activates another nearby membrane protein, a gated sodium ion channel, that opens its "gate" and allows large numbers of sodium ions to pour through the membrane into the receptor cell cytoplasm. The sodium ions increase the electrical potential in the positive direction inside the cell membrane, thus exciting the olfactory neuron and transmitting action potentials into the central nervous system via the olfactory nerve.

The importance of this mechanism for activating olfactory nerves is that it greatly multiplies the excitatory effect of even the weakest odorant. To summarize: (1) activation of the receptor protein by the odorant substance activates the G-protein complex, which, in turn (2) activates multiple molecules of adenylyl cyclase inside the olfactory cell membrane, which (3) causes the formation of many times more molecules of cAMP, and finally, (4) the cAMP opens still many times more sodium ion channels. Therefore, even a minute concentration of a specific odorant initiates a cascading effect that opens extremely large numbers of sodium channels. This process accounts for the exquisite sensitivity of the olfactory neurons to even the slightest amount of odorant.

In addition to the basic chemical mechanism whereby the olfactory cells are stimulated, several physical factors affect the degree of stimulation. First, only volatile substances that can be sniffed into the nasal cavity can be smelled. Second, the stimulating substance must be at least slightly water-soluble so that it can pass through the mucus to reach the olfactory cilia. Third, it is helpful for the substance to be at least slightly lipid-soluble, presumably because lipid constituents of the cilium are a weak barrier to non-lipid-soluble odorants.

Membrane Potentials and Action Potentials in Olfactory Cells. The membrane potential inside unstimulated olfactory cells, as measured by microelectrodes, averages about $\sim 55$ millivolts. At this potential, most of the cells generate continuous action potentials at a very slow rate, varying from once every 20 seconds up to two or three per second.

Most odorants cause depolarization of the olfactory cell membrane, decreasing the negative potential in the cell from the normal level of -55 millivolts to -30 millivolts or less. Along with this, the number of action potentials increases to 20 to 30 per second, which is a high rate for the minute olfactory nerve fibers.

Over a wide range, the rate of olfactory nerve impulses changes approximately in proportion to the logarithm of
the stimulus strength, which demonstrates that the olfactory receptors obey principles of transduction similar to those of other sensory receptors.

Rapid Adaptation of Olfactory Sensations. The olfactory receptors adapt about $50 \%$ in the first second or so after stimulation. Thereafter, they adapt very little and very slowly. Yet, we all know from our own experience that smell sensations adapt almost to extinction within a minute or so after entering a strongly odorous atmosphere. Because this psychological adaptation is far greater than the degree of adaptation of the receptors, it is almost certain that most of the additional adaptation occurs in the central nervous system, which seems to be true for the adaptation of taste sensations as well.

The following neuronal mechanism for the adaptation is postulated: large numbers of centrifugal nerve fibers pass from the olfactory regions of the brain backward along the olfactory tract and terminate on special inhibitory cells in the olfactory bulb, the granule cells. After the onset of an olfactory stimulus, the central nervous system quickly develops strong feedback inhibition to suppress relay of the smell signals through the olfactory bulb.

## Search for the Primary Sensations of Smell

In the past, most physiologists were convinced that the many smell sensations are subserved by a few rather discrete primary sensations in the same way that vision and taste are subserved by a few select primary sensations. On the basis of psychological studies, one attempt to classify these sensations is the following:

1. Camphoraceous
2. Musky
3. Floral
4. Pepperminty
5. Ethereal
6. Pungent
7. Putrid

It is certain that this list does not represent the true primary sensations of smell. Multiple clues, including specific studies of the genes that encode for the receptor proteins, suggest the existence of at least 100 primary sensations of smell-a marked contrast to only three primary sensations of color detected by the eyes and only five primary sensations of taste detected by the tongue. Some studies suggest that there may be as many as 1000 different types of odorant receptors. Further support for the many primary sensations of smell is that people have been found who have odor blindness for single substances; such discrete odor blindness has been identified for more than 50 different substances. It is presumed that odor blindness for each substance represents lack of the appropriate receptor protein in olfactory cells for that particular substance.

Affective Nature of Smell. Smell, even more so than taste, has the affective quality of either pleasantness or

unpleasantness, and thus smell is probably even more important than taste for the selection of food. A person who has previously eaten food that disagreed with him or her is often nauseated by the smell of that same food on a second occasion. Conversely, perfume of the right quality can be a powerful stimulant of human emotions. In addition, in some animals, odors are the primary excitant of sexual drive.

Threshold for Smell. One of the principal characteristics of smell is the minute quantity of stimulating agent in the air that can elicit a smell sensation. For example, the substance methylmercaptan can be smelled when only one 25 trillionth of a gram is present in each milliliter of air. Because of this very low threshold, this substance is mixed with natural gas to give the gas an odor that can be detected when even small amounts of gas leak from a pipeline.

Gradations of Smell Intensities. Although the threshold concentrations of substances that evoke smell are extremely slight, for many (if not most) odorants, concentrations only 10 to 50 times above the threshold evoke maximum intensity of smell. This range of intensity discrimination is in contrast to most other sensory systems of the body, in which the ranges of intensity discrimination are tremendous-for example, 500,000 to 1 for the eyes and 1 trillion to 1 for the ears. This difference might be explained by the fact that smell is concerned more with detecting the presence or absence of odors rather than with quantitative detection of their intensities.

## TRANSMISSION OF SMELL SIGNALS INTO THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

The olfactory portions of the brain were among the first brain structures developed in primitive animals, and much of the remainder of the brain developed around these olfactory beginnings. In fact, part of the brain that originally subserved olfaction later evolved into the basal brain structures that control emotions and other aspects of human behavior; we call this system the limbic system, as discussed in Chapter 59.

Transmission of Olfactory Signals Into the Olfactory Bulb. The olfactory bulb is shown in Figure 54-5. The olfactory nerve fibers leading backward from the bulb are called cranial nerve $I$, or the olfactory tract. In reality, both the tract and the bulb are an anterior outgrowth of brain tissue from the base of the brain; the bulbous enlargement at its end, the olfactory bulb, lies over the cribriform plate, separating the brain cavity from the upper reaches of the nasal cavity. The cribriform plate has multiple small perforations through which an equal number of small nerves pass upward from the olfactory membrane in the nasal cavity to enter the olfactory bulb in the cranial cavity. Figure 54-3 demonstrates the close relation between the olfactory cells in the olfactory membrane and the olfactory bulb, showing short axons from the olfactory cells
terminating in multiple globular structures in the olfactory bulb called glomeruli. Each bulb has several thousand such glomeruli, each of which is the terminus for about 25,000 axons from olfactory cells. Each glomerulus also is the terminus for dendrites from about 25 large mitral cells and about 60 smaller tufted cells, the cell bodies of which lie in the olfactory bulb superior to the glomeruli. These dendrites receive synapses from the olfactory cell neurons; the mitral and tufted cells send axons through the olfactory tract to transmit olfactory signals to higher levels in the central nervous system.

Some research has suggested that different glomeruli respond to different odors. It is possible that specific glomeruli are the real clue to the analysis of different odor signals transmitted into the central nervous system.

## Primitive and Newer Olfactory Pathways Into the Central Nervous System

The olfactory tract enters the brain at the anterior junction between the mesencephalon and cerebrum; there, the tract divides into two pathways, as shown in Figure 54-5, one passing medially into the medial olfactory area of the brain stem and the other passing laterally into the lateral olfactory area. The medial olfactory area represents a very primitive olfactory system, whereas the lateral olfactory area is the input to the following: (1) a less old olfactory system; and (2) a newer system.

## The Primitive Olfactory System—The Medial Olfactory

Area. The medial olfactory area consists of a group of nuclei located in the midbasal portions of the brain immediately anterior to the hypothalamus. Most conspicuous are the septal nuclei, which are midline nuclei that feed into the hypothalamus and other primitive portions of the brain's limbic system. This is the brain area most concerned with basic behavior (as described in Chapter 59).

The importance of this medial olfactory area is best understood by considering what happens in animals
![gu6510682559](gu6510682559.jpg)

Figure 54-5. Neural connections of the olfactory system.

when the lateral olfactory areas on both sides of the brain are removed, and only the medial system remains. The removal of these areas hardly affects the more basic responses to olfaction, such as licking the lips, salivation, and other feeding responses caused by the smell of food or by basic emotional drives associated with smell. Conversely, removal of the lateral areas abolishes the more complicated olfactory conditioned reflexes.

## The Less Old Olfactory System—The Lateral Olfactory

Area. The lateral olfactory area is composed mainly of the prepyriform and pyriform cortex plus the cortical portion of the amygdaloid nuclei. From these areas, signal pathways pass into almost all portions of the limbic system, especially into less primitive portions such as the hippocampus, which seem to be most important for learning to like or dislike certain foods depending on one's experiences with them. For example, it is believed that this lateral olfactory area and its many connections with the limbic behavioral system cause a person to develop an absolute aversion to foods that have caused nausea and vomiting.

An important feature of the lateral olfactory area is that many signal pathways from this area also feed directly into an older part of the cerebral cortex called the paleocortex in the anteromedial portion of the temporal lobe. This area is the only area of the entire cerebral cortex where sensory signals pass directly to the cortex without passing first through the thalamus.

The Newer Pathway. A newer olfactory pathway that passes through the thalamus, passing to the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus and then to the lateroposterior quadrant of the orbitofrontale cortex, has been found. On the basis of studies in monkeys, this newer system probably helps in the conscious analysis of odor.

Summary. Thus, there appear to be a primitive olfactory system that subserves the basic olfactory reflexes, a less old system that provides automatic but partially learned control of food intake and aversion to toxic and unhealthy foods, and a newer system that is comparable to most of the other cortical sensory systems and is used for conscious perception and analysis of olfaction.

Centrifugal Control of Activity in the Olfactory Bulb by the Central Nervous System. Many nerve fibers that originate in the olfactory portions of the brain pass from the brain in the outward direction into the olfactory tract to the olfactory bulb (i.e., centrifugally from the brain to the periphery). These nerve fibers terminate on a large number of small granule cells located among the mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb. The granule cells send inhibitory signals to the mitral and tufted cells. This inhibitory feedback may be a means for sharpening a person's specific ability to distinguish one odor from another.

# Spinal Cord Motor Functions; the Cord Reflexes 

Sensory information is integrated at all levels of the nervous system and causes appropriate motor responses that begin in the spinal cord with relatively simple muscle reflexes, extend into the brain stem with more complicated responses, and finally extend to the cerebrum, where the most complicated muscle skills are controlled.

In this chapter, we discuss spinal cord control of muscle function. Without the special neuronal circuits of the cord, even the most complex motor control systems in the brain could not cause any purposeful muscle movement. For example, there is no neuronal circuit anywhere in the brain that causes the specific to-and-fro movements of the legs that are required in walking. Instead, the circuits for these movements are in the cord, and the brain simply sends command signals to the spinal cord to set into motion the walking process.

Let us not belittle the role of the brain. The brain gives directions that control the sequential cord activities-for example, to promote turning movements when they are required, to lean the body forward during acceleration, to change the movements from walking to jumping as needed, and to monitor continuously and control equilibrium. All this is done through "analytical" and "command" signals generated in the brain. However, the many neuronal circuits of the spinal cord that are the objects of the commands are also required. These circuits provide all but a small fraction of the direct control of the muscles.

## ORGANIZATION OF THE SPINAL CORD FOR MOTOR FUNCTIONS

The cord gray matter is the integrative area for the cord reflexes. Figure 55-1 shows the typical organization of the cord gray matter in a single cord segment. Sensory signals enter the cord almost entirely through the sensory roots, also known as the posterior or dorsal roots. After entering the cord, every sensory signal travels to two separate destinations: one branch of the sensory nerve terminates almost immediately in the gray matter of the cord and elicits local segmental cord reflexes and other local effects; another branch transmits signals to higher
levels of the nervous system-that is, to higher levels in the cord, to the brain stem, or even to the cerebral cortex, as described in earlier chapters.

Each segment of the spinal cord (at the level of each spinal nerve) has several million neurons in its gray matter. Aside from the sensory relay neurons discussed in Chapters 48 and 49 , the other neurons are of two types: (1) anterior motor neurons and (2) interneurons.

Anterior Motor Neurons. Located in each segment of the anterior horns of the cord gray matter are several thousand neurons that are 50 to $100 \%$ larger than most of the others and are called anterior motor neurons (Figure 55-2). They give rise to the nerve fibers that leave the cord by way of the anterior roots and directly innervate the skeletal muscle fibers. The neurons are of two types, alpha motor neurons and gamma motor neurons.
