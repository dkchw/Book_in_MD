# Metabolism of Carbohydrates and Formation of Adenosine Triphosphate 

The next few chapters deal with metabolism in the body-the chemical processes that make it possible for the cells to continue living. It is not the purpose of this text to present the chemical details of all the various cellular reactions, which lie in the discipline of biochemistry. Instead, these chapters are devoted to (1) a review of the principal chemical processes of the cell and (2) an analysis of their physiological implications, especially the manner in which they fit into overall body homeostasis.

## Release of Energy From Foods and "Free Energy"

Many of the chemical reactions in the cells are aimed at making the energy in foods available to the various physiological systems of the cell. For example, energy is required for muscle activity, secretion by the glands, maintenance of membrane potentials by the nerve and muscle fibers, synthesis of substances in the cells, absorption of foods from the gastrointestinal tract, and many other functions.

Coupled Reactions. All the energy foods-carbohydrates, fats, and proteins-can be oxidized in the cells, and during this process, large amounts of energy are released. These same foods can also be burned with pure oxygen outside the body in an actual fire, releasing large amounts of energy, but the energy is released suddenly, all in the form of heat. The energy needed by the physiologic processes of the cells is not heat but energy to cause mechanical movement in the case of muscle function, to concentrate solutes in the case of glandular secretion, and to effect many other cell functions. To provide this energy, the chemical reactions must be "coupled" with the systems responsible for these physiologic functions. This coupling is accomplished by special cellular enzymes and energy transfer systems, some of which are explained in this and subsequent chapters.
"Free Energy." The amount of energy liberated by complete oxidation of a food is called the free energy of food oxidation and is generally represented by the symbol $\Delta \mathrm{G}$. Free energy is usually expressed in terms of calories per mole of substance. For example, the amount of free energy liberated by complete oxidation of 1 mole ( 180 grams) of glucose is 686,000 calories.

## Adenosine Triphosphate Is the "Energy Currency" of the Body

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an essential link between energy-utilizing and energy-producing functions of the body (Figure 68-1). For this reason, ATP has been called the "energy currency" of the body, and it can be gained and spent repeatedly.

Energy derived from the oxidation of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats is used to convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to ATP, which is then consumed by the various reactions of the body that are necessary to maintain and propagate life.

ATP is a labile chemical compound that is present in all cells. ATP is a combination of adenine, ribose, and three phosphate radicals, as shown in Figure 68-2. The last two phosphate radicals are connected with the remainder of the molecule by high-energy bonds, which are indicated by the symbol -.

The amount of free energy in each of these highenergy bonds per mole of ATP is about 7300 calories under standard conditions and about 12,000 calories under the usual conditions of temperature and concentrations of the reactants in the body. Therefore, in the body, removal of each of the last two phosphate radicals liberates about 12,000 calories of energy. After loss

of one phosphate radical from ATP, the compound becomes ADP, and after loss of the second phosphate radical, it becomes adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The interconversions among ATP, ADP, and AMP are the following:

ATP is present everywhere in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of all cells, and essentially all the physiological mechanisms that require energy for operation obtain it directly from ATP (or another similar high-energy compound, guanosine triphosphate). In turn, the food in the cells is gradually oxidized, and the released energy is used to form new ATP, thus always maintaining a supply of this substance. All these energy transfers take place via coupled reactions.

The principal purpose of this chapter is to explain how the energy from carbohydrates can be used to form ATP in the cells. Normally, $90 \%$ or more of all the carbohydrates utilized by the body are for this purpose.

## Central Role of Glucose in Carbohydrate Metabolism

As explained in Chapter 66, the final products of carbohydrate digestion in the alimentary tract are almost entirely glucose, fructose, and galactose-with glucose representing, on average, about $80 \%$ of these products. After absorption from the intestinal tract, much of the fructose and almost all the galactose are rapidly converted into glucose in the liver. Therefore, little fructose and galactose are present in the circulating blood. Glucose thus becomes the final common pathway for transport of almost all carbohydrates to the tissue cells.

In liver cells, appropriate enzymes are available to promote interconversions among the monosaccharides-glucose, fructose, and galactose-as shown in Figure 68-3. Furthermore, the dynamics of the reactions are such that when the liver releases monosaccharides back into the blood, the final product is almost entirely glucose. The reason for this is that liver cells contain large amounts of glucose phosphatase. Therefore, glucose-6-phosphate can be degraded to glucose and phosphate, and the glucose can
![gu0358052264](gu0358052264.jpg)

Figure 68-3. Interconversions of the three major monosaccharides-glucose, fructose, and galactose-in liver cells. ATP, Adenosine triphosphate.
then be transported through the liver cell membrane back into the blood.

Once again, it should be emphasized that more than $95 \%$ of all the monosaccharides that circulate in the blood are normally the final conversion product, glucose.

## Glucose Transport Through Cell Membranes

Before glucose can be used by the body's tissue cells, it must be transported through the cell membrane into the cellular cytoplasm. However, glucose cannot easily diffuse through the pores of the cell membrane because the maximum molecular weight of particles that can diffuse readily is about 100, and glucose has a molecular weight of 180 . Yet glucose does pass to the interior of the cells with a reasonable degree

of freedom by facilitated diffusion. The principles of this type of transport are discussed in Chapter 4. Penetrating through the lipid matrix of the cell membrane are large numbers of protein carrier molecules that can bind with glucose. In this bound form, the glucose can be transported by the carrier from one side of the membrane to the other side and then released. Therefore, if the concentration of glucose is greater on one side of the membrane than on the other side, more glucose will be transported from the high-concentration area to the low-concentration area than in the opposite direction.

Transport of glucose through the membranes of most tissue cells is quite different from that which occurs through the gastrointestinal membrane or through the epithelium of the renal tubules. In both cases, the glucose is transported by the mechanism of active sodium-glucose co-transport, in which active transport of sodium provides energy for absorbing glucose against a concentration difference. This sodiumglucose co-transport mechanism functions only in certain special cells, especially those epithelial cells that are specifically adapted for active absorption of glucose. At other cell membranes, glucose is transported only from higher concentration toward lower concentration by facilitated diffusion, made possible by the special binding properties of membrane glucose carrier protein. The details of facilitated diffusion for cell membrane transport are presented in Chapter 4.

## Insulin Increases Facilitated Diffusion of Glucose

The rate of glucose transport, as well as transport of some other monosaccharides, is greatly increased in most cells by insulin. When large amounts of insulin are secreted by the pancreas, the rate of glucose transport into most cells increases to 10 or more times the rate of transport when no insulin is secreted. Conversely, the amounts of glucose that can diffuse to the insides of most cells of the body in the absence of insulin, with the exception of liver and brain cells, are far too little to supply the amount of glucose normally required for energy metabolism.

In effect, the rate of carbohydrate utilization by most cells is controlled by the rate of insulin secretion from the pancreas and the sensitivity of the various tissues to insulin's effects on glucose transport. The functions of insulin and its control of carbohydrate metabolism are discussed in detail in Chapter 79.

## Phosphorylation of Glucose

Immediately upon entry into the cells, glucose combines with a phosphate radical in accordance with the following reaction:

Glucose $\xrightarrow[\text { ATP }]{\text { Glucokinase or hexokinase }}$ Glucose-6-phosphate

This phosphorylation is promoted mainly by the enzyme glucokinase in the liver and by hexokinase in most other cells. The phosphorylation of glucose is almost completely irreversible except in liver cells, renal tubular epithelial cells, and intestinal epithelial cells; in these cells, another enzyme, glucose phosphatase, is also available, and when activated, it can reverse the reaction. In most tissues of the body, phosphorylation serves to capture the glucose in the cell. That is, because of its almost instantaneous binding with phosphate, the glucose will not diffuse back out, except from those special cells, especially liver cells, that have phosphatase.

## Glycogen Is Stored in the Liver and Muscle

After absorption into a cell, glucose can be used immediately for release of energy to the cell, or it can be stored in the form of glycogen, which is a large polymer of glucose.

Almost all cells of the body are capable of storing at least some glycogen, but certain cells can store large amounts, especially liver cells, which can store up to $5 \%$ to $8 \%$ of their weight as glycogen, and muscle cells, which can store up to $1 \%$ to $3 \%$ glycogen. The glycogen molecules can be polymerized to almost any molecular weight, with the average molecular weight being 5 million or greater; most of the glycogen precipitates in the form of solid granules.

This conversion of monosaccharides into a high-molecular-weight precipitated compound (glycogen) makes it possible to store large quantities of carbohydrates without significantly altering the osmotic pressure of the intracellular fluids. High concentrations of low-molecular-weight soluble monosaccharides would play havoc with the osmotic relations between intracellular and extracellular fluids.

## Glycogenesis-Formation of Glycogen

The chemical reactions for glycogenesis are illustrated in Figure 68-4 which shows that glucose-6-phosphate can become glucose-1-phosphate; this substance is converted to uridine diphosphate glucose, which is finally converted into glycogen. Several specific enzymes are required to cause these conversions, and any monosaccharide that can be converted into glucose can enter into the reactions. Certain smaller compounds, including lactic acid, glycerol, pyruvic acid, and some deaminated amino acids, can also be converted into glucose or closely allied compounds and then converted into glycogen.

## Glycogenolysis—Breakdown of Stored Glycogen

Glycogenolysis means the breakdown of the cell's stored glycogen to re-form glucose in the cells. The glucose can then be used to provide energy. Glycogenolysis does not occur by reversal of the same chemical reactions that form glycogen; instead, each succeeding glucose
![gu0458052264](gu0458052264.jpg)

Figure 68-4. Chemical reactions of glycogenesis and glycogenolysis, also showing interconversions between blood glucose and liver glycogen. (The phosphatase required for the release of glucose from the cell is present in liver cells but not in most other cells.)

molecule on each branch of the glycogen polymer is split away by phosphorylation, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphorylase.

Under resting conditions, the phosphorylase is in an inactive form, and thus glycogen remains stored. When it is necessary to re-form glucose from glycogen, the phosphorylase must first be activated. This activation can be accomplished in several ways, including activation by epinephrine or by glucagon, as described in the next section.

Activation of Phosphorylase by Epinephrine or by Glucagon. Two hormones, epinephrine and glucagon, can activate phosphorylase and thereby cause rapid glycogenolysis. The initial effect of each of these hormones is to promote formation of cyclic AMP in the cells, which then initiates a cascade of chemical reactions that activates the phosphorylase. This process is discussed in detail in Chapter 79.

Epinephrine is released by the adrenal medullae when the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated. Therefore, one of the functions of the sympathetic nervous system is to increase the availability of glucose for rapid energy metabolism. This function of epinephrine occurs markedly in liver cells and muscle, thereby contributing (along with other effects of sympathetic stimulation) to preparation of the body for action, as discussed in Chapter 61.

Glucagon is a hormone secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreas when the blood glucose concentration falls too low. It stimulates formation of cyclic AMP mainly in the liver cells, promoting conversion of liver glycogen into glucose and its release into the blood, thereby elevating the blood glucose concentration. The function of glucagon in blood glucose regulation is discussed in Chapter 79.

## Release of Energy From Glucose by the Glycolytic Pathway

Because complete oxidation of 1 gram -mole of glucose releases 686,000 calories of energy and only 12,000 calories of energy are required to form 1 gram -mole of ATP, energy would be wasted if glucose were decomposed all at once into water and carbon dioxide while forming only a single ATP molecule. Fortunately, cells of the body contain special enzymes that cause the glucose molecule to split a little at a time in many successive steps, so that its energy is released in small packets to form one molecule of ATP at a time, thus forming a total of 38 moles of ATP for each mole of glucose metabolized by the cells.

In the next sections we describe the basic principles of the processes by which the glucose molecule is progressively dissected and its energy released to form ATP.

## Glycolysis—Splitting Glucose to Form Pyruvic Acid

By far the most important means of releasing energy from glucose is initiated by glycolysis. The end products of glycolysis are then oxidized to provide energy. Glycolysis means splitting of the glucose molecule to form two molecules of pyruvic acid.

Glycolysis occurs by 10 successive chemical reactions, shown in Figure 68-5. Each step is catalyzed by at least one specific protein enzyme. Note that glucose is first converted into fructose-1,6-diphosphate and then split
![gu0558052264](gu0558052264.jpg)

Net reaction per molecule of glucose:
Glucose $+2 \mathrm{ADP}+2 \mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{-3} \rightarrow 2$ Pyruvic acid $+2 \mathrm{ATP}+4 \mathrm{H}$
Figure 68-5. Sequence of chemical reactions responsible for glycolysis.
into two three-carbon-atom molecules, glyceraldehyde-3phosphate, each of which is then converted through five additional steps into pyruvic acid.

Formation of ATP During Glycolysis. Despite the many chemical reactions in the glycolytic series, only a small portion of the free energy in the glucose molecule is released at most steps. However, between the 1,3-diphosphoglyceric acid and the 3-phosphoglyceric acid stages, and again between the phosphoenolpyruvic acid and the pyruvic acid stages, the packets of energy released are greater than 12,000 calories per mole, the amount required to form ATP, and the reactions are coupled in such a way that ATP is formed. Thus, a total of 4 moles of ATP are formed for each mole of fructose-1,6-diphosphate that is split into pyruvic acid.

Yet, 2 moles of ATP are required to phosphorylate the original glucose to form fructose-1,6-diphosphate before glycolysis can begin. Therefore, the net gain in ATP molecules by the entire glycolytic process is only 2 moles for each mole of glucose utilized. This amounts to 24,000 calories of energy that becomes transferred to ATP, but during glycolysis, a total of 56,000 calories of energy were lost from the original glucose, giving an overall efficiency for ATP formation of only $43 \%$. The remaining $57 \%$ of the energy is lost in the form of heat.

## Conversion of Pyruvic Acid to Acetyl Coenzyme A

The next stage in the degradation of glucose is a twostep conversion of the two pyruvic acid molecules (shown in Figure 68-5) into two molecules of acetyl

coenzyme $A$ (acetyl-CoA), in accordance with the following reaction:
![gu0658052264](gu0658052264.jpg)
![gu0758052264](gu0758052264.jpg)

Two carbon dioxide molecules and four hydrogen atoms are released from this reaction, while the remaining portions of the two pyruvic acid molecules combine with coenzyme A, a derivative of the vitamin pantothenic acid, to form two molecules of acetyl-CoA. In this conversion, no ATP is formed, but up to six molecules of ATP are formed when the four released hydrogen atoms are later oxidized, as discussed later.

## Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle)

The next stage in the degradation of the glucose molecule is called the citric acid cycle (also called the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the Krebs cycle in honor of Hans Krebs for his discovery of this cycle). The citric acid cycle is a sequence of chemical reactions in which the acetyl portion of acetylCoA is degraded to carbon dioxide and hydrogen atoms. These reactions all occur in the matrix of mitochondria. The released hydrogen atoms add to the number of these atoms that will subsequently be oxidized (as discussed later), releasing tremendous amounts of energy to form ATP.

Figure 68-6 shows the different stages of the chemical reactions in the citric acid cycle. The substances to the left are added during the chemical reactions, and the products of the chemical reactions are shown to the right. Note at the top of the column that the cycle begins with oxaloacetic acid, and at the bottom of the chain of reactions, oxaloacetic acid is formed again. Thus, the cycle can continue repeatedly.

In the initial stage of the citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid. The coenzyme A portion of the acetyl-CoA is released and can be used repeatedly to form additional quantities of acetyl-CoA from pyruvic acid. The acetyl portion, however, becomes an integral part of the citric acid molecule. During the successive stages of the citric acid cycle, several molecules of water are added, as shown on the left in Figure 68-6, and carbon dioxide and hydrogen atoms are released at other stages in the cycle, as shown on the right in the figure.

The net results of the entire citric acid cycle are provided in the explanation at the bottom of Figure 68-6, demonstrating that for each molecule of glucose originally metabolized, 2 acetyl-CoA molecules enter into the citric acid cycle, along with 6 molecules of water. These molecules are then degraded into 4 carbon dioxide molecules, 16 hydrogen atoms, and 2 molecules of coenzyme A. Two molecules of ATP are formed, as follows.

Formation of ATP in the Citric Acid Cycle. The citric acid cycle itself does not cause a great amount of energy to be released; a molecule of ATP is formed in only one of the chemical reactions-during the change from $\alpha$ ketoglutaric acid to succinic acid. Thus, for each molecule
![gu0858052264](gu0858052264.jpg)

Figure 68-6. Chemical reactions of the citric acid cycle, showing the release of carbon dioxide and a number of hydrogen atoms during the cycle. ADP, Adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate.
of glucose metabolized, two acetyl-CoA molecules pass through the citric acid cycle, each forming a molecule of ATP, or a total of two molecules of ATP formed.

Function of Dehydrogenases and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide in Causing Release of Hydrogen Atoms in the Citric Acid Cycle. As already noted at several

points in this discussion, hydrogen atoms are released during different chemical reactions of the citric acid cycle-4 hydrogen atoms during glycolysis, 4 during formation of acetyl-CoA from pyruvic acid, and 16 in the citric acid cycle; thus a total of 24 hydrogen atoms are released for each original molecule of glucose. However, the hydrogen atoms are not simply turned loose in the intracellular fluid. Instead, they are released in packets of two, and in each case, the release is catalyzed by a specific protein enzyme called a dehydrogenase. Twenty of the 24 hydrogen atoms immediately combine with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$, a derivative of the vitamin niacin, in accordance with the following reaction:

$$
\text { Substrate } \stackrel{\mathrm{NAD}^{+}}{\stackrel{+}{\mathrm{H}}}+\stackrel{\text { NAD }}{ }^{+} \xrightarrow{\text { Dehydrogenase }}$
$$

This reaction will not occur without intermediation of the specific dehydrogenase or without the availability of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to act as a hydrogen carrier. Both the free hydrogen ion and the hydrogen bound with $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$subsequently enter into multiple oxidative chemical reactions that form large quantities of ATP, as discussed later.

The remaining 4 hydrogen atoms released during the breakdown of glucose-the 4 released during the citric acid cycle between the succinic and fumaric acid stages combine with a specific dehydrogenase but are not subsequently released to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. Instead, they pass directly from the dehydrogenase into the oxidative process.

Function of Decarboxylases in Causing Release of Carbon Dioxide. Referring again to the chemical reactions of the citric acid cycle, as well as to those for the formation of acetyl-CoA from pyruvic acid, we find that there are three stages in which carbon dioxide is released. To cause the release of carbon dioxide, other specific protein enzymes, called decarboxylases, split the carbon dioxide away from the substrate. The carbon dioxide is then dissolved in the body fluids and transported to the lungs, where it is expired from the body (see Chapter 41).

## Formation of Large Quantities of ATP by Oxidation of Hydrogen-The Process of Oxidative Phosphorylation

Despite all the complexities of (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle, (3) dehydrogenation, and (4) decarboxylation, pitifully small amounts of ATP are formed during all these processes-only 2 ATP molecules in the glycolysis scheme and another 2 in the citric acid cycle for each molecule of glucose metabolized. Instead, almost $90 \%$ of the total ATP created through glucose metabolism is formed during subsequent oxidation of the hydrogen atoms that were released at early stages of glucose degradation. Indeed, the principal function of all these earlier stages is to make the hydrogen of the glucose molecule available in forms that can be oxidized.

Oxidation of hydrogen is accomplished, as illustrated in Figure 68-7, by a series of enzymatically catalyzed reactions in the mitochondria. These reactions (1) split each hydrogen atom into a hydrogen ion and an electron and (2)
![gu0958052264](gu0958052264.jpg)

use the electrons eventually to combine dissolved oxygen of the fluids with water molecules to form hydroxyl ions. Then the hydrogen and hydroxyl ions combine with each other to form water. During this sequence of oxidative reactions, tremendous quantities of energy are released to form ATP. Formation of ATP in this manner is called oxidative phosphorylation, which occurs entirely in the mitochondria by a highly specialized process called the chemiosmotic mechanism.

## Chemiosmotic Mechanism of the Mitochondria to Form ATP

Ionization of Hydrogen, the Electron Transport Chain, and Water Formation. The first step in oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria is to ionize the hydrogen atoms that have been removed from the food substrates. As described earlier, these hydrogen atoms are removed in pairs: one immediately becomes a hydrogen ion, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, the other combines with $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to form reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The upper portion of Figure 68-7 shows the subsequent fate of the NADH and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The initial effect is to release the other hydrogen atom from the NADH to form another hydrogen ion, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$; this process also reconstitutes $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$that will be reused repeatedly.

The electrons that are removed from the hydrogen atoms to cause the hydrogen ionization immediately enter an electron transport chain of electron acceptors that are an integral part of the inner membrane (the shelf membrane) of the mitochondrion. The electron acceptors can be reversibly reduced or oxidized by accepting or giving up electrons. The important members of this electron transport chain include flavoprotein (flavin mononucleotide), several

iron sulfide proteins, ubiquinone, and cytochromes B, C1, C, $A$, and $A 3$. Each electron is shuttled from one of these acceptors to the next until it finally reaches cytochrome A3, which is called cytochrome oxidase because it is capable of giving up 2 electrons and thus reducing elemental oxygen to form ionic oxygen, which then combines with hydrogen ions to form water.

Thus, Figure 68-7 shows the transport of electrons through the electron chain and then their ultimate use by cytochrome oxidase to cause the formation of water molecules. During the transport of these electrons through the electron transport chain, energy is released that is used to cause the synthesis of ATP, as follows.

Electron Transport Chain Releases Energy Used to Pump Hydrogen Ions Into the Outer Chamber of the Mitochondrion. As the electrons pass through the electron transport chain, large amounts of energy are released. This energy is used to pump hydrogen ions from the inner matrix of the mitochondrion (to the right in Figure 68-7) into the outer chamber between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (to the left). This process creates a high concentration of positively charged hydrogen ions in this chamber; it also creates a strong negative electrical potential in the inner matrix.

Formation of ATP. The next step in oxidative phosphorylation is to convert ADP into ATP. This conversion occurs in conjunction with a large protein molecule that protrudes all the way through the inner mitochondrial membrane and projects with a knoblike head into the inner mitochondrial matrix. This molecule is an ATPase, the physical nature of which is shown in Figure 68-7. It is called ATP synthetase.

The high concentration of positively charged hydrogen ions in the outer chamber and the large electrical potential difference across the inner membrane cause the hydrogen ions to flow into the inner mitochondrial matrix through the substance of the ATPase molecule. In doing so, energy derived from this hydrogen ion flow is used by ATPase to convert ADP into ATP by combining ADP with a free ionic phosphate radical $\left(P_{i}\right)$, thus adding another high-energy phosphate bond to the molecule.

The final step in the process is transfer of ATP from the inside of the mitochondrion back to the cell cytoplasm. This step occurs by facilitated diffusion outward through the inner membrane and then by simple diffusion through the permeable outer mitochondrial membrane. In turn, ADP is continually transferred in the other direction for continual conversion into ATP. For each two electrons that pass through the entire electron transport chain (representing the ionization of two hydrogen atoms), up to three ATP molecules are synthesized.

## Summary of ATP Formation During the Breakdown of Glucose

We can now determine the total number of ATP molecules that, under optimal conditions, can be formed by the energy from one molecule of glucose.

1. During glycolysis, 4 molecules of ATP are formed and 2 are expended to cause the initial phosphorylation of glucose to get the process going, giving a net gain of 2 molecules of ATP.
2. During each revolution of the citric acid cycle, 1 molecule of ATP is formed. However, because each glucose molecule splits into 2 pyruvic acid molecules, there are 2 revolutions of the cycle for each molecule of glucose metabolized, giving a net production of 2 more molecules of ATP.
3. During the entire schema of glucose breakdown, a total of 24 hydrogen atoms are released during glycolysis and during the citric acid cycle. Twenty of these atoms are oxidized in conjunction with the chemiosmotic mechanism shown in Figure 68-7, with the release of 3 ATP molecules per 2 atoms of hydrogen metabolized. This process gives an additional 30 ATP molecules.
4. The remaining 4 hydrogen atoms are released by their dehydrogenase into the chemiosmotic oxidative schema in the mitochondrion beyond the first stage of Figure 68-7. Two ATP molecules are usually released for every 2 hydrogen atoms oxidized, thus giving a total of 4 more ATP molecules.
Now, adding all the ATP molecules formed, we find a maximum of 38 ATP molecules formed for each molecule of glucose degraded to carbon dioxide and water. Thus, 456,000 calories of energy can be stored in the form of ATP, whereas 686,000 calories are released during the complete oxidation of each gram-molecule of glucose. This outcome represents an overall maximum efficiency of energy transfer of $66 \%$. The remaining $34 \%$ of the energy becomes heat and, therefore, cannot be used by the cells to perform specific functions.

## Effect of ATP and ADP Cell Concentrations in Controlling Glycolysis and Glucose Oxidation

Continual release of energy from glucose when the cells do not need energy would be an extremely wasteful process. Instead, glycolysis and the subsequent oxidation of hydrogen atoms are continually controlled in accordance with the need of the cells for ATP. This control is accomplished by multiple feedback control mechanisms within the chemical schemata. Among the more important of these mechanisms are the effects of cell concentrations of both ADP and ATP in controlling the rates of chemical reactions in the energy metabolism sequence.

One important way in which ATP helps control energy metabolism is to inhibit the enzyme phosphofructokinase. Because this enzyme promotes the formation of fructose-1,6-diphosphate, one of the initial steps in the glycolytic series of reactions, the net effect of excess cellular ATP is to slow or even stop glycolysis, which in turn stops most carbohydrate metabolism. Conversely, ADP (and AMP as well) causes the opposite change in this enzyme, greatly increasing its activity. Whenever ATP is used by the tissues for energizing a major fraction of almost all intracellular chemical reactions, this action reduces the ATP inhibition of the enzyme phosphofructokinase and at the same time increases its activity as a result of the excess ADP formed. Thus, the glycolytic process is set in motion, and the total cellular store of ATP is replenished.

Another control linkage is the citrate ion formed in the citric acid cycle. An excess of this ion also strongly inhibits phosphofructokinase, thus preventing the glycolytic process from getting ahead of the citric acid cycle's ability to use the pyruvic acid formed during glycolysis.

A third way by which the ATP-ADP-AMP system controls carbohydrate metabolism, as well as controlling energy release from fats and proteins, is the following: Referring to the various chemical reactions for energy release, we see that if all the ADP in the cell has already been converted into ATP, additional ATP simply cannot be formed. As a result, the entire sequence involved in the use of foodstuffsglucose, fats, and proteins-to form ATP is stopped. Then, when ATP is used by the cell to energize the different physiological functions in the cell, the newly formed ADP and AMP turn on the energy processes again, and ADP and AMP are almost instantly returned to the ATP state. In this way, essentially a full store of ATP is automatically maintained, except during extreme cellular activity, such as very strenuous exercise.

## Anaerobic Release of Energy—Anaerobic Glycolysis

Occasionally, oxygen becomes either unavailable or insufficient, so oxidative phosphorylation cannot take place. Yet even under these conditions, a small amount of energy can still be released to the cells by the glycolysis stage of carbohydrate degradation, because the chemical reactions for the breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid do not require oxygen.

This process is extremely wasteful of glucose because only 24,000 calories of energy are used to form ATP for each molecule of glucose metabolized, which represents only a little over $3 \%$ of the total energy in the glucose molecule. Nevertheless, this release of glycolytic energy to the cells, which is called anaerobic energy, can be a lifesaving measure for up to a few minutes when oxygen becomes unavailable.

Formation of Lactic Acid During Anaerobic Glycolysis Allows Release of Extra Anaerobic Energy. The law of mass action states that as the end products of a chemical reaction build up in a reacting medium, the rate of the reaction decreases, approaching zero. The two end products of the glycolytic reactions (see Figure 68-5) are (1) pyruvic acid and (2) hydrogen atoms combined with $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to form NADH and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The buildup of either or both of these substances would stop the glycolytic process and prevent further formation of ATP. When their quantities begin to be excessive, these two end products react with each other to form lactic acid, in accordance with the following equation:
![gu1058052264](gu1058052264.jpg)

Thus, under anaerobic conditions, the major portion of the pyruvic acid is converted into lactic acid, which diffuses readily out of the cells into the extracellular fluids and even into the intracellular fluids of other less active cells. Therefore, lactic acid represents a type of "sinkhole" into which
the glycolytic end products can disappear, thus allowing glycolysis to proceed far longer than would otherwise be possible. Indeed, glycolysis could proceed for only a few seconds without this conversion. Instead, it can proceed for several minutes, supplying the body with considerable extra quantities of ATP, even in the absence of respiratory oxygen.

Reconversion of Lactic Acid to Pyruvic Acid When Oxygen Becomes Available Again. When a person begins to breathe oxygen again after a period of anaerobic metabolism, the lactic acid is rapidly reconverted to pyruvic acid and NADH plus $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Large portions of these substances are immediately oxidized to form large quantities of ATP. This excess ATP then causes as much as $75 \%$ of the remaining excess pyruvic acid to be converted back into glucose.

Thus, the large amount of lactic acid that forms during anaerobic glycolysis is not lost from the body because, when oxygen is available again, the lactic acid can be either reconverted to glucose or used directly for energy. By far the greatest portion of this reconversion occurs in the liver, but a small amount can also occur in other tissues.

Use of Lactic Acid by the Heart for Energy. Heart muscle is especially capable of converting lactic acid to pyruvic acid and then using the pyruvic acid for energy. This process occurs to a great extent during heavy exercise, when large amounts of lactic acid are released into the blood from the skeletal muscles and consumed as an extra energy source by the heart.

## Release of Energy From Glucose by the Pentose Phosphate Pathway

In almost all the body's muscles, essentially all the carbohydrates utilized for energy are degraded to pyruvic acid by glycolysis and then oxidized. However, this glycolytic scheme is not the only means by which glucose can be degraded and used to provide energy. A second important mechanism for breakdown and oxidation of glucose is called the pentose phosphate pathway (or phosphogluconate pathway), which is responsible for as much as $30 \%$ of the glucose breakdown in the liver and even more than this in fat cells.

This pathway is especially important because it can provide energy independently of all the enzymes of the citric acid cycle and therefore is an alternative pathway for energy metabolism when certain enzymatic abnormalities occur in cells. It has a special capacity for providing energy to multiple cellular synthetic processes.

Release of Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen by the Pentose Phosphate Pathway. Figure 68-8 shows most of the basic chemical reactions in the pentose phosphate pathway. It demonstrates that glucose, during several stages of conversion, can release one molecule of carbon dioxide and four atoms of hydrogen, with the resultant formation of a five-carbon sugar, D-ribulose. This substance can change progressively into several other five-, four-, seven-, and three-carbon sugars. Finally, various combinations of these sugars can resynthesize glucose. However, only five molecules of glucose are resynthesized for every six molecules of glucose that initially enter into the reactions. That is, the pentose phosphate pathway is a cyclical process in which one molecule of glucose is metabolized for each revolution

of the cycle. Thus, by repeating the cycle again and again, all the glucose can eventually be converted into carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and the hydrogen can enter the oxidative phosphorylation pathway to form ATP; more often, however, it is used for the synthesis of fat or other substances, as follows.

Use of Hydrogen to Synthesize Fat; the Function of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate. The hydrogen released during the pentose phosphate cycle does not combine with $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$as in the glycolytic pathway but combines with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate $\left(\mathrm{NADP}^{+}\right)$, which is almost identical to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ except for an extra phosphate radical, P. This difference is extremely significant because only hydrogen bound with $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$in the form of NADPH can be used for the synthesis of fats from carbohydrates (as discussed in Chapter 69) and for the synthesis of some other substances.

When the glycolytic pathway for using glucose becomes slowed because of cellular inactivity, the pentose phosphate pathway remains operative (mainly in the liver) to break down any excess glucose that continues to be transported into the cells, and NADPH becomes abundant to help convert acetyl-CoA, also derived from glucose, into long fatty acid chains. This is another way in which energy in the glucose molecule is used other than for the formation of ATP-in this case, for the formation and storage of fat in the body.

## Glucose Conversion to Glycogen or Fat

When glucose is not immediately required for energy, the extra glucose that continually enters the cells is ei-
ther stored as glycogen or converted into fat. Glucose is preferentially stored as glycogen until the cells have stored as much glycogen as they can-an amount sufficient to supply the energy needs of the body for only 12 to 24 hours.

When the glycogen-storing cells (primarily liver and muscle cells) approach saturation with glycogen, the additional glucose is converted into fat in liver and fat cells and is stored as fat in the fat cells. Other steps in the chemistry of this conversion are discussed in Chapter 69.

## Gluconeogenesis-Formation of Carbohydrates From Proteins and Fats

When the body's stores of carbohydrates decrease below normal, moderate quantities of glucose can be formed from amino acids and the glycerol portion of fat. This process is called gluconeogenesis.

Gluconeogenesis is especially important in preventing excessive reductions in blood glucose concentration during fasting. Glucose is the primary substrate for energy in tissues such as the brain and the red blood cells, and adequate amounts of glucose must be present in the blood for several hours between meals. The liver plays a key role in maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting by converting its stored glycogen to glucose (glycogenolysis) and by synthesizing glucose, mainly from lactate and amino acids (gluconeogenesis). Approximately $25 \%$ of the liver's glucose production during fasting is from gluconeogenesis, helping to provide a steady supply of glucose to the brain. During prolonged fasting, the kidneys also synthesize considerable amounts of glucose from amino acids and other precursors.

About $60 \%$ of the amino acids in the body proteins can be converted easily into carbohydrates; the remaining $40 \%$ have chemical configurations that make this conversion difficult or impossible. Each amino acid is converted into glucose by a slightly different chemical process. For example, alanine can be converted directly into pyruvic acid simply by deamination; the pyruvic acid is then converted into glucose or stored glycogen. Several of the more complicated amino acids can be converted into different sugars that contain three-, four-, five-, or seven-carbon atoms. They can then enter the phosphogluconate pathway and eventually form glucose. Thus, by means of deamination plus several simple interconversions, many of the amino acids can become glucose. Similar interconversions can change glycerol into glucose or glycogen.

## Regulation of Gluconeogenesis

Diminished carbohydrates in the cells and decreased blood sugar are the basic stimuli that increase the rate of gluconeogenesis. Diminished carbohydrates can directly reverse many of the glycolytic and phosphogluconate reactions, thus allowing conversion of deaminated amino acids and glycerol into carbohydrates. In addition, the hormone cortisol is especially important in this regulation, as described in the following section.

Effect of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone and Glucocorticoids on Gluconeogenesis. When normal quantities of carbohydrates are not available to the cells, the adenohypophysis, for reasons not completely understood, secretes increased quantities of the hormone adrenocorticotropic

hormone (ACTH), also called corticotropin or adrenocorticotropin. This secretion stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce large quantities of glucocorticoid hormones, especially cortisol. In turn, cortisol mobilizes proteins from essentially all cells of the body, making these proteins available in the form of amino acids in the body fluids. A high proportion of these amino acids immediately becomes deaminated in the liver and provides ideal substrates for conversion into glucose. Thus, one of the most important means by which gluconeogenesis is promoted is through the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex.

## Blood Glucose

The normal blood glucose concentration in a person who has not eaten a meal within the past 3 to 4 hours is about $90 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$. After a meal containing large amounts of carbohydrates, this level seldom rises above $140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ unless the person has diabetes mellitus, which is discussed in Chapter 79.

The regulation of blood glucose concentration is intimately related to the pancreatic hormones insulin and glucagon; this subject is discussed in detail in Chapter 79 in relation to the functions of these hormones.

# Lipid Metabolism 

Several chemical compounds in food and in the body are classified as lipids, including the following: (1) neutral fat, also known as triglycerides; (2) phospholipids; (3) cholesterol; and (4) a few others of less importance. Chemically, the basic lipid moiety of triglycerides and phospholipids is fatty acids, which are long-chain hydrocarbon organic acids. A typical fatty acid, palmitic acid, is the following: $\mathrm{CH}_{3}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2}\right)_{14} \mathrm{COOH}$.

Although cholesterol does not contain fatty acid, its sterol nucleus is synthesized from portions of fatty acid molecules, thus giving it many of the physical and chemical properties of other lipids.

The triglycerides are used in the body mainly to provide energy for the different metabolic processes, a function they share almost equally with carbohydrates. However, some lipids, especially cholesterol, phospholipids, and small amounts of triglycerides, are used to form the membranes of all cells of the body and to perform other essential cellular functions.

## BASIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF TRIGLYCERIDES (NEUTRAL FAT)

Because most of this chapter deals with utilization of triglycerides for energy, the following typical structure of the triglyceride molecule should be understood:
![gu1258052264](gu1258052264.jpg)

Note that three long-chain fatty acid molecules are bound with one molecule of glycerol. The three fatty acids most commonly present in the triglycerides of the human body are as follows: (1) stearic acid (shown in the tristearin example), which has an 18-carbon chain and is fully saturated with hydrogen atoms; (2) oleic acid, which also has an 18 -carbon chain but has one double bond in the
middle of the chain; and (3) palmitic acid, which has 16 carbon atoms and is fully saturated.

## TRANSPORT OF LIPIDS IN THE BODY FLUIDS

## TRANSPORT OF TRIGLYCERIDES AND OTHER LIPIDS FROM THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT BY LYMPH-THE CHYLOMICRONS

As explained in Chapter 66, almost all the fats in the diet, with the principal exception of a few short-chain fatty acids, are absorbed from the intestines into the intestinal lymph. During digestion, most triglycerides are split into monoglycerides and fatty acids. Then, while passing through the intestinal epithelial cells, the monoglycerides and fatty acids are resynthesized into new molecules of triglycerides that enter the lymph as minute, dispersed droplets called chylomicrons (Figure 69-1), whose diameters are between 0.08 and 0.6 micron. A small amount of apolipoprotein, mainly apolipoprotein $B$, is adsorbed to the outer surfaces of the chylomicrons. The remainder of the protein molecules project into the surrounding water and thereby increase the suspension stability of the chylomicrons in the lymph fluid and prevent their adherence to the lymphatic vessel walls.

Most of the cholesterol and phospholipids absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract enter the chylomicrons. Thus, although the chylomicrons are composed principally of triglycerides, they also contain about $9 \%$ phospholipids, $3 \%$ cholesterol, and $1 \%$ apolipoproteins. The chylomicrons are then transported upward through the thoracic duct and emptied into the circulating venous blood at the juncture of the jugular and subclavian veins.

## REMOVAL OF THE CHYLOMICRONS FROM THE BLOOD

About 1 hour after a meal containing large quantities of fat, the chylomicron concentration in the plasma may rise to $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ of the total plasma, and because of the large size of the chylomicrons, the plasma appears turbid and sometimes yellow. However, the chylomicrons have a

Figure 69-1. Chylomicrons are lipoprotein particles that consist of phospholipids and apolipoproteins on the outer surface and triglycerides and cholesterol inside.
half-life of less than 1 hour, so the plasma becomes clear again within a few hours. The fat of the chylomicrons is removed mainly in the following way.

## Chylomicron Triglycerides Are Hydrolyzed by Lipoprotein Lipase, and Fat Is Stored in Adipose Tissue.

Most of the chylomicrons are removed from the circulating blood as they pass through the capillaries of various tissues, especially adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and heart. These tissues synthesize the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, which is transported to the surface of capillary endothelial cells, where it hydrolyzes the triglycerides of chylomicrons as they come in contact with the endothelial wall, thus releasing fatty acids and glycerol (Figure 69-2).

The fatty acids released from the chylomicrons, being highly miscible with the membranes of the cells, diffuse into the fat cells of the adipose tissue and muscle cells. Once inside these cells, the fatty acids can be used for fuel or again synthesized into triglycerides, with new glycerol being supplied by the metabolic processes of the storage cells, as discussed later in the chapter. The lipase also causes hydrolysis of phospholipids, which also releases fatty acids to be stored in the cells in the same way.

After the triglycerides are removed from the chylomicrons, the cholesterol-enriched chylomicron remnants are rapidly cleared from the plasma. The chylomicron remnants bind to receptors on endothelial cells in the liver sinusoids. Apolipoprotein-E on the surface of the chylomicron remnants and secreted by liver cells also plays an important role in initiating clearance of these plasma lipoproteins.

## "Free Fatty Acids" Are Transported in the Blood in Combination With Albumin

When fat that has been stored in the adipose tissue is to be used elsewhere in the body to provide energy, it must first be transported from the adipose tissue to the other tissue. It is transported mainly in the form of free fatty acids. This transport is achieved by hydrolysis of the triglycerides back into fatty acids and glycerol.

At least two classes of stimuli play important roles in promoting this hydrolysis. First, when the amount of glucose available to the fat cell is inadequate, one of the glucose breakdown products, $\alpha$-glycerophosphate, is also available in insufficient quantities. Because this substance is required to maintain the glycerol portion of triglycerides, the result is hydrolysis of triglycerides. Second, a hormone-sensitive cellular lipase can be activated by several hormones from the endocrine glands, and this also promotes rapid hydrolysis of triglycerides. This topic is discussed later in the chapter.

Upon leaving fat cells, fatty acids ionize strongly in the plasma and the ionic portion combines immediately with albumin molecules of the plasma proteins. Fatty acids bound in this manner are called free fatty acids or nonesterified fatty acids, to distinguish them from other fatty acids in the plasma that exist in the form of (1) esters of glycerol, (2) cholesterol, or (3) other substances.

The concentration of free fatty acids in the plasma under resting conditions is about $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$, which is a total of only 0.45 gram of fatty acids in the entire circulatory system. Even this small amount accounts for almost all the transport of fatty acids from one part of the body to another for the following reasons:

1. Despite the minute amount of free fatty acid in the blood, its rate of "turnover" is extremely rapid: half the plasma fatty acid is replaced by new fatty acid every 2 to 3 minutes. One can calculate that at this rate, almost all the normal energy requirements of the body can be provided by the oxidation of transported free fatty acids, without using any carbohydrates or proteins for energy.
2. Conditions that increase the rate of utilization of fat for cellular energy also increase the free fatty acid concentration in the blood. In fact, the concentration sometimes increases fivefold to eightfold. Such a large increase occurs especially in cases of starvation and in diabetes mellitus; in both these conditions, the person derives little or no metabolic energy from carbohydrates.
Under normal conditions, only about 3 molecules of fatty acid combine with each molecule of albumin, but as many as 30 fatty acid molecules can combine with a single albumin molecule when the need for fatty acid transport is extreme. This shows how variable the rate of lipid transport can be under different physiological conditions.

## Lipoproteins—Their Special Function in Transporting Cholesterol and Phospholipids

In the postabsorptive state, after all the chylomicrons have been removed from the blood, more than $95 \%$ of all the lipids in the plasma are in the form of lipoprotein. These lipids are small particles-much smaller than chylomicrons, but qualitatively similar in composition-containing triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids, and protein. The total concentration of lipoproteins in the plasma averages about 700 mg per 100 ml of plasma-that is, $700 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$-and can be broken down into the following individual lipoprotein constituents:

|  | $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ of Plasma |
| :-- | :-- |
| Cholesterol | 180 |
| Phospholipids | 160 |
| Triglycerides | 160 |
| Protein | 200 |

Types of Lipoproteins. Aside from the chylomicrons, which are very large lipoproteins, there are four major types of lipoproteins, classified by their densities as measured in the ultracentrifuge: (1) very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs), which contain high concentrations of
triglycerides and moderate concentrations of both cholesterol and phospholipids; (2) intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), which are VLDLs from which a share of the triglycerides has been removed, so the concentrations of cholesterol and phospholipids are increased; (3) lowdensity lipoproteins (LDLs), which are derived from IDLs by the removal of almost all the triglycerides, leaving an especially high concentration of cholesterol and a moderately high concentration of phospholipids; and (4) high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), which contain a high concentration of protein ( $\approx 50 \%$ ) but much smaller concentrations of cholesterol and phospholipids.

Formation and Function of Lipoproteins. Almost all the lipoproteins are formed in the liver, which is also where most of the plasma cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides are synthesized. In addition, small quantities of HDLs are synthesized in the intestinal epithelium during absorption of fatty acids from the intestines.

The primary function of the lipoproteins is to transport their lipid components in the blood. The VLDLs transport triglycerides synthesized in the liver mainly to the adipose tissue. The other lipoproteins are especially important in different stages of phospholipid and cholesterol transport from the liver to the peripheral tissues or from the periphery back to the liver. Later in the chapter, we discuss in more detail special problems of cholesterol transport in relation

to the disease atherosclerosis, which is associated with the development of fatty lesions on the insides of arterial walls.

## Fat Deposits

Large quantities of fat are stored in two major tissues of the body, the adipose tissue and the liver. The adipose tissue is usually called fat deposits, or simply tissue fat.

## Adipose Tissue

A major function of adipose tissue is storage of triglycerides until they are needed to provide energy elsewhere in the body. Additional functions are to provide heat insulation for the body, as discussed in Chapter 74, and secretion of hormones, such as leptin and adiponectin, which affect multiple body functions, including appetite and energy expenditure, as discussed in Chapter 72.

Fat Cells (Adipocytes) Store Triglycerides. The fat cells (adipocytes) of adipose tissue are modified fibroblasts that store almost pure triglycerides in quantities as great as $80 \%$ to $95 \%$ of the entire cell volume. Triglycerides inside the fat cells are generally in a liquid form. When the tissues are exposed to prolonged cold, the fatty acid chains of the cell triglycerides, over a period of weeks, become either shorter or more unsaturated to decrease their melting point, thereby always allowing the fat to remain in a liquid state. This characteristic is particularly important because only liquid fat can be hydrolyzed and transported from the cells.

Fat cells can synthesize very small amounts of fatty acids and triglycerides from carbohydrates; this function supplements the synthesis of fat in the liver, as discussed later in the chapter.

Tissue Lipases Permit Exchange of Fat Between Adipose Tissue and the Blood. As discussed earlier, large quantities of lipases are present in adipose tissue. Some of these enzymes catalyze the deposition of cell triglycerides from the chylomicrons and lipoproteins. Others, when activated by hormones, cause splitting of the triglycerides of the fat cells to release free fatty acids. Because of the rapid exchange of fatty acids, the triglycerides in fat cells are renewed about once every 2 to 3 weeks, which means that the fat stored in the tissues today is not the same fat that was stored last month, thus emphasizing the dynamic state of storage fat.

## Liver Lipids

The principal functions of the liver in lipid metabolism are to (1) degrade fatty acids into small compounds that can be used for energy; (2) synthesize triglycerides, mainly from carbohydrates, but to a lesser extent from proteins as well; and (3) synthesize other lipids from fatty acids, especially cholesterol and phospholipids.

Large quantities of triglycerides appear in the liver during (1) the early stages of starvation, (2) in diabetes mellitus, and (3) in any other condition in which fat instead of carbohydrates is being used for energy. In these conditions, large quantities of triglycerides are mobilized from the adipose tissue, transported as free fatty acids in the blood, and redeposited as triglycerides in the liver, where the initial stages of much of fat degradation begin. Thus, under normal physiological conditions, the total amount of triglycerides in the liver is determined to a great extent
by the overall rate at which lipids are being used for energy.

The liver may also store large amounts of lipids in people who are obese or have lipodystrophy, a condition characterized by atrophy or genetic deficiency of adipocytes. In both of these conditions, excess fat that cannot be stored in adipose tissue accumulates in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in other tissues that normally store minimal amounts of lipids.

The liver cells, in addition to containing triglycerides, contain large quantities of phospholipids and cholesterol, which are continually synthesized by the liver. Also, the liver cells are much more capable of desaturating fatty acids than are other tissues, and thus liver triglycerides normally are much more unsaturated than the triglycerides of adipose tissue. This capability of the liver to desaturate fatty acids is functionally important to all tissues of the body because many structural elements of all cells contain reasonable quantities of unsaturated fats, and their principal source is the liver. This desaturation is accomplished by a dehydrogenase in the liver cells.

## Use of Triglycerides for Energy: Formation of Adenosine Triphosphate

The dietary intake of fat varies considerably in persons of different cultures, averaging as little as $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of caloric intake in some Asian populations to as much as $35 \%$ to $50 \%$ of the calories in many Western populations. For many persons the use of fats for energy is therefore as important as the use of carbohydrates. In addition, many of the carbohydrates ingested with each meal are converted into triglycerides, stored, and used later in the form of fatty acids released from the triglycerides for energy.

Hydrolysis of Triglycerides Into Fatty Acids and Glycerol. The first stage in using triglycerides for energy is their hydrolysis into fatty acids and glycerol. Then, both the fatty acids and the glycerol are transported in the blood to the active tissues, where they will be oxidized to give energy. Almost all cells-with some exceptions, such as brain tissue and red blood cells-can use fatty acids for energy.

Glycerol, upon entering the active tissue, is immediately changed by intracellular enzymes into glycerol-3phosphate, which enters the glycolytic pathway for glucose breakdown and is thus used for energy. Before the fatty acids can be used for energy, they must be processed further in the mitochondria.

Entry of Fatty Acids Into Mitochondria. Degradation and oxidation of fatty acids occur only in the mitochondria. Therefore, the first step for the use of fatty acids is their transport into the mitochondria using carnitine as a carrier. Once inside the mitochondria, fatty acids split away from carnitine and are degraded and oxidized.

Degradation of Fatty Acids to Acetyl Coenzyme A by Beta-Oxidation. Fatty acids are degraded in the mitochondria by progressive release of two-carbon segments in the form of acetyl coenzyme $A$ (acetyl-CoA). This degradation process, which is shown in Figure 69-3, is called betaoxidation of fatty acids.

To understand the essential steps in the beta-oxidation process, note that in Equation 1 in Figure 69-3, the first step is combination of the fatty acid molecule with coenzyme

![gu1558052264](gu1558052264.jpg)

Figure 69-3. Beta oxidation of fatty acids to yield acetyl coenzyme A.

A (CoA) to form fatty acyl-CoA. In Equations 2, 3, and 4, the beta carbon (the second carbon from the right) of the fatty acyl-CoA binds with an oxygen molecule-that is, the beta carbon becomes oxidized.

Then, in Equation 5, the right-hand two-carbon portion of the molecule is split off to release acetyl-CoA into the cell fluid. At the same time, another CoA molecule binds at the end of the remaining portion of the fatty acid molecule, and thus a new fatty acyl-CoA molecule is formed; this time, however, the molecule is two carbon atoms shorter because of the loss of the first acetyl-CoA from its terminal end.

Next, this shorter fatty acyl-CoA enters into Equation 2 and progresses through Equations 3, 4, and 5 to release another acetyl-CoA molecule, thus shortening the original fatty acid molecule by another two carbons. In addition to the released acetyl-CoA molecules, four atoms of hydrogen are released from the fatty acid molecule at the same time, entirely separate from the acetyl-CoA.

Oxidation of Acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA molecules formed by beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria enter immediately into the citric acid cycle (see Chapter 68), combining first with oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid, which then is degraded into carbon dioxide and hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen is subsequently oxidized by the chemiosmotic oxidative system of the mitochondria, which was also explained in Chapter 68. The net reaction in the citric acid cycle for each molecule of acetyl-CoA is the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCoA}+\text { Oxaloacetic acid }+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\text { ADP } \\
& \text { Citric acid cycle } \\
& 2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+8 \mathrm{H}+\mathrm{HCoA}+\text { ATP + Oxaloacetic acid }
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, after initial degradation of fatty acids to acetylCoA, their final breakdown is precisely the same as that of the acetyl-CoA formed from pyruvic acid during the metabolism of glucose. The extra hydrogen atoms are also oxidized by the same chemiosmotic oxidative system of the mitochondria that is used in carbohydrate oxidation, liberating large amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

Large Amounts of ATP Are Formed by Oxidation of Fatty Acids. Note in Figure 69-3 that the four separate hydrogen atoms released each time a molecule of acetyl-CoA is split from the fatty acid chain are released in the forms
reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{FADH}_{2}\right)$, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Therefore, for every stearic fatty acid molecule that is split to form 9 acetyl-CoA molecules, 32 extra hydrogen atoms are removed. In addition, for each of the 9 molecules of acetylCoA that are subsequently degraded by the citric acid cycle, 8 more hydrogen atoms are removed, making another 72 hydrogen atoms. Thus a total of 104 hydrogen atoms are eventually released by the degradation of each stearic acid molecule. Of this group, 34 are removed from the degrading fatty acids by flavoproteins and 70 are removed by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$as NADH and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

These two groups of hydrogen atoms are oxidized in the mitochondria, as discussed in Chapter 68, but they enter the oxidative system at different points. Therefore, 1 molecule of ATP is synthesized for each of the 34 flavoprotein hydrogens, and 1.5 molecules of ATP are synthesized for each of the 70 NADH and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$hydrogens. This makes 34 plus 105, or a total of 139 molecules of ATP formed by the oxidation of hydrogen derived from each molecule of stearic acid. Another 9 molecules of ATP are formed in the citric acid cycle itself (separate from the ATP released by the oxidation of hydrogen), 1 for each of the nine acetyl-CoA molecules metabolized. Thus, a total of 148 molecules of ATP are formed during the complete oxidation of 1 molecule of stearic acid. However, 2 high-energy bonds are consumed in the initial combination of CoA with the stearic acid molecule, making a net gain of 146 molecules of ATP.

## Formation of Acetoacetic Acid in the Liver and Its Transport in the Blood

A large share of the initial degradation of fatty acids occurs in the liver, especially when large amounts of lipids are being used for energy. However, the liver uses only a small proportion of the fatty acids for its own intrinsic metabolic processes. Instead, when the fatty acid chains have been split into acetyl-CoA, two molecules of acetyl-CoA condense to form one molecule of acetoacetic acid, which is then transported in the blood to the other cells throughout the body, where it is used for energy. The following chemical processes occur:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCoA}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \underset{\text { Acetyl-CoA }}{\stackrel{\text { Liver cells }}{\rightleftarrows}} \\
& \text { Other cells } \\
& \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCH}_{2} \mathrm{COOH}+2 \mathrm{HCoA} \\
& \text { Acetoacetic acid }
\end{aligned}
$$

Part of the acetoacetic acid is also converted into $\beta$ hydroxybutyric acid, and minute quantities are converted into acetone in accord with the following reactions:
![gu1658052264](gu1658052264.jpg)

The acetoacetic acid, $\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone diffuse freely through the liver cell membranes and are transported by the blood to the peripheral tissues. Here they again diffuse into the cells, where reverse reactions occur, and acetyl-CoA molecules are formed. These molecules in turn enter the citric acid cycle and are oxidized for energy, as already explained.

Normally, the acetoacetic acid and $\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid that enter the blood are transported so rapidly to the tissues that their combined concentration in the plasma seldom rises above $3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$. Yet, despite this small concentration in the blood, large quantities are actually transported, as is also true for free fatty acid transport. The rapid transport of both these substances results from their high solubility in the membranes of the target cells, which allows almost instantaneous diffusion into the cells.

Ketosis in Starvation, Diabetes, and Other Diseases. The concentrations of acetoacetic acid, $\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone occasionally rise to levels many times normal in the blood and interstitial fluids; this condition is called ketosis because acetoacetic acid is a keto acid. The three compounds are called ketone bodies. Ketosis occurs especially as a consequence of starvation, in persons with diabetes mellitus, and sometimes even when a person's diet is composed almost entirely of fat. In all these states, essentially no carbohydrates are metabolized-in starvation and with a high-fat diet because carbohydrates are not available, and in diabetes because insulin is not available to cause glucose transport into the cells.

When carbohydrates are not used for energy, almost all the energy of the body must come from fat metabolism. We shall see later in the chapter that the unavailability of carbohydrates automatically increases the rate of removal of fatty acids from adipose tissues. In addition, several hormonal factors-such as increased secretion of glucocorticoids by the adrenal cortex, increased secretion of glucagon by the pancreas, and decreased secretion of insulin by the pan-creas-further enhance removal of fatty acids from the fat tissues. As a result, large quantities of fatty acids become available (1) to the peripheral tissue cells to be used for energy and (2) to the liver cells, where much of the fatty acid is converted to ketone bodies.

The ketone bodies pour out of the liver to be carried to the cells. For several reasons, the cells are limited in the amount of ketone bodies that can be oxidized. The most important reason for this limitation is that one of the
products of carbohydrate metabolism is the oxaloacetate that is required to bind with acetyl-CoA before it can be processed in the citric acid cycle. Therefore, deficiency of oxaloacetate derived from carbohydrates limits the entry of acetyl-CoA into the citric acid cycle, and when a simultaneous outpouring of large quantities of acetoacetic acid and other ketone bodies from the liver occurs, the blood concentrations of acetoacetic acid and $\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid sometimes rise to as high as 20 times normal, thus leading to extreme acidosis, as explained in Chapter 31.

The acetone that is formed during ketosis is a volatile substance, some of which is blown off in small quantities in the expired air of the lungs, thus giving the breath an acetone smell that is frequently used to diagnose ketosis.

Adaptation to a High-Fat Diet. When changing slowly from a carbohydrate diet to a diet almost entirely of fat, a person's body adapts to use far more acetoacetic acid than usual, and in this case, ketosis normally does not occur. For instance, in the Inuit (Eskimos), who sometimes live mainly on a fat diet, ketosis does not develop. Undoubtedly, several factors, none of which is clear, enhance the rate of acetoacetic acid metabolism by the cells. After a few weeks, even the brain cells, which normally derive almost all their energy from glucose, can derive $50 \%$ to $75 \%$ of their energy from fats.

## Synthesis of Triglycerides From Carbohydrates

Whenever a greater quantity of carbohydrates enters the body than can be used immediately for energy or can be stored in the form of glycogen, the excess is rapidly converted into triglycerides and stored in this form in the adipose tissue.

In humans, most triglyceride synthesis occurs in the liver, but minute quantities are also synthesized in the adipose tissue. The triglycerides formed in the liver are transported mainly in VLDLs to the adipose tissue, where they are stored.

Conversion of Acetyl-CoA Into Fatty Acids. The first step in the synthesis of triglycerides is conversion of carbohydrates into acetyl-CoA. As explained in Chapter 68, this conversion occurs during the normal degradation of glucose by the glycolytic system. Because fatty acids are actually large polymers of acetic acid, it is easy to understand how acetyl-CoA can be converted into fatty acids. However, the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA is not achieved by simply reversing the oxidative degradation described earlier. Instead, this occurs by the two-step process shown in Figure 69-4, using malonyl-CoA and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as the principal intermediates in the polymerization process.

## Combination of Fatty Acids With $\alpha$-Glycerophosphate to Form Triglycerides

Once the synthesized fatty acid chains have grown to contain 14 to 18 carbon atoms, they bind with glycerol to form triglycerides. The enzymes that cause this conversion are highly specific for fatty acids, with chain lengths of 14 carbon atoms or greater, a factor that controls the physical quality of the triglycerides stored in the body.

As shown in Figure 69-5, the glycerol portion of triglycerides is furnished by $\alpha$-glycerophosphate, which is another product derived from the glycolytic scheme of glucose degradation. This mechanism is discussed in Chapter 68.

Efficiency of Carbohydrate Conversion Into Fat. During triglyceride synthesis, only about $15 \%$ of the original energy in the glucose is lost in the form of heat; the remaining $85 \%$ is transferred to the stored triglycerides.

Importance of Fat Synthesis and Storage. Fat synthesis from carbohydrates is especially important for two reasons:

1. The ability of the different cells of the body to store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen is generally slight; a maximum of only a few hundred grams of glycogen can be stored in the liver, the skeletal muscles, and all other tissues of the body put together. In contrast, many kilograms of fat can be stored in adipose tissue. Therefore, fat synthesis provides a means by which the energy of excess ingested carbohydrates (and proteins) can be stored for later use. Indeed, the average person has almost 150 times as much energy stored in the form of fat as stored in the form of carbohydrate.
2. Each gram of fat contains almost two and a half times the calories of energy contained by each gram of glycogen. Therefore, for a given weight gain, a person can store several times as much energy in the form of fat as in the form of carbohydrate, which is exceedingly important when an animal must be highly motile to survive.
Failure to Synthesize Fats From Carbohydrates in the
Absence of Insulin. When insufficient insulin is available, as occurs in persons with serious cases of diabetes mellitus, fats are poorly synthesized, if at all, for the following reasons. First, when insulin is not available, glucose does not enter the fat and liver cells satisfactorily, so little of the acetyl-CoA and NADPH needed for fat synthesis can be derived from glucose. Second, lack of glucose in the fat cells greatly reduces the availability of $\alpha$-glycerophosphate, which also makes it difficult for the tissues to form triglycerides.

Figure 69-4. Synthesis of fatty acids.

## Synthesis of Triglycerides From Proteins

Many amino acids can be converted into acetyl-CoA, as discussed in Chapter 70. The acetyl-CoA can then be synthesized into triglycerides. Therefore, when people have more proteins in their diets than their tissues can use as proteins, a large share of the excess is stored as fat.

## Regulation of Energy Release From Triglycerides

Carbohydrates Are Preferred Over Fats for Energy When Excess Carbohydrates Are Available. When excess carbohydrates are available in the body, carbohydrates are used preferentially over triglycerides for energy. Several reasons exist for this "fat-sparing" effect of carbohydrates.

First, fats in adipose tissue cells are present in two forms: stored triglycerides and small quantities of free fatty acids. They are in constant equilibrium with each other. When excess $\alpha$-glycerophosphate is present (which occurs when excess carbohydrates are available), the excess $\alpha$-glycerophosphate binds the free fatty acids in the form of stored triglycerides. As a result, the equilibrium between free fatty acids and triglycerides shifts toward the stored triglycerides; consequently, only minute quantities of fatty acids are available to be used for energy. Because $\alpha$-glycerophosphate is an important product of glucose metabolism, the availability of large amounts of glucose automatically inhibits the use of fatty acids for energy.

Second, when carbohydrates are available in excess, fatty acids are synthesized more rapidly than they are degraded. This effect is caused partially by the large quantities of acetyl-CoA formed from the carbohydrates and by the low concentration of free fatty acids in the adipose tissue, thus creating conditions appropriate for the conversion of acetyl-CoA into fatty acids.

An even more important effect that promotes conversion of carbohydrates to fats is the following: The first step, which is the rate-limiting step, in the synthesis of fatty acids is carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA. The rate of this reaction is controlled primarily by the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the activity of which is accelerated in the presence of intermediates of the citric acid cycle. When excess carbohydrates are being used, these intermediates increase, automatically causing increased synthesis of fatty acids.

Thus, an excess of carbohydrates in the diet not only acts as a fat-sparer but also increases fat stores. In fact, all the excess carbohydrates not used for energy or stored in the small glycogen deposits of the body are converted to fat for storage.
![gu1858052264](gu1858052264.jpg)

Figure 69-5. Overall schema for synthesis of triglycerides from glucose.

Acceleration of Fat Utilization for Energy in the Absence of Carbohydrates. All the fat-sparing effects of carbohydrates are lost and actually reversed when carbohydrates are not available. The equilibrium shifts in the opposite direction, and fat is mobilized from adipose cells and used for energy in place of carbohydrates.

Also important are several hormonal changes that take place to promote rapid fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue. Among the most important of these hormonal changes is a marked decrease in pancreatic secretion of insulin caused by the absence of carbohydrates. This decrease in insulin not only reduces the rate of glucose utilization by the tissues but also decreases fat storage, which further shifts the equilibrium in favor of fat metabolism in place of carbohydrates.

Hormonal Regulation of Fat Utilization. At least seven of the hormones secreted by the endocrine glands have significant effects on fat utilization. Some important hormonal effects on fat metabolism, in addition to lack of insulin, are noted here.

Probably the most dramatic increase that occurs in fat utilization is that observed during heavy exercise. This increase results almost entirely from release of epinephrine and norepinephrine by the adrenal medullae during exercise, as a result of sympathetic stimulation. These two hormones directly activate hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase, which is present in abundance in the fat cells, and this activation causes rapid breakdown of triglycerides and mobilization of fatty acids. Sometimes the free fatty acid concentration in the blood of an exercising person rises as much as eightfold, and the use of these fatty acids by the muscles for energy is correspondingly increased. Other types of stress that activate the sympathetic nervous system can also increase fatty acid mobilization and utilization in a similar manner.

Stress also causes large quantities of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to be released by the anterior pituitary gland, which causes the adrenal cortex to secrete extra quantities of glucocorticoids. Both ACTH and glucocorticoids activate either the same hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase as that activated by epinephrine and norepinephrine or a similar lipase. When ACTH and glucocorticoids are secreted in excessive amounts for long periods, as occurs in the endocrine condition called Cushing's syndrome, fats are frequently mobilized to such a great extent that ketosis results. ACTH and glucocorticoids are then said to have a ketogenic effect. Growth hormone has an effect similar to but weaker than that of ACTH and glucocorticoids in activating hormone-sensitive lipase. Therefore, growth hormone can also have a mild ketogenic effect.

Thyroid hormone indirectly causes rapid mobilization of fat by increasing overall rate of energy metabolism in all cells of the body under the influence of this hormone. The resulting reduction in acetyl-CoA and other intermediates of both fat and carbohydrate metabolism in the cells is a stimulus to fat mobilization.

The effects of the different hormones on metabolism are discussed further in the chapters dealing with each hormone.

## Obesity—Excess Deposition of Fat

Obesity is discussed in Chapter 72 in relation to dietary balances, but briefly, it is caused by the ingestion of greater amounts of food than can be used by the body for energy. The excess food, whether fats, carbohydrates, or proteins, is
then stored almost entirely as fat in the adipose tissue, to be used later for energy. The ability of humans to store excess energy in adipose tissue is tremendous, with some people achieving body weights in excess of 500 kilograms (1100 pounds), mainly as a result of fat accumulation.

Several strains of rodents have been found in which hereditary obesity occurs. In at least one of these strains, the obesity is caused by ineffective mobilization of fat from the adipose tissue by tissue lipase, while synthesis and storage of fat continue normally. Such a one-way process causes progressive enhancement of the fat stores, resulting in severe obesity. Multiple genetic factors that influence brain feeding centers or pathways that control energy expenditure or that alter energy storage can also cause hereditary obesity in humans. However, monogenic (single gene) causes of human obesity are rare, as discussed in Chapter 72.

## Phospholipids and Cholesterol

## Phospholipids

The major types of body phospholipids are lecithins, cephalins, and sphingomyelin; their typical chemical formulas are shown in Figure 69-6. Phospholipids always contain one
![gu1958052264](gu1958052264.jpg)

Figure 69-6. Typical phospholipids.

or more fatty acid molecules and one phosphoric acid radical, and they usually contain a nitrogenous base. Although the chemical structures of phospholipids are somewhat variant, their physical properties are similar because they are all lipid soluble, transported in lipoproteins, and used throughout the body for various structural purposes, such as in cell membranes and intracellular membranes.

Formation of Phospholipids. Phospholipids are synthesized in essentially all cells of the body, although certain cells have a special ability to form great quantities of them. Probably $90 \%$ of phospholipids are formed in liver cells; substantial quantities are also formed by the intestinal epithelial cells during lipid absorption from the gut.

The rate of phospholipid formation is governed to some extent by the usual factors that control the overall rate of fat metabolism because, when triglycerides are deposited in the liver, the rate of phospholipid formation increases. Also, specific chemical substances are needed for the formation of some phospholipids. For instance, choline, either obtained in the diet or synthesized in the body, is necessary for formation of lecithin, because choline is the nitrogenous base of the lecithin molecule. In addition, inositol is necessary for formation of some cephalins.

Specific Uses of Phospholipids. Phospholipids have several functions, including the following:

1. Phospholipids are an important constituent of lipoproteins in the blood and are essential for formation and function of most of these lipoproteins; in the absence of phospholipids, serious abnormalities of transport of cholesterol and other lipids can occur.
2. Thromboplastin, which is necessary to initiate the clotting process, is composed mainly of one of the cephalins.
3. Large quantities of sphingomyelin are present in the nervous system; this substance acts as an electrical insulator in the myelin sheath around nerve fibers.
4. Phospholipids are donors of phosphate radicals when these radicals are necessary for different chemical reactions in the tissues.
5. One of the most important functions of phospholipids is participation in formation of structural elementsmainly membranes-in cells throughout the body, as discussed in the next section of this chapter in connection with a similar function for cholesterol.

## Cholesterol

Cholesterol, the formula of which is shown in Figure 69-7, is present in the normal diet, and it can be absorbed slowly from the gastrointestinal tract into the intestinal lymph. It is highly fat soluble but only slightly soluble in water. It is specifically capable of forming esters with fatty acids.
![gu2058052264](gu2058052264.jpg)

Figure 69-7. Cholesterol.

Indeed, about $70 \%$ of the cholesterol in the lipoproteins of the plasma is in the form of cholesterol esters.

Formation of Cholesterol. Besides the cholesterol absorbed each day from the gastrointestinal tract, which is called exogenous cholesterol, an even greater quantity is formed in the cells of the body, called endogenous cholesterol. Essentially all the endogenous cholesterol that circulates in the lipoproteins of the plasma is formed by the liver, but all other cells of the body form at least some cholesterol, which is consistent with the fact that many of the membranous structures of all cells are partially composed of this substance.

The basic structure of cholesterol is a sterol nucleus, which is synthesized entirely from multiple molecules of acetyl-CoA. In turn, the sterol nucleus can be modified by various side chains to form (1) cholesterol; (2) cholic acid, which is the basis of the bile acids formed in the liver; and (3) many important steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex, the ovaries, and the testes (these hormones are discussed in later chapters).

Factors That Affect Plasma Cholesterol ConcentrationFeedback Control of Body Cholesterol. Among the important factors that affect plasma cholesterol concentration are the following:

1. An increase in the amount of cholesterol ingested each day may increase the plasma concentration slightly. However, when cholesterol is ingested, the rising concentration of cholesterol inhibits the most essential enzyme for endogenous synthesis of cholesterol, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, thus providing an intrinsic feedback control system to prevent an excessive increase in plasma cholesterol concentration. As a result, plasma cholesterol concentration usually is not changed upward or downward more than $\pm 15 \%$ by altering the amount of cholesterol in the diet, although the response of individuals differs markedly.
2. A diet high in saturated fat increases blood cholesterol concentration $15 \%$ to $25 \%$, especially when this diet is associated with excess weight gain and obesity. This increase in blood cholesterol results from increased fat deposition in the liver, which then provides increased quantities of acetyl-CoA in the liver cells for the production of cholesterol. Therefore, to decrease the blood cholesterol concentration, maintaining a normal body weight and a diet low in saturated fat are even more important than maintaining a diet low in cholesterol.
3. Ingestion of fat containing highly unsaturated fatty acids usually depresses the blood cholesterol concentration a slight to moderate amount. The mechanism of this effect is unknown, despite the fact that this observation is the basis of much present-day dietary strategy.
4. Lack of insulin or thyroid hormone increases the blood cholesterol concentration, whereas excess thyroid hormone decreases the concentration. These effects are probably caused mainly by changes in the degree of activation of specific enzymes responsible for the metabolism of lipids and overall metabolic rate.
5. Genetic disorders of cholesterol metabolism may greatly increase plasma cholesterol levels. For example, mutations of the LDL receptor gene prevent the liver from adequately removing the cholesterol-rich LDLs from

the plasma. As discussed later, this phenomenon causes the liver to produce excessive amounts of cholesterol. Mutations of the gene that encodes apolipoprotein $B$, the part of the LDL that binds to the receptor, also cause excessive cholesterol production by the liver.
Specific Uses of Cholesterol in the Body. By far the most abundant non-membranous use of cholesterol in the body is to form cholic acid in the liver. As much as $80 \%$ of cholesterol is converted into cholic acid. As explained in Chapter 71, cholic acid is conjugated with other substances to form bile salts, which promote digestion and absorption of fats.

A small quantity of cholesterol is used by (1) the adrenal glands to form adrenocortical hormones, (2) the ovaries to form progesterone and estrogen, and (3) the testes to form testosterone. These glands can also synthesize their own sterols and then form hormones from them, as discussed in the chapters on endocrinology.

A large amount of cholesterol is precipitated in the corneum of the skin. This cholesterol, along with other lipids, makes the skin highly resistant to the absorption of water-soluble substances and to the action of many chemical agents because cholesterol and the other skin lipids are highly inert to acids and to many solvents that might otherwise easily penetrate the body. Also, these lipid substances help prevent water evaporation from the skin; without this protection, the amount of evaporation can be 5 to 10 liters per day (as occurs in patients with burns who have lost their skin) instead of the usual 300 to 400 milliliters.

Cellular Structural Functions of Phospholipids and Cholesterol-Especially for Membranes. The previously mentioned uses of phospholipids and cholesterol are of only minor importance in comparison with their function of forming specialized structures, mainly membranes, in all cells of the body. In Chapter 2, it was pointed out that large quantities of phospholipids and cholesterol are present in both the cell membrane and the membranes of the internal organelles of all cells. It is also known that the ratio of membrane cholesterol to phospholipids is especially important in determining the fluidity of cell membranes.

For membranes to be formed, substances that are not soluble in water must be available. In general, the only substances in the body that are not soluble in water (besides the inorganic substances of bone) are the lipids and some proteins. Thus, the physical integrity of cells everywhere in the body is based mainly on phospholipids, cholesterol, and certain insoluble proteins. The polar charges on the phospholipids also reduce the interfacial tension between the cell membranes and the surrounding fluids.

Another fact that indicates the importance of phospholipids and cholesterol for the formation of structural elements of the cells is the slow turnover rates of these substances in most non-hepatic tissues-turnover rates measured in months or years. For instance, their function in brain cells to provide memory processes is related mainly to their indestructible physical properties.

## Atherosclerosis

Atherosclerosis is a disease of the large and intermediatesized arteries in which fatty lesions called atheromatous plaques develop on the inside surfaces of the arterial walls.

Arteriosclerosis, in contrast, is a general term that refers to thickened and stiffened blood vessels of all sizes.

One abnormality that can be measured very early in blood vessels that later become atherosclerotic is damage to the vascular endothelium. This damage, in turn, increases the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and decreases their ability to release nitric oxide and other substances that help prevent adhesion of macromolecules, platelets, and monocytes to the endothelium. After damage to the vascular endothelium occurs, circulating monocytes and lipids (mostly LDLs) begin to accumulate at the site of injury (Figure 69-8A). The monocytes cross the endothelium, enter the intima of the vessel wall, and differentiate to become macrophages, which then ingest and oxidize the accumulated lipoproteins, giving the macrophages a foamlike appearance. These macrophage foam cells then aggregate on the blood vessel and form a visible fatty streak.

With time, the fatty streaks grow larger and coalesce, and the surrounding fibrous and smooth muscle tissues proliferate to form larger and larger plaques (see Figure 69-8B). Also, the macrophages release substances that cause inflammation and further proliferation of smooth muscle and fibrous tissue on the inside surfaces of the arterial wall. The lipid deposits plus the cellular proliferation can become so large that the plaque bulges into the lumen of the artery and greatly reduces blood flow, sometimes completely occluding the vessel. Even without occlusion, the fibroblasts of the plaque eventually deposit extensive amounts of dense connective tissue; sclerosis (fibrosis) becomes so great that the arteries become stiff. Still later, calcium salts often precipitate with the cholesterol and other lipids of the plaques, leading to bony-hard calcifications that can make the arteries rigid tubes. Both of these later stages of the disease are called "hardening of the arteries."

Atherosclerotic arteries lose most of their distensibility, and because of the degenerative areas in their walls, they are easily ruptured. Also, where the plaques protrude into the flowing blood, their rough surfaces can cause blood clots to develop, with resultant thrombus or embolus formation (see Chapter 37), leading to a sudden blockage of all blood flow in the artery.

Almost half of all deaths in the United States and Europe are due to vascular disease. About two-thirds of these deaths are caused by thrombosis of one or more coronary arteries. The remaining one-third are caused by thrombosis or hemorrhage of vessels in other organs of the body, especially the brain (causing strokes), but also the kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, limbs, and so forth.

## Roles of Cholesterol and Lipoproteins in Atherosclerosis

Increased Low-Density Lipoproteins. An important factor in causing atherosclerosis is a high blood plasma concentration of cholesterol in the form of LDLs. The plasma concentration of these high-cholesterol LDLs is increased by several factors, especially by eating highly saturated fat in the daily diet, obesity, and physical inactivity. To a much lesser extent, eating excess cholesterol may also raise plasma levels of LDLs.

Familial Hypercholesterolemia. In $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, the person inherits defective genes for the formation of LDL receptors on the membrane surfaces of the body's cells. In the absence of these receptors, the liver cannot absorb either IDL or LDL. Without this absorption, the cholesterol machinery of the liver cells goes on a rampage, producing new cholesterol;

![gu2158052264](gu2158052264.jpg)

Figure 69-8. Development of atherosclerotic plaque. A, Attachment of a monocyte to an adhesion molecule on a damaged endothelial cell of an artery. The monocyte then migrates through the endothelium into the intimal layer of the arterial wall and is transformed into a macrophage. The macrophage then ingests and oxidizes lipoprotein molecules, becoming a macrophage foam cell. The foam cells release substances that cause inflammation and growth of the intimal layer. B, Additional accumulation of macrophages and growth of the intima cause the plaque to grow larger and accumulate lipids. Eventually, the plaque may occlude the vessel or rupture, causing the blood in the artery to coagulate and form a thrombus. (Modified from Libby P: Inflammation in atherosclerosis. Nature 420:868, 2002.)
it is no longer responsive to the feedback inhibition of too much plasma cholesterol. As a result, the number of VLDLs released by the liver into the plasma increases immensely.

A much smaller percentage ( $\sim 2 \%$ ) of persons with familial hypercholesterolemia have gain of function mutations of the PCSK9 gene that encodes the enzyme proprotein
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9; this enzyme binds to the LDL receptor and induces a conformational change that leads to its destruction, thereby reducing LDL absorption by the liver and other cells and increasing plasma cholesterol markedly. Drugs that inhibit PCSK9 are now available to treat familial hypercholesterolemia, although they are still very expensive and not widely used.

Patients with full-blown familial hypercholesterolemia may have blood cholesterol concentrations of 600 to 1000 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$, levels that are four to six times normal. If untreated, many of these people die before age 30 years because of myocardial infarction or other sequelae of atherosclerotic blockage of blood vessels throughout the body.

Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is relatively common and occurs in about 1 in 500 people. The more severe form of this disorder caused by homozygous mutations is much rarer, occurring in only about one of every million births on average.

Role of High-Density Lipoproteins in Preventing Atherosclerosis. Much less is known about the function of HDLs compared with that of LDLs. It is believed that HDLs can actually absorb cholesterol crystals that are beginning to be deposited in arterial walls. Animal experiments also suggest that HDL may have other actions that protect against atherosclerosis, such as inhibition of oxidative stress and prevention of inflammation in blood vessels. Whether or not these mechanisms are true, epidemiological studies indicate that when a person has a high ratio of high-density to low-density lipoproteins, the likelihood of developing atherosclerosis is greatly reduced. Yet, clinical studies with drugs that increase HDL levels have failed to demonstrate decreased risk for cardiovascular disease. These discrepant results indicate the need for additional research on the basic mechanisms by which HDL may influence atherosclerosis.

## Other Major Risk Factors for Atherosclerosis

In some people with perfectly normal levels of cholesterol and lipoproteins, atherosclerosis still develops. Some of the factors that are known to predispose to atherosclerosis are (1) physical inactivity and obesity, (2) diabetes mellitus, (3) hypertension, (4) hyperlipidemia, and (5) cigarette smoking.

Hypertension, for example, increases the risk for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease by at least twofold. Likewise, persons with diabetes mellitus have, on average, more than a twofold increased risk of developing coronary artery disease. When hypertension and diabetes mellitus occur together, the risk for coronary artery disease is increased by more than eightfold. When hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia are all present, the risk for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is increased almost 20 -fold, suggesting that these factors interact in a synergistic manner to increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis. In many overweight and obese patients, these three risk factors do occur together, greatly increasing their risk for atherosclerosis, which in turn may lead to heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease.

In early and middle adulthood, men are more likely to develop atherosclerosis than are women of comparable age, suggesting that male sex hormones might be atherogenic or, conversely, that female sex hormones might be protective.

Some of these factors cause atherosclerosis by increasing the concentration of LDLs in the plasma. Others, such as hypertension, lead to atherosclerosis by causing damage to the vascular endothelium and other changes in the vascular tissues that predispose to cholesterol deposition.

To add to the complexity of atherosclerosis, experimental studies suggest that excess blood levels of iron can lead to atherosclerosis, perhaps by forming free radicals in the blood that damage the vessel walls. About one-quarter of all people have a special type of LDL called lipoprotein(a), containing an additional protein, apolipoprotein(a), that almost doubles the incidence of atherosclerosis. The precise mechanisms of these atherogenic effects have yet to be discovered.

## Prevention of Atherosclerosis

The most important measures to protect against the development of atherosclerosis and its progression to serious vascular disease are (1) maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and eating a diet that contains mainly unsaturated fat with a low cholesterol content; (2) preventing hypertension by maintaining a healthy diet and being physically active, or effectively controlling blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs if hypertension does develop; (3) effectively controlling blood glucose with insulin treatment or other drugs if diabetes develops; and (4) avoiding cigarette smoking.

Several types of drugs that lower plasma lipids and cholesterol have proved to be valuable in preventing atherosclerosis. Most of the cholesterol formed in the liver is converted into bile acids and secreted in this form into the duodenum; then, more than $90 \%$ of these same bile acids is reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and used over and over again in the bile. Therefore, any agent that combines with the bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract and prevents their reabsorption into the circulation can decrease the total bile acid pool in the circulating blood. As a result, far more of the liver cholesterol is converted into new bile acids. Thus, simply eating oat bran, which binds bile acids and is a constituent of many breakfast cereals, increases the proportion of liver cholesterol that forms new bile acids rather than forming new LDLs and atherogenic plaques. Resin agents can also be used to bind bile acids in the gut and increase their fecal excretion, thereby reducing cholesterol synthesis by the liver.

Another group of drugs called statins competitively inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme $A$ (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol. This inhibition decreases cholesterol synthesis and increases LDL receptors in the liver, usually causing a $25 \%$
to $50 \%$ reduction in plasma levels of LDLs. The statins may also have other beneficial effects that help prevent atherosclerosis, such as attenuating vascular inflammation. These drugs are now widely used to treat patients who have increased plasma cholesterol levels.

In general, studies show that for each $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ decrease in LDL cholesterol in the plasma, there is about a $2 \%$ decrease in mortality from atherosclerotic heart disease. Therefore, appropriate preventive measures are valuable in decreasing heart attacks.

# Protein Metabolism 

About three-quarters of the body solids are proteins. These proteins include structural proteins, enzymes, nucleoproteins, proteins that transport oxygen, proteins of the muscle that cause muscle contraction, and many other types that perform specific intracellular and extracellular functions throughout the body.

The basic chemical properties that explain the diverse functions of proteins are so extensive that they constitute a major portion of the entire discipline of biochemistry. For this reason, the current discussion is confined to a few specific aspects of protein metabolism that are important as background for other discussions in this text.

## Basic Properties of Proteins

## Amino Acids Are the Principal Constituents of Proteins

The principal constituents of proteins are amino acids. Twenty of these amino acids are present in the body proteins in significant quantities. Figure 70-1, which shows the chemical formulas of these 20 amino acids, demonstrates that they all have two features in common; each amino acid has an acidic group $(-\mathrm{COOH})$ and a nitrogen atom attached to the molecule, usually represented by the amino group $\left(-\mathrm{NH}_{2}\right)$.

Peptide Linkages and Peptide Chains. The amino acids of proteins are aggregated into long chains by means of peptide linkages. The chemical nature of this linkage is demonstrated by the following reaction:
![gu2258052264](gu2258052264.jpg)

Note in this reaction that the nitrogen of the amino radical of one amino acid bonds with the carbon of the carboxyl radical of the other amino acid. A hydrogen ion
is released from the amino radical, and a hydroxyl ion is released from the carboxyl radical; these two ions combine to form a molecule of water. After the peptide linkage has been formed, an amino radical and a carboxyl radical are still at opposite ends of the new, longer molecule. Each of these radicals is capable of combining with additional amino acids to form a peptide chain. Some complicated protein molecules have many thousands of amino acids combined by peptide linkages, and even the smallest protein molecule usually has more than 20 amino acids combined by peptide linkages. The average is about 400 amino acids.

Other Linkages in Protein Molecules. Some protein molecules are composed of several peptide chains rather than a single chain, and these chains are bound to one another by other linkages, often by hydrogen bonding between the CO and NH radicals of the peptides, as follows:
![gu2358052264](gu2358052264.jpg)

Many peptide chains are coiled or folded, and the successive coils or folds are held in a tight spiral or in other shapes by similar hydrogen bonding and other forces.

## Transport and Storage of Amino Acids

## Blood Amino Acids

The normal concentration of amino acids in the blood is between 35 and $65 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$, which is an average of about 2 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ for each of the 20 amino acids, although some are present in far greater amounts than are others. Because the amino acids are relatively strong acids, they exist in the blood principally in the ionized state, as a result of the removal of one hydrogen atom from the $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ radical. They actually account for 2 to 3 milliequivalents of the negative ions in the blood. The precise distribution of the different amino acids in the blood depends to some extent on the types of proteins eaten, but the concentrations of at least some individual amino acids are regulated by selective synthesis in the different cells.

![gu2458052264](gu2458052264.jpg)

Figure 70-1. Amino acids. The 10 essential amino acids cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities in the body; these amino acids must be obtained, already formed, from food.

Fate of Amino Acids Absorbed From the Gastrointestinal Tract. The products of protein digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract are almost entirely amino acids; only rarely are polypeptides or whole protein molecules absorbed from the digestive tract into the blood. Soon after a meal, the amino acid concentration in a person's blood rises, but the increase is usually only a few milligrams per deciliter, for two reasons: First, protein digestion and absorption are usually extended over 2 to 3 hours, which allows only small quantities of amino acids to be absorbed at a time. Second, after entering the blood, the additional
amino acids are absorbed within 5 to 10 minutes by cells throughout the body, especially by the liver. Therefore, large concentrations of amino acids almost never accumulate in the blood and tissue fluids. Nevertheless, the turnover rate of the amino acids is so rapid that many grams of proteins can be carried from one part of the body to another in the form of amino acids each hour.

Active Transport of Amino Acids Into the Cells. The molecules of all the amino acids are much too large to diffuse readily through the pores of the cell membranes. Therefore, significant quantities of amino acids can move

either inward or outward through the membranes only by facilitated transport or active transport using carrier mechanisms. The nature of some of the carrier mechanisms is not completely understood, but a few are discussed in Chapter 4.

Renal Threshold for Amino Acids. In the kidneys, the different amino acids that are filtered by the glomerular capillaries can be reabsorbed through the proximal tubular epithelium by secondary active transport, which returns them to the blood. However, as is true of other active transport mechanisms in the renal tubules, there is an upper limit to the rate at which each type of amino acid can be transported. For this reason, when the concentration of a particular type of amino acid becomes too high in the plasma and glomerular filtrate, the excess that cannot be actively reabsorbed is lost into the urine.

## Storage of Amino Acids as Proteins in the Cells

After entry into tissue cells, amino acids combine with one another by peptide linkages, under the direction of the cell's messenger RNA and ribosomal system, to form cellular proteins. Therefore, the concentration of free amino acids inside most cells usually remains low, and storage of large quantities of free amino acids does not occur in the cells; instead, they are stored mainly in the form of actual proteins. However, many of these intracellular proteins can be rapidly decomposed again into amino acids under the influence of intracellular lysosomal digestive enzymes. These amino acids can then be transported back out of the cell into the blood. Special exceptions to this reversal process are the proteins in the chromosomes of the nucleus and the structural proteins such as collagen and muscle contractile proteins. These proteins do not participate significantly in this reverse digestion and transport back out of the cells.

Some tissues of the body participate in the storage of amino acids to a greater extent than do others. For example, the liver, which is a large organ and has special systems for processing amino acids, can store large quantities of rapidly exchangeable proteins, which is also true of the kidneys and the intestinal mucosa to a lesser extent.

Amino Acid Release From Cells as a Means of Regulating Plasma Amino Acid Concentration. Whenever plasma amino acid concentrations fall below normal levels, the required amino acids are transported out of the cells to replenish their supply in the plasma. In this way, the plasma concentration of each type of amino acid is maintained at a reasonably constant value. Some of the hormones secreted by the endocrine glands are able to alter the balance between tissue proteins and circulating amino acids. For example, growth hormone and insulin increase the formation of tissue proteins, whereas adrenocortical glucocorticoid hormones increase the concentration of plasma amino acids.

Reversible Equilibrium Between the Proteins in Different Parts of the Body. Because cellular proteins in the liver (and, to a much less extent, in other tissues) can be synthesized rapidly from plasma amino acids, and because many of these proteins can be degraded and returned to the plasma almost as rapidly, constant interchange and equilibrium occurs between the plasma amino acids and labile proteins in virtually all cells of the body. For example, if a particular tissue requires proteins, it can synthesize new proteins from amino acids of the blood; in turn, blood amino acids
are replenished by degradation of proteins from other cells of the body, especially from liver cells. These effects are particularly noticeable in relation to protein synthesis in cancer cells. Cancer cells are often prolific users of amino acids; therefore, the proteins of the other cells can become markedly depleted.

Upper Limit for the Storage of Proteins. Each type of cell has an upper limit with regard to the amount of proteins it can store. After all the cells have reached their limits, the excess amino acids still in the circulation are degraded into other products and used for energy, as discussed subsequently, or they are converted to fat or glycogen and stored in these forms.

## Functional Roles of the Plasma Proteins

The major types of protein present in the plasma are albumin, globulin, and fibrinogen.

A major function of albumin is to provide colloid osmotic pressure in the plasma, which prevents plasma loss from the capillaries, as discussed in Chapter 16.

The globulins perform several enzymatic functions in the plasma, but equally important, they are principally responsible for both the natural and acquired immunity of the body against invading organisms, as discussed in Chapter 35.

Fibrinogen polymerizes into long fibrin threads during blood coagulation, thereby forming blood clots that help repair leaks in the circulatory system, as discussed in Chapter 37.

Formation of the Plasma Proteins. Essentially all the albumin and fibrinogen of the plasma proteins, as well as $50 \%$ to $80 \%$ of the globulins, are formed in the liver. The remaining globulins, which are formed almost entirely in lymphoid tissues, are mainly gamma globulins that constitute antibodies used in the immune system.

The rate of plasma protein formation by the liver can be extremely high-as much as $30 \mathrm{~g} /$ day. Certain disease conditions cause rapid loss of plasma proteins; for example, severe burns that denude large surface areas of the skin can cause the loss of several liters of plasma through the denuded areas each day. The rapid production of plasma proteins by the liver is valuable in preventing death in such states. Occasionally, a person with severe renal disease loses as much as 20 grams of plasma protein in the urine each day for months, and this plasma protein is continually replaced mainly by liver production of the required proteins.

In persons with cirrhosis of the liver, large numbers of liver cells are destroyed and replaced by fibrous tissue, causing a reduction in the liver's ability to synthesize plasma proteins. As discussed in Chapter 25, liver cirrhosis leads to decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure, which causes generalized edema.

Plasma Proteins as a Source of Amino Acids for the Tissues. When the tissues become depleted of proteins, the plasma proteins can act as a source of rapid replacement. Indeed, whole plasma proteins can be imbibed in toto by tissue macrophages through the process of pinocytosis; once in these cells, they are split into amino acids that are transported back into the blood and used throughout the body to build cellular proteins wherever they are needed. In this way, the plasma proteins function as a labile protein storage medium and represent a readily available source of amino acids whenever a particular tissue requires them.

![gu2558052264](gu2558052264.jpg)

Figure 70-2. Reversible equilibrium among the tissue proteins, plasma proteins, and plasma amino acids.

Reversible Equilibrium Between the Plasma Proteins and the Tissue Proteins. As shown in Figure 70-2, a constant state of equilibrium exists among the plasma proteins, the amino acids of the plasma, and the tissue proteins. On the basis of radioactive tracer studies, it has been estimated that normally about 400 grams of body protein are synthesized and degraded each day as part of the continual state of flux of amino acids, which demonstrates the general principle of reversible exchange of amino acids among the different proteins of the body. Even during starvation or severe debilitating diseases, the ratio of total tissue proteins to total plasma proteins in the body remains relatively constant at about 33:1.

Because of this reversible equilibrium between plasma proteins and the other proteins of the body, one of the most effective therapies for severe, acute whole-body protein deficiency is intravenous transfusion of plasma protein. Within a few days, or sometimes within hours, the amino acids of administered protein are distributed throughout the cells of the body to form new proteins as needed.

Essential and Nonessential Amino Acids. Ten of the amino acids normally present in animal proteins can be synthesized in the cells, whereas the other 10 either cannot be synthesized or are synthesized in quantities too small to supply the body's needs. This second group of amino acids that cannot be synthesized is called the essential amino acids. Use of the word "essential" does not mean that the other 10 "nonessential" amino acids are not required for the formation of proteins but only that the others are not essential in the diet because they can be synthesized in the body.

Synthesis of the nonessential amino acids depends mainly on the formation of appropriate $\alpha$-keto acids, which are the precursors of the respective amino acids. For example, pyruvic acid, which is formed in large quantities during the glycolytic breakdown of glucose, is the keto acid precursor of the amino acid alanine. Then, by the process of transamination, an amino radical is transferred to the $\alpha$-keto acid, and the keto oxygen is transferred to the donor of the amino radical. This reaction is shown in Figure 70-3. Note that alanine is formed after the amino radical is transferred to the pyruvic acid from glutamic acid. Amino radicals can be transferred from asparagine, aspartic acid,
![gu2658052264](gu2658052264.jpg)

Figure 70-3. Synthesis of alanine from pyruvic acid by transamination.
and glutamine. Glutamine is present in the tissues in large quantities, and one of its principal functions is to serve as an amino radical storehouse.

Note also that the reactions are reversible so that transfer of amino groups can also occur during degradation of amino acids, as discussed later.

Transamination is promoted by several enzymes, among which are the aminotransferases, which are derivatives of pyridoxine, one of the B vitamins $\left(\mathrm{B}_{6}\right)$. Without this vitamin, the amino acids are poorly synthesized, and protein formation cannot proceed normally.

## Use of Proteins for Energy

Once the cells are filled to their limits with stored protein, any additional amino acids in the body fluids are degraded and used for energy or are stored mainly as fat or secondarily as glycogen. This degradation occurs almost entirely in the liver, and it begins with deamination, which is explained in the following section.

Deamination—Removal of Amino Groups From Amino Acids. Deamination occurs mainly by transamination, which means transfer of the amino group to some acceptor substance. This process is the reverse of the process for synthesis of amino acids, which was previously explained.

The greatest amount of deamination occurs according to the following transamination schema:
![gu2758052264](gu2758052264.jpg)

Note from this illustration that the amino group from the amino acid is transferred to $\alpha$-ketoglutaric acid, which then becomes glutamic acid. The glutamic acid can then transfer the amino group to other substances or release it in the form of ammonia $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$. In the process of losing the amino group, the glutamic acid once again becomes

$\alpha$-ketoglutaric acid, so the cycle can be repeated again and again. To initiate this process, the excess amino acids in the cells, especially in the liver, induce activation of large quantities of aminotransferases, the enzymes responsible for initiating most deamination.

Urea Formation by the Liver. The ammonia released during deamination of amino acids is removed from the blood almost entirely by conversion into urea. Two molecules of ammonia $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$ and one molecule of carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ combine in the following net reaction:

$$
2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~N}-\underset{\substack{\text { O } \\ 0}}{\mathrm{C}}-\mathrm{NH}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

Essentially all urea formed in the human body is synthesized in the liver. In the absence of the liver or in persons with serious liver disease, ammonia accumulates in the blood. This accumulation of ammonia is extremely toxic, especially to the brain, and can lead to a state called hepatic coma.

The stages in the formation of urea are essentially the following:
![gu2858052264](gu2858052264.jpg)

After its formation, the urea diffuses from the liver cells into the body fluids and is excreted by the kidneys.

Oxidation of Deaminated Amino Acids. Once amino acids have been deaminated, the resulting keto acids can, in most cases, be oxidized to release energy for metabolic purposes. This oxidation usually involves two successive processes:

1. The keto acid is changed into an appropriate chemical substance that can enter the citric acid cycle.
2. This substance is degraded by the cycle and used for energy in the same manner that acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) derived from carbohydrate and lipid metabolism is used, as explained in Chapters 68 and 69.
In general, the amount of adenosine triphosphate formed for each gram of protein that is oxidized is slightly less than that formed for each gram of glucose that is oxidized.

Gluconeogenesis and Ketogenesis. Certain deaminated amino acids are similar to the substrates normally used by the cells, mainly the liver cells, to synthesize glucose or fatty acids. For example, deaminated alanine is pyruvic acid, which can be converted into either glucose or glycogen. Alternatively, it can be converted into acetyl-CoA, which can then be polymerized into fatty acids. Also, two molecules of acetyl-CoA can condense to form acetoacetic acid, which is one of the ketone bodies, as explained in Chapter 69.

The conversion of amino acids into glucose or glycogen is called gluconeogenesis, and the conversion of amino acids into keto acids or fatty acids is called ketogenesis. Of the 20 deaminated amino acids, 18 have chemical structures that allow them to be converted into glucose, and 19 of them can be converted into fatty acids.

## Obligatory Degradation of Proteins

When a person eats no proteins, a certain proportion of body proteins is degraded into amino acids and then deaminated and oxidized. This process involves 20 to 30 grams of protein each day, which is called the obligatory loss of proteins. Therefore, to prevent net loss of protein from the body, the average person must ingest a minimum of 20 to 30 grams of protein each day, although this amount depends on multiple factors, including muscle mass, activity, and age; to be on the safe side, a minimum of 60 to 75 grams is usually recommended.

The ratios of the different amino acids in the dietary protein must be about the same as the ratios in the body tissues if the entire dietary protein is to be fully usable to form new tissue proteins. If one particular type of essential amino acid is low in concentration, the others become unusable because cells synthesize either whole proteins or none at all, as explained in Chapter 3 in relation to protein synthesis. The unusable amino acids are deaminated and oxidized. A protein that has a ratio of amino acids different from that of the average body protein is called a partial protein or an incomplete protein, and such a protein is less valuable for nutrition than is a complete protein.

Effect of Starvation on Protein Degradation. Except for the 20 to 30 grams of obligatory protein degradation each day, the body uses almost entirely carbohydrates or fats for energy, as long as they are available. However, after several weeks of starvation, when the quantities of stored carbohydrates and fats begin to run out, the amino acids of the blood are rapidly deaminated and oxidized for energy. From this point on, the proteins of the tissues degrade rapidly-as much as 125 grams daily-and, as a result, cellular functions deteriorate precipitously. Because carbohydrate and fat utilization for energy normally occurs in preference to protein utilization, carbohydrates and fats are called protein sparers.

## Hormonal Regulation of Protein Metabolism

Growth Hormone Increases the Synthesis of Cellular Proteins. Growth hormone causes the tissue proteins to increase. The precise mechanism by which this increase occurs is not fully understood, but it is believed to result mainly from increased transport of amino acids through the cell membranes, acceleration of the DNA and RNA transcription and translation processes for protein synthesis, and decreased oxidation of tissue proteins.

Insulin Is Necessary for Protein Synthesis. Total lack of insulin reduces protein synthesis to almost zero. Insulin accelerates transport of some amino acids into cells, which could be the stimulus for protein synthesis. Also, insulin reduces protein degradation and increases the availability of glucose to the cells, so the need for amino acids for energy is correspondingly reduced.

Glucocorticoids Increase Breakdown of Most Tissue Proteins. Glucocorticoids secreted by the adrenal cortex decrease the quantity of protein in most tissues while

increasing amino acid concentration in the plasma, as well as increasing liver proteins and plasma proteins. Glucocorticoids increase the rate of breakdown of extrahepatic proteins, thereby making increased quantities of amino acids available in the body fluids. This allows the liver to synthesize increased quantities of hepatic cellular proteins and plasma proteins.

Testosterone Increases Protein Deposition in Tissues. Testosterone, the male sex hormone, causes increased deposition of protein in tissues throughout the body, especially the contractile proteins of the muscles (a $30 \%-50 \%$ increase). The mechanism of this effect is unknown, but it is definitely different from the effect of growth hormone, in the following way: Growth hormone causes tissues to continue growing almost indefinitely, whereas testosterone causes the muscles and, to a much lesser extent, some other protein tissues to enlarge for only several months. Once the muscles and other protein tissues have reached a maximum, despite continued administration of testosterone, further protein deposition ceases.

Estrogen. Estrogen, the principal female sex hormone, also causes some deposition of protein, but the effect of estrogen is much less compared with that of testosterone.

Thyroxine Increases Metabolism of Cells. Thyroxine indirectly affects protein metabolism by increasing metabolism of the cells. If insufficient carbohydrates and fats are available for energy, thyroxine causes rapid degradation of proteins and uses them for energy. Conversely, if adequate quantities of carbohydrates and fats are available and excess amino acids are also available in the extracellular fluid, thyroxine can actually increase the rate of protein synthesis. In growing animals or human beings, deficiency of thyroxine causes growth to be greatly inhibited because of lack of protein synthesis. In essence, it is believed that thyroxine has little specific effect on protein metabolism but does have
an important general effect by increasing the rates of both normal anabolic and normal catabolic protein reactions.

# The Liver 

Although the liver is a discrete organ, it performs many different interrelating functions. The critical interrelated functions of the liver become especially evident when abnormalities of the liver occur. This chapter summarizes some of the major functions of the liver, including the following: (1) filtration and storage of blood; (2) metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, hormones, and foreign chemicals; (3) formation of bile; (4) storage of vitamins and iron; and (5) formation of coagulation factors.

## Physiologic Anatomy of the Liver

The liver is the largest organ in the body, contributing about $2 \%$ of the total body weight, or about 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds) in the average adult human. The basic functional unit of the liver is the liver lobule, which is a cylindric structure several millimeters in length and 0.8 to 2 millimeters in diameter. The human liver contains 50,000 to 100,000 individual lobules.

The liver lobule, shown in cut-away format in Figure 71-1, is constructed around a central vein that empties into the hepatic veins and then into the vena cava. The lobule is composed principally of many liver cellular plates (two of which are shown in Figure 71-1) that radiate from the central vein like spokes in a wheel. Each hepatic plate is usually two cells thick, and between the adjacent cells lie small bile canaliculi that empty into bile ducts in the fibrous septa separating the adjacent liver lobules.

In the septa are small portal venules that receive their blood mainly from the venous outflow of the gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein. From these venules blood flows into flat, branching hepatic sinusoids that lie between the hepatic plates and then into the central vein. Thus, the hepatic cells are exposed continuously to portal venous blood.

Hepatic arterioles are also present in the interlobular septa. These arterioles supply arterial blood to the septal tissues between the adjacent lobules, and many of the small arterioles also empty directly into the hepatic sinusoids, most frequently emptying into those located about one third the distance from the interlobular septa, as shown in Figure 71-1.

In addition to the hepatic cells, the venous sinusoids are lined by two other cell types: (1) typical endothelial cells and (2) large Kupffer cells (also called reticuloendothelial cells), which are resident macrophages that line the sinusoids and are capable of phagocytizing bacteria and other foreign matter in the hepatic sinus blood.

The endothelial lining of the sinusoids has extremely large pores, some of which are almost 1 micrometer in diameter. Beneath this lining, lying between the endothelial cells and the hepatic cells, are narrow tissue spaces called the spaces of Disse, also known as the perisinusoidal spaces. The millions of spaces of Disse connect with lymphatic vessels in the interlobular septa. Therefore, excess fluid in these spaces is removed through the lymphatics. Because of the large pores in the endothelium, substances in the plasma move freely into the spaces of Disse. Even large portions of the plasma proteins diffuse freely into these spaces.

## Hepatic Vascular and Lymph Systems

The function of the hepatic vascular system is discussed in Chapter 15 in connection with the portal veins and can be summarized as follows.

## Blood Flows Through the Liver From the Portal Vein and Hepatic Artery

The Liver Has High Blood Flow and Low Vascular Resistance. About $1050 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ of blood flow from the portal vein into the liver sinusoids, and an additional $300 \mathrm{ml} /$ min flow into the sinusoids from the hepatic artery, with the total averaging about $1350 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, which is $27 \%$ of the resting cardiac output.

The pressure in the portal vein leading into the liver averages about 9 mm Hg , and the pressure in the hepatic vein leading from the liver into the vena cava normally averages about 0 mm Hg . This small pressure difference, only 9 mm Hg , shows that the resistance to blood flow through the hepatic sinusoids is normally very low, especially when one considers that about $1350 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ of blood flow by this route.

Cirrhosis of the Liver Greatly Increases Resistance to Blood Flow. When liver parenchymal cells are destroyed, they are replaced with fibrous tissue that eventually contracts around the blood vessels, thereby greatly impeding the flow of portal blood through the liver. This disease process is known as cirrhosis of the liver. It results most commonly from chronic alcoholism or from excess fat accumulation in the liver and subsequent liver inflammation, a condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. A less severe form of fat accumulation and inflammation of the liver, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is the most common cause of liver disease in many industrialized countries, including the United States, and is usually associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.

![gu2958052264](gu2958052264.jpg)

Figure 71-1. Basic structure of a liver lobule, showing the liver cellular plates, the blood vessels, the bile-collecting system, and the lymph flow system composed of the spaces of Disse and the interlobular lymphatics. (Modified from Guyton AC, Taylor AE, Granger HJ: Circulatory Physiology. Vol 2: Dynamics and Control of the Body Fluids. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1975.)

Cirrhosis can also follow ingestion of poisons such as carbon tetrachloride, viral diseases such as infectious hepatitis, obstruction of the bile ducts, and infectious processes in the bile ducts.

The portal system is also occasionally blocked by a large clot that develops in the portal vein or its major branches. When the portal system is suddenly blocked, the return of blood from the intestines and spleen through the liver portal blood flow system to the systemic circulation is impeded. This impedance results in portal hypertension, with the capillary pressure in the intestinal wall increasing to 15 to 20 mm Hg above normal. If the obstruction is not relieved, the patient may die within a few hours because of excessive loss of fluid from the capillaries into the lumens and walls of the intestines.

The Liver Functions as a Blood Reservoir. Because the liver is an expandable organ, large quantities of blood can be stored in its blood vessels. Its normal blood volume, including that in the hepatic veins and hepatic sinuses, is about 450 ml , or almost $10 \%$ of the body's total blood volume. When high pressure in the right atrium causes backpressure in the liver, the liver expands, and 0.5 to 1 liter of extra blood is occasionally stored in the hepatic veins and sinuses. This storage of extra blood occurs especially in cases of cardiac failure with peripheral congestion, which is discussed in Chapter 22. Thus, in effect, the liver is a large, expandable, venous organ capable of acting as a valuable blood reservoir in times of excess blood volume and capable of supplying extra blood in times of diminished blood volume.

## The Liver Has Very High Lymph Flow

Because the pores in the hepatic sinusoids are very permeable compared with capillaries in other tissues, they allow ready passage of both fluid and proteins into the spaces of Disse. Therefore, the lymph draining from the liver usually has a protein concentration of about $6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$, which is only slightly less than the protein concentration of plasma. In addition, the high permeability of the liver sinusoid epithelium allows large quantities of lymph to form. Therefore, about half of all the lymph formed in the body under resting conditions arises in the liver.

High Hepatic Vascular Pressures Can Cause Fluid Transudation Into the Abdominal Cavity From the Liver and Portal Capillaries—Ascites. When the pressure in the hepatic veins rises only 3 to 7 mm Hg above normal, excessive amounts of fluid begin to transude into the lymph and leak through the outer surface of the liver capsule directly into the abdominal cavity. This fluid is almost pure plasma, containing $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ as much protein as normal plasma. At vena caval pressures of 10 to 15 mm Hg , hepatic lymph flow increases to as much as 20 times normal, and the "sweating" from the surface of the liver can be so great that it causes large amounts of free fluid in the abdominal cavity, which is called ascites. Blockage of portal flow through the liver also causes high capillary pressures in the entire portal vascular system of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in edema of the gut wall and transudation of fluid through the serosa of the gut into the abdominal cavity. This can also cause ascites.

## Regulation of Liver Mass—Regeneration

The liver possesses a remarkable ability to restore itself after significant hepatic tissue loss from either partial hepatectomy or acute liver injury, as long as the injury is uncomplicated by viral infection or inflammation. Partial hepatectomy, in which up to $70 \%$ of the liver is removed, causes the remaining lobes to enlarge and restore the liver to its original size. This regeneration is remarkably rapid and requires only 5 to 7 days in rats. During liver regeneration, hepatocytes are estimated to replicate once or twice, and after the original size and volume of the liver are achieved, the hepatocytes revert to their usual quiescent state.

Control of this rapid regeneration of the liver is not well understood, but hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) appears to be important in causing liver cell division and growth. HGF is produced by mesenchymal cells in the liver and in other tissues, but not by hepatocytes. Blood levels of HGF rise more than 20 -fold after partial hepatectomy, but mitogenic responses are usually found only in the liver after these operations, suggesting that HGF may be activated only in the affected organ. Other growth factors (especially epidermal growth factor) and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 may also be involved in stimulating regeneration of liver cells.

After the liver has returned to its original size, the process of hepatic cell division is terminated. Again, the factors involved are not well understood, although transforming growth factor- $\beta$, a cytokine secreted by hepatic cells, is a potent inhibitor of liver cell proliferation and has been suggested as the main terminator of liver regeneration.

Physiological experiments indicate that liver growth is closely regulated by some unknown signal related to body size, so an optimal liver to body weight ratio is maintained for optimal metabolic function. In liver diseases associated with fibrosis, inflammation, or viral infections, however, the regenerative process of the liver is severely impaired and liver function deteriorates.

## The Hepatic Macrophage System Serves a BloodCleansing Function

Blood flowing through the intestinal capillaries picks up many bacteria from the intestines. Indeed, a sample of blood taken from the portal veins before it enters the liver almost always grows colon bacilli when cultured, whereas growth of colon bacilli from blood in the systemic circulation is extremely rare.

Special high-speed motion pictures of the action of Kupffer cells, the large phagocytic macrophages that line the hepatic venous sinuses, have demonstrated that these cells efficiently cleanse blood as it passes through the sinuses; when a bacterium comes into momentary contact with a Kupffer cell, in less than 0.01 second the bacterium passes inward through the wall of the Kupffer cell to become permanently lodged therein until it is digested. Probably less than $1 \%$ of the bacteria entering the portal blood from the intestines succeeds in passing through the liver into the systemic circulation.

## Metabolic Functions of the Liver

The liver is a large, chemically reactant pool of cells that have a high rate of metabolism. These cells share substrates and energy from one metabolic system to another, process and synthesize multiple substances that are transported to other areas of the body, and perform myriad other metabolic functions. For these reasons, a major share of the entire discipline of biochemistry is devoted to the metabolic reactions in the liver. In this chapter, we summarize the major metabolic functions that are especially important in understanding the integrated physiology of the body.

## Carbohydrate Metabolism

In carbohydrate metabolism, the liver performs the following functions, as summarized from Chapter 68:

1. Storage of large amounts of glycogen
2. Conversion of galactose and fructose to glucose
3. Gluconeogenesis
4. Formation of many chemical compounds from intermediate products of carbohydrate metabolism
The liver is especially important for maintaining a normal blood glucose concentration. Storage of glycogen allows the liver to remove excess glucose from the blood, store it, and then return it to the blood when the blood glucose concentration begins to fall too low, which is called the glucose buffer function of the liver. In a person with poor liver function, blood glucose concentration after a meal rich in carbohydrates may rise two to three times as much as in a person with normal liver function.

Gluconeogenesis in the liver is also important in maintaining a normal blood glucose concentration because gluconeogenesis occurs to a significant extent only when the glucose concentration falls below normal. Large amounts of amino acids and glycerol from triglycerides are then
converted into glucose, thereby helping to maintain a relatively normal blood glucose concentration.

## Fat Metabolism

Although most cells of the body metabolize fat, certain aspects of fat metabolism occur mainly in the liver. In fat metabolism, the liver performs the following specific functions, as summarized from Chapter 69:

1. Oxidation of fatty acids to supply energy for other body functions
2. Synthesis of large quantities of cholesterol, phospholipids, and most lipoproteins
3. Synthesis of fat from proteins and carbohydrates

To derive energy from neutral fats, the fat is first split into glycerol and fatty acids. The fatty acids are then split by betaoxidation into two-carbon acetyl radicals that form acetyl coenzyme $A$ (acetyl-CoA). Acetyl-CoA can enter the citric acid cycle and be oxidized to liberate large amounts of energy. Beta-oxidation can take place in all cells of the body, but it occurs especially rapidly in the hepatic cells. The liver cannot use all the acetyl-CoA that is formed; instead, it is converted by the condensation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA into acetoacetic acid, a highly soluble acid that passes from the hepatic cells into the extracellular fluid and is then transported throughout the body to be absorbed by other tissues. These tissues reconvert the acetoacetic acid into acetyl-CoA and then oxidize it in the usual manner. Thus, the liver is responsible for a major part of the metabolism of fats.

About $80 \%$ of the cholesterol synthesized in the liver is converted into bile salts, which are secreted into the bile; the remainder is transported in the lipoproteins and carried by the blood to the tissue cells of the body. Phospholipids are likewise synthesized in the liver and transported principally in the lipoproteins. Both cholesterol and phospholipids are used by the cells to form membranes, intracellular structures, and multiple chemical substances that are important to cellular function.

Almost all the fat synthesis in the body from carbohydrates and proteins also occurs in the liver. After fat is synthesized in the liver, it is transported in the lipoproteins to the adipose tissue to be stored.

## Protein Metabolism

The body cannot dispense with the liver's contribution to protein metabolism for more than a few days without death ensuing. The most important functions of the liver in protein metabolism, as summarized from Chapter 70, are the following:

1. Deamination of amino acids
2. Formation of urea for removal of ammonia from the body fluids
3. Formation of plasma proteins
4. Interconversions of the various amino acids and synthesis of other compounds from amino acids
Deamination of amino acids is required before they can be used for energy or converted into carbohydrates or fats. A small amount of deamination can occur in the other tissues of the body, especially in the kidneys, but it is much less important than the deamination of amino acids by the liver.

Formation of urea by the liver removes ammonia from the body fluids. Large amounts of ammonia are formed by the deamination process, and additional amounts are continually formed in the gut by bacteria and then absorbed

into the blood. Therefore, if the liver does not form urea, the plasma ammonia concentration rises rapidly and results in hepatic coma and death. Indeed, even greatly decreased blood flow through the liver-as occurs occasionally when a shunt develops between the portal vein and the vena cava-can cause excessive ammonia in the blood, an extremely toxic condition.

Essentially all the plasma proteins, with the exception of part of the gamma globulins, are formed by the hepatic cells, accounting for about $90 \%$ of all the plasma proteins. The remaining gamma globulins are the antibodies formed mainly by plasma cells in the lymph tissue of the body. The liver can form plasma proteins at a maximum rate of 15 to $50 \mathrm{~g} /$ day. Therefore, even if as much as half the plasma proteins are lost from the body, they can be replenished in 1 or 2 weeks.

Plasma protein depletion causes rapid mitosis of the hepatic cells and growth of the liver to a larger size; these effects are coupled with rapid output of plasma proteins until the plasma concentration returns to normal. With chronic liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis), plasma proteins, such as albumin, may fall to very low levels, causing generalized edema and ascites, as explained in Chapter 30.

Among the most important functions of the liver is its ability to synthesize certain amino acids and other important chemical compounds from amino acids. For example, the so-called nonessential amino acids can all be synthesized in the liver. To perform this function, a keto acid having the same chemical composition (except at the keto oxygen) as that of the amino acid to be formed is synthesized. An amino radical is then transferred through several stages of transamination from an available amino acid to the keto acid to take the place of the keto oxygen.

## Other Metabolic Functions of the Liver

The Liver Is a Storage Site for Vitamins. The liver has a particular propensity for storing vitamins and has long been known as an excellent source of certain vitamins in the treatment of patients. The vitamin stored in greatest quantity in the liver is vitamin A , but large quantities of vitamin D and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ are normally stored there as well. Sufficient quantities of vitamin A can be stored to prevent vitamin A deficiency for as long as 10 months. Sufficient quantities of vitamin D can be stored to prevent deficiency for 3 to 4 months, and enough vitamin $B_{12}$ can be stored to last for at least 1 year and perhaps for several years.

The Liver Stores Iron as Ferritin. Except for the iron in the hemoglobin of the blood, by far the greatest proportion of iron in the body is stored in the liver in the form of ferritin. The hepatic cells contain large amounts of a protein called apoferritin, which is capable of combining reversibly with iron. Therefore, when iron is available in the body fluids in extra quantities, it combines with apoferritin to form ferritin and is stored in this form in the hepatic cells until needed elsewhere. When the iron in the circulating body fluids reaches a low level, the ferritin releases the iron. Thus, the apoferritin-ferritin system of the liver acts as a blood iron buffer, as well as an iron storage medium. Other functions of the liver in relation to iron metabolism and red blood cell formation are considered in Chapter 33.

The Liver Forms Substances Used in Blood Coagulation. Substances formed in the liver that are used in the
coagulation process include fibrinogen, prothrombin, accelerator globulin, factor VII, and several other important factors. Vitamin K is required by the metabolic processes of the liver for the formation of several of these substances, especially prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X. In the absence of vitamin K, the concentrations of all these substances decrease markedly and almost prevent blood coagulation.

The Liver Removes or Excretes Drugs, Hormones, and Other Substances. The liver is well known for its ability to detoxify or excrete many drugs into the bile, including sulfonamides, penicillin, ampicillin, and erythromycin.

Several of the hormones secreted by the endocrine glands are also either chemically altered or excreted by the liver, including thyroxine and essentially all the steroid hormones, such as estrogen, cortisol, and aldosterone. Liver damage can lead to excess accumulation of one or more of these hormones in the body fluids and therefore cause overactivity of the hormonal systems.

Finally, one of the major routes for excreting calcium from the body is secretion by the liver into the bile, which then passes into the gut and is lost in the feces.

## Measurement of Bilirubin in the Bile as a Clinical Diagnostic Tool

Formation of bile by the liver and the function of bile salts in the digestive and absorptive processes of the intestinal tract are discussed in Chapters 65 and 66. In addition, many substances are excreted in the bile and then eliminated in the feces. One of these substances is the greenish-yellow pigment bilirubin, which is a major end product of hemoglobin degradation, as pointed out in Chapter 33. However, bilirubin also provides an exceedingly valuable tool for diagnosing both hemolytic blood diseases and various types of liver diseases. Therefore, while referring to Figure 71-2, let us explain this.

Briefly, when the red blood cells have lived out their life span (on average, 120 days) and have become too fragile to exist in the circulatory system, their cell membranes rupture, and the released hemoglobin is phagocytized by tissue macrophages (also called the reticuloendothelial system) throughout the body. The hemoglobin is first split into globin and heme, and the heme ring is opened to give (1) free iron, which is transported in the blood by transferrin, and (2) a straight chain of four pyrrole nuclei, which is the substrate from which bilirubin will eventually be formed. The first substance formed is biliverdin, but this substance is rapidly reduced to free bilirubin, also called unconjugated bilirubin, which is gradually released from the macrophages into the plasma. This form of bilirubin immediately combines strongly with plasma albumin and is transported in this combination throughout the blood and interstitial fluids.

Within hours, the unconjugated bilirubin is absorbed through the hepatic cell membrane. In passing to the inside of the liver cells, it is released from the plasma albumin and soon thereafter conjugated about $80 \%$ with glucuronic acid to form bilirubin glucuronide, about $10 \%$ with sulfate to form bilirubin sulfate, and about $10 \%$ with a multitude of other substances. In these forms, the bilirubin is excreted from the hepatocytes by an active transport process into the bile canaliculi and then into the intestines.

Figure 71-2. Bilirubin formation and excretion.

Formation and Fate of Urobilinogen. Once in the intestine, about half of the "conjugated" bilirubin is converted by bacterial action into urobilinogen, which is highly soluble. Some of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed through the intestinal mucosa back into the blood, and most is re-excreted by the liver back into the gut, but about $5 \%$ is excreted by the kidneys into the urine. After exposure to air in the urine, urobilinogen becomes oxidized to urobilin; alternatively, in the feces, it becomes altered and oxidized to form stercobilin. These interrelations of bilirubin and the other bilirubin products are shown in Figure 71-2.

## Jaundice-Excess Bilirubin in the Extracellular Fluid

Jaundice refers to a yellowish tint to the body tissues, including a yellowness of the skin and deep tissues. The usual cause of jaundice is large quantities of bilirubin in the extracellular fluids-either unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin. The normal plasma concentration of bilirubin, which is almost entirely the unconjugated form, averages $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ of plasma. In certain abnormal conditions, this amount can rise to as high as $40 \mathrm{mg} /$ dl , and much of it can become the conjugated type. The skin usually begins to appear jaundiced when the concentration rises to about three times normal-that is, above $1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$.

The common causes of jaundice are (1) increased destruction of red blood cells, with rapid release of bilirubin into the blood, and (2) obstruction of the bile ducts or
damage to the liver cells so that even the usual amounts of bilirubin cannot be excreted into the gastrointestinal tract. These two types of jaundice are called, respectively, hemolytic jaundice and obstructive jaundice.

## Hemolytic Jaundice Is Caused by Hemolysis of Red

Blood Cells. In hemolytic jaundice, the excretory function of the liver is not impaired, but red blood cells are hemolyzed so rapidly that the hepatic cells simply cannot excrete the bilirubin as quickly as it is formed. Therefore, plasma concentration of free bilirubin rises to above-normal levels. Likewise, the rate of formation of urobilinogen in the intestine is greatly increased, and much of this urobilinogen is absorbed into the blood and later excreted in the urine.

Obstructive Jaundice Is Caused by Obstruction of Bile Ducts or Liver Disease. In obstructive jaundice that is caused either by obstruction of the bile ducts (which most often occurs when a gallstone or cancer blocks the common bile duct) or by damage to the hepatic cells (which occurs in hepatitis), the rate of bilirubin formation is normal, but the bilirubin formed cannot pass from the blood into the intestines. The unconjugated bilirubin still enters the liver cells and becomes conjugated in the usual way. This conjugated bilirubin is then returned to the blood, probably by rupture of the congested bile canaliculi and direct emptying of the bile into the lymph leaving the liver. Thus, most

of the bilirubin in the plasma becomes the conjugated type rather than the unconjugated type in obstructive jaundice.

Diagnostic Differences Between Hemolytic and Obstructive Jaundice. Chemical laboratory tests can be used to differentiate between unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin in the plasma. In hemolytic jaundice, almost all the bilirubin is in the "unconjugated" form; in obstructive jaundice, it is mainly in the "conjugated" form. A test called the van den Bergh reaction can be used to differentiate between the two.

When total obstruction of bile flow occurs, no bilirubin can reach the intestines to be converted into urobilinogen by bacteria. Therefore, no urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the blood, and none can be excreted by the kidneys into the urine. Consequently, in total obstructive jaundice, tests for urobilinogen in the urine are completely negative. Also, stools become clay-colored owing to a lack of stercobilin and other bile pigments.

Another major difference between unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin is that the kidneys can excrete small quantities of the highly soluble conjugated bilirubin but not the albumin-bound unconjugated bilirubin. Therefore, in severe obstructive jaundice, significant quantities of conjugated bilirubin appear in the urine. This phenomenon can be demonstrated simply by shaking the urine and observing the foam, which turns an intense yellow. Thus, by understanding the physiology of bilirubin excretion by the liver and by the use of a few simple tests, it is often possible to differentiate among multiple types of hemolytic diseases and liver diseases, as well as to determine the severity of the disease.

# Dietary Balances; Regulation of Feeding; Obesity and Starvation; Vitamins and Minerals 

## ENERGY INTAKE AND OUTPUT BALANCED UNDER STEADY-STATE CONDITIONS

Proteins, carbohydrates, and fats in the diet provide energy for various body functions or for storage and later use. Stability of body weight and composition over long periods requires that a person's energy intake and energy expenditure be balanced. When a person is overfed, and energy intake persistently exceeds expenditure, most of the excess energy is stored as fat, and body weight increases; conversely, loss of body mass and starvation occur when energy intake is insufficient to meet the body's metabolic needs.

Because different foods contain different proportions of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, and vitamins, appropriate balances must also be maintained among these constituents so that all of the body's metabolic systems can be supplied with the requisite materials. This chapter discusses the mechanisms by which food intake is regulated in accordance with the body's metabolic needs and some of the problems of maintaining balance among the different types of foods.

## Dietary Balances

## Energy Available in Foods

The energy liberated from each gram of carbohydrate as it is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water is 4.1 Calories ( 1 Calorie equals 1 kilocalorie), and that liberated from fat is 9.3 Calories. The energy liberated from metabolism of the average dietary protein as each gram is oxidized to carbon dioxide, water, and urea is 4.35 Calories. Also, these substances vary in the average percentages that are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract: about $98 \%$ of carbohydrate, $95 \%$ of fat, and $92 \%$ of protein. Therefore, the average physiologically available energy in each gram of these three foodstuffs is as follows:

|  | Calories |
| :-- | :-- |
| Carbohydrate | 4 |
| Fat | 9 |
| Protein | 4 |

Although considerable variation exists among different individuals, and even in the same person from day to day, the usual diet of Americans provides about $15 \%$ of the total energy intake from protein, $40 \%$ from fat, and $45 \%$ from carbohydrate. In most non-Western countries, the quantity of energy derived from carbohydrates far exceeds that derived from proteins and fats. Indeed, in some parts of the world where meat is scarce, the energy received from fats and proteins combined may be no greater than $15 \%$ to $20 \%$.

Table 72-1 lists the compositions of selected foods, especially demonstrating the high proportions of fat and protein in meat products and the high proportion of carbohydrate in most vegetable and grain products. Fat is deceptive in the diet because it usually exists as nearly $100 \%$ fat, whereas proteins and carbohydrates are mixed in watery media, so that each of these normally represents less than $25 \%$ of the total weight. Therefore, the fat of one pat of butter mixed with an entire helping of potato sometimes contains as much energy as the potato itself.

The Average Daily Requirement for Protein Is 30 to 50 Grams. Twenty to 30 grams of the body proteins are degraded daily and used to produce other body chemicals. Therefore, all cells must continue to form new proteins to take the place of those that are being destroyed, and a supply of protein is necessary in the diet for this purpose. An average person can maintain normal stores of protein if the daily intake is greater than 30 to 50 grams.

Some proteins have inadequate quantities of certain essential amino acids and therefore cannot be used to replace the degraded proteins. Such proteins are called partial proteins, and when they are present in large quantities in the diet, the daily protein requirement is much greater than normal. In general, proteins derived from animal foodstuffs are more complete than are proteins derived from vegetable and grain sources. For example, the protein of corn has inadequate amounts of tryptophan and lysine, two of the essential amino acids. Therefore, individuals who consume cornmeal as their principal source of protein sometimes develop the protein-deficiency syndrome called kwashiorkor, which consists of failure to grow, lethargy, depressed mentality, and edema caused by low plasma protein concentration. On the other hand, food legumes, such as chick peas and beans, provide a relatively rich source of tryptophan and lysine but contain inadequate amounts of methionine, another essential amino acid. Therefore the

Carbohydrates and Fats Act as "Protein Sparers." When a person's diet contains an abundance of carbohydrates and fats, almost all the body's energy is derived from these two substances, and little is derived from proteins. Therefore, carbohydrates and fats are said to be protein sparers. Conversely, in the state of starvation, after the carbohydrates and fats have been depleted, the body's protein stores are consumed rapidly for energy, sometimes at rates approaching several hundred grams per day rather than the normal daily rate of 30 to 50 grams.

## Methods for Determining Metabolic Utilization of Carbohydrates, Fats, and Proteins

"Respiratory Quotient," the Ratio of Carbon Dioxide Production to Oxygen Utilization, Can Be Used to Estimate Fat and Carbohydrate Utilization. When carbohy-
drates are metabolized with oxygen, exactly one carbon dioxide molecule is formed for each molecule of oxygen consumed. This ratio of carbon dioxide output to oxygen usage is called the respiratory quotient, so the respiratory quotient for carbohydrates is 1.0 .

When fat is oxidized in the body's cells, an average of 70 carbon dioxide molecules are formed for each 100 molecules of oxygen consumed. The respiratory quotient for the metabolism of fat therefore averages 0.70 . When proteins are oxidized by the cells, the average respiratory quotient is 0.80 . The reason that the respiratory quotients for fats and proteins are lower than those for carbohydrates is that a portion of the oxygen metabolized with these foods is required to combine with the excess hydrogen atoms present in their molecules, so less carbon dioxide is formed in relation to the oxygen used.

Now let us see how one can use the respiratory quotient to determine the relative utilization of different foods by

the body. First, recall from Chapter 40 that the output of carbon dioxide by the lungs divided by the uptake of oxygen during the same period is called the respiratory exchange ratio. During a period of 1 hour or more, the respiratory exchange ratio exactly equals the average respiratory quotient of the metabolic reactions throughout the body. If a person has a respiratory quotient of 1.0 , he or she is metabolizing carbohydrates almost exclusively, because the respiratory quotients for both fat and protein metabolism are considerably less than 1.0. Likewise, when the respiratory quotient is about 0.70 , the body is metabolizing mostly fats, to the exclusion of carbohydrates and proteins. And, finally, if we ignore the normally small amount of protein metabolism, respiratory quotients between 0.70 and 1.0 describe the approximate ratios of carbohydrate to fat metabolism. To be more exact, one can first determine the protein utilization by measuring nitrogen excretion, as discussed in the next section. Then, using the appropriate mathematical formula, one can calculate the utilization of the three foodstuffs.

Some of the important findings from studies of respiratory quotients are the following:

1. Immediately after a mixed meal containing carbohydrates as well as protein and fat, almost all the food that is metabolized is carbohydrates, so the respiratory quotient at that time approaches 1.0 .
2. About 8 to 10 hours after a meal, the body has already used up most of its readily available carbohydrates, and the respiratory quotient approaches that for fat metabolism, about 0.70 .
3. In untreated diabetes mellitus, little carbohydrate can be used by the body's cells under any conditions because insulin is required for this utilization. Therefore, when diabetes is severe, most of the time the respiratory quotient remains near that for fat metabolism, which is 0.70 .

Nitrogen Excretion Can Be Used to Assess Protein Metabolism. The average protein contains about $16 \%$ nitrogen. During metabolism of protein, about $90 \%$ of this nitrogen is excreted in the urine in the form of urea, uric acid, creatinine, and other nitrogen products. The remaining $10 \%$ is excreted in the feces. Therefore, the rate of protein breakdown in the body can be estimated by measuring the amount of nitrogen in the urine, then adding $10 \%$ for the nitrogen excreted in the feces, and multiplying by 6.25 (i.e., 100/16) to estimate the total amount of protein metabolism in grams per day. Thus, excretion of 8 grams of nitrogen in the urine each day means that about 55 grams of protein breakdown has occurred. If the daily intake of protein is less than the daily breakdown of protein, the person is said to have a negative nitrogen balance, which means that his or her body stores of protein are decreasing daily.

## REGULATION OF FOOD INTAKE AND ENERGY STORAGE

Stability of the body's total mass and composition over long periods requires that energy intake match energy expenditure. As discussed in Chapter 73, only about 27\% of the energy ingested normally reaches the functional systems of the cells, and much of this energy is eventually converted to heat, which is generated as a result of protein metabolism, muscle activity, and activities of the various
organs and tissues of the body. Excess energy intake is stored mainly as fat, whereas a deficit of energy intake causes loss of total body mass until energy expenditure eventually equals energy intake or death occurs.

Although there is considerable variability in the amount of energy storage (i.e., fat mass) in different individuals, maintenance of an adequate energy supply is necessary for survival. Therefore, the body is endowed with powerful physiological control systems that help maintain adequate energy intake. Deficits of energy stores, for example, rapidly activate multiple mechanisms that cause hunger and drive a person to seek food. In athletes and laborers, energy expenditure for the high level of muscle activity may be as high as 10,000 Calories per day, compared with only about 2000 Calories per day for sedentary individuals. Thus, a large energy expenditure associated with physical work usually stimulates equally large increases in caloric intake.

What are the physiological mechanisms that sense changes in energy balance and influence the quest for food? Maintenance of adequate energy supply in the body is so critical that multiple short-term and long-term control systems exist that regulate not only food intake but also energy expenditure and energy stores. In the next few sections we describe some of these control systems and their operation in physiological conditions, as well as in the states of obesity and starvation.

## NEURAL CENTERS REGULATE FOOD INTAKE

The sensation of hunger is associated with a craving for food and several other physiological effects, such as rhythmic contractions of the stomach and restlessness, which cause the person to seek food. A person's appetite is a desire for food, often of a particular type, and is useful in helping to choose the quality of the food to be eaten. If the quest for food is successful, the feeling of satiety occurs. Each of these feelings is influenced by environmental and cultural factors, as well as by physiological controls that influence specific centers of the brain, especially the hypothalamus.

The Hypothalamus Contains Hunger and Satiety Centers. Several neuronal centers of the hypothalamus participate in the control of food intake. The lateral nuclei of the hypothalamus serve as a feeding center, and stimulation of this area causes an animal to eat voraciously (hyperphagia). Conversely, destruction of the lateral hypothalamus causes lack of desire for food and progressive inanition, a condition characterized by marked weight loss, muscle weakness, and decreased metabolism. The lateral hypothalamic feeding center operates by exciting the motor drives to search for food.

The ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus serve as a major satiety center. This center is believed to give a sense of nutritional satisfaction that inhibits the feeding center. Electrical stimulation of this region can cause complete satiety, and even in the presence of highly appetizing food, the animal refuses to eat (aphagia). Conversely,

destruction of the ventromedial nuclei causes voracious and continued eating until the animal becomes extremely obese, sometimes weighing as much as four times normal.

The paraventricular, dorsomedial, and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus also play a major role in regulating food intake. For example, lesions of the paraventricular nuclei often cause excessive eating, whereas lesions of the dorsomedial nuclei usually depress eating behavior. As discussed later, the arcuate nuclei are the sites in the hypothalamus where multiple hormones released from the gastrointestinal tract and adipose tissue converge to regulate food intake, as well as energy expenditure.

Much chemical cross talk occurs among the neurons in the hypothalamus, and together, these centers coordinate the processes that control eating behavior and the perception of satiety. These hypothalamic nuclei also influence secretion of several hormones that are important in regulating energy balance and metabolism, including those from the thyroid and adrenal glands, as well as the pancreatic islet cells.

The hypothalamus receives (1) neural signals from the gastrointestinal tract that provide sensory information about stomach filling; (2) chemical signals from nutrients in the blood (glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids) that signify satiety; (3) signals from gastrointestinal hormones; (4) signals from hormones released by adipose tissue; and (5) signals from the cerebral cortex (sight, smell, and taste) that influence feeding behavior. Some of these inputs to the hypothalamus are shown in Figure 72-1.

The hypothalamic feeding and satiety centers have a high density of receptors for neurotransmitters and hormones that influence feeding behavior. A few of the many substances that have been shown to alter appetite and feeding behavior in experimental studies are listed in Table 72-2 and are generally categorized as (1) orexigenic substances that stimulate feeding or (2) anorexigenic substances that inhibit feeding.

## Neurons and Neurotransmitters in the Hypothalamus

That Stimulate or Inhibit Feeding. Two distinct types of neurons in the arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus are especially important as controllers of both appetite and energy expenditure (Figure 72-2): (1) pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons that produce $\alpha$ -melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( $\alpha-\mathrm{MSH}$ ) together with cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript (CART); and (2) neurons that produce the orexigenic substances neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AGRP). Activation of the POMC neurons decreases food intake and increases energy expenditure, whereas activation of the NPY-AGRP neurons has the opposite effects, increasing food intake and reducing energy expenditure. Considerable cross talk occurs among these neurons and, as discussed later, POMC/CART and AGRP/NPY neurons appear to be the major targets for several hormones that regulate appetite, including leptin, insulin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and ghrelin. In fact, the neurons of the arcuate nuclei appear to be a site of convergence of many of the nervous and peripheral signals that regulate energy stores.

The POMC neurons release $\alpha-\mathrm{MSH}$, which then acts on melanocortin receptors found especially in neurons of the paraventricular nuclei. Although at least five subtypes of melanocortin receptors (MCR) exist, MCR-3 and $M C R-4$ are especially important in regulating food intake and energy balance. Activation of these receptors reduces food intake while increasing energy expenditure. Conversely, inhibition of MCR-3 and MCR-4 greatly increases food intake and decreases energy expenditure. The effect of MCR-4 activation to increase energy expenditure appears to be mediated, at least in part, by activation of neuronal pathways that project from the paraventricular nuclei to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and stimulate sympathetic nervous system activity. However, POMC neurons and MCR-4 are also found in brainstem neurons, including the NTS, where they also regulate food intake and energy expenditure.

Figure 72-1. Feedback mechanisms for control of food intake. Stretch receptors in the stomach activate sensory afferent pathways in the vagus nerve and inhibit food intake. Peptide YY (PYY), cholecystokinin (CCK), and insulin are gastrointestinal hormones that are released by the ingestion of food and suppress further feeding. Ghrelin is released by the stomach, especially during fasting, and stimulates appetite. Leptin is a hormone produced in increasing amounts by fat cells as they increase in size. It inhibits food intake.

The hypothalamic-brainstem melanocortin system plays a powerful role in regulating energy stores of the body, and defective signaling of this pathway is associated with extreme obesity. In fact, mutations of POMC and $M C R-4$ represent the most common known monogenic (single-gene) causes of human obesity, and some studies suggest that $P O M C$ and $M C R-4$ mutations may account for as much as $5 \%$ to $6 \%$ of early-onset severe obesity in children. In contrast, excessive activation of the melanocortin system reduces appetite. Some studies suggest that this activation may play a role in causing the loss of appetite for food (anorexia) associated with severe infections, cancer tumors, or uremia.

AGRP released from the orexigenic neurons of the hypothalamus is a natural antagonist of MCR-3 and MCR-4 and probably increases feeding by inhibiting the effects of $\alpha-\mathrm{MSH}$ to stimulate melanocortin receptors (see Figure 72-2). Although the role of AGRP in normal physiological control of food intake is unclear, excessive formation of AGRP in mice and humans due to gene mutations is associated with increased food intake and obesity.

NPY is also released from orexigenic neurons of the arcuate nuclei. When energy stores of the body are low,

Figure 72-2. Control of energy balance by two types of neurons of the arcuate nuclei: (1) pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons that release $\alpha$-melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( $\alpha-\mathrm{MSH}$ ) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), decreasing food intake and increasing energy expenditure; and (2) neurons that produce agouti-related protein (AGRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), increasing food intake and reducing energy expenditure. $\alpha$-MSH released by POMC neurons stimulates melanocortin receptors (MCR-3 and MCR-4) in the paraventricular nuclei (PVN), which then activate neuronal pathways that project to the nucleus tractus solitarius and increase sympathetic activity and energy expenditure. AGRP acts as an antagonist of MCR-4. Insulin, leptin, and cholecystokinin (CCK) are hormones that inhibit AGRP-NPY neurons and stimulate adjacent POMC-CART neurons, thereby reducing food intake. Ghrelin, a hormone secreted from the stomach, activates AGRP-NPY neurons and stimulates food intake. LepR, Leptin receptor; $Y_{1} r$, neuropeptide $Y_{1}$ receptor. (Modified from Barsh GS, Schwartz MW: Genetic approaches to studying energy balance: perception and integration. Nat Rev Genet 3:589, 2002.)

orexigenic neurons are activated to release NPY, which stimulates appetite. At the same time, firing of the POMC neurons is reduced, thereby decreasing the activity of the melanocortin pathway and further stimulating appetite.

Neural Centers That Influence the Mechanical Process of Feeding. Another aspect of feeding is the mechanical act of the feeding process. If the brain is sectioned below the hypothalamus but above the mesencephalon, the animal can still perform the basic mechanical features of the feeding process. It can salivate, lick its lips, chew food, and swallow. Therefore, the actual mechanics of feeding are controlled by centers in the brainstem. The function of the other centers in feeding, then, is to control the quantity of food intake and to excite these centers of feeding mechanics to activity.

Neural centers higher than the hypothalamus also play important roles in the control of feeding, particularly in the control of appetite. These centers include the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, which are closely coupled with the hypothalamus. Recall from the discussion of the sense of smell in Chapter 54 that portions of the amygdala are a major part of the olfactory nervous system. Destructive lesions in the amygdala have demonstrated that some of its areas increase feeding, whereas others inhibit feeding. In addition, stimulation of some areas of the amygdala elicits the mechanical act of feeding. An important effect of destruction of the amygdala on both sides of the brain is a "psychic blindness" in the choice of foods. In other words, the animal (and presumably the human being as well) at least partially loses the appetite control that determines the type and quality of food it eats.

## FACTORS THAT REGULATE QUANTITY OF FOOD INTAKE

Regulation of the quantity of food intake can be divided into short-term regulation, which is concerned primarily with preventing overeating at each meal, and long-term regulation, which is concerned primarily with maintenance of normal quantities of energy stores in the body.

## Short-Term Regulation of Food Intake

When a person is driven by hunger to eat voraciously and rapidly, what turns off the desire to eat when he or she has eaten enough? There has not been enough time for changes in the body's energy stores to occur, and it takes hours for enough nutritional factors to be absorbed into the blood to cause the necessary inhibition of eating. Yet, it is important that the person not overeat and that he or she eat an amount of food that approximates nutritional needs. Several types of rapid feedback signals are important for these purposes, as described in the following sections.

Gastrointestinal Filling Inhibits Feeding. When the gastrointestinal tract becomes distended, especially the stomach and the duodenum, stretch inhibitory signals
are transmitted mainly by way of the vagi to suppress the feeding centers, thereby reducing the desire for food and providing a negative feedback mechanism to help limit meal size (see Figure 72-1).

Gastrointestinal Hormonal Factors Suppress Feeding. $C C K$, which is released mainly in response to fat and proteins entering the duodenum, enters the blood and acts as a hormone to influence several gastrointestinal functions such as gallbladder contraction, gastric emptying, gut motility, and gastric acid secretion as discussed in Chapters 63, 64, and 65 . However, CCK also activates receptors on local sensory nerves in the duodenum, sending messages to the brain via the vagus nerve that contribute to satiation and meal cessation. The effect of CCK is shortlived, and chronic administration of CCK by itself has no major effect on body weight. Therefore, CCK functions mainly to prevent overeating during meals but may not play a major role in the frequency of meals or the total energy consumed.

Peptide YY (PYY) is secreted from the entire gastrointestinal tract, but especially from the ileum and colon. Food intake stimulates release of PYY, with blood concentrations rising to peak levels 1 to 2 hours after ingesting a meal. These peak levels of PYY are influenced by the amount and composition of the food, with higher levels of PYY observed after meals with a high fat content. Although injections of PYY into mice have been shown to decrease food intake for 12 hours or more, the importance of this gastrointestinal hormone in regulating appetite in humans is still unclear.

For reasons that are not entirely understood, the presence of food in the intestines stimulates them to secrete glucagon-like peptide (GLP), which in turn enhances glucose-dependent insulin production and secretion from the pancreas. GLP and insulin both tend to suppress appetite. Thus, eating a meal stimulates the release of several gastrointestinal hormones that may induce satiety and limit further intake of food (see Figure 72-1).

Ghrelin, a Gastrointestinal Hormone, Increases Feeding. Ghrelin is a hormone released mainly by the oxyntic cells of the stomach but also, to much less of an extent, by the intestine. Blood levels of ghrelin rise during fasting, peak just before eating, and then fall rapidly after a meal, suggesting a possible role in stimulating feeding. Also, administration of ghrelin increases food intake in experimental animals, further supporting the possibility that it may be an orexigenic hormone.

Oral Receptors Meter Food Intake. When an animal with an esophageal fistula is fed large quantities of food, even though this food is immediately lost to the exterior, the degree of hunger is decreased after a reasonable quantity of food has passed through the mouth. This effect occurs despite the fact that the gastrointestinal tract does not become the least bit filled. Therefore, various "oral factors" related to feeding, such as chewing, salivation,

swallowing, and tasting, have been postulated to "meter" the food as it passes through the mouth, and after a certain amount has passed, the hypothalamic feeding center becomes inhibited. The inhibition caused by this metering mechanism, however, is considerably less intense and of shorter duration-usually lasting for only 20 to 40 minutes-than is the inhibition caused by gastrointestinal filling.

## Intermediate- and Long-Term Regulation of Food Intake

An animal that has been starved for a long time and is then presented with unlimited food eats a far greater quantity than does an animal that has been on a regular diet. Conversely, an animal that has been force-fed for several weeks eats very little when allowed to eat according to its own desires. Thus, the biological feeding control mechanisms of the body are geared to the nutritional status of the body although multiple behavioral, social and environmental factors also influence food intake in humans.

## Effect of Blood Concentrations of Glucose, Amino

Acids, and Lipids on Hunger and Feeding. A decrease in blood glucose concentration has been shown in experimental studies to cause hunger, which has led to the socalled glucostatic theory of hunger and feeding regulation. Similar studies have demonstrated the same effect for blood amino acid concentration and blood concentration of breakdown products of lipids such as the keto acids and some fatty acids, leading to the aminostatic and lipostatic theories of regulation. That is, when the availability of any of the three major types of food decreases, the desire for feeding is increased, eventually returning the blood metabolite concentrations back toward normal if the appropriate foods are available.

The following observations from neurophysiological studies of function in specific areas of the brain also support the glucostatic, aminostatic, and lipostatic theories: (1) a rise in blood glucose level increases the rate of firing of glucoreceptor neurons in the satiety center in the ventromedial and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, and (2) the same increase in blood glucose level simultaneously decreases the firing of glucosensitive neurons in the hunger center of the lateral hypothalamus. In addition, some amino acids and lipid substances affect the rates of firing of these same neurons or other closely associated neurons.

Temperature Regulation and Food Intake. When an animal is exposed to cold, it tends to increase feeding; when it is exposed to heat, it tends to decrease its caloric intake. This phenomenon is caused by interaction within the hypothalamus between the temperature-regulating system (see Chapter 74) and the food intake-regulating system. This is important because increased food intake in a cold animal (1) increases its metabolic rate and (2) provides increased fat for insulation, both of which tend to protect against the cold.

Feedback Signals From Adipose Tissue Regulate Food Intake. Most of the stored energy in the body consists of fat, the amount of which can vary considerably in different persons. What regulates this energy reserve, and why is there so much variability among individuals?

Studies in humans and in experimental animals indicate that the hypothalamus senses energy storage through the actions of leptin, a peptide hormone released from adipocytes. When the amount of adipose tissue increases (signaling excess energy storage), the adipocytes produce increased amounts of leptin, which is released into the blood. Leptin then circulates to the brain, where it moves across the blood-brain barrier by facilitated diffusion and occupies leptin receptors at multiple sites in the hypothalamus, especially the POMC and AGRP/NPY neurons of the arcuate nuclei and neurons of the paraventricular nuclei, as well as neurons in other areas of the brain including the brainstem.

Stimulation of leptin receptors in these central nervous system nuclei initiates multiple actions that decrease fat storage, including (1) decreased production in the hypothalamus of appetite stimulators, such as NPY and $A G R P$; (2) activation of POMC neurons, causing release of $\alpha-\mathrm{MSH}$ and activation of melanocortin receptors; (3) increased production in the hypothalamus of substances, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone, that decrease food intake; (4) increased sympathetic nerve activity (through neural projections from the hypothalamus to the vasomotor centers), which increases metabolic rate and energy expenditure; and (5) decreased insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cells, which decreases energy storage. Thus, leptin is an important means by which the adipose tissue signals the brain that enough energy has been stored and that intake of food is no longer necessary.

In mice or humans with mutations that render their fat cells unable to produce leptin or mutations that cause defective leptin receptors in the hypothalamus, marked hyperphagia and morbid obesity occur. In most obese humans, however, there does not appear to be a deficiency of leptin production because plasma leptin levels increase in proportion with increasing adiposity. Therefore, some physiologists believe that obesity may be associated with leptin resistance; that is, leptin receptors or postreceptor signaling pathways normally activated by leptin may be resistant to activation by leptin in obese people, who continue to overeat despite having very high levels of leptin.

Another explanation for the failure of leptin to prevent increasing adiposity in obese individuals is that there are many redundant systems that control feeding behavior, as well as social and cultural factors that can cause continued excess food intake even in the presence of high levels of leptin.

Summary of Long-Term Regulation. Even though our information on the different feedback factors in longterm feeding regulation is imprecise, we can make the following general statement: When the energy stores of

the body fall below normal, the feeding centers of the hypothalamus and other areas of the brain become highly active, and the person exhibits increased hunger, as well as the behavior of searching for food. Conversely, when the energy stores (mainly the fat stores) are already abundant, the person usually loses the sensation of hunger and develops a state of satiety. Although the precise feedback systems that regulate food intake and energy expenditure are not fully understood, rapid advances have been made in this field of research in recent years, with the discovery of many new orexigenic and anorexigenic factors.

## Importance of Having Both Long- and Short-Term Regulatory Systems for Feeding

The long-term regulatory system for feeding, which includes all the nutritional energy feedback mechanisms, helps maintain constant stores of nutrients in the tissues, preventing them from becoming too low or too high. The short-term regulatory stimuli serve two other purposes. First, they tend to make the person eat smaller quantities at each eating session, thus allowing food to pass through the gastrointestinal tract at a steadier pace so that its digestive and absorptive mechanisms can work at optimal rates rather than becoming periodically overburdened. Second, they help prevent the person from eating amounts at each meal that would be too much for the metabolic storage systems once all the food has been absorbed.

## Obesity

Obesity can be defined as an excess of body fat. A surrogate marker for body fat content is the body mass index (BMI), which is calculated as:

$$
\mathrm{BMI}=\frac{\text { Weight in kilograms }}{\text { Height in meters }^{2}}
$$

In clinical terms, a person with a BMI between 25 and 29.9 $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ is deemed overweight, and a person with a BMI greater than or equal to $30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ is considered obese. BMI is not a direct estimate of adiposity and does not take into account the fact that some individuals have a high BMI as a result of a large muscle mass. A better way to define obesity is to actually measure the percentage of total body fat. Obesity is usually defined as $25 \%$ or greater total body fat in men and $35 \%$ or greater total body fat in women. Although percentage of body fat can be estimated with various methods, such as measuring skin-fold thickness, bioelectrical impedance, or underwater weighing, these methods are not routinely used in clinical practice, where BMI is commonly used to assess obesity.

The adverse impact of obesity on the risk for various disorders such as cirrhosis, hypertension, heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease appears to be more closely associated with increased visceral (abdominal) adiposity than with increased subcutaneous fat storage, or storage of fat in the lower parts of the body such as the hips. Therefore, many clinicians measure waist circumference or sagittal abdominal diameter as indicators of abdominal obesity. In the United States a waist circumference greater than 102 centimeters in men and 88 centimeters in women or
a waist/hip ratio of greater than 0.9 in men and 0.85 in women is often considered to indicate abdominal obesity in adults.

The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States and in many other industrialized countries is rapidly increasing, rising by more than $30 \%$ during the past decade. Approximately $70 \%$ of adults aged 20 and over in the United States are overweight or obese, and more than $35 \%$ of those adults are obese.

## Obesity Results From Greater Intake Than Expenditure of Energy

When greater quantities of energy (in the form of food) enter the body than are expended, the body weight increases, and most of the excess energy is stored as fat. Therefore, excessive adiposity (obesity) is caused by energy intake in excess of energy output. For each 9.3 calories of excess energy that remains in the body, approximately 1 gram of fat is stored.

Fat is stored mainly in adipocytes in subcutaneous tissue and in the intraperitoneal cavity, although the liver and other tissues of the body often accumulate significant amounts of lipids in obese persons. The metabolic processes involved in fat storage were discussed in Chapter 69.

It was previously believed that the number of adipocytes could increase substantially only during infancy and childhood and that excess energy intake in children led to hyperplastic obesity, associated with increased numbers of adipocytes and only small increases in adipocyte size. In contrast, the development of obesity in adults was thought to increase only adipocyte size, resulting in hypertrophic obesity. However, research studies have shown that new adipocytes can differentiate from fibroblast-like preadipocytes at any period of life and that the development of obesity in adults is accompanied by increased numbers, as well as increased size, of adipocytes. An extremely obese person may have as many as four times as many adipocytes, each containing twice as much lipid, as a lean person.

Once a person has become obese and a stable weight is obtained, energy intake once again equals energy output. For a person to lose weight, energy intake must be less than energy expenditure.

## Decreased Physical Activity and Abnormal Feeding Regulation as Causes of Obesity

The causes of obesity are complex. Although genes play an important role in programming the powerful physiological mechanisms that regulate food intake and energy metabolism, lifestyle and environmental factors may play a major role in many obese people. The rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity in the past 20 to 30 years emphasizes the important role of lifestyle and environmental factors because genetic changes could not have occurred so rapidly. Still, genetic factors may predispose many people to the environmental influences that are driving the rising prevalence of obesity in most industrialized and developing countries.

Sedentary Lifestyle Is a Major Cause of Obesity. Regular physical activity and physical training are known to increase muscle mass and decrease body fat mass, whereas inadequate physical activity is typically associated with decreased muscle mass and increased adiposity. For example, studies have shown a close association between sedentary

behaviors, such as excessive screen time (e.g., television watching), and obesity.

About $25 \%$ to $30 \%$ of the energy used each day by the average person goes into muscular activity, and in a laborer, as much as $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ is used in this way. In obese people, increased physical activity often increases energy expenditure more than food intake, resulting in significant weight loss. Even a single episode of strenuous exercise may increase basal energy expenditure for several hours after the physical activity is stopped. Because muscular activity is by far the most important means by which energy is expended in the body, increased physical activity is often an effective means of reducing fat stores.

Abnormal Feeding Behavior Is an Important Cause of Obesity. Although powerful physiological mechanisms regulate food intake, important environmental, social, and psychological factors also can cause abnormal feeding behavior, excessive energy intake, and obesity.

As discussed previously, the importance of environmental factors is evident from the rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity in most industrialized countries, which has coincided with an abundance of high-energy foods and sedentary lifestyles.

Psychological and social factors may contribute to obesity in some people. For example, people often gain large amounts of weight during or after stressful situations, such as the death of a parent, a severe illness, or even mental depression. It seems that eating can be a means of relieving stress.

Childhood Overnutrition May Contribute to Adult Obesity. One factor that may contribute to obesity is the prevalent idea that healthy eating habits require three meals a day and that each meal must be filling. Many young children are forced into this habit by overly solicitous parents, and the children continue to practice it throughout life.

The rate of formation of new fat cells is especially rapid in the first few years of life, and the greater the rate of fat storage, the greater the number of fat cells. The number of fat cells in obese children is often as much as three times that in normal children. Therefore, it has been suggested that overnutrition of children-especially in infancy and, to a lesser extent, during the later years of childhood-can lead to a lifetime of obesity. In fact, studies have shown that approximately $80 \%$ of obese children become obese adults.

Genetic Factors as a Cause of Obesity. Obesity definitely runs in families. However, it has been difficult to determine the precise role of genetics in contributing to obesity because family members generally share many of the same eating habits and physical activity patterns. Current evidence suggests that $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of cases of obesity may be caused by genetic factors.

Genes can contribute to obesity by causing abnormalities of (1) one or more of the pathways that regulate the feeding centers and (2) energy expenditure and fat storage. Three of the monogenic (single-gene) causes of obesity are (1) mutations of POMC and MCR-4, the most common monogenic forms of obesity discovered thus far; (2) congenital leptin deficiency caused by mutations of the leptin gene, which are very rare; and (3) mutations of the leptin receptor, which are also rare. All these monogenic forms of obesity account for only a very small percentage of obesity.

Figure 72-3 Possible interactions of adverse intrauterine environment, epigenetic, and development factors in programming increased risk for obesity in multiple generations. The intrauterine environment of an obese mother may influence development of the embryo, including epigenetic effects on germ cells that become sperm or oocytes. The sperm and oocytes of male and female parents may also be altered by epigenetic changes that occur secondary to obesity, thus predisposing subsequent generations to increased risk for developing obesity.

It is likely that many gene variations interact with environmental factors to influence the amount and distribution of body fat.

Parents May Contribute to Obesity in Their Offspring Through Epigenetic Mechanisms. Parents who are overweight or obese may also increase the risk for obesity and associated disorders in their offspring through "epigenetic" mechanisms that alter gene expression in the absence of a change in the DNA sequence (Figure 72-3). Epigenetic effects of parental obesity have been proposed to occur through alterations in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and expression of microRNAs that may influence gene expression in the offspring. Based mainly on studies in experimental animals, it has been suggested that epigenetic changes in the parents' gametes (sperm from the father and oocytes from the mother) as well as an adverse intrauterine environment and epigenetic changes in the developing fetus' germ cells (embryonic cells that give rise to the gametes) may contribute to obesity in the immediate offspring as well as in subsequent generations. However, additional research is needed to further assess the impact of germ cell epigenetics in predisposing human beings to become obese.

Regardless of the precise contribution of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors, it is clear that the percentage of children affected by obesity has increased steadily in

many countries, including the United States, where obesity prevalence in children has more than tripled since the 1970s.

Neurogenic Abnormalities as a Cause of Obesity. We previously pointed out that lesions in the ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus cause an animal to eat excessively and become obese. Progressive obesity often develops in people with hypophysial tumors that encroach on the hypothalamus, demonstrating that obesity in human beings, too, can result from damage to the hypothalamus.

Although hypothalamic damage is almost never found in obese people, it is possible that the functional organization of the hypothalamic or other neurogenic feeding centers in obese individuals is different from that in persons who are not obese. Also, abnormalities of neurotransmitters or receptor mechanisms may be present in the neural pathways of the hypothalamus that control feeding. In support of this theory, an obese person who has reduced to normal weight by strict dietary measures usually develops intense hunger that is demonstrably far greater than that of a normal person. Also, diet-induced weight loss in obese people is associated with substantial "metabolic adaptation," which refers to slowing of metabolic rate and energy expenditure by greater amounts than predicted for the change in body composition caused by loss of fat and muscle mass. This phenomenon suggests that the "set points" of an obese person's feeding and metabolic control systems are at a much higher level of nutrient storage than that of a nonobese person.

Studies in experimental animals also indicate that when food intake is restricted in obese animals, marked neurotransmitter changes occur in the hypothalamus that greatly increase hunger and oppose weight loss. Some of these changes include increased formation of orexigenic neurotransmitters such as NPY and decreased formation of anorexigenic substances such as leptin and $\alpha$-MSH. Studies in humans have confirmed that diet-induced weight loss is accompanied by increased levels of hunger-stimulating hormones (e.g., ghrelin) and decreased levels of hormones (e.g., leptin) that reduce hunger. These hormonal changes persist for at least 1 year after the weight loss, perhaps explaining, in part, why it is so difficult for most people to achieve sustained weight loss by dieting alone.

## Treatment of Obesity

Treatment of obesity depends on decreasing energy input below energy expenditure and creating a sustained negative energy balance until the desired weight loss is achieved. The current National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines recommend a decrease in caloric intake of 500 Calories (kilocalories) per day for overweight and moderately obese persons (BMI $>25$ but $<35 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ) to achieve a weight loss of approximately 1 pound each week. A more aggressive energy deficit of 500 to 1000 Calories per day is recommended for persons with BMIs greater than $35 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. Typically, such an energy deficit, if it can be achieved and sustained, will cause a weight loss of about 1 to 2 pounds per week, or about a $10 \%$ weight loss after 6 months. However, it is important to prevent vitamin deficiencies during the dieting period.

For most people, increasing physical activity is also an important component of successful long-term reductions
in adiposity. Almost all current guidelines for treatment of obesity therefore recommend lifestyle modifications that include increased physical activity combined with a reduction in caloric intake.

Pharmacological Management of Obesity. Various drugs for decreasing the degree of hunger have been used in obesity treatment. The most widely used drugs are amphetamines (or amphetamine derivatives), which directly inhibit the feeding centers in the brain. One drug for treating obesity combines phentermine, a sympathomimetic that reduces food intake and increases energy expenditure, with topiramate, which has been used as an anticonvulsant drug. The danger in using sympathomimetic drugs is that they simultaneously overexcite the sympathetic nervous system and raise blood pressure. A commonly used sympathomimetic drug, sibutramine, was removed from the United States market in 2010 for obesity treatment because clinical studies demonstrated that it increased the risk for myocardial infarction and stroke. Another drug developed for treatment of obesity is lorcaserin, which activates serotonin receptors in the brain and promotes increased POMC expression. However, the FDA requested the withdrawal of lorcaserin from the market in 2020 due to safety concerns. Bupropion, a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, stimulates POMC neurons and is used in combination with naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, to treat obesity. Synthetic Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, a class of drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, also stimulates POMC neurons to cause satiety and modest weight loss.

Another class of medications, the sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT 2) inhibitors, promote mild weight loss by preventing reabsorption of glucose as well as water in the renal tubules and are also used in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Still another group of drugs works by altering lipid absorption by the gut. For example, orlistat, a lipase inhibitor, reduces the intestinal digestion of fat, causing a portion of the ingested fat to be lost in the feces and therefore reducing energy absorption. However, fecal fat loss may cause unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects, as well as loss of fat-soluble vitamins in the feces.

All of the drugs that are currently approved for long-term treatment of obesity produce modest weight loss, usually only $5 \%$ to $10 \%$, or less in some cases, and are most effective when used in combination with lifestyle modifications aimed at increased physical activity and a healthier diet.

Surgical Treatment of Obesity. For morbidly obese patients with BMIs greater than $40 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$, or for patients with BMIs greater than $35 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ and conditions such as hypertension or type 2 diabetes that predispose them to other serious diseases, various surgical procedures can be used to decrease the fat mass of the body or to decrease the amount of food that can be eaten at each meal.

Gastric bypass surgery involves construction of a small pouch in the proximal part of the stomach that is then connected to the jejunum with a section of small bowel of varying lengths; the pouch is separated from the remaining part of the stomach with staples. Gastric banding surgery involves placing an adjustable band around the stomach near its upper end; this procedure also creates a small stomach pouch that restricts the amount of food that can be eaten at each meal. A third procedure that is now becoming more

widely used is vertical sleeve gastrectomy, which removes a large part of the stomach with the remaining part stapled back together. These surgical procedures generally produce substantial weight loss in obese patients. The gastric bypass and vertical sleeve procedures often lead to rapid remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, important complications of obesity, even before substantial weight loss has occurred. These procedures are major operations, however, and their long-term effects on overall health and mortality are still uncertain.

## Inanition, Anorexia, and Cachexia

Inanition is the opposite of obesity and is characterized by extreme weight loss. It can be caused by inadequate availability of food or by pathophysiological conditions that greatly decrease the desire for food, including psychogenic disturbances, hypothalamic abnormalities, and factors released from peripheral tissues. In many cases, especially in persons with serious diseases such as cancer, the reduced desire for food may be associated with increased energy expenditure, resulting in serious weight loss.

Anorexia can be defined as a reduction in food intake caused primarily by diminished appetite, as opposed to the literal definition of "not eating." This definition emphasizes the important role of central neural mechanisms in the pathophysiology of anorexia in diseases such as cancer, when other common problems, such as pain and nausea, may also cause a person to consume less food. Anorexia nervosa is an abnormal psychic state in which a person loses all desire for food and even becomes nauseated by food; as a result, severe inanition occurs.

Cachexia is a metabolic disorder of increased energy expenditure leading to weight loss greater than that caused by reduced food intake alone. Anorexia and cachexia often occur together in many types of cancer or in the "wasting syndrome" observed in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and chronic inflammatory disorders. Almost all types of cancer cause both anorexia and cachexia, and anorexia-cachexia syndrome develops in more than half of persons with cancer during the course of their disease.

Central neural and peripheral factors are believed to contribute to cancer-induced anorexia and cachexia. Several inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor- $\alpha$, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 $\beta$, and a proteolysisinducing factor, have been shown to cause anorexia and cachexia. Most of these inflammatory cytokines appear to mediate anorexia by activation of the melanocortin system in the hypothalamus. The precise mechanisms by which cytokines or tumor products interact with the melanocortin pathway to decrease food intake are still unclear, but blockade of hypothalamic melanocortin receptors greatly attenuates their anorexic and cachectic effects in experimental animals. Additional research, however, is necessary to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of anorexia and cachexia in persons with cancer and to develop therapeutic agents to improve the nutritional status and survival of these individuals.

## Starvation

Depletion of Food Stores in the Body Tissues During Starvation. Even though the tissues prefer to use carbohydrate
![gu3458052264](gu3458052264.jpg)

Figure 72-4. Effect of starvation on the food stores of the body.
rather than fat or protein for energy, the quantity of carbohydrate normally stored in the entire body is only a few hundred grams (mainly glycogen in the liver and muscles), and it can supply the energy required for body functions for only perhaps half a day. Therefore, except for the first few hours, the major effects of starvation are progressive depletion of tissue fat and protein. Because fat is the prime source of energy ( 100 times as much fat energy as carbohydrate energy is stored in the average person), the rate of fat depletion continues unabated, as shown in Figure 72-4, until most of the fat stores in the body are gone.

Protein undergoes three phases of depletion: rapid depletion at first, followed by greatly slowed depletion, and finally rapid depletion again shortly before death. The initial rapid depletion is caused by the use of easily mobilized protein for direct metabolism or for conversion to glucose and then metabolism of glucose mainly by the brain. After the readily mobilized protein stores have been depleted during the early phase of starvation, the remaining protein is not so easily removed. At this time, the rate of gluconeogenesis decreases to $30 \%$ to $50 \%$ of its previous rate, and the rate of depletion of protein becomes greatly decreased. The lessened availability of glucose then initiates a series of events that leads to excessive fat utilization and conversion of some of the fat breakdown products to ketone bodies, producing ketosis, which is discussed in Chapter 69. The ketone bodies, like glucose, can cross the blood-brain barrier and can be used by the brain cells for energy. Therefore, about two-thirds of the brain's energy is now derived from these ketone bodies, principally from $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate. This sequence of events leads to at least partial preservation of the protein stores of the body.

There finally comes a time when the fat stores are almost depleted, and the only remaining source of energy is protein. At that time, the protein stores once again enter a stage of rapid depletion. Because proteins are also essential for the maintenance of cellular function, death ordinarily ensues when the body proteins have been depleted to about half their normal level.

Vitamin Deficiencies in Starvation. The stores of some vitamins, especially the water-soluble vitamins-the vita$\min$ B group and vitamin C -do not last long during starvation. Consequently, after a week or more of starvation, mild vitamin deficiencies usually begin to appear, and after

several weeks, severe vitamin deficiencies can occur. These deficiencies can add to the debility that leads to death.

## Vitamins

Daily Requirements of Vitamins. A vitamin is an organic compound needed in small quantities for normal metabolism that cannot be manufactured in the cells of the body. Lack of vitamins in the diet can cause important metabolic deficits. Table 72-3 lists the amounts of important vitamins required daily by the average adult man and woman. These requirements vary considerably, depending on such factors as body size, rate of growth, amount of exercise, pregnancy, and lactation.

Storage of Vitamins in the Body. Vitamins are stored to a slight extent in all cells. Some vitamins are stored to a major extent in the liver. For example, the quantity of vitamin A stored in the liver may be sufficient to maintain a person for 5 to 10 months without any intake of vitamin A. The quantity of vitamin D stored in the liver is usually sufficient to maintain a person for 2 to 4 months without any additional intake of vitamin D.

The storage of most water-soluble vitamins, especially vitamin C and most vitamin B compounds, is relatively slight. Absence of vitamin C in the diet can cause symptoms within a few weeks and can cause death from scurry in 20 to 30 weeks. When a person's diet is deficient in vitamin B compounds, clinical symptoms of the deficiency can sometimes be recognized within a few days (except for vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, which can last in the liver in a bound form for a year or longer).

## Vitamin A

Vitamin A occurs in animal tissues as retinol. This vitamin does not occur in foods of vegetable origin, but provitamins
for the formation of vitamin A do occur in abundance in many vegetable foods. These provitamins are the yellow and red carotenoid pigments, which, because their chemical structures are similar to that of vitamin A, can be changed into vitamin A in the liver.

Vitamin A Deficiency Causes "Night Blindness" and Abnormal Epithelial Cell Growth. One basic function of vitamin A is its use in forming retinal pigments of the eye, which is discussed in Chapter 51. Vitamin A is needed to form the visual pigments and, therefore, to prevent night blindness.

Vitamin A is also necessary for normal growth of most cells of the body and especially for normal growth and proliferation of the different types of epithelial cells. When vitamin A is lacking, the epithelial structures of the body tend to become stratified and keratinized. Vitamin A deficiency manifests itself by (1) scaliness of the skin and sometimes acne; (2) failure of growth of young animals, including cessation of skeletal growth; (3) failure of reproduction, associated especially with atrophy of the germinal epithelium of the testes and sometimes with interruption of the female sexual cycle; and (4) keratinization of the cornea, with resultant corneal opacity and blindness.

In vitamin A deficiency, the damaged epithelial structures often become infected (e.g., conjunctivae of the eyes, linings of the urinary tract, and respiratory passages). Vitamin A has been called an "anti-infection" vitamin.

## Thiamine (Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ )

Thiamine operates in the metabolic systems of the body principally as thiamine pyrophosphate; this compound functions as a cocarboxylase, operating mainly in conjunction with a protein decarboxylase for decarboxylation of pyruvic acid and other $\alpha$-keto acids, as discussed in Chapter 68.

Thiamine deficiency (beriberi) causes decreased utilization of pyruvic acid and some amino acids by the tissues but increased utilization of fats. Thus, thiamine is specifically needed for final metabolism of carbohydrates and many amino acids. Decreased utilization of these nutrients is responsible for many debilities associated with thiamine deficiency.

Thiamine Deficiency Causes Lesions of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems. The central nervous system normally depends almost entirely on the metabolism of carbohydrates for its energy. In thiamine deficiency, utilization of glucose by nervous tissue may be decreased by $50 \%$ to $60 \%$ and is replaced by utilization of ketone bodies derived from fat metabolism. The neuronal cells of the central nervous system frequently show chromatolysis and swelling during thiamine deficiency, changes that are characteristic of neuronal cells with poor nutrition. These changes can disrupt communication in many portions of the central nervous system.

Thiamine deficiency can cause degeneration of myelin sheaths of nerve fibers in both the peripheral nerves and the central nervous system. Lesions in peripheral nerves frequently cause them to become extremely irritable, resulting in "polyneuritis," characterized by pain radiating along the course of one or many peripheral nerves. Also, fiber tracts in the cord can degenerate to such an extent that paralysis occasionally results; even in the absence of paralysis, the muscles atrophy, resulting in severe weakness.

Thiamine Deficiency Weakens the Heart and Causes Peripheral Vasodilation. Cardiac failure eventually develops in a person with severe thiamine deficiency because of weakened cardiac muscle. Furthermore, the venous return of blood to the heart may be increased to as much as two times normal, because thiamine deficiency causes peripheral vasodilation throughout the circulatory system, presumably as a result of decreased release of metabolic energy in the tissues, leading to local vascular dilation. The cardiac effects of thiamine deficiency are due partly to high blood flow into the heart and partly to primary weakness of the cardiac muscle. Peripheral edema and ascites also occur to a major extent in some people with thiamine deficiency, mainly because of cardiac failure.

Thiamine Deficiency Causes Gastrointestinal Tract Disturbances. Among the gastrointestinal symptoms of thiamine deficiency are indigestion, severe constipation, anorexia, gastric atony, and hypochlorhydria. All these effects presumably result from failure of the smooth muscle and glands of the gastrointestinal tract to derive sufficient energy from carbohydrate metabolism.

The overall picture of thiamine deficiency, including polyneuritis, cardiovascular symptoms, and gastrointestinal disorders, is frequently referred to as beriberi-especially when the cardiovascular symptoms predominate.

## Riboflavin (Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ )

Riboflavin normally combines in the tissues with phosphoric acid to form two coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). They operate as hydrogen carriers in important oxidative systems of the mitochondria. NAD, operating in association with specific dehydrogenases, usually accepts hydrogen removed from various food substrates and then passes the hydrogen to FMN or FAD. Finally, the hydrogen is released as an ion into the mitochondrial matrix to become oxidized by oxygen (described in Chapter 68).

Deficiency of riboflavin in experimental animals causes severe dermatitis, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle spasticity that finally becomes muscle weakness, coma, and decline in body temperature, followed by death. Thus, severe riboflavin deficiency can cause many of the same effects as a lack of niacin in the diet; presumably, the debilities that result in each case are due to generally depressed oxidative processes within the cells.

In the human being, there are no known cases of riboflavin deficiency severe enough to cause the marked debilities noted in animal studies, but mild riboflavin deficiency is probably common. Such deficiency causes digestive disturbances, burning sensations of the skin and eyes, cracking at the corners of the mouth, headaches, mental depression, forgetfulness, and so on.

Although the manifestations of riboflavin deficiency are usually relatively mild, this deficiency frequently occurs in association with deficiency of thiamine, niacin, or both. Many deficiency syndromes, including pellagra, beriberi, sprue, and kwashiorkor, are probably due to a combined deficiency of a number of vitamins, as well as other aspects of malnutrition.

## Niacin (Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{3}$ )

Niacin, also called nicotinic acid, functions in the body as coenzymes in the form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD) and NAD phosphate. These coenzymes are hydrogen acceptors and combine with hydrogen atoms as they are removed from food substrates by many types of dehydrogenases. The typical operation of both these coenzymes is presented in Chapter 68. When niacin deficiency exists, the normal rate of dehydrogenation cannot be maintained; therefore, oxidative delivery of energy from the foodstuffs to the functioning elements of all cells cannot occur at normal rates.

In the early stages of niacin deficiency, simple physiological changes such as muscle weakness and poor glandular secretion may occur, but in the case of severe niacin deficiency, actual tissue death ensues. Pathological lesions appear in many parts of the central nervous system, and permanent dementia or many types of psychoses may result. In addition, the skin develops a cracked, pigmented scaliness in areas that are exposed to mechanical irritation or sun irradiation; thus, in persons with niacin deficiency, the skin is unable to repair irritative damage.

Niacin deficiency causes intense irritation and inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth and other portions of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in many digestive abnormalities that can lead to widespread gastrointestinal hemorrhage in severe cases. It is possible that this condition results from generalized depression of metabolism in the gastrointestinal epithelium and failure of appropriate epithelial repair.

The clinical entity called pellagra and the canine disease called black tongue are caused mainly by niacin deficiency. Pellagra is greatly exacerbated in people on a corn diet because corn is deficient in the amino acid tryptophan, which can be converted in limited quantities to niacin in the body.

## Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{5}$ )

Pantothenic acid is mainly incorporated in the body into coenzyme $A(\mathrm{CoA})$, which has many metabolic roles in the cells. Two of these roles discussed at length in Chapters 68 and 69 are (1) conversion of decarboxylated pyruvic acid into acetyl-CoA before its entry into the citric acid cycle and (2) degradation of fatty acid molecules into multiple molecules of acetyl-CoA. Thus, lack of pantothenic acid can lead to depressed metabolism of carbohydrates and fats.

Deficiency of pantothenic acid in experimental animals can cause retarded growth, failure of reproduction, graying of the hair, dermatitis, fatty liver, and hemorrhagic adrenocortical necrosis. In humans, no definite deficiency syndrome has been proved, presumably because of the wide occurrence of this vitamin in almost all foods and because small amounts can probably be synthesized in the body. This situation does not mean that pantothenic acid is not of value in the metabolic systems of the body; indeed, it is perhaps as necessary as any other vitamin.

## Pyridoxine (Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ )

Pyridoxine exists in the form of pyridoxal phosphate in the cells and functions as a coenzyme for many chemical reactions related to amino acid and protein metabolism. Its most important role is that of coenzyme in the transamination process for the synthesis of amino acids. As a result, pyridoxine plays many key roles in metabolism, especially protein metabolism. Also, it is believed to act in the transport of some amino acids across cell membranes.

Dietary lack of pyridoxine in experimental animals can cause dermatitis, decreased rate of growth, development of fatty liver, anemia, and evidence of mental deterioration. Rarely, in children, pyridoxine deficiency has been known to cause seizures, dermatitis, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

## Vitamin $B_{12}$

Several cobalamin compounds that possess a common prosthetic group exhibit so-called vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ activity. This prosthetic group contains cobalt, which has bonds similar to those of iron in the hemoglobin molecule. It is likely that the cobalt atom functions in much the same way that the iron atom functions to combine reversibly with other substances.

Vitamin $B_{12}$ Deficiency Causes Pernicious Anemia. Vitamin $B_{12}$ performs several metabolic functions in its role as a hydrogen acceptor coenzyme. Its most important function is to act as a coenzyme for reducing ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, a step that is necessary in the replication of genes and could explain the major functions of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ : (1) promotion of growth and (2) promotion of red blood cell formation and maturation. This red blood cell function is described in detail in Chapter 33 in relation to pernicious anemia, a type of anemia caused by failure of red blood cell maturation when vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is deficient.

Vitamin $B_{12}$ Deficiency Causes Demyelination of the Large Nerve Fibers of the Spinal Cord. The demyelination of nerve fibers in people with vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency occurs especially in the posterior columns, and occasionally the lateral columns, of the spinal cord. As a result, many people with pernicious anemia have loss of peripheral sensation and, in severe cases, even become paralyzed.

The usual cause of vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency is not lack of this vitamin in the food but deficiency of formation of intrinsic factor, which is normally secreted by the parietal cells of the gastric glands and is essential for absorption of vitamin $B_{12}$ by the ileal mucosa. This topic is discussed in Chapters 33 and 67.

## Folic Acid (Pteroylglutamic Acid, Vitamin B6)

Several pteroylglutamic acids exhibit the "folic acid effect." Folic acid functions as a carrier of hydroxymethyl and formyl groups. Perhaps its most important use in the body is in the synthesis of purines and thymine, which are required for DNA formation. Therefore, folic acid, like vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, is required for replication of the cellular genes and may explain one of the most important functions of folic acid-to promote growth. Indeed, when it is absent from the diet, an animal grows very little.

Folic acid is an even more potent growth promoter than vitamin $B_{12}$ and, like vitamin $B_{12}$, it is important for the maturation of red blood cells, as discussed in Chapter 33. However, vitamin $B_{12}$ and folic acid each perform specific and different chemical functions in promoting growth and maturation of red blood cells. One of the significant effects of folic acid deficiency is the development of macrocytic anemia, almost identical to that which occurs in pernicious anemia. This often can be treated effectively with folic acid alone.

## Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)

Ascorbic Acid Deficiency Weakens Collagen Fibers Throughout the Body. Ascorbic acid is essential for activating the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase, which promotes the hydroxylation step in the formation of hydroxyproline, an integral constituent of collagen. Without ascorbic acid, collagen fibers that are formed in virtually all tissues of the body are defective and weak. Therefore, this vitamin is essential for growth and strength of the fibers in subcutaneous tissue, cartilage, bone, and teeth.

Ascorbic Acid Deficiency Causes Scurvy. Deficiency of ascorbic acid for 20 to 30 weeks causes scurvy. One of the most important effects of scurvy is failure of wounds to heal. This condition is caused by failure of the cells to deposit collagen fibrils and intercellular cement substances. As a result, healing of a wound may require several months instead of the several days ordinarily necessary.

Lack of ascorbic acid also causes cessation of bone growth. The cells of the growing epiphyses continue to proliferate, but no new collagen is laid down between the cells, and the bones fracture easily at the point of growth because of failure to ossify. Also, when an already ossified bone fractures in a person with ascorbic acid deficiency, the osteoblasts cannot form new bone matrix. Consequently, the fractured bone does not heal.

The blood vessel walls become extremely fragile in persons with scurvy because of (1) failure of the endothelial cells to be cemented together properly and (2) failure to form the collagen fibrils normally present in vessel walls. The capillaries are especially likely to rupture, and as a result, many small petechial hemorrhages occur throughout the body. The hemorrhages beneath the skin cause purpuric blotches, sometimes over the entire body. In extreme cases of scurvy, the muscle cells sometimes fragment; lesions of the gums occur, with loosening of the teeth; infections of the mouth develop; and vomiting of blood, bloody stools, and cerebral hemorrhage can all occur. Finally, high fever often develops before death.

## Vitamin D

Vitamin D (calciferol) increases calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and helps control calcium deposition in the bone. The mechanism by which vitamin D increases calcium absorption is mainly to promote active transport of calcium through the epithelium of the ileum. In particular, it increases the formation of a calcium-binding protein in the intestinal epithelial cells that aids in calcium absorption. The specific functions of vitamin D in relation to overall body calcium metabolism and bone formation are presented in Chapter 80.

## Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol)

Several related compounds exhibit so-called vitamin E activity. Only rare cases of proved vitamin E deficiency have occurred in human beings. In animal studies, lack of vitamin E can cause degeneration of the germinal epithelium in the testis and, therefore, can cause male sterility. Lack of vitamin E can also cause resorption of a fetus after conception in the female. Because of these effects of vitamin E deficiency, vitamin E is sometimes called the "antisterility vitamin." Deficiency of vitamin E prevents normal growth and sometimes causes degeneration of the renal tubular cells and the muscle cells.

Vitamin E is believed to play a protective role in the prevention of oxidation of unsaturated fats. In the absence of vitamin E, the quantity of unsaturated fats in the cells becomes diminished, causing abnormal structure and function of such cellular organelles as the mitochondria, the lysosomes, and even the cell membrane.

## Vitamin K

Vitamin K is an essential co-factor to a liver enzyme that adds a carboxyl group to factors II (prothrombin), VII (proconvertin), IX, and X, all of which are important in blood coagulation. Without this carboxylation, these coagulation factors are inactive. Therefore, when vitamin K deficiency occurs, blood clotting is retarded. The function of this vitamin and its relation to some of the anticoagulants, such as dicumarol, are presented in greater detail in Chapter 37.

Several natural and synthetic compounds exhibit vitamin K activity. Because vitamin K is synthesized by bacteria in the colon, it is rare for a person to have a bleeding tendency because of vitamin K deficiency in the diet. However, when the bacteria of the colon are destroyed by administration of large quantities of antibiotic drugs, vita$\min K$ deficiency occurs rapidly because of the paucity of this compound in the normal diet.

## Mineral Metabolism

The functions of many minerals, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride, are presented at appropriate points in the text. Only specific functions of minerals not covered elsewhere are mentioned here. The average recommended or adequate daily dietary intakes of these minerals for adult men and women are provided in Table 72-4.

Magnesium. Magnesium is about one sixth as plentiful in cells as potassium. Magnesium is required as a catalyst for many intracellular enzymatic reactions, particularly those related to carbohydrate metabolism.

The extracellular fluid magnesium concentration is slight, only 1.8 to $2.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. Increased extracellular concentration of magnesium depresses nervous system activity, as well as skeletal muscle contraction. This latter effect can be blocked by the administration of calcium. Low magnesium concentration causes increased irritability of the nervous system, peripheral vasodilation, and cardiac arrhythmias, especially after acute myocardial infarction.

Calcium. Calcium is present in the body mainly in the form of calcium phosphate in the bone. This subject is discussed in detail in Chapter 80, as is the calcium content of extracellular fluid. Excess quantities of calcium ions in extracellular fluid can cause the heart to stop in systole and can act as a mental depressant. At the other extreme, low levels of calcium can cause spontaneous discharge of nerve fibers, resulting in tetany, as discussed in Chapter 80.

Phosphorus. Phosphate is the major anion of intracellular fluid. Phosphates have the ability to combine reversibly with many coenzyme systems and with multiple other compounds that are necessary for the operation of metabolic processes. Many important reactions of phosphates have been catalogued at other points in this text, especially in relation to the functions of adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, phosphocreatine, and so forth.

Also, bone contains a large amount of calcium phosphate, which is discussed in Chapter 80.

Iron. The function of iron in the body, especially in relation to the formation of hemoglobin, is discussed in Chapter 33. Two thirds of the iron in the body is in the form of hemoglobin, although smaller quantities are present in other forms, especially in the liver and bone marrow. Electron carriers containing iron (especially the cytochromes) are present in the mitochondria of all cells of the body and are essential for most of the oxidation that occurs in the cells. Therefore, iron is absolutely essential for transport of oxygen to the tissues and operation of oxidative systems within the tissue cells, without which life would cease within a few seconds.

## Important Trace Elements in the Body

A few elements are present in the body in such small quantities that they are called trace elements. The amounts of these elements in foods are also usually minute. Yet, without any one of them, a specific deficiency syndrome is likely to develop. Three of the most important trace elements are iodine, zinc, and fluorine.
Iodine. The best known of the trace elements is iodine. This element is discussed in Chapter 77 in connection with the formation and function of thyroid hormone; as shown in Table 72-4, the entire body contains an average of only 14 milligrams. Iodine is essential for the formation of thyroxine and triiodothyronine, the two thyroid hormones that are essential for maintenance of normal metabolic rates in all cells of the body.

Zinc. Zinc is an integral part of many enzymes, one of the most important of which is carbonic anhydrase, which is present in especially high concentration in the red blood cells. This enzyme is responsible for rapid combination of carbon dioxide with water in red blood cells of peripheral capillary blood and for rapid release of carbon dioxide from pulmonary capillary blood into the alveoli. Carbonic anhydrase is also present to a major extent in the gastrointestinal mucosa, the tubules of the kidney, and the epithelial cells of many glands of the body. Consequently, zinc in small quantities is essential for the performance of many reactions related to carbon dioxide metabolism.

Zinc is also a component of lactic dehydrogenase and is therefore important for the interconversions between pyruvic acid and lactic acid. Finally, zinc is a component of some peptidases and is important for the digestion of proteins in the gastrointestinal tract.

Fluorine. Fluorine does not seem to be a necessary element for metabolism, but the presence of a small quantity of fluorine in the body during the period of life when the teeth are being formed subsequently protects against caries. Fluorine does not make the teeth stronger but suppresses the cariogenic process. It has been suggested that fluorine is deposited in the hydroxyapatite crystals of the tooth enamel and combines with and therefore blocks the functions of various trace metals that are necessary for activation of the bacterial enzymes that cause caries. Therefore, when fluorine is present, the enzymes remain inactive and cause no caries.

Excessive intake of fluorine causes fluorosis, which manifests in its mild state by mottled teeth and in its more severe state by enlarged bones. It has been postulated that in this condition, fluorine combines with trace metals in some of the metabolic enzymes, including the phosphatases, so that various metabolic systems become partially inactivated. According to this theory, the mottled teeth and enlarged bones are due to abnormal enzyme systems in the odontoblasts and osteoblasts. Even though the mottled teeth are highly resistant to the development of caries, the structural strength of these teeth may be lessened by the mottling process.

## Adenosine Triphosphate Functions as an "Energy Currency" in Metabolism

Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be used by cells to synthesize large quantities of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used as an energy source for almost all other cellular functions. For this reason, ATP has been called an energy "currency" in cell metabolism. Indeed, the transfer of energy from foodstuffs to most functional systems of the cells can be performed only through this medium of ATP (or the similar nucleotide guanosine triphosphate [GTP]). Many of the attributes of ATP are presented in Chapter 2.

An attribute of ATP that makes it highly valuable as an energy currency is the large quantity of free energy ( $\approx 7300$ calories-or 7.3 Calories [kilocalories]-per mole under standard conditions, but as much as 12,000 calories under physiological conditions) vested in each of its two high-energy phosphate bonds. The amount of energy in each bond, when liberated by decomposition of ATP, is enough to cause almost any step of any chemical reaction in the body to take place if appropriate energy transfer is achieved. Some chemical reactions that require ATP energy use only a few hundred of the available 12,000 calories, and the remainder of this energy is lost in the form of heat.

ATP Is Generated by Combustion of Carbohydrates, Fats, and Proteins. In previous chapters, we discussed the transfer of energy from various foods to ATP. To summarize, ATP is produced through the following processes:

1. Combustion of carbohydrates-mainly glucose, but also smaller amounts of other sugars such as fructose; this combustion occurs in the cell cytoplasm through the anaerobic process of glycolysis and in the cell mitochondria through the aerobic citric acid (Krebs) cycle.
2. Combustion of fatty acids in the cell mitochondria by beta-oxidation.
3. Combustion of proteins, which requires hydrolysis to their component amino acids and degradation of the amino acids to intermediate compounds of the citric acid cycle and then to acetyl coenzyme A and carbon dioxide.
ATP Energizes the Synthesis of Cellular Components. Among the most important intracellular processes that require ATP energy is the formation of peptide linkages between amino acids during synthesis of proteins. The different peptide linkages, depending on which types of amino acids are linked, require from 500 to 5000 calories of energy per mole. Recall from Chapter 3 that four highenergy phosphate bonds are expended during the cascade
of reactions required to form each peptide linkage. This expenditure provides a total of 48,000 calories of energy, far more than the 500 to 5000 calories eventually stored in each of the peptide linkages.

ATP energy is also used for synthesizing glucose from lactic acid and for synthesizing fatty acids from acetyl coenzyme A. In addition, ATP energy is used for the synthesis of cholesterol, phospholipids, the hormones, and almost all other substances of the body. Even the urea excreted by the kidneys requires ATP for its formation from ammonia. One might wonder why energy is expended to form urea, which is simply discarded by the body. However, remembering the extreme toxicity of ammonia in the body fluids, one can see the value of this reaction, which keeps the ammonia concentration of the body fluids at a low level.

ATP Energizes Muscle Contraction. Muscle contraction will not occur without energy from ATP. Myosin, one of the important contractile proteins of the muscle fiber, acts as an enzyme to cause breakdown of ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thus releasing the energy required to cause contraction. Only a small amount of ATP is normally degraded in muscles when muscle contraction is not occurring, but this rate of ATP usage can rise to at least 150 times the resting level during short bursts of maximal contraction. The mechanism by which ATP energy is used to cause muscle contraction is discussed in Chapter 6.

ATP Energizes Active Transport Across Membranes. In Chapters 4, 28, and 66, active transport of electrolytes and various nutrients across cell membranes and from the renal tubules and gastrointestinal tract into the blood is discussed. We noted that active transport of most electrolytes and substances such as glucose, amino acids, and acetoacetate can occur against an electrochemical gradient, even though the natural diffusion of the substances would be in the opposite direction. Energy provided by ATP is required to oppose the electrochemical gradient.

ATP Energizes Glandular Secretion. The same principles apply to glandular secretion as to the absorption of substances against concentration gradients because energy is required to concentrate substances as they are secreted by the glandular cells. In addition, energy is required to synthesize the organic compounds to be secreted.

ATP Energizes Nerve Conduction. The energy used during propagation of nerve impulses is derived from the potential energy stored in the form of concentration differences of ions across the neuronal cell membranes. That is, a high concentration of potassium inside the neuron

and a low concentration outside the neuron constitute a type of energy storage. Likewise, a high concentration of sodium on the outside of the membrane and a low concentration on the inside represent another store of energy. The energy needed to pass each action potential along the fiber membrane is derived from this energy storage, with small amounts of potassium transferring out of the cell and sodium into the cell during each of the action potentials. However, active transport systems energized by ATP then retransport the ions back through the membrane to their former positions.

## Phosphocreatine Functions as an Accessory Storage Depot for Energy and as an "ATP Buffer"

Despite the paramount importance of ATP as a coupling agent for energy transfer, this substance is not the most abundant store of high-energy phosphate bonds in the cells. Phosphocreatine, which also contains high-energy phosphate bonds, is three to eight times more abundant than ATP. Also, the high-energy bond ( - ) of phosphocreatine contains about 8500 calories per mole under standard conditions and as many as 13,000 calories per mole under conditions in the body ( $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and low concentrations of the reactants). This amount is slightly greater than the 12,000 calories per mole in each of the two high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP. The formula for creatinine phosphate is the following:
![gu3558052264](gu3558052264.jpg)

Unlike ATP, phosphocreatine cannot act as a direct coupling agent for energy transfer between the foods and the functional cellular systems, but it can transfer energy interchangeably with ATP. When extra amounts of ATP are available in the cell, much of its energy is used to synthesize phosphocreatine, thus building up this storehouse of energy. Then, when the ATP begins to be used up, the energy in the phosphocreatine is transferred rapidly back to ATP and then to the functional systems of the cells. This reversible interrelation between ATP and phosphocreatine is demonstrated by the following equation:

Phosphocreatine + ADP
ATP + Creatine

The higher energy level of the high-energy phosphate bond in phosphocreatine (1000-1500 calories per mole greater than that in ATP) causes the reaction between phosphocreatine and ADP to proceed rapidly toward the formation of new ATP whenever the slightest amount of ATP expends its energy elsewhere. Therefore, the slightest usage of ATP by the cells calls forth the energy from the phosphocreatine to synthesize new ATP. This effect keeps the concentration of ATP at an almost constant high level as long as any phosphocreatine remains. For this reason, we can call the ATP-phosphocreatine system an ATP "buffer" system. One can readily understand the importance of keeping the concentration of ATP nearly constant because the rates of almost all the metabolic reactions in the body depend on this constancy.

## Anaerobic Versus Aerobic Energy

Anaerobic energy means energy that can be derived from foods without the simultaneous utilization of oxygen; aerobic energy means energy that can be derived from foods only by oxidative metabolism. In Chapters 68 through 70, we noted that carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be oxidized to cause synthesis of ATP. However, carbohydrates are the only significant foods that can be used to provide energy without utilization of oxygen; this energy release occurs during glycolytic breakdown of glucose or glycogen to pyruvic acid. For each mole of glucose that is split into pyruvic acid, 2 moles of ATP are formed. However, when stored glycogen in a cell is split to pyruvic acid, each mole of glucose in the glycogen gives rise to 3 moles of ATP. The reason for this difference is that free glucose entering the cell must be phosphorylated by using 1 mole of ATP before it can begin to be split; this is not true of glucose derived from glycogen because it comes from the glycogen already in the phosphorylated state, without the additional expenditure of ATP. Thus, the best source of energy under anaerobic conditions is the stored glycogen of the cells.

Anaerobic Energy Utilization During Hypoxia. One of the prime examples of anaerobic energy utilization occurs in acute hypoxia. When a person stops breathing, a small amount of oxygen is already stored in the lungs and an additional amount is stored in the hemoglobin of the blood. This oxygen is sufficient to keep the metabolic processes functioning for only about 2 minutes. Continued life beyond this time requires an additional source of energy. This energy can be derived for another minute or so from glyco-lysis-that is, the glycogen of the cells splitting into pyruvic acid, and the pyruvic acid becoming lactic acid, which diffuses out of the cells, as described in Chapter 68.

Anaerobic Energy Utilization During Strenuous Bursts of Activity Is Derived Mainly From Glycolysis. Skeletal muscles can perform extreme feats of strength for a few seconds but are much less capable during prolonged activity. Most of the extra energy required during these bursts of activity cannot come from the oxidative processes because they are too slow to respond. Instead, the extra energy comes from anaerobic sources: (1) ATP already present in the muscle cells, (2) phosphocreatine in the cells, and (3) anaerobic energy released by glycolytic breakdown of glycogen to lactic acid.

The maximum amount of ATP in muscle is only about 5 $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ of intracellular fluid, and this amount can maintain maximum muscle contraction for no more than a second or so. The amount of phosphocreatine in the cells is three to eight times this amount, but even by using all the phosphocreatine, maximum contraction can be maintained for only 5 to 10 seconds.

Release of energy by glycolysis can occur much more rapidly than can oxidative release of energy. Consequently, most of the extra energy required during strenuous activity that lasts for more than 5 to 10 seconds but less than 1 to 2 minutes is derived from anaerobic glycolysis. As a result, the glycogen content of muscles during strenuous bouts of exercise is reduced, whereas the lactic acid concentration of the blood rises. After the exercise is over, oxidative metabolism is used to reconvert about four fifths of the lactic acid into glucose; the remainder becomes pyruvic acid and is de-

graded and oxidized in the citric acid cycle. The reconversion to glucose occurs principally in the liver cells, and the glucose is then transported in the blood back to the muscles, where it is stored once more in the form of glycogen.

## Extra Consumption of Oxygen Repays the Oxygen Debt

After Completion of Strenuous Exercise. After a period of strenuous exercise, a person continues to breathe hard and to consume large amounts of oxygen for at least a few minutes and sometimes for as long as 1 hour thereafter. This additional oxygen is used to (1) reconvert the lactic acid that has accumulated during exercise back into glucose, (2) reconvert adenosine monophosphate and ADP to ATP, (3) reconvert creatine and phosphate to phosphocreatine, (4) re-establish normal concentrations of oxygen bound with hemoglobin and myoglobin, and (5) raise the concentration of oxygen in the lungs to its normal level. This extra consumption of oxygen after exercise is called repaying the oxygen debt.

The principle of oxygen debt is discussed further in Chapter 85 in relation to sports physiology. The ability of a person to build up an oxygen debt is especially important in many types of athletics.

## Summary of Energy Utilization by the Cells

With the background of the past few chapters and of the preceding discussion, we can now synthesize a composite picture of overall energy utilization by the cells, as shown in Figure 73-1. This figure demonstrates the anaerobic utilization of glycogen and glucose to form ATP and the aerobic utilization of compounds derived from carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and other substances to form additional ATP. In turn, ATP is in reversible equilibrium with phosphocreatine in the cells, and because larger quantities of phosphocreatine than of ATP are present in the cells, much of the cells' stored energy is in this energy storehouse.

Energy from ATP can be used by the different functioning systems of the cells to provide for synthesis and growth, muscle contraction, glandular secretion, nerve impulse conduction, active absorption, and other cellular activities. If greater amounts of energy are demanded for cellular activities than can be provided by oxidative metabolism, the phosphocreatine storehouse is used first, followed rapidly by anaerobic breakdown of glycogen. Thus, oxidative
metabolism cannot deliver bursts of extreme energy to the cells nearly as rapidly as the anaerobic processes can, but at slower rates of usage, the oxidative processes can continue as long as energy stores (mainly fat) exist.

## Control of Energy Release in the Cell

Rate Control of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions. Before discussing the control of energy release in the cell, it is necessary to consider the basic principles of rate control of enzymatically catalyzed chemical reactions, which are the types of reactions that occur almost universally throughout the body.

The mechanism by which an enzyme catalyzes a chemical reaction is, first, for the enzyme to combine loosely with one of the substrates of the reaction. This loose combination alters the bonding forces on the substrate sufficiently so that it can react with other substances. Therefore, the rate of the overall chemical reaction is determined by the concentration of the enzyme and the concentration of the substrate that binds with the enzyme. The basic equation expressing this concept is as follows:

$$
\text { Rate of reaction }=\frac{\mathrm{K}_{1} \times[\text { Enzyme }] \times[\text { Substrate }]}{\mathrm{K}_{2}+[\text { Substrate }]}
$$

This equation is called the Michaelis-Menten equation. Figure 73-2 shows the application of this equation.

Role of Enzyme Concentration in Regulation of Metabolic Reactions. Figure 73-2 shows that when the substrate concentration is high, as shown in the right half of the figure, the rate of a chemical reaction is determined almost entirely by the concentration of the enzyme. Thus, as the enzyme concentration increases from an arbitrary value of 1 up to 2 , 4 , or 8 , the rate of the reaction increases proportionately, as demonstrated by the rising levels of the curves. For example, when large quantities of glucose enter the renal tubules in a person with diabetes mellitus-that is, the substrate glucose is in great excess in the tubules-further increases in tubular glucose have little effect on glucose reabsorption, because the transport enzymes are saturated. Under these conditions, the rate of reabsorption of the glucose is limited by the concentration of the transport enzymes in the proximal tubular cells, not by the concentration of the glucose.

![gu3758052264](gu3758052264.jpg)

Figure 73-2. Effect of substrate and enzyme concentrations on the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

Role of Substrate Concentration in Regulation of Metabolic Reactions. Note also in Figure 73-2 that when the substrate concentration becomes low enough that only a small portion of the enzyme is required in the reaction, the rate of the reaction becomes directly proportional to the substrate concentration, as well as the enzyme concentration. This is the relationship seen in the absorption of substances from the intestinal tract and renal tubules when their concentrations are low.

Rate Limitation in a Series of Reactions. Almost all chemical reactions of the body occur in series, with the product of one reaction acting as a substrate for the next reaction, and so on. Therefore, the overall rate of a complex series of chemical reactions is determined mainly by the rate of reaction of the slowest step in the series, which is called the rate-limiting step in the entire series.

ADP Concentration as a Rate-Controlling Factor in Energy Release. Under resting conditions, the concentration of ADP in the cells is extremely slight, and thus the chemical reactions that depend on ADP as one of the substrates are quite slow. They include all the oxidative metabolic pathways that release energy from food, as well as essentially all other pathways for the release of energy in the body. Thus, $A D P$ is a major rate-limiting factor for almost all energy metabolism of the body.

When the cells become active, regardless of the type of activity, ATP is converted into ADP, increasing the concentration of ADP in direct proportion to the degree of activity of the cell. This ADP then automatically increases the rates of all the reactions for the metabolic release of energy from food. Thus, by this simple process, the amount of energy released in the cell is controlled by the degree of activity of the cell. In the absence of cellular activity, the release of energy stops because all the ADP soon becomes ATP.

## Metabolic Rate

The metabolism of the body simply means all the chemical reactions in all the cells of the body, and the metabolic rate is normally expressed in terms of the rate of heat liberation during chemical reactions.

Heat Is the End Product of Almost All the Energy Released in the Body. In discussing many of the metabolic reactions in the preceding chapters, we noted that not all the energy in foods is transferred to ATP; instead, a large portion of this energy becomes heat. On average, $35 \%$ of
the energy in foods becomes heat during ATP formation. Additional energy becomes heat as it is transferred from ATP to the functional systems of the cells, so even under optimal conditions, no more than $27 \%$ of all the energy from food is finally used by the functional systems.

Even when $27 \%$ of the energy reaches the functional systems of the cells, most of this energy eventually becomes heat. For example, when proteins are synthesized, large portions of ATP are used to form the peptide linkages, and this action stores energy in these linkages. However, continuous turnover of proteins also occurs-some are being degraded while others are being formed. When proteins are degraded, the energy stored in the peptide linkages is released in the form of heat into the body.

Another example is the energy used for muscle activity. Much of this energy simply overcomes the viscosity of the muscles or of the tissues so that the limbs can move. This viscous movement causes friction within the tissues, which generates heat.

Consider also the energy expended by the heart in pumping blood. The blood distends the arterial system, and this distention represents a reservoir of potential energy. As the blood flows through peripheral vessels, the friction of different layers of blood flowing over one another and the friction of blood against the walls of the vessels turn all this energy into heat.

Essentially all the energy expended by the body is eventually converted into heat. The only significant exception occurs when the muscles are used to perform some form of work outside the body. For example, when the muscles elevate an object to a height or propel the body up steps, a type of potential energy is created by raising a mass against gravity. However, when external expenditure of energy is not taking place, all the energy released by the metabolic processes eventually becomes body heat.

The Calorie. To discuss the metabolic rate of the body and related subjects quantitatively, it is necessary to use some unit for expressing the quantity of energy released from different foods or expended by different functional processes of the body. Most often, the Calorie is the unit used for this purpose. Recall that 1 calorie-spelled with a small "c" and often called a gram calorie-is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The calorie is much too small a unit to use when referring to energy in the body. Consequently, the Calo-rie-spelled with a capital "C" and often called a kilocalorie, which is equivalent to 1000 calories-is the unit ordinarily used when discussing energy metabolism.

## Measurement of the Whole-Body Metabolic Rate

Direct Calorimetry Measures Heat Liberated From the Body. If a person is not performing any external work, the whole-body metabolic rate can be determined by simply measuring the total quantity of heat liberated from the body in a given time.

In determining the metabolic rate by direct calorimetry, one measures the quantity of heat liberated from the body in a large, specially constructed calorimeter. The subject is placed in an air chamber that is so well insulated that no heat can leak through the walls of the chamber. Heat formed by the subject's body warms the air of the chamber. However, the air temperature within the chamber is maintained at a

constant level by forcing the air through pipes in a cool water bath. The rate of heat gain by the water bath, which can be measured with an accurate thermometer, is equal to the rate at which heat is liberated by the subject's body.

Direct calorimetry is physically difficult to perform and is used only for research purposes.

## Indirect Calorimetry—The "Energy Equivalent" of

Oxygen. Because more than $95 \%$ of the energy expended in the body is derived from reactions of oxygen with the different foods, the whole-body metabolic rate can also be calculated with a high degree of accuracy from the rate of oxygen utilization. When 1 liter of oxygen is metabolized with glucose, 5.01 Calories of energy are released; when metabolized with starches, 5.06 Calories are released; with fat, 4.70 Calories; and with protein, 4.60 Calories.

These figures clearly demonstrate that the quantities of energy liberated per liter of oxygen consumed are nearly equivalent when different types of food are metabolized. For the average diet, the quantity of energy liberated per liter of oxygen used in the body averages about 4.825 Calories, which is called the energy equivalent of oxygen. By using this energy equivalent, one can calculate with a high degree of precision the rate of heat liberation in the body from the quantity of oxygen used in a given period.

If a person metabolizes only carbohydrates during the period of the metabolic rate determination, the calculated quantity of energy liberated, based on the value for the average energy equivalent of oxygen (4.825 Calories/L), would be about $4 \%$ too little. Conversely, if the person obtains most energy from fat, the calculated value would be about $4 \%$ too great.

## Energy Metabolism—Factors That Influence Energy Output

As discussed in Chapter 72, energy intake is balanced with energy output in healthy adults who maintain a stable body weight. In the average American diet, about $45 \%$ of daily energy intake is derived from carbohydrates, $40 \%$ from fats, and $15 \%$ from proteins. Energy output can also be partitioned into several measurable components, including energy used for (1) performing essential metabolic functions of the body (the "basal" metabolic rate); (2) performing various physical activities, including nonexercise physical activity and physical activity associated with volitional exercise; (3) digesting, absorbing, and processing food; and (4) maintaining body temperature.

## Overall Energy Requirements for Daily Activities

An average man who weighs 70 kilograms and lies in bed all day uses about 1650 Calories of energy. The process of eating and digesting food increases the amount of energy used each day by an additional 200 or more Calories, so the same man lying in bed and eating a reasonable diet requires a dietary intake of about 1850 Calories per day. If he sits in a chair all day without exercising, his total energy requirement reaches 2000 to 2250 Calories. Therefore, the daily energy requirement for a very sedentary man performing only essential functions is about 2000 Calories.

The amount of energy used to perform daily physical activities is normally about $25 \%$ of the total energy expenditure, but it can vary markedly in different individuals, depending on the type and amount of physical activity
![gu3858052264](gu3858052264.jpg)

Figure 73-3. Average daily energy expenditure and components of energy usage in a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ person in energy balance and ingesting approximately 3000 Calories per day.
performed. For example, walking up stairs requires about 17 times as much energy as lying in bed asleep. In general, over a 24 -hour period, a person performing heavy labor can achieve a maximal rate of energy utilization as great as 6000 to 7000 Calories, or as much as 3.5 times the energy used under conditions of no physical activity.

## Basal Metabolic Rate—The Minimum Energy Expenditure for the Body to Exist

Even when a person is at complete rest, considerable energy is required to perform all the chemical reactions of the body. This minimum level of energy required to exist is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and accounts for about $50 \%$ to $70 \%$ of the daily energy expenditure in most sedentary persons (Figure 73-3).

Because the level of physical activity is highly variable among different persons, measurement of the BMR provides a useful means of comparing one person's metabolic rate with that of another. The usual method for determining BMR is to measure the rate of oxygen utilization over a given period under the following conditions:

1. The person must not have eaten food for at least 12 hours.
2. The BMR is determined after a night of restful sleep.
3. No strenuous activity is performed for at least 1 hour before the test.
4. All psychic and physical factors that cause excitement must be eliminated.
5. The temperature of the air must be comfortable and between $68^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ and $80^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.
6. No physical activity is permitted during the test.

The BMR normally averages about 65 to 70 Calories per hour in an average 70 -kilogram man. Although much of the BMR is accounted for by essential activities of the central nervous system, heart, kidneys, and other organs, variations in BMR among different persons are related mainly to differences in the amount of skeletal muscle and body size.

Skeletal muscle, even under resting conditions, accounts for $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ of the BMR. For this reason, BMR is usually corrected for differences in body size by expressing it as Calories per hour per square meter of body surface area, calculated from height and weight. The average

![gu3958052264](gu3958052264.jpg)

Figure 73-4. Normal basal metabolic rates at different ages for each sex.
values for males and females of different ages are shown in Figure 73-4.

Much of the decline in BMR with increasing age is probably related to loss of muscle mass and replacement of muscle with adipose tissue, which has a lower rate of metabolism. Likewise, slightly lower BMRs in women, compared with men, are due partly to the lower percentage of muscle mass and higher percentage of adipose tissue in women. However, other factors can influence the BMR, as is discussed next.

Thyroid Hormone Increases Metabolic Rate. When the thyroid gland secretes maximal amounts of thyroxine, the metabolic rate sometimes rises $50 \%$ to $100 \%$ above normal. Conversely, total loss of thyroid secretion decreases the metabolic rate to $40 \%$ to $60 \%$ of normal. As discussed in Chapter 77, thyroxine increases the chemical reaction rates of many cells in the body and therefore increases metabolic rate. Adaptation of the thyroid gland-with increased secretion in cold climates and decreased secretion in hot climates-contributes to the differences in BMRs among people living in different geographical zones. For example, people living in arctic regions have BMRs that are $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ higher than those of persons living in tropical regions.

Male Sex Hormone Increases Metabolic Rate. The male sex hormone testosterone can increase the metabolic rate about $10 \%$ to $15 \%$. The female sex hormones may increase the BMR a small amount, but usually not enough to be significant. Much of this effect of the male sex hormone is related to its anabolic effect to increase skeletal muscle mass.

Growth Hormone Increases Metabolic Rate. Growth hormone can increase the metabolic rate by stimulating cellular metabolism and by increasing skeletal muscle mass. In adults with growth hormone deficiency, replacement therapy with recombinant growth hormone increases the basal metabolic rate by about $20 \%$.

Fever Increases Metabolic Rate. Fever, regardless of its cause, increases the chemical reactions of the body by an average of about $120 \%$ for every $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ rise in temperature. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 74.

Sleep Decreases Metabolic Rate. The metabolic rate decreases $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ below normal during sleep. This decrease is due to two principal factors: (1) decreased tone
of the skeletal musculature during sleep; and (2) decreased activity of the central nervous system.

Malnutrition Decreases Metabolic Rate. Prolonged malnutrition can decrease the metabolic rate $20 \%$ to $30 \%$, presumably because of the paucity of food substances in the cells. In the final stages of many disease conditions, the inanition that accompanies the disease causes a marked decrease in metabolic rate to the extent that the body temperature may fall several degrees shortly before death.

## Energy Used for Physical Activities

The factor that most dramatically increases metabolic rate is strenuous exercise. Short bursts of maximal muscle contraction in a single muscle can liberate as much as 100 times its normal resting amount of heat for a few seconds. For the entire body, maximal muscle exercise can increase the overall heat production of the body for a few seconds to about 50 times normal, or to about 20 times normal for more sustained exercise in a well-trained individual.

Table 73-1 shows the energy expenditure during different types of physical activity for a 70-kilogram man. Because of the great variation in the amount of physical activity among individuals, this component of energy expenditure is the most important reason for the differences in caloric intake required to maintain energy balance. However, in industrialized countries where food supplies are generally plentiful and the level of physical activity is often low, caloric intake often periodically exceeds energy expenditure, and the excess energy is stored mainly as fat. This underscores the importance of maintaining a proper level of physical activity to prevent excess fat stores and obesity.

Even in sedentary individuals who perform little or no daily exercise or physical work, significant energy is spent on spontaneous physical activity required to maintain muscle tone and body posture and on other nonexercise activities. Together, these nonexercise activities typically account for about $7 \%$ of a sedentary person's daily energy usage. However, this percentage can vary markedly among different people depending on their occupation, habits (e.g. walking to work, using the stairs rather than elevators, fidgeting), and leisure time activities.

## Energy Used for Processing Food—Thermogenic Effect of Food

After a meal is ingested, the metabolic rate increases as a result of the different chemical reactions associated with digestion, absorption, and storage of food in the body. This increase is called the thermogenic effect of food because these processes require energy and generate heat.

After a meal that contains a large quantity of carbohydrates or fats, the metabolic rate usually increases about $4 \%$. However, after a meal high in protein, the metabolic rate usually begins rising within an hour, reaching a maximum of about $30 \%$ above normal, and this rate lasts for 3 to 12 hours. This effect of protein on the metabolic rate is called the specific dynamic action of protein. The thermogenic effect of food accounts for about $8 \%$ of the total daily energy expenditure in many persons.

## Energy Used for Nonshivering Thermogenesis—Role of Sympathetic Stimulation

Although physical work and the thermogenic effect of food cause liberation of heat, these mechanisms are not aimed primarily at regulation of body temperature. Shivering

provides a regulated means of producing heat by increasing muscle activity in response to cold stress, as discussed in Chapter 74. Another mechanism, nonshivering thermogenesis, can also produce heat in response to cold stress. This type of thermogenesis is stimulated by sympathetic nervous system activation, which releases norepinephrine and epinephrine, which in turn increase metabolic activity and heat generation.

In certain types of fat tissue, called brown fat, sympathetic nervous stimulation causes liberation of large amounts of heat. This type of fat contains large numbers of mitochondria and many small globules of fat instead of one large fat globule. In these cells, the process of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria is mainly "uncoupled." That is, when the cells are stimulated by the sympathetic nerves, the mitochondria produce a large amount of heat but almost no ATP, so almost all the released oxidative energy immediately becomes heat.

A neonate has a considerable amount of brown fat, and maximal sympathetic stimulation can increase the child's metabolism more than $100 \%$. The magnitude of this type of thermogenesis in an adult human, who has virtually no brown fat, is probably less than $15 \%$, although this might increase significantly after cold adaptation.

Nonshivering thermogenesis may also serve as a buffer against obesity. Recent studies indicate that sympathetic nervous system activity is increased in obese persons who have a persistent excess caloric intake. The mechanism responsible for sympathetic activation in obese persons is uncertain, but it may be mediated partly through the effects of increased leptin, which activates pro-opiomelanocortin neurons in the hypothalamus. Sympathetic stimulation, by increasing thermogenesis, helps to limit excess weight gain.

# Body Temperature Regulation and Fever 

## NORMAL BODY TEMPERATURES

Body Core Temperature and Skin Temperature. The temperature of the deep tissues of the body-the "core" of the body-usually remains very constant, within $\pm 1^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ $\left( \pm 0.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, except when a person has a febrile illness. Indeed, a nude person can be exposed to temperatures as low as $55^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ or as high as $130^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ in $d r y$ air and still maintain an almost constant core temperature. The mechanisms for regulating body temperature represent a beautifully designed control system. In this chapter we discuss this system as it operates in health and in disease.

The skin temperature, in contrast to the core temperature, rises and falls with the temperature of the surroundings. The skin temperature is important when we refer to the skin's ability to lose heat to the surroundings.

Normal Core Temperature. No single core temperature can be considered normal because measurements in many healthy people have shown a range of normal temperatures measured orally, as shown in Figure 74-1, from less than $97^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(36^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ to greater than $99.5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. The average normal core temperature is generally considered to be between $98.0^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ and $98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ when measured orally and about $1^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ higher when measured rectally.

The body temperature increases during exercise and varies with temperature extremes of the surroundings because the temperature regulatory mechanisms are not perfect. When excessive heat is produced in the body by strenuous exercise, the temperature can rise temporarily to as high as $101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to $104^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Conversely, when the body is exposed to extreme cold, the temperature can fall below $96^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

## BODY TEMPERATURE IS CONTROLLED BY BALANCING HEAT PRODUCTION AND HEAT LOSS

When the rate of heat production in the body is greater than the rate at which heat is being lost, heat builds up in the body, and the body temperature rises. Conversely, when heat loss is greater, both body heat and body temperature decrease. Most of the remainder of this chapter is concerned with this balance between heat production and heat loss and the mechanisms by which the body controls this production and loss.

## HEAT PRODUCTION

Heat production is a principal by-product of metabolism. In Chapter 73, which summarizes body energetics, we discuss the different factors that determine the rate of heat production, called the metabolic rate of the body. The most important of these factors are listed again here: (1) basal rate of metabolism of all the cells of the body; (2) extra rate of metabolism caused by muscle activity, including muscle contractions caused by shivering; (3) extra metabolism caused by the effect of thyroxine (and, to a lesser extent, other hormones, such as growth hormone and testosterone) on the cells; (4) extra metabolism caused by the effect of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and sympathetic stimulation on the cells; (5) extra metabolism caused by increased chemical activity in the cells, especially when the cell temperature increases; and (6) extra metabolism needed for digestion, absorption, and storage of food (thermogenic effect of food).

## HEAT LOSS

Most of the heat produced in the body is generated in the deep organs, especially the liver, brain, and heart, and in the skeletal muscles during physical activity. This heat is then transferred from the deeper organs and tissues to the skin, where it is lost to the air and other surroundings. Therefore, the rate at which heat is lost is determined almost entirely by two factors: (1) how rapidly heat can be conducted from where it is produced in the body core to the skin and (2) how rapidly heat can then be transferred from the skin to the surroundings. Let us begin by discussing the system that insulates the core from the skin surface.

## Insulator System of the Body

The skin, the subcutaneous tissues, and especially the fat of the subcutaneous tissues act together as a heat insulator for the body. The fat is important because it conducts heat only one-third as readily as other tissues. When no blood is flowing from the heated internal organs to the skin, the insulating properties of the normal male body are about equal to three-quarters the insulating properties of a usual suit of clothes. In women, this insulation is even better.

The insulation beneath the skin is an effective means of maintaining normal internal core temperature, even though it allows the temperature of the skin to approach the temperature of the surroundings.

## Blood Flow to the Skin From the Body Core Provides Heat Transfer

Blood vessels are distributed profusely beneath the skin. Especially important is a continuous venous plexus that is supplied by inflow of blood from the skin capillaries, shown in Figure 74-2. In the most exposed areas of the body-the hands, feet, and ears-blood is also supplied to the plexus directly from the small arteries through highly muscular arteriovenous anastomoses.

The rate of blood flow into the skin venous plexus can vary tremendously, from barely above zero to as great as $30 \%$ of the total cardiac output. A high rate of skin flow causes heat to be conducted from the body core to the skin with great efficiency, whereas reduction in the rate
![gu4158052264](gu4158052264.jpg)

Figure 74-2. Skin circulation.
of skin flow can decrease heat conduction from the core to very little.

Figure 74-3 shows quantitatively the effect of environmental air temperature on conductance of heat from the core to the skin surface and then conductance into the air, demonstrating an approximate eightfold increase in heat conductance between the fully vasoconstricted state and the fully vasodilated state.

Therefore, the skin is an effective controlled "heat radiator" system, and the flow of blood to the skin is a most effective mechanism for heat transfer from the body core to the skin.

Control of Heat Conduction to the Skin by the Sympathetic Nervous System. Heat conduction to the skin by the blood is controlled by the degree of vasoconstriction of the arterioles and the arteriovenous anastomoses that supply blood to the venous plexus of the skin. This vasoconstriction is controlled almost entirely by the sympathetic nervous system in response to changes in body core temperature and changes in environmental temperature. This is discussed later in the chapter in connection with control of body temperature by the hypothalamus.

## Basic Physics of Heat Loss From the Skin Surface

The various methods by which heat is lost from the skin to the surroundings are shown in Figure 74-4. They include radiation, conduction, and evaporation, which are explained next.

## Radiation Causes Heat Loss in the Form of Infrared

Rays. As shown in Figure 74-4, in a nude person sitting inside at normal room temperature, about $60 \%$ of total heat loss is by radiation.

Most infrared heat rays (a type of electromagnetic ray) that radiate from the body have wavelengths of 5 to
![gu4258052264](gu4258052264.jpg)

Figure 74-3. Effect of changes in the environmental temperature on heat conductance from the body core to the skin surface (in ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ). (Modified from Benzinger TH: Heat and Temperature Fundamentals of Medical Physiology. New York: Dowden, Hutchinson \& Ross, 1980.)

20 micrometers, 10 to 30 times the wavelengths of light rays. All objects that are not at absolute zero temperature radiate such rays. The human body radiates heat rays in all directions. Heat rays are also being radiated from the walls of rooms and other objects toward the body. If the temperature of the body is greater than the temperature of the surroundings, a greater quantity of heat is radiated from the body than is radiated to the body.

## Conductive Heat Loss Occurs by Direct Contact With

an Object. As shown in Figure 74-4, only minute quantities of heat, about $3 \%$, are normally lost from the body by direct conduction from the surface of the body to solid objects, such as a chair or a bed. Loss of heat by conduction to air, however, represents a sizable proportion of the body's heat loss ( $\approx 15 \%$ ), even under normal conditions.

Heat is actually the kinetic energy of molecular motion, and the molecules of the skin are continually undergoing vibratory motion. Much of the energy of this motion can be transferred to the air if the air is colder than the skin, thus increasing the velocity of the air molecules' motion. Once the temperature of the air adjacent to the skin equals the temperature of the skin, no further loss of heat occurs in this way because now an equal amount of heat is conducted from the air to the body. Therefore, conduction of heat from the body to the air is self-limited unless the heated air moves away from the skin, so new, unheated air is continually brought in contact with the skin, a phenomenon called air convection.

## Convective Heat Loss Results From Air Movement.

Heat from the skin is first conducted to the air and then carried away by the convection air currents.

A small amount of convection almost always occurs around the body because of the tendency for air adjacent to the skin to rise as it becomes heated. Therefore, in a nude person seated in a comfortable room without gross air movement, about $15 \%$ of his or her total heat loss occurs by conduction to the air and then by air convection away from the body.

Cooling Effect of Wind. When the body is exposed to wind, the layer of air immediately adjacent to the skin is replaced by new air much more rapidly than is normal,
![gu4358052264](gu4358052264.jpg)

Figure 74-4. Mechanisms of heat loss from the body.
and heat loss by convection increases accordingly. The cooling effect of wind at low velocities is about proportional to the square root of the wind velocity. For example, a wind of 4 miles per hour is about twice as effective for cooling as a wind of 1 mile per hour.

## Conduction and Convection of Heat From a Person

Suspended in Water. Water has a specific heat several thousand times as great as that of air, so each unit portion of water adjacent to the skin can absorb far greater quantities of heat than can be absorbed by air. Also, heat conductivity in water is very great in comparison with that in air. Consequently, it is impossible for the body to heat a thin layer of water next to the body to form an "insulator zone" as occurs in air. Therefore, if the temperature of the water is below body temperature the rate of heat loss to water is usually many times greater than the rate of heat loss to air.

## Evaporation

When water evaporates from the body surface, 0.58 Calorie (kilocalorie) of heat is lost for each gram of water that evaporates. Even when a person is not sweating, water still evaporates insensibly from the skin and lungs at a rate of about 600 to $700 \mathrm{ml} /$ day. This insensible evaporation causes continual heat loss at a rate of 16 to 19 Calories per hour. Insensible evaporation through the skin and lungs cannot be controlled for purposes of temperature regulation because it results from continual diffusion of water molecules through the skin and respiratory surfaces. However, loss of heat by evaporation of sweat can be controlled by regulating the rate of sweating, which is discussed later in this chapter.

Evaporation is a Necessary Cooling Mechanism at Very High Air Temperatures. As long as skin temperature is greater than the temperature of the surroundings, heat can be lost by radiation and conduction. However, when the temperature of the surroundings becomes greater than that of the skin, instead of losing heat, the body gains heat by both radiation and conduction. Under these conditions, the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation.

Therefore, anything that prevents adequate evaporation when the surrounding temperature is higher than the skin temperature will cause the internal body temperature to rise. This phenomenon occurs occasionally in human beings who are born with congenital absence of sweat glands. These people can tolerate cold temperatures as well as normal people can, but they can become severely stressed and die of heatstroke in tropical zones because, without the evaporative refrigeration system, they cannot prevent a rise in body temperature when the air temperature is greater than that of the body.

Clothing Reduces Conductive and Convective Heat Loss. Clothing entraps air next to the skin in the weave of the cloth, thereby increasing the thickness of the so-called

private zone of air adjacent to the skin and decreasing the flow of convection air currents. Consequently, the rate of heat loss from the body by conduction and convection is greatly depressed. A usual suit of clothes decreases the rate of heat loss to about half that from the nude body, but arctic-type clothing can decrease this heat loss to as little as one sixth.

About half the heat transmitted from the skin to the clothing is radiated to the clothing instead of being conducted across the small intervening space. Therefore, coating the inside of clothing with a thin layer of metal, such as silver or gold, which reflects radiant heat back to the body, makes the insulating properties of clothing far more effective than otherwise. By using this technique, clothing for use in the arctic can be decreased in weight by about half.

The effectiveness of clothing in maintaining body temperature is almost completely lost when the clothing becomes wet because the high conductivity of water increases the rate of heat transmission through cloth 20fold or more. Therefore, one of the most important factors for protecting the body against cold in arctic regions is extreme caution against allowing the clothing to become wet. Indeed, one must be careful not to become overheated even temporarily because sweating in one's clothes makes them much less effective thereafter as an insulator.

## Sweating and Its Regulation by the Autonomic Nervous System

Stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus-preoptic area in the brain either electrically or by excess heat causes sweating. The nerve impulses from this area that cause sweating are transmitted in the autonomic pathways to the spinal cord and then through sympathetic outflow to the skin.

It should be recalled from the discussion of the autonomic nervous system in Chapter 61 that the sweat glands are innervated by cholinergic nerve fibers (fibers that secrete acetylcholine but that run in the sympathetic nerves along with the adrenergic fibers). These glands can also be stimulated to some extent by epinephrine or norepinephrine circulating in the blood, even though the glands themselves do not have adrenergic innervation. This mechanism is important during exercise, when these hormones are secreted by the adrenal medullae and the body needs to lose excessive amounts of heat produced by the active muscles.

Mechanism of Sweat Secretion. In Figure 74-5, the sweat gland is shown to be a tubular structure consisting of two parts: (1) a deep subdermal coiled portion that secretes the sweat, and (2) a duct portion that passes outward through the dermis and epidermis of the skin. As is true of so many other glands, the secretory portion of the sweat gland secretes a fluid called the primary secretion or precursor secretion; the concentrations of constituents in the fluid are then modified as the fluid flows through the duct.
![gu4458052264](gu4458052264.jpg)

Figure 74-5. Sweat gland innervated by an acetylcholine-secreting sympathetic nerve. A primary protein-free secretion is formed by the glandular portion, but most of the electrolytes are reabsorbed in the duct, leaving a dilute, watery secretion.

The precursor secretion is an active secretory product of the epithelial cells lining the coiled portion of the sweat gland. Cholinergic sympathetic nerve fibers ending on or near the glandular cells elicit the secretion.

The composition of the precursor secretion is similar to that of plasma, except that it does not contain plasma proteins. The concentration of sodium is about $142 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, and that of chloride is about $104 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, with much smaller concentrations of the other solutes of plasma. As this precursor solution flows through the duct portion of the gland, it is modified by reabsorption of most of the sodium and chloride ions. The degree of this reabsorption depends on the rate of sweating.

When the sweat glands are stimulated only slightly, the precursor fluid passes through the duct slowly. In this case, essentially all the sodium and chloride ions are reabsorbed, and the concentration of each falls to as low as $5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. This process reduces the osmotic pressure of the sweat fluid to such a low level that most of the water is also reabsorbed, which concentrates most of the other constituents. Therefore, at low rates of sweating, such constituents as urea, lactic acid, and potassium ions are usually very concentrated.

Conversely, when the sweat glands are strongly stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system, large amounts of precursor secretion are formed, and the duct may reabsorb only slightly more than half the sodium chloride; the concentrations of sodium and chloride ions are then (in an unacclimatized person) a maximum of about 50 to $60 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, slightly less than half the concentrations in plasma. Furthermore, the sweat flows through the glandular tubules so rapidly that little of the water is reabsorbed. Therefore, the other dissolved constituents of sweat are only moderately increased in concentration; urea is about twice that in the plasma, lactic acid about 4 times, and potassium about 1.2 times.

A significant loss of sodium chloride occurs in the sweat when a person is unacclimatized to heat. Much less electrolyte loss occurs, despite increased sweating capacity, once a person has become acclimatized.

Acclimatization of the Sweating Mechanism to Heat-The Role of Aldosterone. Although a normal, unacclimatized person seldom produces more than about 1 liter of sweat per hour, when this person is exposed to hot weather for 1 to 6 weeks, he or she begins to sweat more profusely, often increasing maximum sweat production to as much as 2 to $3 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{hr}$. Evaporation of this much sweat can remove heat from the body at a rate more than 10 times the normal basal rate of heat production. This increased effectiveness of the sweating mechanism is caused by a change in the internal sweat gland cells to increase their sweating capability.

Also associated with acclimatization is a further decrease in the concentration of sodium chloride in the sweat, which allows progressively better conservation of body salt. Most of this effect is caused by increased secretion of aldosterone by the adrenocortical glands, which results from a slight decrease in sodium chloride concentration in the extracellular fluid and plasma. An unacclimatized person who sweats profusely often loses 15 to 30 grams of salt each day for the first few days. After 4 to 6 weeks of acclimatization, the loss is usually 3 to $5 \mathrm{~g} /$ day.

## Loss of Heat by Panting

Many animals have little ability to lose heat from the surfaces of their bodies, for two reasons: (1) the surfaces are often covered with fur, and (2) the skin of most animals is not supplied with sweat glands, which prevents most of the evaporative loss of heat from the skin. A substitute mechanism, the panting mechanism, is used by many animals as a means of dissipating heat.

The phenomenon of panting is "turned on" by the thermoregulator centers of the brain. That is, when the blood becomes overheated, the hypothalamus initiates neurogenic signals to decrease the body temperature. One of these signals initiates panting. The actual panting process is controlled by a panting center that is associated with the pneumotaxic respiratory center located in the pons.

When an animal pants, it breathes in and out rapidly, and thus large quantities of new air from the exterior come in contact with the upper portions of the respiratory passages. This mechanism cools the blood in the respiratory
passage mucosa as a result of water evaporation from the mucosal surfaces, especially evaporation of saliva from the tongue. Yet, panting does not increase the alveolar ventilation more than is required for proper control of the blood gases because each breath is extremely shallow; therefore, most of the air that enters the alveoli is dead-space air mainly from the trachea and not from the atmosphere.

## REGULATION OF BODY TEMPERATURE-ROLE OF THE HYPOTHALAMUS

Figure 74-6 shows what happens to the body "core" temperature of a nude person after a few hours' exposure to $d r y$ air ranging from $30^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to $160^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. The precise dimensions of this curve depend on the wind movement of the air, the amount of moisture in the air, and even the nature of the surroundings. In general, a nude person in dry air between $55^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ and $130^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ is capable of maintaining a normal body core temperature somewhere between $97^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ and $100^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

The temperature of the body is regulated almost entirely by nervous feedback mechanisms, and almost all these mechanisms operate through temperatureregulating centers located in the hypothalamus. For these feedback mechanisms to operate, there must also be temperature detectors to determine when body temperature becomes either too high or too low.

## ROLE OF THE ANTERIOR HYPOTHALAMICPREOPTIC AREA IN THERMOSTATIC DETECTION OF TEMPERATURE

The anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area contains large numbers of heat-sensitive neurons, as well as about onethird as many cold-sensitive neurons. These neurons are believed to function as temperature sensors for controlling body temperature. The heat-sensitive neurons increase their firing rate 2 - to 10 -fold in response to a $10^{\circ}-\mathrm{C}$ increase in body temperature. The cold-sensitive neurons, by contrast, increase their firing rate when body temperature falls.
![gu4558052264](gu4558052264.jpg)

Figure 74-6. Effect of high and low atmospheric temperatures of several hours' duration, under dry conditions, on the internal body core temperature (in ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ). Note that the internal body temperature remains stable, despite wide changes in atmospheric temperature.

When the preoptic area is heated, the skin all over the body immediately breaks out in a profuse sweat, whereas the skin blood vessels over the entire body become greatly dilated. This response is an immediate reaction to cause the body to lose heat, thereby helping to return the body temperature toward the normal level. In addition, any excess body heat production is inhibited. Therefore, it is clear that the hypothalamic-preoptic area has the capability to serve as a thermostatic body temperature control center.

## DETECTION OF TEMPERATURE BY RECEPTORS IN THE SKIN AND DEEP BODY TISSUES

Although the signals generated by the temperature receptors of the hypothalamus are extremely powerful in controlling body temperature, receptors in other parts of the body play additional roles in temperature regulation. This is especially true of temperature receptors in the skin and in a few specific deep tissues of the body.

Recall from the discussion of sensory receptors in Chapter 49 that the skin is endowed with both cold and warmth receptors. The skin has far more cold receptors than warmth receptors-in fact, 10 times as many in many parts of the skin. Therefore, peripheral detection of temperature mainly concerns detecting cool and cold instead of warm temperatures.

Although the molecular mechanisms for sensing changes in temperature are not well understood, experimental studies suggest that the transient receptor potential family of cation channels, found in somatosensory neurons and epidermal cells, may mediate thermal sensation over a wide range of skin temperatures.

When the skin is chilled over the entire body, immediate reflex effects are invoked and begin to increase the temperature of the body in several ways: (1) by providing a strong stimulus to cause shivering, with a resultant increase in the rate of body heat production; (2) by inhibiting sweating, if this is already occurring; and (3) by promoting skin vasoconstriction to diminish loss of body heat from the skin.

Deep body temperature receptors are found mainly in the spinal cord, in the abdominal viscera, and in or around the great veins in the upper abdomen and thorax. These deep receptors function differently from the skin receptors because they are exposed to the body core temperature rather than the body surface temperature. Yet, like the skin temperature receptors, they detect mainly cold rather than warmth. It is probable that both the skin and the deep body receptors are concerned with preventing hypothermia-that is, preventing low body temperature.

## POSTERIOR HYPOTHALAMUS INTEGRATES CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL TEMPERATURE SENSORY SIGNALS

Even though many temperature sensory signals arise in peripheral receptors, these signals contribute to body
temperature control mainly through the hypothalamus. The area of the hypothalamus that they stimulate is located bilaterally in the posterior hypothalamus approximately at the level of the mammillary bodies. The temperature sensory signals from the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area are also transmitted into this posterior hypothalamic area. Here the signals from the preoptic area and the signals from elsewhere in the body are combined and integrated to control the heat-producing and heat-conserving reactions of the body.

## NEURONAL EFFECTOR MECHANISMS THAT DECREASE OR INCREASE BODY TEMPERATURE

When the hypothalamic temperature centers detect that the body temperature is either too high or too low, they institute appropriate temperature-decreasing or temperature-increasing procedures. The reader is probably familiar with most of these procedures from personal experience, but special features are described in the following sections.

## Temperature-Decreasing Mechanisms When the Body Is Too Hot

The temperature control system uses three important mechanisms to reduce body heat when the body temperature becomes too great:

1. Vasodilation of skin blood vessels. In almost all areas of the body, the skin blood vessels become intensely dilated. This dilation is caused by inhibition of the sympathetic centers in the posterior hypothalamus that cause vasoconstriction. Full vasodilation can increase the rate of heat transfer to the skin as much as eightfold.
2. Sweating. The effect of increased body temperature to cause sweating is demonstrated by the blue curve in Figure 74-7, which shows a sharp increase in the rate of evaporative heat loss resulting from sweating when the body core temperature rises above the critical level of $37.1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(98.8^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. An additional $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ increase in body temperature causes enough sweating to remove 10 times the basal rate of body heat production.
3. Decrease in heat production. The mechanisms that cause excess heat production, such as shivering and chemical thermogenesis, are strongly inhibited.

## Temperature-Increasing Mechanisms When the Body Is Too Cold

When the body is too cold, the temperature control system institutes procedures opposite of those when the body is too hot:

1. Skin vasoconstriction throughout the body. This vasoconstriction is caused by stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic sympathetic centers.
2. Piloerection. Piloerection means hairs "standing on end." Sympathetic stimulation causes the arrector

![gu4658052264](gu4658052264.jpg)

Figure 74-7. Effect of hypothalamic temperature on evaporative heat loss from the body and on heat production caused primarily by muscle activity and shivering (in ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). This figure demonstrates the extremely critical temperature level at which increased heat loss begins and heat production reaches a minimum stable level.
pili muscles attached to the hair follicles to contract, which brings the hairs to an upright stance and produces "goose bumps" on the skin at the base of the hairs. This mechanism is not important in human beings, but in many animals, upright projection of the hairs allows them to entrap a thick layer of "insulator air" next to the skin, so transfer of heat to the surroundings is greatly depressed.
3. Increase in thermogenesis (heat production). Heat production by the metabolic systems is increased by promoting shivering, sympathetic excitation of heat production, and thyroxine secretion. These methods of increasing heat require additional explanation, which is provided in the following sections.

Hypothalamic Stimulation of Shivering. Located in the dorsomedial portion of the posterior hypothalamus near the wall of the third ventricle is an area called the primary motor center for shivering. This area is normally inhibited by signals from the heat center in the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area but is excited by cold signals from the skin and spinal cord. Therefore, as shown by the sudden increase in "heat production" (see the red curve in Figure 74-7), this center becomes activated when the body temperature falls even a fraction of a degree below a critical temperature level. It then transmits signals that cause shivering through bilateral tracts down the brain stem, into the lateral columns of the spinal cord, and finally to the anterior motor neurons. These signals are nonrhythmic and do not cause the actual muscle shaking. Instead, they increase the tone of the skeletal muscles throughout the body by facilitating the activity of the anterior motor neurons. When the tone rises above a certain critical level, shivering begins. This reaction probably
results from feedback oscillation of the muscle spindle stretch reflex mechanism, which is discussed in Chapter 55. During maximum shivering, body heat production can rise to four to five times normal.

Sympathetic "Chemical" Excitation of Heat Production. As noted in Chapter 73, an increase in either sympathetic stimulation or circulating norepinephrine and epinephrine in the blood can rapidly increase the rate of cellular metabolism. This effect is called chemical thermogenesis, or nonshivering thermogenesis. It results at least partially from the ability of norepinephrine and epinephrine to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, which means that excess foodstuffs are oxidized and thereby release energy in the form of heat but do not cause adenosine triphosphate to be formed.

The degree of chemical thermogenesis that occurs in an animal is almost directly proportional to the amount of brown fat in the animal's tissues. This type of fat contains large numbers of special mitochondria where uncoupled oxidation occurs, as described in Chapter 73. Brown fat is richly supplied with sympathetic nerves that release norepinephrine, which stimulates tissue expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1, also called thermogenin) and increases thermogenesis.

Acclimatization greatly affects the intensity of chemical thermogenesis; some animals, such as rats, that have been exposed to a cold environment for several weeks exhibit a $100 \%$ to $500 \%$ increase in heat production when acutely exposed to cold, in contrast to the unacclimatized animal, which responds with an increase of perhaps onethird as much. This increased thermogenesis also leads to a corresponding increase in food intake.

In adult human beings, who have almost no brown fat, it is rare for chemical thermogenesis to increase the rate of heat production more than $10 \%$ to $15 \%$. However, in infants, who do have a small amount of brown fat in their interscapular space, chemical thermogenesis can increase the rate of heat production $100 \%$, which is probably an important factor in maintaining normal body temperature in neonates.

Increased Thyroxine Output as a Long-Term Cause of Increased Heat Production. Cooling the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area also increases production of the neurosecretory hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus. This hormone is carried by way of the hypothalamic portal veins to the anterior pituitary gland, where it stimulates secretion of thyroidstimulating hormone.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone in turn stimulates increased output of thyroxine by the thyroid gland, as explained in Chapter 77. The increased thyroxine activates uncoupling protein and increases the rate of cellular metabolism throughout the body, which is yet another mechanism of chemical thermogenesis. This increase in metabolism does not occur immediately but requires several weeks' exposure to cold to make the thyroid gland hypertrophy and reach its new level of thyroxine secretion.

Exposure of animals to extreme cold for several weeks can cause their thyroid glands to increase in size $20 \%$ to $40 \%$. However, human beings seldom allow themselves to be exposed to the same degree of cold as that to which many animals are often subjected. Therefore, we still do not know, quantitatively, how important the thyroid mechanism of adaptation to cold is in the human being.

Isolated measurements have shown that metabolic rates increase in military personnel residing for several months in the arctic; some of the Inuit, the indigenous people who inhabit the Arctic regions of Alaska, Canada, or Greenland, also have abnormally high basal metabolic rates. Further, the continuous stimulatory effect of cold on the thyroid gland may explain the much higher incidence of toxic thyroid goiters in people who live in cold climates than in those who live in warm climates.

## "SET POINT" FOR TEMPERATURE CONTROL

In the example of Figure 74-7, it is clear that at a critical body core temperature of about $37.1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(98.8^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, drastic changes occur in the rates of both heat loss and heat production. At temperatures above this level, the rate of heat loss is greater than that of heat production, so the body temperature falls and approaches the $37.1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ level. At temperatures below this level, the rate of heat production is greater than that of heat loss, so the body temperature rises and again approaches the $37.1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ level. This crucial temperature level is called the "set point" of the temperature control mechanism-that is, all the temperature control mechanisms continually attempt to bring the body temperature back to this set point level.

Feedback Gain for Body Temperature Control. As discussed in Chapter 1, feedback gain is a measure of the effectiveness of a control system. In the case of body temperature control, it is important for the internal core temperature to change as little as possible, even though the environmental temperature might change greatly from day to day or even hour to hour. The feedback gain of the temperature control system is equal to the ratio of the change in environmental temperature to the change in body core temperature minus 1.0 (see Chapter 1 for this formula). Experiments have shown that the body temperature of humans changes about $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for each $25^{\circ}-$ to $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$-change in environmental temperature. Therefore, the feedback gain of the total mechanism for body temperature control averages about $27(28 / 1.0-1.0=27)$, which is an extremely high gain for a biological control system (the baroreceptor arterial pressure control system, by comparison, has a feedback gain of $<2$ ).

## Skin Temperature Can Slightly Alter the Set Point for Core Temperature Control

The critical temperature set point in the hypothalamus above which sweating begins and below which shivering begins is determined mainly by the degree of activity of the

Figure 74-8. Effect of changes in the internal head temperature on the rate of evaporative heat loss from the body (in ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). Note that the skin temperature determines the set point level at which sweating begins. (Courtesy Dr. T.H. Benzinger.)
heat temperature receptors in the anterior hypothalamicpreoptic area. However, temperature signals from the peripheral areas of the body, especially from the skin and certain deep body tissues (e.g., spinal cord and abdominal viscera), also contribute slightly to body temperature regulation by altering the set point of the hypothalamic temperature control center. This effect is shown in Figures 74-8 and 74-9.

Figure 74-8 demonstrates the effect of different skin temperatures on the set point for sweating, showing that the set point increases as skin temperature decreases. Thus, for the person represented in this figure, the hypothalamic set point increased from $36.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ when the skin temperature was higher than $33^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to a set point of $37.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ when the skin temperature had fallen to $29^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Therefore, when the skin temperature was high, sweating began at a lower hypothalamic temperature than when the skin temperature was low. One can readily understand the value of such a system because it is important that sweating be inhibited when the skin temperature is low; otherwise, the combined effect of low skin temperature and sweating could cause far too much loss of body heat.

A similar effect occurs in shivering, as shown in Figure 74-9. That is, when the skin becomes cold, it drives the hypothalamic centers to the shivering threshold even when the hypothalamic temperature is still on the hot side of normal. Here again, one can understand the value of the control system because a cold skin temperature would soon lead to a deeply depressed body temperature unless heat production were increased. Thus, a cold skin temperature actually "anticipates" a fall in internal body temperature and prevents it.

## BEHAVIORAL CONTROL OF BODY TEMPERATURE

Aside from the subconscious mechanisms for body temperature control, the body has another temperaturecontrol mechanism that is even more potent-behavioral control of temperature.

Whenever the internal body temperature becomes too high, signals from the temperature-controlling areas in the brain give the person a psychic sensation of being overheated. Conversely, whenever the body becomes too cold, signals from the skin and probably also from some deep body receptors elicit the feeling of cold discomfort. Therefore, the person makes appropriate environmental adjustments to re-establish comfort, such as moving into a heated room or wearing wellinsulated clothing in freezing weather. Behavioral control of temperature is the only really effective mechanism to maintain body heat control in severely cold environments.

## Local Skin Temperature Reflexes

When a person places a foot under a hot lamp and leaves it there for a short time, local vasodilation and mild local sweating occur. Conversely, placing the foot in cold water causes local vasoconstriction and local cessation of sweating. These reactions are caused by local effects of temperature directly on the blood vessels and also by local cord reflexes conducted from skin receptors to the spinal cord and back to the same skin area and the sweat glands. The intensity of these local effects is, in addition, controlled by the central brain temperature controller, so their overall effect is proportional to the hypothalamic heat control signal times the local signal. Such reflexes can help prevent excessive heat exchange from locally cooled or heated portions of the body.

Figure 74-10. Body temperatures under different conditions. (Modified from DuBois EF: Fever. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas, 1948.)

Regulation of Internal Body Temperature Is Impaired by Cutting the Spinal Cord. If the spinal cord is severed in the neck above the sympathetic outflow from the cord, regulation of body temperature becomes extremely poor because the hypothalamus can no longer control either skin blood flow or the degree of sweating anywhere in the body. This is true even though the local temperature reflexes originating in the skin, spinal cord, and intra-abdominal receptors still exist. These reflexes are extremely weak in comparison with hypothalamic control of body temperature.

In people with this condition, body temperature must be regulated principally by the patient's psychic response to cold and hot sensations in the head region-that is, by behavioral control of clothing and by moving into an appropriate warm or cold environment.

## ABNORMALITIES OF BODY TEMPERATURE REGULATION

## FEVER

Fever, which means a body temperature above the usual range of normal, can be caused by abnormalities in the brain or by toxic substances that affect the temperatureregulating centers. Some causes of fever (and also of subnormal body temperatures) are presented in Figure 74-10. They include bacterial or viral infections, brain tumors, and environmental conditions that may terminate in heatstroke.

## Resetting the Hypothalamic TemperatureRegulating Center in Febrile DiseasesEffect of Pyrogens

Many proteins, breakdown products of proteins, and certain other substances, especially lipopolysaccharide toxins released from bacterial cell membranes, can cause the set point of the hypothalamic thermostat to rise. Substances that cause this effect are called pyrogens.

![gu5058052264](gu5058052264.jpg)

Figure 74-11. Effects of changing the set point of the hypothalamic temperature controller.

Pyrogens released from toxic bacteria or those released from degenerating body tissues cause fever during disease conditions. When the set point of the hypothalamic temperature-regulating center becomes higher than normal, all the mechanisms for raising the body temperature are brought into play, including heat conservation and increased heat production. Within a few hours after the set point has been increased, the body temperature also approaches this level, as shown in Figure 74-11.

Mechanism of Action of Pyrogens in Causing FeverRole of Cytokines. Experiments in animals have shown that some pyrogens, when injected into the hypothalamus, can act directly and immediately on the hypothalamic temperature-regulating center to increase its set point. Other pyrogens function indirectly and may require several hours of latency before causing their effects. This is true of many of the bacterial pyrogens, especially the endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria.

When bacteria or breakdown products of bacteria are present in the tissues or in the blood, they are phagocytized by the blood leukocytes, by tissue macrophages, and by large granular killer lymphocytes, as discussed in Chapter 34. All these cells digest the bacterial products and then release cytokines, a diverse group of peptidesignaling molecules involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses. One of the most important of these cytokines in causing fever is interleukin-1 (IL-1), also called leukocyte pyrogen or endogenous pyrogen. IL-1 is released from macrophages into the body fluids and, upon reaching the hypothalamus, almost immediately activates the processes to produce fever, sometimes increasing the body temperature a noticeable amount in only 8 to 10 minutes. As little as one ten-millionth of a gram of endotoxin lipopolysaccharide from bacteria, acting in concert with the blood leukocytes, tissue macrophages, and killer lymphocytes, can cause fever. The amount of IL-1 that is formed in response to lipopolysaccharide to cause fever is only a few nanograms.

Several experiments have suggested that IL-1 causes fever by first inducing formation of one of the prostaglandins, mainly prostaglandin $\mathrm{E}_{2}$, or a similar substance, which acts in the hypothalamus to elicit the fever reaction. When prostaglandin formation is blocked by drugs, the fever is either completely abrogated or at least reduced. In fact, this may be the explanation for the manner in which aspirin reduces fever because aspirin impedes the formation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. Drugs such as aspirin that reduce fever are called antipyretics.

Fever Caused by Brain Lesions. When a brain surgeon operates in the region of the hypothalamus, severe fever almost always occurs; rarely, the opposite effect, hypothermia, occurs, demonstrating both the potency of the hypothalamic mechanisms for body temperature control and the ease with which abnormalities of the hypothalamus can alter the set point of temperature control. Another condition that frequently causes prolonged high temperature is compression of the hypothalamus by a brain tumor.

## Characteristics of Febrile Conditions

Chills. When the set point of the hypothalamic temperature-control center is suddenly changed from the normal level to higher than normal (as a result of tissue destruction, pyrogenic substances, or dehydration), the body temperature usually takes several hours to reach the new temperature set point.

Figure 74-11 demonstrates the effect of suddenly increasing the temperature set point to a level of $103^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Because the blood temperature is now less than the set point of the hypothalamic temperature controller, the usual responses that cause elevation of body temperature occur. During this period, the person experiences chills and feels extremely cold, even though his or her body temperature may already be above normal. Also, the skin becomes cold because of vasoconstriction and the person shivers. Chills can continue until the body temperature reaches the hypothalamic set point of $103^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Then the person no longer experiences chills but instead feels neither cold nor hot. As long as the factor that is causing the higher set point of the hypothalamic temperature controller is present, the body temperature is regulated more or less in the normal manner, but at the high temperature set point level.

Crisis, or "Flush." If the factor that is causing the high temperature is removed, the set point of the hypothalamic temperature controller will be reduced to a lower valueperhaps even back to the normal level, as shown in Figure 74-11. In this case, the body temperature is still $103^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, but the hypothalamus is attempting to regulate the temperature to $98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. This situation is analogous to excessive heating of the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area, which causes intense sweating and the sudden development of hot skin because of vasodilation everywhere. This sudden change of events in a febrile state is known as the "crisis" or, more appropriately, the "flush." In the days before the advent of antibiotics, the crisis was always anxiously awaited because once this occurred, the doctor assumed that the patient's temperature would soon begin falling.

## Heatstroke

The upper limit of air temperature that one can stand depends to a great extent on whether the air is dry or wet. If the air is dry and sufficient convection air currents are flowing to promote rapid evaporation from the body, a person can withstand several hours of air temperature at $130^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Conversely, if the air is $100 \%$ humidified or if the body is in water, the body temperature begins to rise whenever the environmental temperature rises above about $94^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. If the person is performing heavy work, the critical environmental temperature above which heatstroke is likely to occur may be as low as $85^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to $90^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

When the body temperature rises beyond a critical temperature, into the range of $105^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to $108^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, heatstroke is likely to develop. The symptoms include dizziness, abdominal distress, sometimes accompanied by vomiting, sometimes delirium, and eventually loss of consciousness if the body temperature is not soon decreased. These symptoms are often exacerbated by a degree of circulatory shock brought on by excessive loss of fluid and electrolytes in the sweat.

The hyperpyrexia is also exceedingly damaging to the body tissues, especially the brain, and is responsible for many of the effects. In fact, even a few minutes of very high body temperature can sometimes be fatal. For this reason, some authorities recommend immediate treatment of heatstroke by placing the person in a cold-water bath. Because a cold-water bath often induces uncontrollable shivering, with a considerable increase in the rate of heat production, a muscle relaxant may be administered in some cases. Others have suggested that sponge or spray cooling of the skin along with blowing cool air over the moist skin may be more effective and more practical for rapidly decreasing the body core temperature.

Harmful Effects of High Temperature. The pathological findings in a person who dies of hyperpyrexia are local hemorrhages and parenchymatous degeneration of cells throughout the entire body, but especially in the brain. Once neuronal cells are destroyed, they can never be replaced. Also, damage to the liver, kidneys, and other organs can often be severe enough that failure of one or more of these organs eventually causes death, but sometimes not until several days after the heatstroke occurs.

Acclimatization to Heat. It can be extremely important to acclimatize people to extreme heat. Examples of people requiring acclimatization are soldiers on duty in the tropics and miners working in the 2-mile-deep gold mines of South Africa, where the temperature approaches body temperature and the humidity approaches $100 \%$. A person exposed to heat for several hours each day while performing a reasonably heavy workload will develop increased tolerance to hot and humid conditions in 1 to 3 weeks.

Among the most important physiological changes that occur during this acclimatization process are an approximately twofold increase in the maximum rate of sweating, an increase in plasma volume, and diminished loss of salt in the sweat and urine to almost none; the last two effects result from increased secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal glands.

## Exposure of the Body to Extreme Cold

Unless treated immediately, a person exposed to ice water for 20 to 30 minutes ordinarily dies because of heart standstill or heart fibrillation. By that time, the internal
body temperature will have fallen to about $77^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. If warmed rapidly by the application of external heat, the person's life can often be saved.

## Loss of Temperature Regulation at Low Temperatures.

As noted in Figure 74-10, once the body temperature has fallen below about $85^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, the ability of the hypothalamus to regulate temperature is lost; it is greatly impaired even when the body temperature falls below about $94^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Part of the reason for this diminished temperature regulation is that the rate of chemical heat production in each cell is depressed almost twofold for each $10^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ decrease in body temperature. Also, sleepiness develops (later followed by coma), which depresses the activity of the central nervous system heat control mechanisms and prevents shivering.

Frostbite. When the body is exposed to extremely low temperatures, surface areas can freeze, which is a phenomenon called frostbite. Frostbite occurs especially in the lobes of the ears and in the digits of the hands and feet. If the freeze has been sufficient to cause extensive formation of ice crystals in the cells, permanent damage usually results, such as permanent circulatory impairment and local tissue damage. Gangrene often follows thawing, and the frostbitten areas must be removed surgically.

Cold-Induced Vasodilation Is a Final Protection Against Frostbite at Almost Freezing Temperatures. When the temperature of tissues falls almost to freezing, the smooth muscle in the vascular wall becomes paralyzed because of the cold, and sudden vasodilation occurs, often manifested by a flush of the skin. This mechanism helps prevent frostbite by delivering warm blood to the skin. This mechanism is far less developed in humans than in most animals that live in the cold all the time.

Artificial Hypothermia. It is easy to decrease the temperature of a person by first administering a strong sedative to depress the reactivity of the hypothalamic temperature controller and then cooling the person with ice or cooling blankets until the temperature falls. The temperature can then be maintained below $90^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ for several days to a week or more by continual sprinkling of cool water or alcohol on the body. Such artificial cooling has been used during heart surgery so that the heart can be stopped artificially for many minutes at a time. Cooling to this extent does not cause tissue damage, but it does slow the heart and greatly depresses cell metabolism so that the body's cells can survive 30 minutes to more than 1 hour without blood flow during the surgical procedure.

# Introduction to Endocrinology 

## COORDINATION OF BODY FUNCTIONS BY CHEMICAL MESSENGERS

The multiple activities of the cells, tissues, and organs of the body are coordinated by the interplay of several types of chemical messenger systems:

1. Neurotransmitters are released by axon terminals of neurons into the synaptic junctions and act locally to control nerve cell functions.
2. Endocrine hormones are released by glands or specialized cells into the circulating blood and influence the function of target cells at another location in the body.
3. Neuroendocrine hormones are secreted by neurons into the circulating blood and influence the function of target cells at another location in the body.
4. Paracrines are secreted by cells into the extracellular fluid and affect neighboring target cells of a different type.
5. Autocrines are secreted by cells into the extracellular fluid and affect the function of the same cells that produced them.
6. Cytokines are peptides secreted by cells into the extracellular fluid and can function as autocrines, paracrines, or endocrine hormones. Examples of cytokines include the interleukins and other lymphokines that are secreted by helper cells and act on other cells of the immune system (see Chapter 35). Cytokine hormones (e.g., leptin) produced by adipocytes are sometimes called adipokines.
In the next few chapters, we discuss mainly the endocrine and neuroendocrine hormone systems, keeping in mind that many of the body's chemical messenger systems interact with one another to maintain homeostasis. For example, the adrenal medullae and the pituitary gland secrete their hormones primarily in response to neural stimuli. The neuroendocrine cells, located in the hypothalamus, have axons that terminate in the posterior pituitary gland and median eminence and secrete several neurohormones, including antidiuretic hormone, oxytocin, and hypophysiotropic hormones, which control the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones.

The endocrine hormones are carried by the circulatory system to cells throughout the body, including the nervous system in some cases, where they bind with receptors and initiate many cell reactions. Some endocrine hormones affect many different types of cells of the body; for example, growth hormone from the anterior pituitary gland causes growth in most parts of the body, and thyroxine from the thyroid gland increases the rate of many chemical reactions in almost all the body's cells.

Other hormones affect mainly specific target tissues because these tissues have abundant receptors for the hormone. For example, adrenocorticotropic hormone from the anterior pituitary gland specifically stimulates the adrenal cortex, causing it to secrete adrenocortical hormones, and the ovarian hormones have their main effects on the female sex organs and the secondary sexual characteristics of the female body.

Figure 75-1 shows the anatomical loci of the major endocrine glands and endocrine tissues of the body, except for the placenta, which is an additional source of the sex hormones. Table 75-1 provides an overview of the different hormone systems and their major actions.

The multiple hormone systems play a key role in regulating almost all body functions, including metabolism, growth and development, water and electrolyte balance, reproduction, and behavior. For example, without growth hormone, a person would have very short stature. Without thyroxine and triiodothyronine from the thyroid gland, almost all the chemical reactions of the body would become sluggish and the person would become sluggish as well. Without insulin from the pancreas, the body's cells could use little of the food carbohydrates for energy. And without the sex hormones, sexual development and sexual functions would be absent.

## CHEMICAL STRUCTURE AND SYNTHESIS OF HORMONES

Three general classes of hormones exist:

1. Proteins and polypeptides, including hormones secreted by the anterior and posterior pituitary gland, the pancreas (insulin and glucagon), the parathyroid
