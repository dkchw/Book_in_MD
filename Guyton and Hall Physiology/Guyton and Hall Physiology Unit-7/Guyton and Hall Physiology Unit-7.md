# Red Blood Cells, Anemia, and Polycythemia 

In this chapter, we begin discussing the blood cells and cells of the macrophage system and lymphatic system. We first present the functions of red blood cells (RBCs), which are the most abundant cells of the blood and are necessary for the delivery of oxygen to the tissues.

## RED BLOOD CELLS (ERYTHROCYTES)

A major function of RBCs, also known as erythrocytes, is to transport hemoglobin, which, in turn, carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. In some animals, including many invertebrates, hemoglobin circulates as free protein in the circulatory fluids and is not enclosed in RBCs. When it is free in human plasma, about $3 \%$ of it leaks through the capillary membrane into the tissue spaces or through the glomerular membrane of the kidney into the glomerular filtrate each time the blood passes through the capillaries. Therefore, hemoglobin must remain inside RBCs to perform its functions in humans effectively.

The RBCs have other functions besides transport of hemoglobin. For example, they contain a large quantity of carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reaction between carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ and water to form carbonic acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$, increasing the rate of this reaction several thousandfold. The rapidity of this reaction makes it possible for the water of the blood to transport enormous quantities of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the form of bicarbonate ion $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$from the tissues to the lungs, where it is reconverted to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and expelled into the atmosphere as a body waste product. The hemoglobin in the cells is an excellent acid-base buffer (as is true of most proteins), so the RBCs are responsible for most of the acid-base buffering power of whole blood.

Shape and Size of Red Blood Cells. Normal RBCs, shown in Figure 33-3, are biconcave discs having a mean diameter of about 7.8 micrometers and a thickness of 2.5 micrometers at the thickest point and 1 micrometer or less in the center. The average volume of the RBC is 90 to 95 cubic micrometers.

The shapes of RBCs can change remarkably as the cells squeeze through capillaries. Actually, the RBC resembles a bag that can be deformed into almost any shape.

Furthermore, because the normal cell has a great excess of cell membrane for the quantity of material inside, deformation does not stretch the membrane greatly and, consequently, does not rupture the cell, as would be the case with many other cells.

Concentration of Red Blood Cells in the Blood. In healthy men, the average number of RBCs per cubic millimeter is $5,200,000( \pm 300,000)$; in healthy women, it is $4,700,000( \pm 300,000)$. Persons living at high altitudes have greater numbers of RBCs, as discussed later.

Quantity of Hemoglobin in the Cells. RBCs can concentrate hemoglobin in the cell fluid up to about 34 $\mathrm{g} / 100 \mathrm{ml}$ of cells. The concentration does not rise above this value because this is the metabolic limit of the cell's hemoglobin-forming mechanism. Furthermore, in normal people, the percentage of hemoglobin is almost always near the maximum in each cell. However, when hemoglobin formation is deficient, the percentage of hemoglobin in the cells may fall considerably below this value, and the volume of the RBC may also decrease because of diminished hemoglobin to fill the cell.

When the hematocrit (the percentage of blood that is comprised of cells-normally, $40 \%$ to $45 \%$ ) and the quantity of hemoglobin in each respective cell are normal, the whole blood of men contains an average of 15 g hemoglobin $/ 100 \mathrm{ml}$; for women, it contains an average of 14 g hemoglobin/ 100 ml .

As discussed in connection with blood transport of oxygen in Chapter 41, each gram of hemoglobin can combine with 1.34 ml of oxygen if the hemoglobin is $100 \%$ saturated. Therefore, in the average man, a maximum of about 20 milliliters of oxygen can be carried in combination with hemoglobin in each 100 milliliters of blood, and in woman 19 milliliters of oxygen can be carried.

## PRODUCTION OF RED BLOOD CELLS

Areas of the Body That Produce Red Blood Cells. In the early weeks of embryonic life, primitive nucleated RBCs are produced in the yolk sac. During the middle trimester of gestation, the liver is the main organ for RBC production but reasonable numbers are also produced in

the spleen and lymph nodes. Then, during the last month or so of gestation and after birth, RBCs are produced exclusively in the bone marrow.

As illustrated in Figure 33-1, the marrow of essentially all bones produces RBCs until a person is about 5 years old. The marrow of the long bones, except for the proximal portions of the humeri and tibiae, becomes fatty and produces no more RBCs after about the age of 20 years. Beyond this age, most RBCs continue to be produced in the marrow of the membranous bones, such as the vertebrae, sternum, ribs, and ilia. Even in these bones, the marrow becomes less productive as age increases.

## Genesis of Blood Cells

Multipotential Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Growth Inducers, and Differentiation Inducers. The blood cells begin their lives in the bone marrow from a single type of cell called the multipotential hematopoietic stem cell, from which all the cells of the circulating blood are eventually derived. Figure 33-2 shows the successive divisions of the multipotential cells to form the different circulating blood cells. As these cells reproduce, a small portion of them remains exactly like the original multipotential cells and is retained in the bone marrow to maintain their supply, although their numbers diminish with age. Most of the reproduced cells, however, differentiate to form the other cell types, shown at the right in Figure 33-2. The intermediatestage cells are very much like the multipotential stem cells, even though they have already become committed to a particular line of cells; these are called committed stem cells.

The different committed stem cells, when grown in culture, will produce colonies of specific types of blood cells. A committed stem cell that produces erythrocytes is called a colony-forming unit-erythrocyte, and the abbreviation CFU-E is used to designate this type of stem cell. Likewise, colony-forming units that form granulocytes and monocytes have the designation CFU-GM, and so forth.

Growth and reproduction of the different stem cells are controlled by multiple proteins called growth inducers.

Genesis of RBCs
![gu0377962137](gu0377962137.jpg)

Figure 33-3. Genesis of normal red blood cells (RBCs) and characteristics of RBCs in different types of anemias.

At least four major growth inducers have been described, each having different characteristics. One of these, interleukin-3, promotes growth and reproduction of virtually all the different types of committed stem cells, whereas the others induce growth of only specific types of cells.

The growth inducers promote growth but not differentiation of the cells, which is the function of another set of proteins called differentiation inducers. Each of these differentiation inducers causes one type of committed stem cell to differentiate one or more steps toward a final adult blood cell.

Formation of the growth inducers and differentiation inducers is controlled by factors outside the bone marrow. For example, in the case of RBCs, exposure of the blood to a low oxygen level for a long time causes growth induction, differentiation, and production of greatly increased numbers of RBCs, as discussed later in this chapter. In the case of some of the white blood cells, infectious diseases cause growth, differentiation, and eventual formation of specific types of white blood cells that are needed to combat each infection.

## Stages of Differentiation of Red Blood Cells

The first cell that can be identified as belonging to the RBC series is the proerythroblast, shown at the starting point in Figure 33-3. Under appropriate stimulation, large numbers of these cells are formed from the CFU-E stem cells.

Once the proerythroblast has been formed, it divides multiple times, eventually forming many mature RBCs.

The first-generation cells are called basophil erythroblasts because they stain with basic dyes. Hemoglobin first appears in polychromatophil erythroblasts. In the succeeding generations, as shown in Figure 33-3, the cells become filled with hemoglobin to a concentration of about $34 \%$, the nucleus condenses to a small size, and its final remnant is absorbed or extruded from the cell. At the same time, the endoplasmic reticulum is also reabsorbed. The cell at this stage is called a reticulocyte because it still contains a small amount of basophilic material, consisting of remnants of the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and a few other cytoplasmic organelles. During this reticulocyte stage, the cells pass from the bone marrow into the blood capillaries by diapedesis (squeezing through the pores of the capillary membrane).

The remaining basophilic material in the reticulocyte normally disappears within 1 to 2 days, and the cell is then a mature erythrocyte. Because of the short life of the reticulocytes, their concentration among all the RBCs is normally slightly less than $1 \%$.

## Erythropoietin Regulates Red Blood Cell Production

The total mass of RBCs in the circulatory system is regulated within narrow limits, and thus (1) an adequate number of RBCs are always available to provide sufficient transport of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, yet (2) the cells do not become so numerous that they impede blood flow. This control mechanism is diagrammed in Figure 33-4 and is described in the following sections.

![gu0477962137](gu0477962137.jpg)

Figure 33-4. Function of the erythropoietin mechanism to increase production of red blood cells when tissue oxygenation decreases.

Tissue Oxygenation-Essential Regulator of Red Blood Cell Production. Conditions that decrease the quantity of oxygen transported to the tissues ordinarily increase the rate of RBC production. Thus, when a person becomes extremely anemic as a result of hemorrhage or any other condition, the bone marrow begins to produce large quantities of RBCs. Also, destruction of major portions of the bone marrow, especially by x-ray therapy, causes hyperplasia of the remaining bone marrow in an attempt to supply the body's need for RBCs.

At very high altitudes, where the quantity of oxygen in the air is greatly decreased, insufficient oxygen is transported to the tissues, and RBC production is greatly increased. In this case, it is not the concentration of RBCs in the blood that controls RBC production but the amount of oxygen transported to the tissues in relation to tissue demand for oxygen.

Various diseases of the circulation that decrease tissue blood flow, particularly those that cause failure of oxygen absorption by the blood as it passes through the lungs, can also increase the rate of RBC production. This result is especially apparent in prolonged cardiac failure and in many lung diseases because the tissue hypoxia resulting from these conditions increases RBC production, with a resultant increase in hematocrit and, usually, total blood volume.

Hypoxia Increases Formation of Erythropoietin Which Stimulates Red Blood Cell Production. The principal stimulus for RBC production in a low oxygen state is a circulating hormone called erythropoietin, a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 34,000 . In the absence of erythropoietin, hypoxia has little or no effect to stimulate RBC production. However, when the erythropoietin system is functional, hypoxia causes a marked increase
in erythropoietin production and the erythropoietin, in turn, enhances RBC production until the hypoxia is relieved.

Erythropoietin Is Formed Mainly in the Kidneys. Normally, about $90 \%$ of all erythropoietin is formed in the kidneys, and the remainder is formed mainly in the liver. It is not known exactly where in the kidneys the erythropoietin is formed. Some studies have suggested that erythropoietin is secreted mainly by fibroblast-like interstitial cells surrounding the tubules in the cortex and outer medulla, where much of the kidney's oxygen consumption occurs. It is likely that other cells, including the renal epithelial cells, also secrete erythropoietin in response to hypoxia.

Renal tissue hypoxia leads to increased tissue levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which serves as a transcription factor for a large number of hypoxiainducible genes, including the erythropoietin gene. HIF-1 binds to a hypoxia response element in the erythropoietin gene, inducing transcription of messenger RNA and, ultimately, increased erythropoietin synthesis.

At times, hypoxia in other parts of the body, but not in the kidneys, stimulates kidney erythropoietin secretion, which suggests that there might be some nonrenal sensor that sends an additional signal to the kidneys to produce this hormone. In particular, norepinephrine and epinephrine and several of the prostaglandins stimulate erythropoietin production.

When both kidneys are removed from a person, or when the kidneys are destroyed by renal disease, the person invariably becomes very anemic. This is because the $10 \%$ of the normal erythropoietin formed in other tissues (mainly in the liver) is sufficient to cause only one third to half the RBC formation needed by the body.

Erythropoietin Stimulates Production of Proerythroblasts From Hematopoietic Stem Cells. When an animal or person is placed in an atmosphere of low oxygen, erythropoietin begins to be formed within minutes to hours, and it reaches maximum production within 24 hours. Yet, almost no new RBCs appear in the circulating blood until about 5 days later. From this, as well as from other studies, it has been determined that the important effect of erythropoietin is to stimulate production of proerythroblasts from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. In addition, once the proerythroblasts are formed, the erythropoietin causes these cells to pass more rapidly through the different erythroblastic stages than they normally do, further speeding up the production of new RBCs. The rapid production of cells continues as long as the person remains in a low oxygen state or until enough RBCs have been produced to carry adequate amounts of oxygen to the tissues despite the low level of oxygen; at this time, the rate of erythropoietin production decreases to a level that will maintain the required number of RBCs but not an excess.

In the absence of erythropoietin, few RBCs are formed by the bone marrow. At the other extreme, when large quantities of erythropoietin are formed, and if plenty of iron and other required nutrients are available, the rate of RBC production can rise to perhaps 10 or more times normal. Therefore, the erythropoietin mechanism for controlling RBC production is a powerful one.

## Maturation of Red Blood Cells Requires Vitamin $B_{12}$ (Cyanocobalamin) and Folic Acid

Because of the continuing need to replenish RBCs, the erythropoietic cells of the bone marrow are among the most rapidly growing and reproducing cells in the entire body. Therefore, as would be expected, their maturation and rate of production are affected greatly by a person's nutritional status.

Especially important for final maturation of the RBCs are two vitamins, vitamin $B_{12}$ and folic acid. Both these vitamins are essential for synthesis of DNA because each, in a different way, is required for formation of thymidine triphosphate, one of the essential building blocks of DNA. Therefore, lack of vitamin $B_{12}$ or folic acid causes abnormal and diminished DNA and, consequently, failure of nuclear maturation and cell division. Furthermore, the erythroblastic cells of the bone marrow, in addition to failing to proliferate rapidly, produce mainly larger than normal RBCs called macrocytes, which have a flimsy membrane and are often irregular, large, and oval instead of the usual biconcave disc. These poorly formed cells, after entering the circulating blood, are capable of carrying oxygen normally, but their fragility causes them to have a short life, half to one-third normal. Therefore, deficiency of vitamin $B_{12}$ or folic acid causes maturation failure in the process of erythropoiesis.

Maturation Failure Anemia Caused by Poor Absorption of Vitamin $B_{12}$ From the Gastrointestinal TractPernicious Anemia. A common cause of RBC maturation failure is failure to absorb vitamin $B_{12}$ from the gastrointestinal tract. This situation often occurs in the disease pernicious anemia, in which the basic abnormality is an atrophic gastric mucosa that fails to produce normal gastric secretions. The parietal cells of the gastric glands secrete a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor, which combines with vitamin $B_{12}$ in food and makes the $B_{12}$ available for absorption by the gut in the following way:

1. Intrinsic factor binds tightly with the vitamin $B_{12}$. In this bound state, vitamin $B_{12}$ is protected from digestion by the gastrointestinal secretions.
2. Still in the bound state, intrinsic factor binds to specific receptor sites on the brush border membranes of the mucosal cells in the ileum.
3. Vitamin $B_{12}$ is then transported into the blood during the next few hours by the process of pinocytosis, carrying intrinsic factor and the vitamin together through the membrane.

Lack of intrinsic factor, therefore, decreases availability of vitamin $B_{12}$ because of faulty absorption of the vitamin.

Once vitamin $B_{12}$ has been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, it is first stored in large quantities in the liver and then released slowly as needed by the bone marrow. The minimum amount of vitamin $B_{12}$ required each day to maintain normal RBC maturation is only 1 to 3 micrograms, and the normal storage in the liver and other body tissues is about 1000 times this amount. Therefore, 3 to 4 years of defective vitamin $B_{12}$ absorption are usually required to cause maturation failure anemia.

Maturation Failure Anemia Caused by Folic Acid (Pteroylglutamic Acid) Deficiency. Folic acid is a normal constituent of green vegetables, some fruits, and meats (especially liver). However, it is easily destroyed during cooking. Also, people with gastrointestinal absorption abnormalities, such as the frequently occurring small intestinal disease called sprue, often have serious difficulty absorbing both folic acid and vitamin $B_{12}$. Therefore, in many cases of maturation failure, the cause is deficiency of intestinal absorption of folic acid and vitamin $B_{12}$.

## HEMOGLOBIN FORMATION

The synthesis of hemoglobin begins in polychromatophil erythroblasts and continues even into the reticulocyte stage of the RBCs. Therefore, when reticulocytes leave the bone marrow and pass into the blood stream, they continue to form minute quantities of hemoglobin for another day or so until they become mature erythrocytes.

Figure 33-5 shows the basic chemical steps in the formation of hemoglobin. First, succinyl-CoA, which is formed in the Krebs metabolic cycle (as explained in Chapter 68), binds with glycine to form a pyrrole molecule. In turn, four pyrroles combine to form protoporphyrin IX, which then combines with iron to form the heme molecule. Finally, each heme molecule combines with a long polypeptide chain, a globin synthesized by ribosomes, forming a subunit of hemoglobin called a hemoglobin chain (Figure 33-6). Each chain has a molecular weight of about 16,000; four of these chains, in turn, bind together loosely to form the whole hemoglobin molecule.

There are several slight variations in the different subunit hemoglobin chains, depending on the amino acid
![gu0577962137](gu0577962137.jpg)

Figure 33-6. Basic structure of the heme moiety, showing one of the four heme chains that along with globin polypeptide, bind together to form the hemoglobin molecule.
composition of the polypeptide portion. The different types of chains are designated as alpha ( $\alpha$ ) chains, beta ( $\beta$ ) chains, ( $\gamma$ ) gamma chains, and ( $\delta$ ) delta chains. The most common form of hemoglobin in adults, hemoglobin $A$, is a combination of two alpha chains and two beta chains. Hemoglobin A has a molecular weight of 64,458.

Because each hemoglobin chain has a heme prosthetic group containing an atom of iron, and because there are four hemoglobin chains in each hemoglobin molecule, one finds four iron atoms in each hemoglobin molecule. Each of these can bind loosely with one molecule of oxygen, making a total of four molecules of oxygen (or eight oxygen atoms) that can be transported by each hemoglobin molecule.

The types of hemoglobin chains in the hemoglobin molecule determine the binding affinity of the hemoglobin for oxygen. Abnormalities of the chains can alter the physical characteristics of the hemoglobin molecule as well. For example, in sickle cell anemia, the amino acid valine is substituted for glutamic acid at one point in each of the two beta chains. When this type of hemoglobin is exposed to low oxygen, it forms elongated crystals inside the RBCs that are sometimes 15 micrometers in length. These crystals make it almost impossible for the cells to pass through many small capillaries, and the spiked ends of the crystals are likely to rupture the cell membranes, leading to sickle cell anemia.

Hemoglobin Combines Reversibly With Oxygen. The most important feature of the hemoglobin molecule is its ability to combine loosely and reversibly with oxygen. This ability is discussed in detail in Chapter 41 in relation to respiration because the primary function of hemoglobin in the body is to combine with oxygen in the lungs
![gu0777962137](gu0777962137.jpg)

Figure 33-7. Iron transport and metabolism.
and then to release this oxygen readily in the peripheral tissue capillaries, where the gaseous tension of oxygen is much lower than in the lungs.

Oxygen does not combine with the two positive bonds of the iron in the hemoglobin molecule. Instead, it binds loosely with one of the so-called coordination bonds of the iron atom. This bond is extremely loose, so the combination is easily reversible. Furthermore, the oxygen does not become ionic oxygen but is carried as molecular oxygen (composed of two oxygen atoms) to the tissues, where, because of the loose, readily reversible combination, it is released into the tissue fluids still in the form of molecular oxygen rather than ionic oxygen.

## IRON METABOLISM

Because iron is important for the formation not only of hemoglobin but also of other essential elements in the body (e.g., myoglobin, cytochromes, cytochrome oxidase, peroxidase, and catalase), it is important to understand the means whereby iron is used in the body. The total quantity of iron in the body averages 4 to 5 grams, about $65 \%$ of which is in the form of hemoglobin. About $4 \%$ is in the form of myoglobin, $1 \%$ is in the form of the various heme compounds that promote intracellular oxidation, $0.1 \%$ is combined with the protein transferrin in the blood plasma, and $15 \%$ to $30 \%$ is stored for later use, mainly in the reticuloendothelial system and liver parenchymal cells, principally in the form of ferritin.

Transport and Storage of Iron. Transport, storage, and metabolism of iron in the body are diagrammed in Figure 33-7 and can be explained as follows. When iron is absorbed from the small intestine, it immediately combines in the blood plasma with a beta globulin, apotransferrin, to form transferrin, which is then transported in the plasma. The iron is loosely bound in the transferrin and, consequently, can be released to any tissue cell at any point in the body. Excess iron in the blood is deposited especially in the liver hepatocytes and less in the reticuloendothelial cells of the bone marrow.

In the cell cytoplasm, iron combines mainly with a protein, apoferritin, to form ferritin. Apoferritin has a molecular weight of about 460,000 , and varying quantities of iron can combine in clusters of iron radicals with this large molecule; therefore, ferritin may contain only a small or a large amount of iron. This iron stored as ferritin is called storage iron.

Smaller quantities of the iron in the storage pool are in an extremely insoluble form called hemosiderin. This is especially true when the total quantity of iron in the body is more than the apoferritin storage pool can accommodate. Hemosiderin collects in cells in the form of large clusters that can be observed microscopically as large particles. In contrast, ferritin particles are so small and dispersed that they usually can be seen in the cell cytoplasm only with an electron microscope.

When the quantity of iron in the plasma falls low, some of the iron in the ferritin storage pool is removed easily and transported in the form of transferrin in the plasma to the areas of the body where it is needed. A unique characteristic of the transferrin molecule is that it binds strongly with receptors in the cell membranes of erythroblasts in the bone marrow. Then, along with its bound iron, it is ingested into the erythroblasts by endocytosis. There the transferrin delivers the iron directly to the mitochondria, where heme is synthesized. In people who do not have adequate quantities of transferrin in their blood, failure to transport iron to the erythroblasts in this manner can cause severe hypochromic anemia (i.e., RBCs that contain much less hemoglobin than normal).

When RBCs have lived their life span of about 120 days and are destroyed, the hemoglobin released from the cells is ingested by monocyte-macrophage cells. There, iron is liberated and is stored mainly in the ferritin pool to be used as needed for the formation of new hemoglobin.

Daily Loss of Iron. An average man excretes about 0.6 mg of iron each day, mainly into the feces. Additional quantities of iron are lost when bleeding occurs. For a woman, additional menstrual loss of blood brings long-term iron loss to an average of about $1.3 \mathrm{mg} /$ day.

## Absorption of Iron From the Intestinal Tract

Iron is absorbed from all parts of the small intestine, mostly by the following mechanism. The liver secretes moderate amounts of apotransferrin into the bile, which flows through the bile duct into the duodenum. Here, the apotransferrin binds with free iron and also with certain iron compounds, such as hemoglobin and myoglobin from meat, two of the most important sources of iron in the diet. This combination is called transferrin. In turn, it is attracted to and binds with receptors in the membranes of intestinal epithelial cells. Then, by pinocytosis, the transferrin molecule, carrying its iron store, is absorbed into the epithelial cells and later released into the blood capillaries beneath these cells in the form of plasma transferrin.

Iron absorption from the intestines is extremely slow, at a maximum rate of only a few milligrams per day. This slow rate of absorption means that even when tremendous quantities of iron are present in the food, only small proportions can be absorbed.

## Regulation of Total Body Iron by Controlling Absorption Rate. When the body becomes saturated with iron

so that essentially all apoferritin in the iron storage areas is already combined with iron, the rate of additional iron absorption from the intestinal tract markedly decreases. Conversely, when the iron stores become depleted, the rate of absorption can probably accelerate five or more times normal. Thus, total body iron is regulated mainly by altering the rate of absorption.

## LIFE SPAN OF RED BLOOD CELLS IS ABOUT 120 DAYS

When RBCs are delivered from the bone marrow into the circulatory system, they normally circulate an average of 120 days before being destroyed. Even though mature RBCs do not have a nucleus, mitochondria, or endoplasmic reticulum, they do have cytoplasmic enzymes that are capable of metabolizing glucose and forming small amounts of adenosine triphosphate. These enzymes also do the following: (1) maintain pliability of the cell membrane; (2) maintain membrane transport of ions; (3) keep the iron of the cells' hemoglobin in the ferrous form rather than the ferric form; and (4) prevent oxidation of the proteins in the RBCs. Even so, the metabolic systems of old RBCs become progressively less active, and the cells become more and more fragile, presumably because their life processes wear out.

Once the RBC membrane becomes fragile, the cell ruptures during passage through some tight spot of the circulation. Many of the RBCs self-destruct in the spleen, where they squeeze through the red pulp of the spleen. There, the spaces between the structural trabeculae of the red pulp, through which most of the cells must pass, are only 3 micrometers wide, in comparison with the 8 -micrometer diameter of the RBC. When the spleen is removed, the number of old abnormal RBCs circulating in the blood increases considerably.

Destruction of Hemoglobin by Macrophages. When RBCs burst and release their hemoglobin, the hemoglobin is phagocytized almost immediately by macrophages in many parts of the body, but especially by the Kupffer cells of the liver and macrophages of the spleen and bone marrow. During the next few hours to days, the macrophages release iron from the hemoglobin and pass it back into the blood to be carried by transferrin either to the bone marrow for production of new RBCs or to the liver and other tissues for storage in the form of ferritin. The porphyrin portion of the hemoglobin molecule is converted by the macrophages, through a series of stages, into the bile pigment bilirubin, which is released into the blood and later removed from the body by secretion through the liver into the bile. This process is discussed in relation to liver function in Chapter 71.

## ANEMIAS

Anemia means deficiency of hemoglobin in the blood, which can be caused by too few RBCs or too little hemoglobin in the cells. Some types of anemia and their physiological causes are described in the following sections.

Blood Loss Anemia. After rapid hemorrhage, the body replaces the fluid portion of the plasma in 1 to 3 days, but this response results in a low concentration of RBCs. If a second hemorrhage does not occur, the RBC concentration usually returns to normal within 3 to 6 weeks.

When chronic blood loss occurs, a person frequently cannot absorb enough iron from the intestines to form hemoglobin as rapidly as it is lost. RBCs that are much smaller than normal and have too little hemoglobin inside them are then produced, giving rise to microcytic hypochromic anemia, which is shown in Figure 33-3.

Aplastic Anemia Due to Bone Marrow Dysfunction. Bone marrow aplasia means lack of functioning bone marrow. For example, exposure to high-dose radiation or chemotherapy for cancer treatment can damage stem cells of the bone marrow, followed in a few weeks by anemia. Likewise, high doses of certain toxic chemicals, such as insecticides or benzene in gasoline, may cause the same effect. In autoimmune disorders, such as lupus erythematosus, the immune system begins attacking healthy cells such as bone marrow stem cells, which may lead to aplastic anemia. In about half of aplastic anemia cases the cause is unknown, a condition called idiopathic aplastic anemia.

People with severe aplastic anemia usually die unless they are treated with blood transfusions-which can temporarily increase the numbers of RBCs-or by bone marrow transplantation.

Megaloblastic Anemia. Based on the earlier discussions of vitamin $B_{12}$, folic acid, and intrinsic factor from the stomach mucosa, one can readily understand that loss of any one of these can lead to slow reproduction of erythroblasts in the bone marrow. As a result, the RBCs grow too large, with odd shapes, and are called megaloblasts. Thus, atrophy of the stomach mucosa, as occurs in pernicious anemia, or loss of the entire stomach after surgical total gastrectomy can lead to megaloblastic anemia. Also, megaloblastic anemia often develops in patients who have intestinal sprue, in which folic acid, vitamin $B_{12}$, and other vitamin B compounds are poorly absorbed. Because the erythroblasts in these states cannot proliferate rapidly enough to form normal numbers of RBCs, the RBCs that are formed are mostly oversized, have bizarre shapes, and have fragile membranes. These cells rupture easily, leaving the person in dire need of an adequate number of RBCs.

Hemolytic Anemia. Different abnormalities of the RBCs, many of which are acquired through hereditary, make the cells fragile, so they rupture easily as they go through the capillaries, especially through the spleen. Even though
the number of RBCs formed may be normal, or even much greater than normal in some hemolytic diseases, the life span of the fragile RBC is so short that the cells are destroyed faster than they can be formed, and serious anemia results.

In hereditary spherocytosis, the RBCs are very small and spherical rather than being biconcave discs. These cells cannot withstand compression forces because they do not have the normal loose, baglike cell membrane structure of the biconcave discs. On passing through the splenic pulp and some other tight vascular beds, they are easily ruptured by even slight compression.

In sickle cell anemia, which is present in $0.3 \%$ to $1.0 \%$ of West African and American blacks, the cells have an abnormal type of hemoglobin called hemoglobin $S$, containing faulty beta chains in the hemoglobin molecule, as explained earlier in this chapter. When this hemoglobin is exposed to low concentrations of oxygen, it precipitates into long crystals inside the RBC. These crystals elongate the cell and give it the appearance of a sickle rather than a biconcave disc. The precipitated hemoglobin also damages the cell membrane, so the cells become highly fragile, leading to serious anemia. Such patients frequently experience a vicious circle of events called a sickle cell disease crisis, in which low oxygen tension in the tissues causes sickling, which leads to ruptured RBCs, which causes a further decrease in oxygen tension and still more sickling and RBC destruction. Once the process starts, it progresses rapidly, eventuating in a serious decrease in RBCs within a few hours and, in some cases, death.

In erythroblastosis fetalis, Rh-positive RBCs in the fetus are attacked by antibodies from an Rh-negative mother. These antibodies make the Rh-positive cells fragile, leading to rapid rupture and causing the child to be born with a serious case of anemia. This condition is discussed in Chapter 36 in relation to the Rh factor of blood. The extremely rapid formation of new RBCs to make up for the destroyed cells in erythroblastosis fetalis causes a large number of early blast forms of RBCs to be released from the bone marrow into the blood.

## EFFECTS OF ANEMIA ON CIRCULATORY SYSTEM FUNCTION

The viscosity of the blood, which was discussed in Chapter 14, depends largely on the blood concentration of RBCs. In persons with severe anemia, the blood viscosity may fall to as low as 1.5 times that of water rather than the normal value of about 3 . This change decreases the resistance to blood flow in the peripheral blood vessels, so far greater than normal quantities of blood flow through the tissues and return to the heart, thereby greatly increasing cardiac output. Moreover, hypoxia resulting from diminished transport of oxygen by the blood causes the peripheral tissue blood vessels to dilate, allowing a further increase in the return of blood to the heart and increasing the cardiac output to a still higher level-sometimes three to four times normal. Thus, one of the major effects of anemia is greatly increased cardiac output, as well as increased pumping workload on the heart.

The increased cardiac output in persons with anemia partially offsets the reduced oxygen-carrying effect of the anemia because, even though each unit quantity of blood carries only small quantities of oxygen, the rate of blood flow may be increased enough that almost normal quantities of oxygen are actually delivered to the tissues. However, when a person with anemia begins to exercise, the heart is not capable of pumping much greater quantities of blood than it is already pumping. Consequently, during exercise, which greatly increases tissue demand for oxygen, extreme tissue hypoxia results and acute cardiac failure may ensue.

## POLYCYTHEMIA

Secondary Polycythemia. Whenever the tissues become hypoxic because of too little oxygen in the breathed air, such as at high altitudes, or because of failure of oxygen delivery to the tissues, such as in cardiac failure, the blood-forming organs automatically produce large quantities of extra RBCs. This condition is called secondary polycythemia, and the RBC count commonly rises to 6 to 7 million $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, about $30 \%$ above normal.

A common type of secondary polycythemia, called physiological polycythemia, occurs in those who live at altitudes of 14,000 to 17,000 feet, where the atmospheric oxygen is very low. The blood count is generally 6 to 7 million $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$, which allows these people to perform reasonably high levels of continuous work, even in a rarefied atmosphere.

Polycythemia Vera (Erythremia). In addition to physiological polycythemia, a pathological condition known as polycythemia vera exists, in which the RBC count may be 7 to 8 million $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ and the hematocrit may be $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ instead of the normal $40 \%$ to $45 \%$. Polycythemia vera is caused by a genetic aberration in the hemocytoblastic cells that produce the blood cells. The blast cells no longer stop producing RBCs when too many cells are already present. This causes excess production of RBCs in the same manner that a breast tumor causes excess production of a specific type of breast cell. It usually causes excess production of white blood cells and platelets as well.

In polycythemia vera, not only does the hematocrit increase, but the total blood volume also increases, sometimes to almost twice normal. As a result, the entire vascular system becomes intensely engorged. Also, many blood capillaries become plugged by the viscous blood; the viscosity of the blood in polycythemia vera sometimes increases from the normal of 3 times the viscosity of water to 10 times that of water.

## EFFECT OF POLYCYTHEMIA ON FUNCTION OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM

Because of the greatly increased viscosity of blood in polycythemia, blood flow through the peripheral blood vessels is often very sluggish. In accordance with the factors
that regulate return of blood to the heart, as discussed in Chapter 20, increasing blood viscosity decreases the rate of venous return to the heart. Conversely, the blood volume is greatly increased in polycythemia, which tends to increase venous return. Actually, the cardiac output in polycythemia is not far from normal because these two factors more or less neutralize each other.

The arterial pressure is also normal in most people with polycythemia, although in about one-third of them, the arterial pressure is elevated. This means that the blood pressure-regulating mechanisms can usually offset the tendency for increased blood viscosity to increase peripheral resistance and, thereby, increase arterial pressure. Beyond certain limits, however, these regulations fail, and hypertension develops.

The color of the skin depends to a great extent on the quantity of blood in the skin subpapillary venous plexus. In polycythemia vera, the quantity of blood in this plexus is greatly increased. Furthermore, because blood passes sluggishly through the skin capillaries before entering the venous plexus, a larger than normal quantity of hemoglobin is deoxygenated. The blue color of all this deoxygenated hemoglobin masks the red color of the oxygenated hemoglobin. Therefore, a person with polycythemia vera ordinarily has a ruddy complexion, with a bluish (cyanotic) tint to the skin.

# Resistance of the Body to Infection: I. Leukocytes, Granulocytes, the Monocyte-Macrophage System, and Inflammation 

Our bodies are exposed continually to bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, all of which occur normally and to varying degrees in the skin, mouth, respiratory passageways, intestinal tract, lining membranes of the eyes, and even the urinary tract. Many of these infectious agents are capable of causing serious abnormal physiological function or even death if they invade deeper tissues. We are also exposed intermittently to other highly infectious bacteria and viruses besides those that are normally present, and these agents can cause acute lethal diseases such as pneumonia, streptococcal infection, and typhoid fever.

Our bodies have a special system for combating the different infectious and toxic agents. This system is composed of blood leukocytes (white blood cells [WBCs]) and tissue cells derived from leukocytes. These cells work together in two ways to prevent disease: (1) by actually destroying invading bacteria or viruses by phagocytosis; and (2) by forming antibodies and sensitized lymphocytes that may destroy or inactivate the invader. This chapter discusses the first of these methods, and Chapter 35 discusses the second.

## LEUKOCYTES (WHITE BLOOD CELLS)

The leukocytes, also called white blood cells, are the mobile units of the body's protective system. They are formed partially in the bone marrow (granulocytes and monocytes and a few lymphocytes) and partially in the lymph tissue (lymphocytes and plasma cells). After formation, they are transported in the blood to different parts of the body where they are needed.

The real value of WBCs is that most of them are specifically transported to areas of serious infection and inflammation, thereby providing a rapid and potent defense against infectious agents. As we see later, the granulocytes and monocytes have a special ability to "seek out and destroy" a foreign invader.

## GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEUKOCYTES

Types of White Blood Cells. Six types of WBCs are normally present in the blood: neutrophils (polymorphonuclear),
eosinophils (polymorphonuclear), basophils (polymorphonuclear), monocytes, lymphocytes and, occasionally, plasma cells. In addition, there are large numbers of platelets, which are fragments of another type of cell similar to the WBCs found in the bone marrow, the megakaryocyte. The first three types of cells, the polymorphonuclear cells, all have a granular appearance, as shown in cell numbers 7,10 , and 12 in Figure 34-1, and for this reason they are called granulocytes.

The granulocytes and monocytes protect the body against invading organisms by ingesting them (by phagocytosis) or by releasing antimicrobial or inflammatory substances that have multiple effects that aid in destroying the offending organism. The lymphocytes and plasma cells function mainly in connection with the immune system, as discussed in Chapter 35. Finally, the function of platelets is specifically to activate the blood-clotting mechanism, discussed in Chapter 37.

Concentrations of Different White Blood Cells in Blood. An adult human has about 7000 WBCs per microliter of blood (in comparison with 5 million red blood cells [RBCs] per microliter). Of the total WBCs, the normal percentages of the different types are approximately the following:

- Neutrophils: $62.0 \%$
- Eosinophils: $2.3 \%$
- Basophils: $0.4 \%$
- Monocytes: $5.3 \%$
- Lymphocytes: $30.0 \%$

The number of platelets, which are only cell fragments, in each microliter of blood is normally between 150,000 and 450,000 , averaging about 300,000 .

## GENESIS OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS

Early differentiation of the multipotential hematopoietic stem cell into the different types of committed stem cells was shown in Figure 33-2 in the previous chapter. Aside from the cells committed to form RBCs, two major lineages of WBCs are formed, the myelocytic and lymphocytic lineages. The left side of Figure 34-1 shows the

![gu0877962137](gu0877962137.jpg)

Figure 34-1. Genesis of white blood cells. The different cells of the myelocyte series are shown: 1, myeloblast; 2, promyelocyte; 3, megakaryocyte; 4, neutrophil myelocyte; 5, young neutrophil metamyelocyte; 6, band neutrophil metamyelocyte; 7, neutrophil; 8, eosinophil myelocyte; 9, eosinophil metamyelocyte; 10, eosinophil; 11, basophil myelocyte; 12, basophil; 13-16, stages of monocyte formation.
myelocytic lineage, beginning with the myeloblast; the right side shows the lymphocytic lineage, beginning with the lymphoblast.

The granulocytes and monocytes are formed only in the bone marrow. Lymphocytes and plasma cells are produced mainly in the various lymphogenous tissuesespecially the lymph glands, spleen, thymus, tonsils, and various pockets of lymphoid tissue elsewhere in the body, such as in the bone marrow and in Peyer's patches underneath the epithelium in the gut wall.

The WBCs formed in the bone marrow are stored in the marrow until they are needed in the circulatory system. Then, when the need arises, various factors cause them to be released (these factors are discussed later). Normally, about three times as many WBCs are stored in the marrow as circulate in the entire blood. This quantity represents about a 6-day supply of these cells.

The lymphocytes are mostly stored in the various lymphoid tissues, except for a small number that are temporarily being transported in the blood.

As shown in Figure 34-1, megakaryocytes (cell 3) are also formed in the bone marrow. These megakaryocytes fragment in the bone marrow and the small fragments, known as platelets (or thrombocytes), then pass into the blood. They are very important in the initiation of blood clotting.

## LIFE SPAN OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS

The life of the granulocytes after being released from the bone marrow is normally 4 to 8 hours circulating in the blood and another 4 to 5 days in tissues where they are
needed. In times of serious tissue infection, this total life span is often shortened to only a few hours because the granulocytes proceed even more rapidly to the infected area, perform their functions, and in the process, are themselves destroyed.

The monocytes also have a short transit time, 10 to 20 hours in the blood, before wandering through the capillary membranes into the tissues. Once in the tissues, they swell to much larger sizes to become tissue macrophages and, in this form, they can live for months unless destroyed while performing phagocytic functions. These tissue macrophages are the basis of the tissue macrophage system (discussed in greater detail later), which provides continuing defense against infection.

Lymphocytes enter the circulatory system continually, along with drainage of lymph from the lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissue. After a few hours, they pass out of the blood back into the tissues by diapedesis/extravasation. Then, they re-enter the lymph and return to the blood again and again; thus, there is continual circulation of lymphocytes through the body. Lymphocytes have life spans of weeks or months, depending on the body's need for these cells.

The platelets in the blood are replaced about once every 10 days. In other words, about 30,000 platelets are formed each day for each microliter of blood.

## NEUTROPHILS AND MACROPHAGES DEFEND AGAINST INFECTIONS

It is mainly the neutrophils and tissue macrophages that attack and destroy invading bacteria, viruses, and other

![gu0977962137](gu0977962137.jpg)

Figure 34-2. Movement of neutrophils by diapedesis or extravasation through capillary pores and by chemotaxis toward an area of tissue damage.
harmful agents. The neutrophils are mature cells that can attack and destroy bacteria, even in the circulating blood. Conversely, the tissue macrophages begin life as blood monocytes, which are immature cells while still in the blood and have little ability to fight infectious agents at that time. However, once they enter the tissues, they begin to swell-sometimes increasing their diameters as much as fivefold-to as great as 60 to 80 micrometers, a size that can barely be seen with the naked eye. These cells are now called macrophages, and they are extremely capable of combating disease agents in the tissues.

White Blood Cells Enter the Tissue Spaces by Diapedesis. Neutrophils and monocytes can squeeze through gaps between endothelial cells of the blood capillaries and postcapillary venules by diapedesis. Although the intercellular gaps are much smaller than a cell, a small portion of the cell slides through the gap at a time; the portion sliding through is momentarily constricted to the size of the gap, as shown in Figure 34-2 (also see Figure 34-6).

White Blood Cells Move Through Tissue Spaces by Ameboid Motion. Both neutrophils and macrophages can move through the tissues by ameboid motion, described in Chapter 2. Some cells move at velocities as great as $40 \mu \mathrm{~m} /$ min , a distance as great as their own length each minute.

White Blood Cells Are Attracted to Inflamed Tissue Areas by Chemotaxis. Many different chemical substances in the tissues cause both neutrophils and macrophages to move toward the source of the chemical. This phenomenon, shown in Figure 34-2, is known as chemotaxis. When a tissue becomes inflamed, at least a dozen different products that can cause chemotaxis toward the
inflamed area are formed (Video 34-1). They include the following: (1) some of the bacterial or viral toxins; (2) degenerative products of the inflamed tissues; (3) several reaction products of the complement complex (discussed in Chapter 35) activated in inflamed tissues; and (4) several reaction products caused by plasma clotting in the inflamed area, as well as other substances.

As shown in Figure 34-2, chemotaxis depends on the concentration gradient of the chemotactic substance. The concentration is greatest near the source, which directs the unidirectional movement of the WBCs. Chemotaxis is effective up to 100 micrometers away from an inflamed tissue. Therefore, because almost no tissue area is more than 50 micrometers away from a capillary, the chemotactic signal can easily move hordes of WBCs from the capillaries into the inflamed area.

## PHAGOCYTOSIS

A major function of the neutrophils and macrophages is phagocytosis, which means cellular ingestion of the offending agent. Phagocytes must be selective of the material that is phagocytized; otherwise, normal cells and structures of the body might be ingested. Whether phagocytosis will occur especially depends on three selective procedures (Figure 34-3).

First, most natural structures in the tissues have smooth surfaces, which resist phagocytosis. However, if the surface is rough, the likelihood of phagocytosis is increased.

Second, most natural substances of the body have protective protein coats that repel the phagocytes. Conversely, most dead tissues and foreign particles have no protective coats, which makes them subject to phagocytosis.

Third, the immune system of the body (described in Chapter 35) develops antibodies against infectious agents such as bacteria. The antibodies then adhere to the bacterial membranes and thereby make the bacteria especially susceptible to phagocytosis. To do this, the antibody molecule also combines with the C3 product of the complement cascade, which is an additional part of the immune system discussed in the next chapter. The C3 molecules, in turn, attach to receptors on the phagocyte membrane, thus initiating phagocytosis. This process whereby a pathogen is selected for phagocytosis and destruction is called opsonization.

Phagocytosis by Neutrophils. The neutrophils entering the tissues are already mature cells that can immediately begin phagocytosis. On approaching a particle to be phagocytized, the neutrophil first attaches itself to the particle and then projects pseudopodia in all directions around the particle. The pseudopodia meet one another on the opposite side and fuse. This action creates an enclosed chamber that contains the phagocytized particle. Then, the chamber invaginates to the inside of the cytoplasmic cavity and breaks away from the outer cell membrane to form a free-floating phagocytic vesicle (also called

![gu1077962137](gu1077962137.jpg)

Figure 34-3. Phagocytosis of pathogens, such as bacteria, by a phagocytic cell, such as a macrophage. Antibodies coat the bacteria, making them more susceptible to phagocytosis by the macrophage that engulfs the bacterium, bringing it into the cell and forming a phagosome. Lysosomes then attach to the phagosome to form a phagolysosome, which digests the invading pathogen. The phagocytic cell then releases the digested products by exocytosis.
a phagosome) inside the cytoplasm. A single neutrophil can usually phagocytize 3 to 20 bacteria before the neutrophil becomes inactivated and dies.

Phagocytosis by Macrophages. Macrophages are the end-stage product of monocytes that enter the tissues from the blood. When activated by the immune system, as described in Chapter 35, they are much more powerful phagocytes than neutrophils, often capable of phagocytizing as many as 100 bacteria. They also have the ability to engulf much larger particles, even whole RBCs or, occasionally, malarial parasites, whereas neutrophils are not capable of phagocytizing particles much larger than bacteria. Also, after digesting particles, macrophages can extrude the residual products and often survive and function for many more months.

Once Phagocytized, Most Particles Are Digested by Intracellular Enzymes. Once a foreign particle has been phagocytized, lysosomes and other cytoplasmic granules in the neutrophil or macrophage immediately come into contact with the phagocytic vesicle, and their membranes fuse, thereby dumping many digestive enzymes and bactericidal agents into the vesicle. Thus, the phagocytic vesicle now becomes a digestive vesicle, and digestion of the phagocytized particle begins immediately.

Both neutrophils and macrophages contain an abundance of lysosomes filled with proteolytic enzymes especially geared for digesting bacteria and other foreign protein matter. The lysosomes of macrophages (but not of neutrophils) also contain large amounts of lipases, which digest the thick lipid membranes possessed by some bacteria, such as the tuberculosis bacillus.

Neutrophils and Macrophages Can Kill Bacteria. In addition to the digestion of ingested bacteria in phagosomes, neutrophils and macrophages contain bactericidal agents that kill most bacteria, even when the lysosomal enzymes fail to digest them. This characteristic is especially important because some bacteria have protective coats or other factors that prevent their destruction by digestive enzymes. Much of the killing effect results from several powerful oxidizing agents formed by enzymes in the membrane of the phagosome or by a special organelle called the peroxisome. These oxidizing agents include large quantities of superoxide $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{-}\right)$, hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, and hydroxyl ions $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)$, which are lethal to most bacteria, even in small quantities. Also, one of the lysosomal enzymes, myeloperoxidase, catalyzes the reaction between $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and chloride ions to form hypochlorite, which is exceedingly bactericidal.

Some bacteria, notably the tuberculosis bacillus, have coats that are resistant to lysosomal digestion and also secrete substances that partially resist the killing effects of the neutrophils and macrophages. These bacteria are responsible for many chronic diseases, such as tuberculosis.

## MONOCYTE-MACROPHAGE CELL SYSTEM (RETICULOENDOTHELIAL SYSTEM)

In the preceding paragraphs, we described the macrophages mainly as mobile cells capable of wandering through the tissues. However, after entering the tissues and becoming macrophages, another large portion of monocytes becomes attached to the tissues and remains attached for months or even years until they are called on to perform specific local protective functions. They have the same capabilities as the mobile macrophages to phagocytize large quantities of bacteria, viruses, necrotic tissue, or other foreign particles in the tissue. In addition, when appropriately stimulated, they can break away from their attachments and, once again, become mobile macrophages that respond to chemotaxis and all the other stimuli related to the inflammatory process. Thus, the body has a widespread monocyte-macrophage system in virtually all tissue areas.

The total combination of monocytes, mobile macrophages, fixed tissue macrophages, and a few specialized endothelial cells in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes is called the reticuloendothelial system. However, all or almost all these cells originate from monocytic stem

![gu1177962137](gu1177962137.jpg)

Figure 34-4. Functional diagram of a lymph node.
cells; therefore, the reticuloendothelial system is almost synonymous with the monocyte-macrophage system. Because the term reticuloendothelial system is much better known in medical literature than the term monocytemacrophage system, it should be remembered as a generalized phagocytic system located in all tissues, especially in the tissue areas where large quantities of particles, toxins, and other unwanted substances must be destroyed.

Tissue Macrophages in Skin and Subcutaneous Tissues (Histiocytes). The skin is mainly impregnable to infectious agents, except when it is broken. When infection begins in a subcutaneous tissue and local inflammation ensues, local tissue macrophages can divide in situ and form still more macrophages. Then, they perform the usual functions of attacking and destroying the infectious agents, as described earlier.

Macrophages in Lymph Nodes. Essentially no particulate matter that enters the tissues, such as bacteria, can be absorbed directly through the capillary membranes into the blood. Instead, if the particles are not destroyed locally in the tissues, they enter the lymph and flow to the lymph nodes located intermittently along the course of the lymph flow. The foreign particles are then trapped in these nodes in a meshwork of sinuses lined by tissue macrophages.

Figure 34-4 illustrates the general organization of the lymph node, showing lymph entering through the lymph node capsule via afferent lymphatics, then flowing through the nodal medullary sinuses, and finally passing out the hilus into efferent lymphatics that eventually empty into the venous blood.

Large numbers of macrophages line the lymph sinuses and if any particles enter the sinuses by way of the lymph the macrophages phagocytize them and prevent general dissemination throughout the body.

Alveolar Macrophages in Lungs. Another route whereby invading organisms frequently enter the body is through
![gu1277962137](gu1277962137.jpg)

Figure 34-5. Kupffer cells lining the liver sinusoids, showing phagocytosis of India ink particles into the cytoplasm of the Kupffer cells.
the lungs. Large numbers of tissue macrophages are present as integral components of the alveolar walls. They can phagocytize particles that become entrapped in the alveoli. If the particles are digestible, the macrophages can also digest them and release the digestive products into the lymph. If the particle is not digestible, the macrophages often form a giant cell capsule around the particle until such time-if ever-that it can be slowly dissolved. Such capsules are frequently formed around tuberculosis bacilli, silica dust particles, and even carbon particles.

Macrophages (Kupffer Cells) in Liver Sinusoids. Another route whereby bacteria invade the body is through the gastrointestinal tract. Large numbers of bacteria from ingested food constantly pass through the gastrointestinal mucosa into the portal blood. Before this blood enters the general circulation, it passes through the liver sinusoids, which are lined with tissue macrophages called Kupffer cells, shown in Figure 34-5. These cells form such an effective particulate filtration system that almost none of the bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract pass from the portal blood into the general systemic circulation. Indeed, videos of phagocytosis by Kupffer cells have demonstrated phagocytosis of a single bacterium in less than 0.01 second.

Macrophages of Spleen and Bone Marrow. If an invading organism succeeds in entering the general circulation, there are other lines of defense by the tissue macrophage system, especially by macrophages of the spleen and bone marrow. In both these tissues, macrophages become entrapped by the reticular meshwork of the two organs, and when foreign particles come into contact with these macrophages, they are phagocytized.

![gu1377962137](gu1377962137.jpg)

Figure 34-6. Functional structures of the spleen.
The spleen is similar to the lymph nodes, except that blood, instead of lymph, flows through the tissue spaces of the spleen. Figure 34-6 shows a small peripheral segment of spleen tissue. Note that a small artery penetrates from the splenic capsule into the splenic pulp and terminates in small capillaries. The capillaries are highly porous, allowing whole blood to pass out of the capillaries into cords of red pulp. The blood then gradually squeezes through the trabecular meshwork of these cords and eventually returns to the circulation through the endothelial walls of the venous sinuses. The trabeculae of the red pulp and venous sinuses are lined with vast numbers of macrophages. This peculiar passage of blood through the cords of the red pulp provides an exceptional means of phagocytizing unwanted debris in the blood, including especially old and abnormal RBCs.

## INFLAMMATION: ROLE OF NEUTROPHILS AND MACROPHAGES

## INFLAMMATION

When tissue injury occurs, whether caused by bacteria, trauma, chemicals, heat, or any other phenomenon, multiple substances are released by the injured tissues and cause dramatic secondary changes in the surrounding uninjured tissues. This entire complex of tissue changes is called inflammation.

Inflammation is characterized by the following: (1) vasodilation of the local blood vessels, with consequent increased local blood flow; (2) increased permeability of the capillaries, allowing leakage of large quantities of fluid into the interstitial spaces; (3) often, clotting of the fluid in the interstitial spaces because of increased amounts of fibrinogen and other proteins leaking from the capillaries; (4) migration of large numbers of granulocytes and monocytes into the tissue; and (5) swelling of the tissue cells. Some of the many tissue products that cause these reactions are histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, prostaglandins, several different reaction products of the complement
system (described in Chapter 35), reaction products of the blood clotting system, and multiple substances called lymphokines that are released by sensitized T cells (part of the immune system; also discussed in Chapter 35). Several of these substances strongly activate the macrophage system, and within a few hours, the macrophages begin to devour the destroyed tissues. At times, however, the macrophages may also further injure the still-living tissue cells.

Walling-Off Effect of Inflammation. One of the first results of inflammation is to wall off the area of injury from the remaining tissues. The tissue spaces and the lymphatics in the inflamed area are blocked by fibrinogen clots so that after a while, fluid barely flows through the spaces. This walling-off process delays the spread of bacteria or toxic products.

The intensity of the inflammatory process is usually proportional to the degree of tissue injury. For example, when staphylococci invade tissues, they release extremely lethal cellular toxins. As a result, inflammation develops rapidly-indeed, much more rapidly than the staphylococci can multiply and spread. Therefore, local staphylococcal infection is characteristically walled off rapidly and prevented from spreading through the body. Streptococci, in contrast, do not cause such intense local tissue destruction. Therefore, the walling-off process develops slowly over many hours, while many streptococci reproduce and migrate. As a result, streptococci often have a far greater tendency to spread through the body and cause death than staphylococci, even though staphylococci are far more destructive to the tissues.

## MACROPHAGE AND NEUTROPHIL RESPONSES DURING INFLAMMATION

Tissue Macrophages Provide First Line of Defense Against Infection. Within minutes after inflammation begins, the macrophages already present in the tissues, whether histiocytes in the subcutaneous tissues, alveolar macrophages in the lungs, microglia in the brain, or others, immediately begin their phagocytic actions. When activated by the products of infection and inflammation, the first effect is rapid enlargement of each of these cells. Next, many of the previously sessile macrophages break loose from their attachments and become mobile, forming the first line of defense against infection during the first hour or so. The numbers of these early mobilized macrophages often are not great, but they are lifesaving.

Neutrophil Invasion of the Inflamed Area Is a Second Line of Defense. Within the first hour or so after inflammation begins, large numbers of neutrophils begin to invade the inflamed area from the blood. This invasion is caused by inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1) and other biochemical products produced by the inflamed tissues that initiate the following reactions:

![gu1477962137](gu1477962137.jpg)

Figure 34-7. Migration of neutrophils from the blood into inflamed tissue. Cytokines and other biochemical products of the inflamed tissue cause increased expression of selectins and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the surface of endothelial cells. These adhesion molecules bind to complementary molecules or receptors on the neutrophil, causing it to adhere to the wall of the capillary or venule. The neutrophil then migrates through the vessel wall by diapedesis or extravasation toward the site of tissue injury.

1. They cause increased expression of adhesion molecules, such as selectins and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the surface of endothelial cells in the capillaries and venules. These adhesion molecules, reacting with complementary integrin molecules on the neutrophils, cause the neutrophils to stick to the capillary and venule walls in the inflamed area. This effect is called margination and is shown in Figure 34-2 and in more detail in Figure 34-7.
2. They also cause the intercellular attachments between the endothelial cells of the capillaries and small venules to loosen, allowing openings large enough for neutrophils to crawl through the capillaries by diapedesis into the tissue spaces.
3. They then cause chemotaxis of the neutrophils toward the injured tissues, as explained earlier. The entire process of neutrophil (or other substances and cells such as monocytes) translocation through the capillaries into the tissues surrounding them is called extravasation; the specific passage of blood cells through the intact walls of the capillaries is called diapedesis, although this term is often used interchangeably with extravasation when discussing blood cell movement through the capillaries into tissues.
Thus, within several hours after tissue damage begins, the area becomes well supplied with neutrophils. Because the blood neutrophils are already mature cells, they are ready to begin their scavenger functions of killing bacteria and removing foreign matter immediately.

Acute Increase in the Number of Neutrophils in Blood-Neutrophilia. Also, within a few hours after the onset of acute severe inflammation, the number of
neutrophils in the blood sometimes increases fourfold to fivefold-from a normal of 4,000 to 5,000 to 15,000 to 25,000 neutrophils $/ \mu \mathrm{l}$. This is called neutrophilia, which means an increase in the number of neutrophils in the blood. Neutrophilia is caused by products of inflammation that enter the blood stream, are transported to the bone marrow, and act there on the stored neutrophils of the marrow to mobilize these into the circulating blood. This makes even more neutrophils available to the inflamed tissue area.

Second Macrophage Invasion Into the Inflamed Tissue Is a Third Line of Defense. Along with the invasion of neutrophils, monocytes from the blood enter the inflamed tissue and enlarge to become macrophages. However, the number of monocytes in the circulating blood is low. Also, the storage pool of monocytes in the bone marrow is much less than that of neutrophils. Therefore, the buildup of macrophages in the inflamed tissue area is much slower than that of neutrophils, requiring several days to become effective. Furthermore, even after invading the inflamed tissue, monocytes are still immature cells, requiring 8 hours or more to swell to much larger sizes and develop tremendous quantities of lysosomes. Only then do they acquire the full capacity of tissue macrophages for phagocytosis. After several days to several weeks, the macrophages finally come to dominate the phagocytic cells of the inflamed area because of greatly increased bone marrow production of new monocytes, as explained later.

As already noted, macrophages can phagocytize far more bacteria (about five times as many) and far larger particles, including even neutrophils and large quantities of necrotic tissue, than can neutrophils. Also, the macrophages play an important role in initiating development of antibodies, as discussed in Chapter 35.

![gu1577962137](gu1577962137.jpg)

Increased Production of Granulocytes and Monocytes by Bone Marrow Is a Fourth Line of Defense. The fourth line of defense is greatly increased production of granulocytes and monocytes by the bone marrow. This action results from stimulation of the granulocytic and monocytic progenitor cells of the marrow. However, it takes 3 to 4 days before newly formed granulocytes and monocytes reach the stage of leaving the bone marrow. If the stimulus from the inflamed tissue continues, the bone marrow can continue to produce these cells in large quantities for months and even years, sometimes at a rate 20 to 50 times normal.

## Feedback Control of Macrophage and Neutrophil Responses

Although more than two dozen factors have been implicated in control of the macrophage response to inflammation, five of these are believed to play dominant roles. They are shown in Figure 34-8 and consist of the following: (1) tumor necrosis factor (TNF); (2) interleukin-1 (IL-1), (3) granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF): (4) granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); and (5) monocyte colony-stimulating factor (MCSF). These factors are formed by activated macrophage cells in the inflamed tissues and in smaller quantities by other inflamed tissue cells.

The cause of increased production of granulocytes and monocytes by the bone marrow is mainly the three
colony-stimulating factors; one of these, GM-CSF, stimulates both granulocyte and monocyte production; the other two, G-CSF and M-CSF, stimulate granulocyte and monocyte production, respectively. This combination of TNF, IL-1, and colony-stimulating factors provides a powerful feedback mechanism that begins with tissue inflammation and proceeds to formation of large numbers of defensive WBCs that help remove the cause of the inflammation.

## Formation of Pus

When neutrophils and macrophages engulf large numbers of bacteria and necrotic tissue, essentially all the neutrophils and many, if not most, of the macrophages eventually die. After several days, a cavity is often excavated in the inflamed tissues. This cavity contains varying portions of necrotic tissue, dead neutrophils, dead macrophages, and tissue fluid. This mixture is commonly known as pus. After the infection has been suppressed, the dead cells and necrotic tissue in the pus gradually autolyze over a period of days, and the end products are eventually absorbed into the surrounding tissues and lymph until most of the evidence of tissue damage is gone.

## EOSINOPHILS

The eosinophils normally constitute about $2 \%$ of all the blood leukocytes. Eosinophils are weak phagocytes, and they exhibit chemotaxis, but in comparison with neutrophils, it is doubtful that eosinophils are significant in protecting against the usual types of infection.

Eosinophils, however, are often produced in large numbers in people with parasitic infections, and they migrate into tissues diseased by parasites. Although most parasites are too large to be phagocytized by eosinophils or any other phagocytic cells, eosinophils attach themselves to the parasites by way of special surface molecules and release substances that kill many of the parasites. For example, one of the most widespread infections is schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection found in as many as onethird of the population of some developing countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. An estimated 85\% to $90 \%$ of the world's cases of schistosomiasis are in Africa.

The schistosome parasitic worms can invade any part of the body. Eosinophils attach themselves to the juvenile forms of the parasite and kill many of them. They do so in several ways: (1) by releasing hydrolytic enzymes from their granules, which are modified lysosomes; (2) probably also by releasing highly reactive forms of oxygen that are especially lethal to parasites; and (3) by releasing from the granules a highly larvicidal polypeptide called major basic protein.

In a few areas of the world, another parasitic disease that causes eosinophilia is trichinosis. This disease results from invasion of the body's muscles by the Trichinella parasite (pork worm) after a person eats undercooked infested pork.

Eosinophils also have a special propensity to collect in tissues in which allergic reactions occur, such as in the peribronchial tissues of the lungs in people with asthma and in the skin after an allergic skin reaction. This action is caused at least partly by the fact that many mast cells and basophils participate in allergic reactions, as discussed in the next paragraph. The mast cells and basophils release an eosinophil chemotactic factor that causes eosinophils to migrate toward the inflamed allergic tissue. The eosinophils are believed to detoxify some of the inflammation-inducing substances released by the mast cells and basophils and probably also phagocytize and destroy allergen-antibody complexes, thus preventing excess spread of the local inflammatory process.

## BASOPHILS

The basophils in the circulating blood are similar to the large tissue mast cells located immediately outside many of the capillaries in the body. Both mast cells and basophils liberate heparin into the blood. Heparin is a substance that can prevent blood coagulation.

The mast cells and basophils also release histamine, as well as smaller quantities of bradykinin and serotonin. It is mainly the mast cells in inflamed tissues that release these substances during inflammation.

The mast cells and basophils play an important role in some types of allergic reactions because the type of antibody that causes allergic reactions, immunoglobulin E (IgE), has a special propensity to become attached to mast cells and basophils. Then, when the specific antigen for the specific IgE antibody subsequently reacts with the antibody, the resulting attachment of antigen to antibody causes the mast cell or basophil to release increased quantities of histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, heparin, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (a mixture of three leukotrienes), and several lysosomal enzymes. These substances cause local vascular and tissue reactions that mediate many, if not most, of the allergic manifestations. These reactions are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 35.

## LEUKOPENIA

A clinical condition known as leukopenia, in which the bone marrow produces very few WBCs, occasionally occurs. This condition leaves the body unprotected against many bacteria and other agents that might invade the tissues.

Normally, the human body lives in symbiosis with many bacteria because the mucous membranes of the body are constantly exposed to large numbers of bacteria. The mouth almost always contains various spirochetal, pneumococcal, and streptococcal bacteria, and these same bacteria are present to a lesser extent in the entire respiratory tract. The distal gastrointestinal tract is especially loaded with colon bacilli. Furthermore, one can
always find bacteria on the surfaces of the eyes, urethra, and vagina. Any decrease in the number of WBCs immediately allows invasion of adjacent tissues by bacteria that are already present.

Within 2 days after the bone marrow stops producing WBCs, ulcers may appear in the mouth and colon, or some form of severe respiratory infection might develop. Bacteria from the ulcers rapidly invade surrounding tissues and the blood. Without treatment, death often ensues in less than 1 week after acute total leukopenia begins.

Irradiation of the body by x-rays or gamma rays, or exposure to drugs and chemicals that contain benzene or anthracene nuclei, is likely to cause aplasia of the bone marrow. Some common drugs such as chloramphenicol (an antibiotic), thiouracil (used to treat thyrotoxicosis), and even various barbiturate hypnotics on rare occasions cause leukopenia, thus setting off the entire infectious sequence of this disorder.

After moderate irradiation injury to the bone marrow, some stem cells, myeloblasts, and hemocytoblasts may remain undestroyed in the marrow and are capable of regenerating the bone marrow, provided sufficient time is available. A patient properly treated with transfusions, plus antibiotics and other drugs to ward off infection, usually develops enough new bone marrow within weeks to months for blood cell concentrations to return to normal.

## LEUKEMIAS

Uncontrolled production of WBCs can be caused by cancerous mutation of a myelogenous or lymphogenous cell. This process causes leukemia, which is usually characterized by greatly increased numbers of abnormal WBCs in the circulating blood.

There are two general types of leukemia, lymphocytic and myelogenous. The lymphocytic leukemias are caused by cancerous production of lymphoid cells, usually beginning in a lymph node or other lymphocytic tissue and spreading to other areas of the body. The second type of leukemia, myelogenous leukemia, begins by cancerous production of young myelogenous cells in the bone marrow and then spreads throughout the body so that WBCs are produced in many extramedullary tissues-especially in the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver.

In myelogenous leukemia, the cancerous process occasionally produces partially differentiated cells, resulting in what might be called neutrophilic leukemia, eosinophilic leukemia, basophilic leukemia, or monocytic leukemia. More frequently, however, the leukemia cells are bizarre and undifferentiated and not identical to any of the normal WBCs. Usually, the more undifferentiated the cell, the more acute is the leukemia, often leading to death within a few months if untreated. With some of the more differentiated cells, the process can be chronic, sometimes developing slowly over 10 to 20 years. Leukemic cells, especially the very undifferentiated cells, are usually nonfunctional for providing normal protection against infection.

## Effects of Leukemia on the Body

The first effect of leukemia is metastatic growth of leukemic cells in abnormal areas of the body. Leukemic cells from the bone marrow may reproduce so much that they invade the surrounding bone, causing pain and, eventually, a tendency for bones to fracture easily.

Almost all leukemias eventually spread to the spleen, lymph nodes, liver, and other vascular regions, regardless of whether the leukemia originated in the bone marrow or lymph nodes. Common effects in leukemia are the development of infection, severe anemia, and a bleeding tendency caused by thrombocytopenia (lack of platelets). These effects result mainly from displacement of the normal bone marrow and lymphoid cells by the nonfunctional leukemic cells.

Finally, an important effect of leukemia on the body is excessive use of metabolic substrates by the growing cancerous cells. The leukemic tissues reproduce new cells so rapidly that tremendous demands are made on the body reserves for foodstuffs, specific amino acids, and vitamins. Consequently, the energy of the patient is greatly depleted, and excessive utilization of amino acids by leukemic cells causes especially rapid deterioration of the normal protein tissues of the body. Thus, while the leukemic tissues grow, other tissues become debilitated. After metabolic starvation has continued long enough, this factor alone is sufficient to cause death.

# Resistance of the Body to Infection: II. Immunity and Allergy 

The human body has the ability to resist almost all types of organisms or toxins that tend to damage the tissues and organs. This capability is called immunity. Much of the immunity is acquired immunity that does not develop until after the body is first attacked by a bacterium, virus, or toxin; often, weeks or months are required for the immunity to develop. An additional element of immunity that results from general processes, rather than from processes directed at specific disease organisms, is called innate immunity, which includes the following aspects:

1. Phagocytosis of bacteria and other invaders by white blood cells and cells of the tissue macrophage system, as described in Chapter 34
2. Destruction of swallowed organisms by the acid secretions of the stomach and the digestive enzymes
3. Resistance of the skin to invasion by organisms
4. Presence in the blood of certain chemicals and cells that attach to foreign organisms or toxins and destroy them. Some of these are: (1) lysozyme, a mucolytic polysaccharide that attacks bacteria and causes them to dissolute; (2) basic polypeptides, which react with and inactivate certain types of gram-positive bacteria; (3) the complement complex, described later, a system of about 20 proteins that can be activated in various ways to destroy bacteria; and (4) natural killer lymphocytes that can recognize and destroy foreign cells, tumor cells, and even some infected cells.
This innate immunity makes the human body resistant to diseases such as some paralytic viral infections of animals, hog cholera, cattle plague, and distemper-a viral disease that kills a large percentage of dogs that become afflicted with it. Likewise, many animals are resistant or even immune to many human diseases, such as poliomyelitis, mumps, human cholera, measles, and syphilis, which are very damaging or even lethal to humans.

## ACQUIRED (ADAPTIVE) IMMUNITY

In addition to its generalized innate immunity, the human body has the ability to develop extremely powerful specific immunity against individual invading agents such as lethal bacteria, viruses, toxins, and even foreign tissues from other animals. This ability is called acquired
or adaptive immunity. Acquired immunity is caused by a special immune system that forms antibodies and/or activated lymphocytes that attack and destroy the specific invading organism or toxin.

Acquired immunity can often bestow an extreme degree of protection. For example, certain toxins, such as the paralytic botulinum toxin or the tetanizing toxin of tetanus, can be protected against in doses as high as 100,000 times the amount that would be lethal without immunity. It is for this reason that the treatment process known as immunization is so important in protecting people against disease and against toxins, as explained later in this chapter.

## BASIC TYPES OF ACQUIRED IMMUNITYHUMORAL AND CELL-MEDIATED

Two basic but closely allied types of acquired immunity occur in the body. In one of these, the body develops circulating antibodies, which are globulin molecules in the blood plasma capable of attacking the invading agent. This type of immunity is called humoral immunity or B-cell immunity because B lymphocytes produce the antibodies. The second type of acquired immunity is achieved through formation of large numbers of activated $T$ lymphocytes, which are specifically crafted in the lymph nodes to destroy the foreign agent. This type of immunity is called cell-mediated immunity or T-cell immunity because the activated lymphocytes are T lymphocytes. Both the antibodies and activated lymphocytes are formed in the lymphoid tissues of the body.

## BOTH TYPES OF ACQUIRED IMMUNITY ARE INITIATED BY ANTIGENS

Because acquired immunity does not develop until after invasion by a foreign organism or toxin, it is clear that the body must have some mechanism for recognizing this invasion. Each toxin or organism almost always contains one or more specific chemical compounds in its makeup that is (are) different from all other compounds. In general, these are proteins or large polysaccharides that initiate the acquired immunity; these substances are called antigens (antibody generators).

For a substance to be antigenic, it usually must have a high molecular weight of 8000 or more. Furthermore, the process of antigenicity usually depends on regularly recurring molecular groups, called epitopes, on the surface of the large molecule. This factor also explains why proteins and large polysaccharides are almost always antigenic because both these substances have this stereochemical characteristic.

## LYMPHOCYTES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNITY

Acquired immunity is the product of the body's lymphocytes. In people who have a genetic lack of lymphocytes or whose lymphocytes have been destroyed by radiation or chemicals, no acquired immunity can develop. Within days after birth, such a person dies of fulminating bacterial infection unless he or she is treated by heroic measures. Therefore, it is clear that lymphocytes are essential to the survival of humans.

Lymphocytes are located most extensively in the lymph nodes, but are also found in special lymphoid tissues such as the spleen, submucosal areas of the gastrointestinal tract, thymus, and bone marrow. The lymphoid tissue is distributed advantageously in the body to intercept invading organisms or toxins before they can spread too widely.

In most cases, the invading agent first enters the tissue fluids and then is carried by lymph vessels to the lymph node or other lymphoid tissue. For example, the lymphoid tissue of the gastrointestinal walls is exposed immediately to antigens invading from the gut. The lymphoid tissue of the throat and pharynx (including the tonsils and adenoids) is well located to intercept antigens that enter by way of the upper respiratory tract. The lymphoid tissue in the lymph nodes is exposed to antigens that invade the peripheral tissues of the body, and the lymphoid tissue of
the spleen, thymus, and bone marrow plays the specific role of intercepting antigenic agents that have succeeded in reaching the circulating blood.

T and B Lymphocytes Promote Cell-Mediated and Humoral Immunity. Although most lymphocytes in normal lymphoid tissue look alike when studied under a microscope, these cells are distinctly divided into two major populations. One of the populations, the $T$ lymphocytes, is responsible for forming the activated lymphocytes that provide cell-mediated immunity, and the other population, the $B$ lymphocytes, is responsible for forming antibodies that provide humoral immunity.

Both types of lymphocytes are derived originally in the embryo from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells that form common lymphoid progenitor cells as one of their most important offspring as they differentiate. Almost all the lymphocytes that are formed eventually end up in the lymphoid tissue, but before doing so, they are further differentiated or preprocessed in the following ways.

The lymphoid progenitor cells that are eventually destined to form activated T lymphocytes first migrate to and are preprocessed in the thymus gland; thus, they are called $T$ lymphocytes to designate the role of the thymus. They are responsible for cell-mediated immunity.

The other population of lymphocytes-the B lymphocytes that are destined to form antibodies-are preprocessed in the liver during mid-fetal life and in the bone marrow in late fetal life and after birth. This population of cells was first discovered in birds, which have a special preprocessing organ called the bursa of Fabricius. For this reason, these lymphocytes are called $B$ lymphocytes to designate the role of the bursa, and they are responsible for humoral immunity. Figure 35-1 shows the two lymphocyte systems for formation, respectively, of (1) activated T lymphocytes and (2) antibodies.
![gu1677962137](gu1677962137.jpg)

Figure 35-1. Formation of antibodies and sensitized lymphocytes by a lymph node in response to antigens. This figure also shows the origin of thymic $(T)$ and bursal $(B)$ lymphocytes that, respectively, are responsible for the cell-mediated and humoral immune processes.

## PREPROCESSING OF T AND B LYMPHOCYTES

Although all lymphocytes in the body originate from lymphocyte-committed stem cells of the embryo, these stem cells are incapable of forming activated T lymphocytes or antibodies directly. Before they can do so, they must be further differentiated in appropriate processing areas, as follows.

Thymus Gland Preprocesses T Lymphocytes. The T lymphocytes, after origination in the bone marrow, first migrate to the thymus gland. Here they divide rapidly and, at the same time, develop extreme diversity for reacting against different specific antigens. That is, one thymic lymphocyte develops specific reactivity against one antigen, and then the next lymphocyte develops specificity against another antigen. This process continues until there are thousands of different types of thymic lymphocytes with specific reactivities against many thousands of different antigens. These different types of preprocessed T lymphocytes now leave the thymus and spread via the blood throughout the body to lodge in lymphoid tissue everywhere.

The thymus also makes certain that any T lymphocytes leaving the thymus will not react against proteins or other antigens that are present in the body's own tissues; otherwise, the T lymphocytes would be lethal to the person's own body in only a few days. The thymus selects which T lymphocytes will be released by first mixing them with virtually all the specific self-antigens from the body's own tissues. If a T lymphocyte reacts, it is destroyed and phagocytized instead of being released, which happens in to up to $90 \%$ of the cells. Thus, the only cells that are finally released are those that are nonreactive against the body's own antigens-they react only against antigens from an outside source, such as from a bacterium, toxin, or even transplanted tissue from another person.

Most of the preprocessing of T lymphocytes in the thymus occurs shortly before the birth of a baby and for a few months after birth. Beyond this period, removal of the thymus gland diminishes (but does not eliminate) the T-lymphocytic immune system. However, removal of the thymus several months before birth can prevent development of all cell-mediated immunity, including rejection of transplanted organs.

## Liver and Bone Marrow Preprocess B Lymphocytes.

In humans, B lymphocytes are preprocessed in the liver during midfetal life and in the bone marrow during late fetal life and after birth. B lymphocytes are different from T lymphocytes in two ways:

1. Instead of the whole cell developing reactivity against the antigen, as occurs for the T lymphocytes, the B lymphocytes actively secrete antibodies that are the reactive agents. These agents are large proteins that are capable of combining with and destroying the antigenic substance, explained elsewhere in this chapter and in Chapter 34.
2. The B lymphocytes have even greater diversity than the T lymphocytes, thus forming many millions of types of B-lymphocyte antibodies with different specific reactivities. After preprocessing, the B lymphocytes, like the T lymphocytes, migrate to lymphoid tissue throughout the body, where they lodge near but slightly removed from the T-lymphocyte areas.

## T LYMPHOCYTES AND B-LYMPHOCYTE ANTIBODIES REACT AGAINST SPECIFIC ANTIGENS—ROLE OF LYMPHOCYTE CLONES

When specific antigens come into contact with T and B lymphocytes in the lymphoid tissue, some of the T lymphocytes become activated to form activated T cells, and some of the B lymphocytes become activated to form antibodies. The activated T cells and antibodies, in turn, react highly specifically against the particular types of antigens that initiated their development. The mechanism of this specificity is described next.

Millions of Specific Types of Lymphocytes Are Stored in Lymphoid Tissue. Millions of different types of preformed B lymphocytes and preformed T lymphocytes capable of forming highly specific types of antibodies or T cells are stored in the lymph tissue, as explained earlier. Each of these preformed lymphocytes is capable of forming only one type of antibody or one type of T cell with a single type of specificity, and only the specific type of antigen can activate it. Once the specific lymphocyte is activated by its antigen, it reproduces wildly, forming tremendous numbers of duplicate lymphocytes (Figure 35-2). If it is a B lymphocyte, its progeny will eventually secrete the specific type of antibody that then circulates throughout the body. If it is a T lymphocyte, its progeny are specific sensitized T cells that are released into the lymph, carried to the blood, and then circulated through all the tissue fluids and back into the lymph, sometimes circulating around and around in this circuit for months or years.

All the different lymphocytes that are capable of forming one specific antibody or T cell are called a clone of lymphocytes. That is, the lymphocytes in each clone are alike, derived originally from one or a few early lymphocytes of its specific type.

## ORIGIN OF THE MANY CLONES OF LYMPHOCYTES

Only several hundred to a few thousand genes code for the millions of different types of antibodies and T lymphocytes. At first, it was a mystery how it was possible for so few genes to code for the millions of different specificities of antibodies or T cells produced by the lymphoid tissue. This mystery has now been solved.

The whole gene for forming each type of T cell or B cell is never present in the original stem cells from which the functional immune cells are formed. Instead, there are only gene segments-actually, hundreds of such seg-ments-but not whole genes. During preprocessing of

![gu1777962137](gu1777962137.jpg)

Figure 35-2. An antigen activates only the lymphocytes that have cell surface receptors that are complementary and recognize a specific antigen. Millions of different clones of lymphocytes exist (shown as $B_{1}, B_{2}$, and $B_{3}$ ). When the lymphocyte clone ( $B_{2}$ in this example) is activated by its antigen, it reproduces to form large numbers of duplicate lymphocytes, which then secrete antibodies.
the respective T- and B-cell lymphocytes, these gene segments become mixed with one another in random combinations, finally forming whole genes.

Because there are several hundred types of gene segments, as well as millions of different combinations in which the segments can be arranged in single cells, one can understand the millions of different cell gene types that can occur. For each functional T or B lymphocyte that is finally formed, the gene structure codes for only a single antigen specificity. These mature cells then become the highly specific T and B cells that spread to and populate the lymphoid tissue.

## MECHANISM FOR ACTIVATING LYMPHOCYTE CLONES

Each clone of lymphocytes is responsive to only a single type of antigen (or to several similar antigens that have
almost exactly the same stereochemical characteristics). The reason for this is the following. In the case of the B lymphocytes, each of these has on its cell surface membrane about 100,000 antibody molecules that will react highly specifically with only one type of antigen. Therefore, when the appropriate antigen comes along, it immediately attaches to the antibody in the cell membrane; this leads to the activation process, described in more detail subsequently. In the case of the T lymphocytes, molecules similar to antibodies, called surface receptor proteins (or T-cell receptors), are on the surface of the T-cell membrane, and these are also highly specific for one specified activating antigen. An antigen therefore stimulates only those cells that have complementary receptors for the antigen and are already committed to respond to it.

Role of Macrophages in the Activation Process. Aside from the lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue, literally millions of macrophages are also present in the same tissue. These macrophages line the sinusoids of the lymph nodes, spleen, and other lymphoid tissue, and they lie in apposition to many of the lymph node lymphocytes. Most invading organisms are first phagocytized and partially digested by the macrophages, and the antigenic products are liberated into the macrophage cytosol. The macrophages then pass these antigens by cell to cell contact directly to the lymphocytes, thus leading to activation of the specified lymphocytic clones. The macrophages, in addition, secrete a special activating substance, interleukin-1, that promotes still further growth and reproduction of the specific lymphocytes.

Role of T Cells in Activation of B Lymphocytes. Most antigens activate both T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes at the same time. Some of the T cells that are formed, called T-helper cells, secrete specific substances (collectively called lymphokines) that activate the specific B lymphocytes. Indeed, without the aid of these T-helper cells, the quantity of antibodies formed by the B lymphocytes is usually small. We discuss this cooperative relationship between helper T cells and B cells after describing the mechanisms of the T-cell system of immunity.

## SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES OF THE B-LYMPHOCYTE SYSTEM—HUMORAL IMMUNITY AND ANTIBODIES

Antibody Formation by Plasma Cells. Before exposure to a specific antigen, the clones of B lymphocytes remain dormant in the lymphoid tissue. On entry of a foreign antigen, macrophages in lymphoid tissue phagocytize the antigen and then present it to adjacent B lymphocytes. In addition, the antigen is presented to T cells at the same time, and activated T-helper cells are formed. These helper cells also contribute to extreme activation of the B lymphocytes, as discussed later.

The B lymphocytes specific for the antigen immediately enlarge and take on the appearance of lymphoblasts.

Some of the lymphoblasts further differentiate to form plasmablasts, which are precursors of plasma cells. In the plasmablasts, the cytoplasm expands, and the rough endoplasmic reticulum proliferates vastly. The plasmablasts then begin to divide at a rate of about once every 10 hours for about nine divisions, giving a total population of about 500 cells for each original plasmablast in 4 days. The mature plasma cell then produces gamma globulin antibodies at an extremely rapid rate-about 2000 molecules per second for each plasma cell. In turn, the antibodies are secreted into the lymph and carried to the circulating blood. This process continues for several days or weeks until, finally, exhaustion and death of the plasma cells occur.

Formation of Memory Cells Enhances Antibody Response to Subsequent Antigen Exposure. A few of the lymphoblasts formed by activation of a clone of B lymphocytes do not go on to form plasma cells but, instead, form moderate numbers of new B lymphocytes similar to those of the original clone. In other words, the B-cell population of the specifically activated clone becomes greatly enhanced, and the new B lymphocytes are added to the original lymphocytes of the same clone. They also circulate throughout the body to populate all the lymphoid tissue; immunologically, however, they remain dormant until activated once again by a new quantity of the same antigen. These lymphocytes are called memory cells. Subsequent exposure to the same antigen will cause a much more rapid and potent antibody response this second time around because there are many more memory cells than there were original B lymphocytes of the specific clone.

Figure 35-3 shows the differences between the primary response for forming antibodies that occurs on first exposure to a specific antigen and the secondary response that occurs after second exposure to the same antigen. Note the 1-week delay in the appearance of the primary response, its weak potency, and its short life. The secondary response, by contrast, begins rapidly after exposure to the antigen
![gu1877962137](gu1877962137.jpg)

Figure 35-3. Time course of the antibody response in the circulating blood to a primary injection of antigen and to a secondary injection several weeks later.
(often within hours), is far more potent, and forms antibodies for many months rather than for only a few weeks. The increased potency and duration of the secondary response explain why immunization is usually accomplished by injecting antigen in multiple doses, with periods of several weeks or several months between injections.

Generation of Lifelong Immunity by Plasma Cells. When naïve B lymphocytes encounter their associated antigens, become activated, and undergo clonal expansion, they differentiate into short-lived or long-lived plasma cells that produce large amounts of antibodies. The short-lived plasma cells provide rapid protection but undergo apoptosis after a few days of intense antibody secretion. However, the long-lived plasma cells reside in tissues such as the bone marrow and gut-associated lymphoid tissue and can continue producing antibodies for many years, providing lifelong immunity against infectious diseases such as measles and smallpox. High titers of smallpox-specific antibodies, for example, have been detected in the blood of subjects vaccinated in childhood, 70 years previously. Also, older survivors of the 1918 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic were shown to possess highly functional, virus-neutralizing antibodies to this virulent virus 90 years after they were infected. Thus, plasma cells that produce virus-neutralizing antibodies can be sustained for many decades after exposure, even into the tenth decade of life in humans.

## Nature of Antibodies

Antibodies are gamma globulins called immunoglobulins (Igs) that have molecular weights between 160,000 and 970,000 and constitute about $20 \%$ of all the plasma proteins. All the immunoglobulins are composed of combinations of light and heavy polypeptide chains. Most are a combination of two light and two heavy chains, as shown in Figure 35-4. However, some immunoglobulins have
![gu1977962137](gu1977962137.jpg)

Figure 35-4. Structure of the typical IgG antibody, showing it to be composed of two heavy polypeptide chains and two light polypeptide chains. The antigen binds at two different sites on the variable portions of the chains.

combinations of as many as 10 heavy and 10 light chains, which give rise to high-molecular-weight immunoglobulins. Yet, in all immunoglobulins, each heavy chain is paralleled by a light chain at one of its ends, thus forming a heavy-light pair; there are always at least two and as many as 10 such pairs in each immunoglobulin molecule.

Figure 35-4 shows a designated end of each light and heavy chain, called the variable portion; the remainder of each chain is called the constant portion. The variable portion is different for each specific antibody, and it is this portion that attaches specifically to a particular type of antigen. The constant portion determines other properties of the antibody, establishing such factors as antibody diffusivity in the tissues, adherence to specific structures in the tissues, attachment to the complement complex, ease with which the antibodies pass through membranes, and other biological properties of the antibody. A combination of noncovalent and covalent bonds (disulfide) holds the light and heavy chains together.
Specificity of Antibodies. Each antibody is specific for a particular antigen; this characteristic is a result of the unique structural organization of amino acids in the variable portions of the light and heavy chains. The amino acid organization has a different steric shape for each antigen specificity, so when an antigen comes into contact with it, multiple prosthetic groups of the antigen fit as a mirror image with those of the antibody, thus allowing for rapid and tight bonding between the antibody and antigen. When the antibody is highly specific, there are so many bonding sites that the antibody-antigen coupling is exceedingly strong, held together by (1) hydrophobic bonding; (2) hydrogen bonding; (3) ionic attractions; and (4) van der Waals forces. It also obeys the thermodynamic mass action law:

$$
\mathrm{k}_{\mathrm{a}}=\frac{\text { Concentration of bound antibody-antigen }}{\text { Concentration of antibody }} \times \text { Concentration of antigen }
$$

$\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}$ is called the affinity constant and is a measure of how tightly the antibody binds with the antigen.

Note especially in Figure 35-4 that there are two variable sites on the illustrated antibody for attachment of antigens, making this type of antibody bivalent. A small proportion of the antibodies, which consist of combinations of up to 10 light and 10 heavy chains, has as many as 10 binding sites.

Five General Classes of Antibodies. There are five general classes of antibodies, respectively named $\operatorname{IgM}, \operatorname{IgG}$, $\operatorname{Ig} A, \operatorname{Ig} D$, and $\operatorname{IgE}$."Ig" stands for immunoglobulin, and the other five letters designate the respective classes.

For the purpose of our limited discussion, two of these classes of antibodies are of particular importance-IgG, which is a bivalent antibody and constitutes about $75 \%$ of the antibodies of the normal person, and IgE, which constitutes only a small percentage of the antibodies but

is especially involved in allergies. The IgM class is also interesting because a large share of the antibodies formed during the primary response are of this type. These antibodies have 10 binding sites that make them exceedingly effective in protecting the body against invaders, even though there are not many IgM antibodies.

## Mechanisms of Action of Antibodies

Antibodies act mainly in two ways to protect the body against invading agents: (1) by direct attack on the invader; and (2) by activation of the complement system that then has multiple means of its own for destroying the invader.

Direct Action of Antibodies on Invading Agents. Figure 35-5 shows antibodies (designated by the red Yshaped bars) reacting with antigens (designated by the shaded objects). Because of the bivalent nature of the antibodies and the multiple antigen sites on most invading agents, the antibodies can inactivate the invading agent in one of several ways, as follows:

1. Agglutination, in which multiple large particles with antigens on their surfaces (e.g., bacteria or red cells) are bound together into a clump
2. Precipitation, in which the molecular complex of soluble antigen (e.g., tetanus toxin) and antibody becomes so large that it is rendered insoluble and precipitates
3. Neutralization, in which the antibodies cover the toxic sites of the antigenic agent
4. Lysis, in which some potent antibodies are occasionally capable of directly attacking membranes of cellular agents and thereby cause rupture of the agent These direct actions of antibodies often are not strong enough to play a major role in protecting the body against the invader. Most of the protection occurs through the amplifying effects of the complement system, described next.

## COMPLEMENT SYSTEM FOR ANTIBODY ACTION

The main function of the complement system is to enhance (complement) the actions of antibodies and phagocytic cells in neutralizing and destroying pathogens, removing damaged cells from the body, and promoting inflammation. Complement is a collective term that describes a system of about 20 proteins, many of which are enzyme precursors. The principal actors in this system are 11 proteins designated C 1 through C 9 , B, and D, shown in Figure 35-6. All these are present normally among the plasma proteins in the blood, as well as among the proteins that leak out of the capillaries into the tissue spaces. The enzyme precursors are normally inactive but can be activated by the so-called classical pathway.
Classical Pathway. The classical pathway is initiated by an antigen-antibody reaction. That is, when an antibody binds with an antigen, a specific reactive site on the constant portion of the antibody becomes uncovered, or activated, and this in turn binds directly with the C 1 molecule of the complement system. This sets into motion a cascade of sequential reactions, shown in Figure 35-6, beginning with activation of the proenzyme C1. The C1 enzymes that are formed then activate successively increasing quantities of enzymes in the later stages of the system so that from a small beginning, an extremely large, amplified reaction occurs. Multiple end products are formed, as shown at the right in the figure, and several of these have important effects that help prevent damage to the body's tissues caused by the invading organism or toxin. Among the more important effects are the following:

1. Opsonization and phagocytosis. One of the products of the complement cascade, C3b, strongly activates phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages,
causing these cells to engulf the bacteria to which the antigen-antibody complexes are attached. This process is called opsonization. It often enhances the number of bacteria that can be destroyed by many hundredfold.
2. Lysis. One of the most important of all the products of the complement cascade is the membrane attack complex (also called the cytolytic complex), which is a combination of multiple complement factors designated as C5b6789. This membrane attack complex inserts itself into the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, creating pores that are permeable to ions and causing osmotic rupture of the cell membranes of bacteria or other invading organisms.
3. Agglutination. The complement products also change the surfaces of the invading organisms, causing them to adhere to one another, thus promoting agglutination.
4. Neutralization of viruses. The complement enzymes and other complement products can attack the structures of some viruses and thereby render them nonvirulent.
5. Chemotaxis. Fragment C5a initiates chemotaxis of neutrophils and macrophages, thus causing large numbers of these phagocytes to migrate into the tissue area adjacent to the antigenic agent.
6. Activation of mast cells and basophils. Fragments C3a, C4a, and C5a activate mast cells and basophils, causing them to release histamine, heparin, and several other substances into the local fluids. These substances, in turn, cause increased local blood flow, increased leakage of fluid and plasma protein into the tissue, and other local tissue reactions that help inactivate or immobilize the antigenic agent. These same factors play a major role in inflammation (discussed in Chapter 34) and allergy, discussed later.
![gu2177962137](gu2177962137.jpg)

Figure 35-6. Cascade of reactions during activation of the classical pathway of complement.

7. Inflammatory effects. In addition to inflammatory effects caused by activation of the mast cells and basophils, several other complement products contribute to local inflammation. These products cause (1) the already increased blood flow to increase still further; (2) the capillary leakage of proteins to be increased; and (3) the interstitial fluid proteins to coagulate in the tissue spaces, thus preventing movement of the invading organism through the tissues.

## SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES OF T-LYMPHOCYTE SYSTEM-ACTIVATED T CELLS AND CELLMEDIATED IMMUNITY

Release of Activated T Cells From Lymphoid Tissue and Formation of Memory Cells. On exposure to the proper antigen, as presented by adjacent macrophages, the T lymphocytes of a specific lymphocyte clone proliferate and release large numbers of activated, specifically reacting T cells in ways that parallel antibody release by activated B cells. The principal difference is that instead of releasing antibodies, whole activated T cells are formed and released into the lymph. These T cells then pass into the circulation, are distributed throughout the body, pass through the capillary walls into the tissue spaces, back into the lymph and blood again, and circulate again and again throughout the body, sometimes lasting for months or even years.

Also, T-lymphocyte memory cells are formed in the same way that B memory cells are formed in the antibody system. That is, when a clone of T lymphocytes is activated by an antigen, many of the newly formed lymphocytes are preserved in the lymphoid tissue to become additional T lymphocytes of that specific clone; in fact, these memory cells even spread throughout the lymphoid tissue of the entire body. Therefore, on subsequent exposure to the same antigen anywhere in the body, release of activated T cells occurs far more rapidly and much more powerfully than during first exposure.

Antigen-Presenting Cells, Major Histocompatibility Complex Proteins, and Antigen Receptors on T Lymphocytes. T-cell responses are extremely antigenspecific, like the antibody responses of B cells, and are at least as important as antibodies in defending against infection. In fact, acquired immune responses usually require assistance from T cells to begin the process, and T cells play a major role in helping eliminate invading pathogens.

Although B lymphocytes recognize intact antigens, T lymphocytes respond to antigens only when they are bound to specific molecules called MHC proteins on the surface of antigen-presenting cells in the lymphoid tissues (Figure 35-7). The three major types of antigenpresenting cells are macrophages, B lymphocytes, and dendritic cells. The dendritic cells (also known as accessory cells), the most potent of the antigen-presenting cells, are located throughout the body, and their main function is
![gu2277962137](gu2277962137.jpg)

Figure 35-7. Activation of T cells requires interaction of T-cell receptors with an antigen (foreign protein) that is transported to the surface of the antigen-presenting cell by a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein. Cell-to-cell adhesion proteins enable the T cell to bind to the antigen-presenting cell long enough to become activated.
to present antigens to T cells. The interaction of cell adhesion proteins is critical in permitting the T cells to bind to antigen-presenting cells long enough to become activated.

The MHC proteins are encoded by a large group of genes called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The MHC proteins bind peptide fragments of antigen proteins that are degraded inside antigen-presenting cells and then transport them to the cell surface. There are two types of MHC proteins: (1) MHC I proteins, which present antigens to cytotoxic T cells; and (2) MHC II proteins, which present antigens to $T$-helper cells. The specific functions of cytotoxic and T-helper cells are discussed later.

The antigens on the surface of antigen-presenting cells bind with receptor molecules on the surfaces of T cells in the same way that they bind with plasma protein antibodies. These receptor molecules are composed of a variable unit similar to the variable portion of the humoral antibody, but its stem section is firmly bound to the cell membrane of the T lymphocyte. There are as many as 100,000 receptor sites on a single T cell.

## DIFFERENT TYPES OF T CELLS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS

It has become clear that there are multiple types of T cells, classified into three major groups: (1) T-helper cells; (2) cytotoxic T cells; and (3) regulatory T cells (also called suppressor $T$ cells). The functions of each of these T cells are distinct.

## T-Helper Cells Are the Most Numerous T Cells

The T-helper cells are the most numerous of the T cells, usually constituting more than $75 \%$ of all of them. As their name implies, they help in the functions of the immune system in many ways. They serve as the major regulator of

virtually all immune functions, as shown in Figure 35-8. They do this by forming a series of protein mediators, called lymphokines, that act on other cells of the immune system, as well as on bone marrow cells.

When stimulated, naïve CD4+ T-helper cells can differentiate into subsets that produce different lymphokines and perform different functions. Table 35-1 summarizes the main subsets of T-helper cells, the lymphokines that induce each subset, the lymphokines produced by the subsets, and the immunological reactions that each subset triggers.

Specific Regulatory Functions of Lymphokines. In the absence of the lymphokines from the T-helper cells, the remainder of the immune system is almost paralyzed. In fact, it is the T-helper cells that are inactivated or de-

stroyed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which leaves the body almost totally unprotected against infectious disease, therefore leading to the now wellknown debilitating and lethal effects of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Some of the specific regulatory functions are described in the following sections.

Stimulation of Growth and Proliferation of Cytotoxic T Cells and Regulatory T Cells. In the absence of T-helper cells, the clones for producing cytotoxic T cells and regulatory T cells are activated only slightly by most antigens. The lymphokine interleukin-2 has an especially strong stimulatory effect in causing growth and proliferation of cytotoxic and regulatory T cells. In addition, several of the other lymphokines have less potent effects.

Stimulation of B-Cell Growth and Differentiation to Form Plasma Cells and Antibodies. The direct actions of antigens to cause B-cell growth, proliferation, formation of plasma cells, and secretion of antibodies are also slight without the help of the T-helper cells. Almost all the interleukins participate in the B-cell response, but especially interleukins 4, 5, and 6. These three interleukins have such potent effects on the B cells that they have been called $B$-cell stimulating factors or $B$-cell growth factors.

Activation of the Macrophage System. The lymphokines also affect the macrophages. First, they slow or stop the migration of the macrophages after they have been chemotactically attracted into the inflamed tissue area, thus causing much accumulation of macrophages. Second, they activate the macrophages to cause more efficient phagocytosis, allowing them to attack and destroy increasing numbers of invading bacteria or other tissue-destroying agents.

Feedback Stimulatory Effect on T-Helper Cells. Some of the lymphokines, especially interleukin-2, have a direct positive feedback effect in stimulating activation of T-helper cells. This acts as an amplifier by further enhancing the helper cell response, as well as the entire immune response to an invading antigen.

## Cytotoxic T Cells Are Killer Cells

The cytotoxic T cell is a direct attack cell that is capable of killing microorganisms and, at times, even some of the

Figure 35-9. Direct destruction of an invading cell by sensitized lymphocytes (cytotoxic T cells).
body's own cells. For this reason, these cells are called killer cells. The receptor proteins on the surfaces of the CD8+ cytotoxic cells cause them to bind tightly to the organisms or cells that contain the appropriate binding-specific antigen. They then kill the attacked cell in the manner shown in Figure 35-9. After binding, the cytotoxic T cell secretes hole-forming proteins, called perforins, that literally punch round holes in the membrane of the attacked cell. Fluid then flows rapidly into the cell from the interstitial space. In addition, the cytotoxic T cell releases cytotoxic substances directly into the attacked cell. Almost immediately, the attacked cell becomes greatly swollen, and it usually dissolves shortly thereafter.

Of special importance is that these cytotoxic killer cells can pull away from the victim cells after they have punched holes and delivered cytotoxic substances and then move on to kill more cells. Some of these cells persist for months in the tissues.

Some of the cytotoxic T cells are especially lethal to tissue cells that have been invaded by viruses because many virus particles become entrapped in the membranes of the tissue cells and attract T cells in response to the viral antigenicity. The cytotoxic cells also play an important role in destroying cancer cells, heart transplant cells, or other types of cells that are foreign to the person's own body.

## Regulatory T Cells

Much less is known about the regulatory T cells than about the others, but they are capable of suppressing the functions of both cytotoxic and T-helper cells. These suppressor functions of the CD4+ regulatory T cells are believed to prevent the cytotoxic cells from causing excessive immune reactions that might damage the body's own tissues. It is probable that the suppressor T-cell system plays an important role in limiting the ability of the immune system to attack a person's own body tissues, called immune tolerance, as discussed in the next section.

## TOLERANCE OF ACQUIRED IMMUNITY SYSTEM TO THE BODY'S OWN TISSUES -ROLE OF PREPROCESSING IN THYMUS AND BONE MARROW

The process of acquired immunity would destroy the individual's own body if that person became immune to his or her own tissues. The immune mechanism normally recognizes a person's own tissues as being distinctive from bacteria or viruses, and the person's immunity system forms few antibodies or activated T cells against his or her own antigens.

## Most Tolerance Results From Clone Selection During

Preprocessing. Most tolerance is believed to develop during the preprocessing of T lymphocytes in the thymus and of B lymphocytes in the bone marrow. This is because injecting a strong antigen into a fetus while the lymphocytes are being preprocessed in these two areas prevents development of clones of lymphocytes in the lymphoid tissue that are specific for the injected antigen. Experiments have shown that specific immature lymphocytes in the thymus, when exposed to a strong antigen, become lymphoblastic, proliferate considerably, and then combine with the stimulating antigen-an effect that is believed to cause the cells to be destroyed by the thymic epithelial cells before they can migrate to and colonize the total body lymphoid tissue.

During the preprocessing of lymphocytes in the thymus and bone marrow, all or most of the clones of lymphocytes that are specific to damage the body's own tissues appear to be self-destroyed because of their continual exposure to the body's antigens.

Failure of the Tolerance Mechanism Causes Autoimmune Diseases. Sometimes, people lose immune tolerance of their own tissues. This phenomenon occurs to a greater extent the older a person becomes. It usually occurs after destruction of some of the body's own tissues, which releases considerable quantities of self-antigens that circulate in the body and presumably cause acquired immunity in the form of activated T cells or antibodies.

Over 100 diseases that result from autoimmunity have been described and include: (1) rheumatic fever, in which the body becomes immunized against tissues in the joints and heart, especially the heart valves, after exposure to a specific type of streptococcal toxin that has an epitope in its molecular structure similar to the structure of some of the body's own self-antigens; (2) one type of glomerulonephritis, in which the person becomes immunized against the basement membranes of glomeruli; (3) myasthenia gravis, in which immunity develops against the acetylcholine receptor proteins of the neuromuscular junction, causing paralysis; (4) multiple sclerosis (MS), in which the immune system attacks the myelin that covers nerve fibers, disrupting nervous

system communication; and (5) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in which the person becomes immunized against many different body tissues at the same time, a disease that causes extensive damage and even death when SLE is severe.

## IMMUNIZATION BY INJECTION OF ANTIGENS

Immunization has been used for many years to produce acquired immunity against specific diseases. A person can be immunized by injecting dead organisms that are no longer capable of causing disease but that still have some of their chemical antigens. This type of immunization is used to protect against typhoid fever, whooping cough, diphtheria, and many other types of bacterial diseases.

Immunity can be achieved against toxins that have been treated with chemicals so that their toxic nature has been destroyed, even though their antigens for causing immunity are still intact. This procedure is used in immunizing against tetanus, botulism, and other similar toxic diseases.

And, finally, a person can be immunized by being infected with live organisms that have been attenuated. That is, these organisms have been grown in special culture media or have been passed through a series of animals until they have mutated enough that they will not cause disease but do still carry specific antigens required for immunization. This procedure is used to protect against smallpox, yellow fever, poliomyelitis, measles, and many other viral diseases.

## PASSIVE IMMUNITY

Thus far, all the acquired immunity we have discussed has been active immunity-that is, the person's own body develops antibodies or activated T cells in response to invasion of the body by a foreign antigen. However, temporary immunity can be achieved in a person without injecting any antigen. This temporary immunity is achieved by infusing antibodies, activated T cells, or both obtained from the blood of someone else or from some other animal that has been actively immunized against the antigen.

Antibodies last in the body of the recipient for 2 to 3 weeks and, during that time, the person is protected against the invading disease. Activated T cells last for a few weeks if transfused from another person but only for a few hours to a few days if transfused from an animal. Such transfusion of antibodies or T lymphocytes to confer immunity is called passive immunity.

## ALLERGY AND HYPERSENSITIVITY

An important undesirable side effect of immunity is the development, under some conditions, of an allergy or other type of immune hypersensitivity. There are several
types of allergy and other hypersensitivities, some of which occur only in people who have a specific allergic tendency.

## ALLERGY CAUSED BY ACTIVATED T CELLS: DELAYED-REACTION ALLERGY

Delayed-reaction allergy is caused by activated T cells and not by antibodies. In the case of poison ivy, the toxin of poison ivy in itself does not cause much harm to the tissues. However, on repeated exposure, it does cause the formation of activated helper and cytotoxic T cells. Then, after subsequent exposure to the poison ivy toxin, within a day or so, the activated T cells diffuse from the circulating blood in large numbers into the skin to respond to the poison ivy toxin. At the same time, these T cells elicit a cell-mediated type of immune reaction. Remembering that this type of immunity can cause release of many toxic substances from the activated T cells, as well as extensive invasion of the tissues by macrophages, along with their subsequent effects, one can understand that the eventual result of some delayed-reaction allergies can be serious tissue damage. The damage normally occurs in the tissue area where the instigating antigen is present, such as in the skin in the case of poison ivy or in the lungs to cause lung edema or asthmatic attacks in the case of some airborne antigens.

## ATOPIC ALLERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH EXCESS IGE ANTIBODIES

Some people have an allergic tendency. Their allergies are called atopic allergies because they are caused by a nonordinary response of the immune system. The allergic tendency is genetically passed from parent to child and is characterized by the presence of large quantities of IgE antibodies in the blood. These antibodies are called reagins or sensitizing antibodies to distinguish them from the more common IgG antibodies. When an allergen (defined as an antigen that reacts specifically with a specific type of IgE reagin antibody) enters the body, an allergen-reagin reaction takes place, and a subsequent allergic reaction occurs.

A special characteristic of the IgE antibodies (the reagins) is a strong propensity to attach to mast cells and basophils. Indeed, a single mast cell or basophil can bind as many as a half-million molecules of IgE antibodies. Then, when an antigen (an allergen) that has multiple binding sites binds with several IgE antibodies that are already attached to a mast cell or basophil, there is an immediate change in the membrane of the mast cell or basophil, perhaps resulting from a physical effect of the antibody molecules to contort the cell membrane. At any rate, many of the mast cells and basophils rupture; others release special agents immediately or shortly thereafter, including histamine, protease, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (a mixture of toxic leukotrienes), eosinophil

chemotactic substance, neutrophil chemotactic substance, heparin, and platelet-activating factors. These substances cause effects such as dilation of the local blood vessels, attraction of eosinophils and neutrophils to the reactive site, increased permeability of the capillaries with loss of fluid into the tissues, and contraction of local smooth muscle cells. Therefore, several different tissue responses can occur, depending on the type of tissue in which the allergen-reagin reaction occurs. Some of the different types of allergic reactions caused in this manner are described next.

Anaphylaxis-Widespread Allergic Reaction. When a specific allergen is injected directly into the circulation, the allergen can react with basophils of the blood and mast cells in the tissues located immediately outside the small blood vessels if the basophils and mast cells have been sensitized by the attachment of IgE reagins. Therefore, a widespread allergic reaction occurs throughout the vascular system and closely associated tissues. This reaction is called anaphylaxis. Histamine is released into the circulation and causes body-wide vasodilation, as well as increased permeability of the capillaries, with a resultant marked loss of plasma from the circulation. Occasionally, a person who experiences this reaction dies of circulatory shock within a few minutes unless treated with epinephrine to counteract the effects of the histamine.

Also released from the activated basophils and mast cells is a mixture of leukotrienes called slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis. These leukotrienes can cause spasm of the smooth muscle of the bronchioles, eliciting an asthma-like attack and sometimes causing death by suffocation.

Urticaria-Localized Anaphylactoid Reactions. Urticaria results from antigen entering specific skin areas and causing localized anaphylactoid reactions. Histamine released locally causes: (1) vasodilation that induces an immediate red flare; and (2) increased local permeability of the capillaries that leads to local circumscribed areas of swelling of the skin within another few minutes. The swellings are commonly called hives. Administration of antihistamine drugs to a person before exposure will prevent the hives.

Hay Fever. In hay fever, the allergen-reagin reaction occurs in the nose. Histamine released in response to the reaction causes local intranasal vascular dilation, with resultant increased capillary pressure and increased capillary permeability. Both these effects cause rapid fluid leakage into the nasal cavities and into associated deeper tissues of the nose, and the nasal linings become swollen and secretory. Here again, the use of antihistamine drugs can prevent this swelling reaction. However, other products of the allergen-reagin reaction can still cause
irritation of the nose, eliciting the typical sneezing syndrome.

Asthma. Asthma often occurs in the hypersensitive allergic person. In these individuals, the allergen-reagin reaction occurs in the bronchioles of the lungs. Here, an important product released from the mast cells is believed to be the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (a mixture of three leukotrienes), which causes spasm of the bronchiolar smooth muscle. Consequently, the person has difficulty breathing until the reactive products of the allergic reaction have been removed. The administration of antihistamine medication has less effect on the course of asthma because histamine does not appear to be the major factor eliciting the asthmatic reaction.

# Blood Types; Transfusion; and Tissue and Organ Transplantation 

## ANTIGENICITY CAUSES IMMUNE REACTIONS OF BLOOD

When blood transfusions from one person to another were first attempted, immediate or delayed agglutination and hemolysis of the red blood cells (RBCs) often occurred, resulting in typical transfusion reactions that frequently led to death. Soon it was discovered that the blood types of different people have different antigenic and immune properties so that antibodies in the plasma of one blood type will react with antigens on the surfaces of the RBCs of another blood type. If proper precautions are taken, one can determine ahead of time whether the antibodies and antigens present in the donor and recipient blood will cause a transfusion reaction.

## Multiplicity of Antigens in the Blood Cells

At least 30 commonly occurring antigens and hundreds of other rare antigens, each of which can at times cause antigen-antibody reactions, have been found on the surfaces of the cell membranes of human blood cells. Most of the antigens are weak and therefore are of importance principally for studying the inheritance of genes to establish parentage.

Two particular types of antigens are much more likely than the others to cause blood transfusion reactions. They are the $O-A-B$ system of antigens and the $R h$ system.

## O-A-B BLOOD TYPES

## A AND B ANTIGENS—AGGLUTINOGENS

Two antigens-type A and type B-occur on the surfaces of the RBCs in a large proportion of people. It is these antigens (also called agglutinogens because they often cause RBC agglutination) that cause most blood transfusion reactions. Because of how these agglutinogens are inherited, people may have neither of them on their cells, they may have one, or they may have both simultaneously.

Major O-A-B Blood Types. In transfusing blood from one person to another, the blood of donors and recipients is normally classified into four major O-A-B
blood types, as shown in Table 36-1, depending on the presence or absence of the two agglutinogens, the A and B agglutinogens. When neither A nor B agglutinogen is present, the blood is type $O$. When only type A agglutinogen is present, the blood is type $A$. When only type B agglutinogen is present, the blood is type $B$. When both A and B agglutinogens are present, the blood is type $A B$.

Genetic Determination of the Agglutinogens. The ABO blood group genetic locus has three alleles, which means three different forms of the same gene. These three al-leles- $1^{\mathrm{A}}, 1^{\mathrm{B}}$, and $1^{\mathrm{O}}$-determine the three blood types. We typically call these alleles $A, B$, and $O$, but geneticists often represent alleles of a gene by variations of the same symbol. In this case, the common symbol is the letter "I," which stands for immunoglobulin.

The type O allele is functionless or almost functionless, so it causes no significant type O agglutinogen on the cells. Conversely, the type A and type B alleles do cause strong agglutinogens on the cells. Thus, the O allele is recessive to both the A and B alleles, which show co-dominance.

Because each person has only two sets of chromosomes, only one of these alleles is present on each of the two chromosomes in any individual. However, the presence of three different alleles means that there are six possible combinations of alleles, as shown in Table 36-1: OO, OA, OB, AA, BB , and AB . These combinations of alleles are known as the genotypes, and each person is one of the six genotypes.

One can also observe from Table 36-1 that a person with genotype OO produces no agglutinogens, and therefore the blood type is O. A person with genotype OA or AA produces type A agglutinogens and therefore has blood type A. Genotypes OB and BB give type B blood, and genotype $A B$ gives type $A B$ blood.
Relative Frequencies of Different Blood Types. The prevalence of the different blood types among one group of persons studied was approximately as follows:

- O: $47 \%$
- A: $41 \%$
- B: $9 \%$
- AB: 3\%

Table 36-1 Blood Types With Their Genotypes and Constituent Agglutinogens and Agglutinins

| Genotypes | Blood Types | Agglutinogens | Agglutinins |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| OO | O | - | Anti-A and |
|  |  |  | Anti-B |
| OA or AA | A | A | Anti-B |
| OB or BB | B | B | Anti-A |
| AB | AB | A and B | - |

It is obvious from these percentages that the O and A genes occur frequently, whereas the B gene occurs infrequently.

## AGGLUTININS

When type A agglutinogen is not present in a person's RBCs, antibodies known as anti-A agglutinins develop in the plasma. Also, when type B agglutinogen is not present in the RBCs, antibodies known as anti-B agglutinins develop in the plasma.

Referring once again to Table 36-1, note that type O blood, although containing no agglutinogens, does contain both anti-A and anti-B agglutinins. Type A blood contains type A agglutinogens and anti-B agglutinins, and type B blood contains type B agglutinogens and anti-A agglutinins. Finally, type AB blood contains both A and B agglutinogens but no agglutinins.
Titer of Agglutinins at Different Ages. Immediately after birth, the quantity of agglutinins in the plasma is almost zero. At 2 to 8 months after birth, an infant begins to produce agglutinins-anti-A agglutinins when type A agglutinogens are not present in the cells, and anti-B agglutinins when type B agglutinogens are not in the cells. Figure 36-1 shows the changing titers of the anti-A and anti-B agglutinins at different ages. A maximum titer is usually reached at 8 to 10 years of age, and this titer gradually declines throughout the remaining years of life.
Origin of Agglutinins in Plasma. The agglutinins are gamma globulins, as are almost all antibodies, and they are produced by the same bone marrow and lymph gland cells that produce antibodies to any other antigens. Most of them are IgM and IgG immunoglobulin molecules.

But why are these agglutinins produced in people who do not have the respective agglutinogens in their RBCs? A possible answer to this question is that small amounts of type A and B antigens enter the body in food, bacteria, and other ways, and these substances initiate the development of the anti-A and anti-B agglutinins.

For example, infusion of group A antigen into a recipient having a non-A blood type causes a typical immune response, with formation of more anti-A agglutinins than ever. Also, the neonate has few, if any, agglutinins, showing that agglutinin formation occurs almost entirely after birth.

## AGGLUTINATION PROCESS IN TRANSFUSION REACTIONS

When bloods are mismatched so that anti-A or anti-B plasma agglutinins are mixed with RBCs that contain A or B agglutinogens, respectively, the RBCs agglutinate as a result of the agglutinins attaching themselves to the RBCs. Because the agglutinins have two binding sites (IgG type) or ten binding sites (IgM type), a single agglutinin can attach to two or more RBCs at the same time, thereby causing the cells to be bound together by the agglutinin. This binding causes the cells to clump, which is the process of agglutination. Then these clumps plug small blood vessels throughout the circulatory system. During the ensuing hours to days, physical distortion of the cells or attack by phagocytic white blood cells destroys the membranes of the agglutinated cells, releasing hemoglobin into the plasma, called hemolysis of the RBCs.

Acute Hemolysis Occurs in Some Transfusion Reactions. Sometimes, when recipient and donor bloods are mismatched, immediate hemolysis of RBCs occurs in the circulating blood. In this case, the antibodies cause lysis of the RBCs by activating the complement system and forming a membrane attack complex (also called cytolytic complex) that inserts itself into the lipid bilayer of the cell membranes; this insertion creates membrane pores that are permeable to ions and causes osmotic lysis of the cells, as described in Chapter 35. Immediate intravascular hemolysis is far less common than agglutination followed by delayed hemolysis, because not only does there have to be a high titer of antibodies for lysis to occur, but also a different type of antibody seems to be required, mainly the IgM antibodies; these antibodies are called hemolysins.

## BLOOD TYPING

Before giving a transfusion to a person, it is necessary to determine the blood type of the recipient and donor blood so that the bloods can be appropriately matched. This process is called blood typing and blood matching, and these procedures are performed in the following way. The RBCs

Table 36-2 Blood Typing: Agglutination of Cells of Different Blood Types With Anti-A or Anti-B Agglutinins in the Sera

|  | Sera |  |
| :-- | :-- | :--: |
| Red Blood Cell Types | Anti-A | Anti-B |
| O | - | - |
| A | + | - |
| B | - | + |
| AB | + | + |

are first separated from the plasma and diluted with saline solution. One portion is then mixed with anti-A agglutinin and another portion is mixed with anti-B agglutinin. After several minutes, the mixtures are observed under a microscope. If the RBCs have become clumped-that is, agglutinated-then an antibody-antigen reaction has resulted.

Table 36-2 lists the presence (+) or absence (-) of agglutination of the four types of RBCs. Type O RBCs have no agglutinogens and therefore do not react with the anti-A or anti-B agglutinins. Type A blood has A agglutinogens and therefore agglutinates with anti-A agglutinins. Type B blood has B agglutinogens and agglutinates with anti-B agglutinins. Type AB blood has both A and B agglutinogens and agglutinates with both types of agglutinins.

## Rh BLOOD TYPES

Along with the O-A-B blood type system, the Rh blood type system is also important when transfusing blood. The major difference between the O-A-B system and Rh system is the following. In the O-A-B system, the plasma agglutinins responsible for causing transfusion reactions develop spontaneously, whereas in the Rh system, spontaneous agglutinins almost never occur. Instead, the person must first be massively exposed to an Rh antigen-such as by transfusion of blood containing the Rh antigenbefore enough agglutinins to cause a significant transfusion reaction will develop.

Rh Antigens—Rh-Positive and Rh-Negative. There are six common types of Rh antigens, each of which is called an Rh factor. These types are designated C, D, E, c, d, and e. A person who has a C antigen does not have the c antigen, but the person missing the C antigen always has the c antigen. The same is true for the D-d and E-e antigens. Also, because of the manner of inheritance of these factors, each person has one of each of the three pairs of antigens.

The type D antigen is widely prevalent in the population and is considerably more antigenic than the other Rh antigens. Anyone who has this type of antigen is said to be Rh positive, whereas a person who does not have type D antigen is said to be Rh negative. However, it must be
noted that even in Rh-negative people, some of the other Rh antigens can still cause transfusion reactions, although the reactions are usually much milder.

About $85 \%$ of all whites are Rh positive, and $15 \%$ are Rh negative. In American blacks, the percentage of Rhpositives is about $95 \%$, whereas in African blacks, it is nearly $100 \%$. Over $95 \%$ of Native Americans and Asians living in China, Japan, and Korea are also Rh positive, and it is estimated that the worldwide frequencies of Rhpositive and Rh-negative blood types are $95 \%$ and $6 \%$, respectively.

## Rh IMMUNE RESPONSE

Formation of Anti-Rh Agglutinins. When RBCs containing Rh factor are injected into a person whose blood does not contain the Rh factor-that is, into an Rhnegative person-anti-Rh agglutinins develop slowly, reaching a maximum concentration of agglutinins about 2 to 4 months later. This immune response occurs to a much greater extent in some people than in others. With multiple exposures to the Rh factor, an Rh-negative person eventually becomes strongly sensitized to Rh factor.
Characteristics of Rh Transfusion Reactions. If an Rhnegative person has never been exposed to Rh-positive blood, transfusion of Rh-positive blood into that person will likely cause no immediate reaction. However, anti-Rh antibodies can develop in sufficient quantities during the next 2 to 4 weeks to cause agglutination of the transfused cells that are still circulating in the blood. These cells are then hemolyzed by the tissue macrophage system. Thus, a delayed transfusion reaction occurs, although it is usually mild. On subsequent transfusion of Rh-positive blood into the same person, who is now already immunized against the Rh factor, the transfusion reaction is greatly enhanced and can be immediate and as severe as a transfusion reaction caused by mismatched type A or B blood.

## Erythroblastosis Fetalis (Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn)

Erythroblastosis fetalis is a disease of the fetus and newborn child characterized by agglutination and phagocytosis of the fetus's RBCs. In most cases of erythroblastosis fetalis, the mother is Rh negative and the father is Rh positive. The baby has inherited the Rh-positive antigen from the father, and the mother develops anti-Rh agglutinins from exposure to the fetus's Rh antigen. In turn, the mother's agglutinins diffuse through the placenta into the fetus and cause RBC agglutination.
Incidence of Erythroblastosis Fetalis. An Rh-negative mother having her first Rh-positive child usually does not develop sufficient anti-Rh agglutinins to cause any harm. However, about 3\% of second Rh-positive babies exhibit some signs of erythroblastosis fetalis, about $10 \%$ of third babies exhibit the disease, and the incidence rises progressively with subsequent pregnancies.

Effect of Mother's Antibodies on the Fetus. After antiRh antibodies have formed in the mother, they diffuse slowly through the placental membrane into the fetus's blood. There they cause agglutination of the fetus's blood. The agglutinated RBCs subsequently hemolyze, releasing hemoglobin into the blood. The fetus's macrophages then convert the hemoglobin into bilirubin, which causes the baby's skin to become yellow (jaundiced). The antibodies can also attack and damage other cells of the body.

Clinical Picture of Erythroblastosis. The jaundiced, erythroblastotic newborn baby is usually anemic at birth, and the anti-Rh agglutinins from the mother usually circulate in the infant's blood for another 1 to 2 months after birth, destroying more and more RBCs.

The hematopoietic tissues of the infant attempt to replace the hemolyzed RBCs. The liver and spleen become greatly enlarged and produce RBCs in the same manner that they normally do during the middle of gestation. Because of the rapid production of RBCs, many early forms of RBCs, including many nucleated blastic forms, are passed from the baby's bone marrow into the circulatory system, and it is because of the presence of these nucleated blastic RBCs that the disease is called erythroblastosis fetalis.

Although the severe anemia of erythroblastosis fetalis is usually the cause of death, many children who barely survive the anemia exhibit permanent mental impairment or damage to motor areas of the brain because of precipitation of bilirubin in the neuronal cells, causing the destruction of many of these cells, a condition called kernicterus.

## Treatment of Neonates With Erythroblastosis Fetalis.

One treatment for erythroblastosis fetalis is to replace the neonate's blood with Rh-negative blood. The Rh-negative blood is infused over a period of 1.5 or more hours while the neonate's own Rh-positive blood is being removed. This procedure may be repeated several times during the first few weeks of life, mainly to keep the bilirubin level low and thereby prevent kernicterus. By the time these transfused Rh-negative cells are replaced with the infant's own Rh-positive cells, a process that requires 6 weeks or more, the anti-Rh agglutinins that had come from the mother will have been destroyed.

Prevention of Erythroblastosis Fetalis. The D antigen of the Rh blood group system is the primary culprit in causing immunization of an Rh-negative mother to an Rh-positive fetus. In the 1970s, a dramatic reduction in the incidence of erythroblastosis fetalis was achieved with the development of Rh immunoglobulin globin, an anti$D$ antibody that is administered to the expectant mother starting at 28 to 30 weeks of gestation. The anti-D antibody is also administered to Rh-negative women who deliver Rh-positive babies to prevent sensitization of the mothers to the D antigen. This step greatly reduces the risk of developing large amounts of D antibodies during the second pregnancy.

The mechanism whereby Rh immunoglobulin globin prevents sensitization of the D antigen is not completely understood, but one effect of the anti-D antibody is to inhibit antigen-induced, B lymphocyte antibody production in the expectant mother. The administered anti-D antibody also attaches to D antigen sites on Rh-positive fetal RBCs that may cross the placenta and enter the circulation of the expectant mother, thereby interfering with the immune response to the D antigen.

## TRANSFUSION REACTIONS RESULTING FROM MISMATCHED BLOOD TYPES

If donor blood of one blood type is transfused into a recipient who has another blood type, a transfusion reaction is likely to occur in which the RBCs of the donor blood are agglutinated. It is rare that the transfused blood causes agglutination of the recipient's cells, for the following reason. The plasma portion of the donor blood immediately becomes diluted by all the plasma of the recipient, thereby decreasing the titer of the infused agglutinins to a level usually too low to cause agglutination. However, the small amount of infused blood does not significantly dilute the agglutinins in the recipient's plasma. Therefore, the recipient's agglutinins can still agglutinate the mismatched donor cells.

As explained earlier, all transfusion reactions eventually cause immediate hemolysis resulting from hemolysins or later hemolysis resulting from phagocytosis of agglutinated cells. Hemoglobin released from the RBCs is then converted by the phagocytes into bilirubin and later excreted in the bile by the liver, as discussed in Chapter 71. The concentration of bilirubin in the body fluids often rises high enough to cause jaundice-that is, the person's internal tissues and skin become colored with yellow bile pigment. However, if liver function is normal, the bile pigment will be excreted into the intestines by way of the liver bile, so jaundice usually does not appear in an adult unless more than 400 milliliters of blood are hemolyzed in less than a day.

Acute Kidney Failure After Transfusion Reactions. One of the most lethal effects of transfusion reactions is kidney failure, which can begin within a few minutes to a few hours and continue until the person dies of acute renal failure.

The kidney shutdown seems to have three causes:

1. The antigen-antibody reaction of the transfusion reaction releases toxic substances from the hemolyzing blood that cause powerful renal vasoconstriction.
2. Loss of circulating RBCs in the recipient, along with production of toxic substances from the hemolyzed cells and the immune reaction, often cause circulatory shock. The arterial blood pressure falls very low, and renal blood flow and urine output decrease.

3. If the total amount of free hemoglobin released into the circulating blood is greater than the quantity that can bind with haptoglobin (a plasma protein that binds small amounts of hemoglobin), much of the excess leaks through the glomerular membranes into the kidney tubules.
If this amount is still slight, it can be reabsorbed through the tubular epithelium into the blood and will cause no harm; if large, then only a small percentage is reabsorbed. Yet, water continues to be reabsorbed, causing the tubular hemoglobin concentration to rise so high that the hemoglobin precipitates and blocks many of the kidney tubules. Thus, renal vasoconstriction, circulatory shock, and renal tubular blockage together cause acute renal shutdown. If the shutdown is complete and fails to resolve, the patient dies within 7 to 12 days, as explained in Chapter 32, unless treated with an artificial kidney.

## TRANSPLANTATION OF TISSUES AND ORGANS

Most of the different antigens of RBCs that cause transfusion reactions are also widely present in other cells of the body, and each bodily tissue has its own additional complement of antigens. Consequently, foreign cells transplanted anywhere into the body of a recipient can produce an immune reaction. In other words, most recipients are just as able to resist invasion by foreign tissue cells as to resist invasion by foreign bacteria or RBCs.

Autografts, Isografts, Allografts, and Xenografts. A transplant of a tissue or whole organ from one part of the same animal to another part is called an autograft; from one identical twin to another, an isograft; from one person to another or from an animal to another animal of the same species, an allograft; and from a nonhuman animal to a human or from an animal of one species to one of another species, a xenograft.

Transplantation of Cellular Tissues. In the case of autografts and isografts, cells in the transplant contain virtually the same types of antigens as in the tissues of the recipient and will almost always continue to live normally and indefinitely if an adequate blood supply is provided. At the other extreme, immune reactions almost always occur in xenografts, causing death of the cells in the graft within 1 day to 5 weeks after transplantation unless some specific therapy is used to prevent the immune reactions.

Some of the different cellular tissues and organs that have been transplanted from one person to another as allografts, either experimentally or for therapeutic purposes, are skin, kidney, heart, liver, glandular tissue, bone marrow, and lung. With proper matching of tissues between persons, many kidney allografts have been successful for at least 5 to 15 years and allograft liver and heart transplants for 1 to 15 years.

## ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME IMMUNE REACTIONS IN TRANSPLANTED TISSUE

Because of the extreme potential importance of transplanting certain tissues and organs, serious attempts have been made to prevent antigen-antibody reactions associated with transplantation. The following specific procedures have met with some degrees of clinical or experimental success.

Tissue Typing-Human Leukocyte Antigen Complex of Antigens. The most important antigens for causing graft rejection are a complex called human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens. Six of these antigens are present on the tissue cell membranes of each person, but there are about 150 different HLA antigens to choose from, representing more than 1 trillion possible combinations. Consequently, it is virtually impossible for two persons, except in the case of identical twins, to have the same six HLA antigens. Development of significant immunity against any of these antigens can cause graft rejection.

The HLA antigens are on the white blood cells, as well as on the tissue cells. Therefore, tissue typing for these antigens is done on the membranes of lymphocytes that have been separated from the person's blood. The lymphocytes are mixed with appropriate antisera and complement; after incubation, the cells are tested for membrane damage, usually by determining the rate of transmembrane uptake by the lymphocytic cells of a special dye.

Some of the HLA antigens are not severely antigenic. Therefore, a precise match of some antigens between donor and recipient is not always essential to allow allograft acceptance. By using a more advanced method of genetic testing and obtaining the best possible match between donor and recipient, the grafting procedure has become far less hazardous. The best success has been with tissue type matches between siblings and between parent and child. The match in identical twins is exact, so transplants between identical twins are almost never rejected because of an immune reaction.

## Prevention of Graft Rejection by Suppressing the Immune System

If the immune system were completely suppressed, graft rejection would not occur. In fact, in a person who has serious depression of the immune system, grafts can be successful without the use of significant therapy to prevent rejection. However, in the person with a healthy immune system, even with the best possible tissue typing, allografts seldom resist rejection for more than a few days or weeks without the use of specific therapy to suppress the immune system. Furthermore, because the T cells are mainly the portion of the immune system important for killing grafted cells, their suppression is much more important than suppression of plasma antibodies. Some

of the therapeutic agents that have been used for this purpose include the following:

1. Glucocorticoid hormones from adrenal cortex glands (or drugs with glucocorticoid-like activity). These drugs inhibit genes that code for several cytokines, especially interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 is an essential factor that induces T-cell proliferation and antibody formation.
2. Various drugs that have a toxic effect on the lymphoid system and therefore block formation of antibodies and T cells, especially the drug azathioprine.
3. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus, which inhibit formation of T-helper cells and, therefore, are especially efficacious in blocking the T-cell rejection reaction. These agents have proven to be highly valuable drugs because they do not depress some other portions of the immune system.
4. Immunosuppressive antibody therapy, including specific antilymphocyte or IL-2 receptor antibodies.
Use of these agents often leaves the person unprotected from infectious disease; therefore, sometimes bacterial and viral infections become rampant. In addition, the incidence of cancer is several times greater in an immunosuppressed person, presumably because the immune system is important in destroying many early cancer cells before they can begin to proliferate.

Transplantation of living tissues in people has been successful mainly because of the development of drugs that suppress the responses of the immune system. With the introduction of improved immunosuppressive agents, successful organ transplantation has become much more common. The current approach to immunosuppressive
therapy attempts to balance acceptable rates of rejection with moderation of the adverse effects of immunosuppressive drugs.

# Hemostasis and Blood Coagulation 

## HEMOSTASIS EVENTS

The term hemostasis means prevention of blood loss. Whenever a vessel is severed or ruptured, hemostasis is achieved by several mechanisms: (1) vascular constriction; (2) formation of a platelet plug; (3) formation of a blood clot as a result of blood coagulation; and (4) eventual growth of fibrous tissue into the blood clot to close the hole in the vessel permanently.

## VASCULAR CONSTRICTION

Immediately after a blood vessel has been cut or ruptured, the trauma to the vessel wall causes smooth muscle in the wall to contract; this instantaneously reduces the flow of blood from the ruptured vessel. The contraction results from the following: (1) local myogenic spasm; (2) local autacoid factors from the traumatized tissues, vascular endothelium, and blood platelets; and (3) nervous reflexes. The nervous reflexes are initiated by pain nerve impulses or other sensory impulses that originate from the traumatized vessel or nearby tissues. However, even more vasoconstriction probably results from local myogenic contraction of the blood vessels initiated by direct damage to the vascular wall. And, for the smaller vessels, the platelets are responsible for much of the vasoconstriction by releasing a vasoconstrictor substance, thromboxane $A_{2}$.

The more severely a vessel is traumatized, the greater the degree of vascular spasm. The spasm can last for many minutes or even hours, during which time the processes of platelet plugging and blood coagulation can take place.

## FORMATION OF THE PLATELET PLUG

If the cut in the blood vessel is very small-many very small vascular holes develop throughout the body each day-the cut is often sealed by a platelet plug rather than by a blood clot. To understand this process, it is important that we first discuss the nature of platelets themselves.

## Physical and Chemical Characteristics

Platelets (also called thrombocytes) are minute discs 1 to 4 micrometers in diameter. They are formed in the bone marrow from megakaryocytes, which are extremely large hematopoietic cells in the marrow; the megakaryocytes
fragment into the minute platelets in the bone marrow or soon after entering the blood, especially as they squeeze through capillaries. The normal concentration of platelets in the blood is between 150,000 and $450,000 / \mu \mathrm{l}$.

Platelets have many functional characteristics of whole cells, even though they do not have nuclei and cannot reproduce. In their cytoplasm are the following: (1) actin and myosin molecules, which are contractile proteins similar to those found in muscle cells, and still another contractile protein, thrombosthenin, that can cause the platelets to contract; (2) residuals of both the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus that synthesize various enzymes and especially store large quantities of calcium ions; (3) mitochondria and enzyme systems that are capable of forming adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP); (4) enzyme systems that synthesize prostaglandins, which are local hormones that cause many vascular and other local tissue reactions; (5) an important protein called fibrin-stabilizing factor, which we discuss later in relation to blood coagulation; and (6) a growth factor that causes vascular endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts to multiply and grow, thus causing cellular growth that eventually helps repair damaged vascular walls.

On the platelet cell membrane surface is a coat of glycoproteins that repulses adherence to normal endothelium and yet causes adherence to injured areas of the vessel wall, especially to injured endothelial cells and even more so to any exposed collagen from deep within the vessel wall. In addition, the platelet membrane contains large amounts of phospholipids that activate multiple stages in the blood-clotting process, as discussed later.

Thus, the platelet is an active structure. It has a half-life in the blood of only 8 to 12 days, so over several weeks its functional processes run out; it is then eliminated from the circulation mainly by the tissue macrophage system. More than half of the platelets are removed by macrophages in the spleen, where the blood passes through a latticework of tight trabeculae.

## Mechanism of Platelet Plug Formation

Platelet repair of vascular openings is based on several important functions of the platelet. When platelets

Figure 37-1. Formation of a platelet plug in a severed blood vessel. Endothelial injury and exposure of the vascular extracellular matrix facilitates platelet adhesions and activation, which changes their shape and causes release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}\left(\mathrm{~T}_{\mathrm{X}} \mathrm{A}_{2}\right)$, and platelet-activating factor (PAF). These platelet-secreted factors recruit additional platelets (aggregation) to form a hemostatic plug. Von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) serves as an adhesion bridge between subendothelial collagen and the glycoprotein Ib (GpIb) platelet receptor.
![gu2677962137](gu2677962137.jpg)
come in contact with a damaged vascular surface, especially with collagen fibers in the vascular wall, the platelets rapidly change their own characteristics drastically (Figure 37-1). They begin to swell, they assume irregular forms with numerous irradiating pseudopods protruding from their surfaces, their contractile proteins contract forcefully and cause the release of granules that contain multiple active factors, and they become sticky so that they adhere to collagen in the tissues and to a protein called von Willebrand factor (vWF), which leaks into the traumatized tissue from the plasma. The platelet surface glycoproteins bind to vWF in the exposed matrix below the damaged endothelium. The platelets then secrete increased quantities of $A D P$ and platelet-activating factor (PAF), and their enzymes form thromboxane $A_{2}$. Thromboxane is a vasoconstrictor and, along with ADP and PAF, acts on nearby platelets to activate them as well; the stickiness of these additional activated platelets causes them to adhere to the original activated platelets.

Therefore, at the site of a puncture in a blood vessel wall, the damaged vascular wall activates successively increasing numbers of platelets that attract more and more additional platelets, thus forming a platelet plug. This plug is loose at first but is usually successful in blocking blood loss if the vascular opening is small. Then, during the subsequent process of blood coagulation, fibrin threads form. These threads attach tightly to the platelets, thus constructing an unyielding plug.
Importance of Platelet Mechanism for Closing Vascular Holes. The platelet-plugging mechanism is extremely important for closing minute ruptures in very small blood vessels that occur many thousands of times daily. Indeed, multiple small holes through the endothelial cells themselves are often closed by platelets actually fusing with the endothelial cells to form additional endothelial cell membranes. Literally thousands of small hemorrhagic areas develop each day under the skin (petechiae, which appear as purple or red dots on the skin) and throughout the internal tissues of a person who has few blood platelets. This phenomenon does not occur in persons with normal numbers of platelets.

Figure 37-2. Clotting process in a traumatized blood vessel. (Modified from Seegers WH: Hemostatic Agents. Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas, 1948.)

## BLOOD COAGULATION IN THE RUPTURED VESSEL

The third mechanism for hemostasis is formation of the blood clot. The clot begins to develop in 15 to 20 seconds if the trauma to the vascular wall is severe and in 1 to 2 minutes if the trauma is minor. Activator substances from the traumatized vascular wall, from platelets, and from blood proteins adhering to the traumatized vascular wall initiate the clotting process. The physical events of this process are shown in Figure 37-2; Table 37-1 lists the most important clotting factors.

Within 3 to 6 minutes after rupture of a vessel, the entire opening or broken end of the vessel is filled with clot if the vessel opening is not too large. After 20 to 60 minutes, the clot retracts, which closes the vessel still further. Platelets also play an important role in this clot retraction, as discussed later.

## FIBROUS ORGANIZATION OR DISSOLUTION OF BLOOD CLOTS

Once a blood clot has formed, it can follow one of two courses: (1) it can become invaded by fibroblasts, which

subsequently form connective tissue all through the clot; or (2) it can dissolve. The usual course for a clot that forms in a small hole of a vessel wall is invasion by fibroblasts, beginning within a few hours after the clot is formed, which is promoted at least partially by growth factor secreted by platelets. This process continues to complete organization of the clot into fibrous tissue within about 1 to 2 weeks.

Conversely, when excess blood has leaked into the tissues, and tissue clots have formed where they are not needed, special substances in the clot usually become activated. These substances function as enzymes to dissolve the clot, as discussed later in the chapter.

## MECHANISM OF BLOOD COAGULATION

## GENERAL MECHANISM

More than 50 important substances that cause or affect blood coagulation have been found in the blood and in the tissues-some that promote coagulation, called procoagulants, and others that inhibit coagulation, called anticoagulants. Whether blood will coagulate depends on the balance between these two groups of substances. In the blood stream, the anticoagulants normally predominate, so the blood does not coagulate while it is circulating
![gu2877962137](gu2877962137.jpg)

Figure 37-3 Schema for conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and polymerization of fibrinogen to form fibrin fibers.
in the blood vessels. However, when a vessel is ruptured, procoagulants from the area of tissue damage become activated and override the anticoagulants, and then a clot does develop.

Clotting takes place in three essential steps:

1. In response to rupture of the vessel or damage to the blood itself, a complex cascade of chemical reactions occurs in the blood involving more than 12 blood coagulation factors. The net result is the formation of a complex of activated substances collectively called prothrombin activator.
2. The prothrombin activator catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin into thrombin.
3. The thrombin acts as an enzyme to convert fibrinogen into fibrin fibers that enmesh platelets, blood cells, and plasma to form the clot.
We will first discuss the mechanism whereby the blood clot is formed, beginning with conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, and then come back to the initiating stages in the clotting process whereby prothrombin activator is formed.

## CONVERSION OF PROTHROMBIN TO THROMBIN

1. Prothrombin activator is formed as a result of rupture of a blood vessel or as a result of damage to special substances in the blood.
2. Prothrombin activator, in the presence of sufficient amounts of ionic calcium $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right)$, causes conversion of prothrombin to thrombin (Figure 37-3 and 37-4).
3. Thrombin causes polymerization of fibrinogen molecules into fibrin fibers within another 10 to 15 seconds.
Thus, the rate-limiting factor in causing blood coagulation is usually the formation of prothrombin activator and not the subsequent reactions beyond that point because these terminal steps normally occur rapidly to form the clot.

Figure 37-4. Coagulation cascade after vascular injury. Exposure of blood to the vascular wall causes release of tissue factor (also called factor III or thromboplastin) from endothelial cells, phospholipid expression, activation of thrombin, which then acts on fibrinogen to form fibrin, and fibrin polymerization to form a meshwork that stabilizes the platelet plug.
![gu2977962137](gu2977962137.jpg)

Platelets also play an important role in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin because much of the prothrombin first attaches to prothrombin receptors on the platelets that are already bound to the damaged tissue.

Prothrombin and Thrombin. Prothrombin is a plasma protein, an $\alpha_{2}$-globulin, having a molecular weight of 68,700 . It is present in normal plasma in a concentration of about $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$. It is an unstable protein that can split easily into smaller compounds, one of which is thrombin, which has a molecular weight of 33,700 , almost half that of prothrombin.

Prothrombin is formed continually by the liver, and it is continually being used throughout the body for blood clotting. If the liver fails to produce prothrombin, in a day or so prothrombin concentration in the plasma falls too low to provide normal blood coagulation.

Vitamin $K$ is required by the liver for normal activation of prothrombin, as well as a few other clotting factors. Therefore, lack of vitamin K or the presence of liver disease that prevents normal prothrombin formation can decrease the prothrombin to such a low level that a bleeding tendency results.

## CONVERSION OF FIBRINOGEN TO FIBRIN—FORMATION OF THE CLOT

Fibrinogen Formed in the Liver Essential for Clot Formation. Fibrinogen is a high-molecular-weight protein (molecular weight $\approx 340,000$ ) that occurs in the plasma in quantities of 100 to $700 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$. Fibrinogen is formed in the liver, and liver disease can decrease the concentration of circulating fibrinogen, as it does the concentration of prothrombin, noted earlier.

Because of its large molecular size, little fibrinogen normally leaks from the blood vessels into the interstitial fluids, and because fibrinogen is one of the essential factors in the coagulation process, interstitial fluids ordinarily do not coagulate. Yet, when the permeability of the capillaries becomes pathologically increased, fibrinogen does leak into the tissue fluids in sufficient quantities to allow clotting of these fluids in much the same way that plasma and whole blood can clot.

Action of Thrombin on Fibrinogen to Form Fibrin. Thrombin is a protein enzyme with weak proteolytic capabilities. It acts on fibrinogen to remove four low-molecular-weight peptides from each molecule of fibrinogen, forming one molecule of fibrin monomer that has the automatic capability to polymerize with other fibrin monomer molecules to form fibrin fibers. Therefore, many fibrin monomer molecules polymerize within seconds into long fibrin fibers that constitute the reticulum of the blood clot.

In the early stages of polymerization, the fibrin monomer molecules are held together by weak noncovalent hydrogen bonding, and the newly forming fibers are not cross-linked with one another. Therefore, the resultant clot is weak and can be broken apart with ease. However, another process occurs during the next few minutes that greatly strengthens the fibrin reticulum. This process involves a substance called fibrin stabilizing factor that is present in small amounts in normal plasma globulins but is also released from platelets entrapped in the clot. Before fibrin stabilizing factor can have an effect on the fibrin fibers, it must be activated. The same thrombin that causes fibrin formation also activates the fibrin stabilizing factor. This activated substance then operates as an enzyme to form covalent bonds between more and more of the fibrin monomer molecules, as well as multiple cross-linkages between adjacent fibrin fibers, thus adding tremendously to the three-dimensional strength of the fibrin meshwork.

Blood Clot. The clot is composed of a meshwork of fibrin fibers running in all directions and entrapping blood cells, platelets, and plasma (see Figure 37-4). The fibrin fibers also adhere to damaged surfaces of blood vessels; therefore, the blood clot becomes adherent to any vascular opening and thereby prevents further blood loss.

Clot Retraction and Expression of Serum. Within a few minutes after a clot is formed, it begins to contract and usually expresses most of the fluid from the clot within 20 to 60 minutes. The fluid expressed is called serum because all its fibrinogen and most of the other clotting factors have been removed; in this way, serum differs from plasma and cannot clot because it lacks these factors.

Platelets are necessary for clot retraction to occur. Therefore, failure of clot retraction is an indication that the number of platelets in the circulating blood might be low. Electron micrographs of platelets in blood clots show that they become attached to the fibrin fibers in such a way that they actually bond different fibers together. Furthermore, platelets entrapped in the clot continue to release procoagulant substances, one of the most important of which is fibrin stabilizing factor, which causes more and more cross-linking bonds between adjacent fibrin fibers. In addition, the platelets contribute directly to clot contraction by activating platelet thrombosthenin, actin, and myosin molecules, which are all contractile proteins in the platelets; they cause strong contraction of the platelet spicules attached to the fibrin. This action also helps compress the fibrin meshwork into a smaller mass. The contraction is activated and accelerated by thrombin and by calcium ions released from calcium stores in the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus of the platelets.

As the clot retracts, the edges of the broken blood vessel are pulled together, thus contributing still further to hemostasis.

## POSITIVE FEEDBACK OF CLOT FORMATION

Once a blood clot starts to develop, it normally extends within minutes into the surrounding blood-that is, the clot initiates a positive feedback to promote more clotting. One of the most important causes of this clot promotion is that the proteolytic action of thrombin allows it to act on many of the other blood-clotting factors in addition to fibrinogen. For example, thrombin has a direct proteolytic effect on prothrombin, tending to convert it into still more thrombin, and it acts on some of the bloodclotting factors responsible for formation of prothrombin activator. (These effects, discussed in subsequent paragraphs, include acceleration of the actions of factors VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII and aggregation of platelets.) Once a critical amount of thrombin is formed, a positive feedback develops that causes still more blood clotting and more and more thrombin to be formed; thus, the blood clot continues to grow until blood leakage ceases.

## INITIATION OF COAGULATION: FORMATION OF PROTHROMBIN ACTIVATOR

Now that we have discussed the clotting process, the more complex mechanisms that initiate clotting in the first place will be described. These mechanisms are set into play by the following: (1) trauma to the vascular wall and adjacent tissues; (2) trauma to the blood; or (3) contact of the blood with damaged endothelial cells or with collagen and other tissue elements outside the blood vessel. In each case, this leads to the formation of prothrombin activator, which then causes prothrombin conversion to thrombin and all the subsequent clotting steps.
![gu3077962137](gu3077962137.jpg)

Figure 37-5. Extrinsic pathway for initiating blood clotting.

Prothrombin activator is generally considered to be formed in two ways, although, in reality, the two ways interact constantly with each other: (1) by the extrinsic pathway that begins with trauma to the vascular wall and surrounding tissues; and (2) by the intrinsic pathway that begins in the blood.

In both the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways, a series of different plasma proteins called blood-clotting factors plays a major role. Most of these proteins are inactive forms of proteolytic enzymes. When converted to the active forms, their enzymatic actions cause the successive, cascading reactions of the clotting process.

Most of the clotting factors listed in Table 37-1 are designated by Roman numerals. To indicate the activated form of the factor, a small letter "a" is added after the Roman numeral, such as factor VIIIa to indicate the activated state of factor VIII.

## Extrinsic Pathway for Initiating Clotting

The extrinsic pathway for initiating the formation of prothrombin activator begins with a traumatized vascular wall or traumatized extravascular tissues that come in contact with the blood. This condition leads to the following steps, as shown in Figure 37-4 and Figure 37-5:

1. Release of tissue factor. Traumatized tissue releases a complex of several factors called tissue factor or tissue thromboplastin. This factor is composed especially of phospholipids from the membranes of the tissue plus a lipoprotein complex that functions mainly as a proteolytic enzyme.
2. Activation of factor X-role of factor VII and tissue factor. The lipoprotein complex of tissue factor further complexes with blood coagulation factor VII

and, in the presence of calcium ions, acts enzymatically on factor X to form activated factor $X$ (Xa).
3. Effect of Xa to form prothrombin activator-role of factor V. The activated factor X combines immediately with tissue phospholipids that are part of tissue factors or with additional phospholipids released from platelets, as well as with factor V , to form the complex called prothrombin activator. Within a few seconds, in the presence of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, prothrombin is split to form thrombin, and the clotting process proceeds as already explained. At first, the factor V in the prothrombin activator complex is inactive, but once clotting begins and thrombin begins to form, the proteolytic action of thrombin activates factor V. This activation then becomes an additional strong accelerator of prothrombin activation. Thus, in the final prothrombin activator complex, activated factor X is the actual protease that causes splitting of prothrombin to form thrombin. Activated factor V greatly accelerates this protease activity, and platelet phospholipids act as a vehicle that further accelerates the process. Note especially the positive feedback effect of thrombin, acting through factor V , to accelerate the entire process once it begins.

## Intrinsic Pathway for Initiating Clotting

The second mechanism for initiating formation of prothrombin activator, and therefore for initiating clotting, begins with trauma to the blood or exposure of the blood to collagen from a traumatized blood vessel wall. Then the process continues through the series of cascading reactions shown in Figure 37-6.

1. Blood trauma causes (1) activation of factor XII and (2) release of platelet phospholipids. Trauma to the blood or exposure of the blood to vascular wall collagen alters two important clotting factors in the blood: factor XII and the platelets. When factor XII is disturbed, such as by coming into contact with collagen or with a wettable surface such as glass, it takes on a new molecular configuration that converts it into a proteolytic enzyme called activated factor XII. Simultaneously, the blood trauma also damages the platelets because of adherence to collagen or to a wettable surface (or by damage in other ways); this releases platelet phospholipids that contain the lipoprotein called platelet factor 3, which also plays a role in subsequent clotting reactions.
2. Activation of factor XI. The activated factor XII also acts enzymatically on factor XI to activate this factor, which is the second step in the intrinsic path-
![gu3177962137](gu3177962137.jpg)

Figure 37-6. Intrinsic pathway for initiating blood clotting. HMW, High-molecular weight.

way. This reaction also requires high-molecularweight kininogen and is accelerated by prekallikrein.
3. Activation of factor IX by activated factor XI. The activated factor XI then acts enzymatically on factor IX to activate this factor as well.
4. Activation of factor $X$-role of factor VIII. The activated factor IX, acting in concert with activated factor VIII and the platelet phospholipids and factor III from the traumatized platelets, activates factor X. It is clear that when either factor VIII or platelets are in short supply, this step is deficient. Factor VIII is the factor that is missing in a person who has classic hemophilia, so it is called antihemophilic factor. Platelets are the clotting factor that is lacking in the bleeding disease called thrombocytopenia.
5. Action of activated factor $X$ to form prothrombin activator-role of factor V. This step in the intrinsic pathway is the same as the last step in the extrinsic pathway. That is, activated factor X combines with factor V and platelet or tissue phospholipids to form the complex called prothrombin activator. The prothrombin activator, in turn, initiates the cleavage of prothrombin to form thrombin within seconds, thereby setting into motion the final clotting process, as described earlier.

## Role of Calcium lons in the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Pathways

Except for the first two steps in the intrinsic pathway, calcium ions are required for promotion or acceleration of all the blood-clotting reactions. Therefore, in the absence of calcium ions, blood clotting by either pathway does not occur.

In the living body, the calcium ion concentration seldom falls low enough to affect blood-clotting kinetics significantly. However, when blood is removed from someone, it can be prevented from clotting by reducing the calcium ion concentration below the threshold level for clotting by deionizing the calcium by causing it to react with substances such as citrate ion or by precipitating the calcium with substances such as oxalate ion.

## Interaction Between Extrinsic and Intrinsic Pathways-Summary of BloodClotting Initiation

It is clear from the schemas of the intrinsic and extrinsic systems that after blood vessels rupture, clotting occurs by both pathways simultaneously. Tissue factor initiates the extrinsic pathway, whereas contact of factor XII and platelets with collagen in the vascular wall initiates the intrinsic pathway.

An especially important difference between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways is that the extrinsic pathway can be explosive; once initiated, its speed of completion to the final clot is limited only by the amount of tissue factor released from the traumatized tissues and by the quantities of factors X, VII, and V in
the blood. With severe tissue trauma, clotting can occur in as little as 15 seconds. The intrinsic pathway is much slower to proceed, usually requiring 1 to 6 minutes to cause clotting.

## Intravascular Anticoagulants Prevent Blood Clotting in the Normal Vascular System

Endothelial Surface Factors. Probably the most important factors for preventing clotting in the normal vascular system are the following: (1) the smoothness of the endothelial cell surface, which prevents contact activation of the intrinsic clotting system; (2) a layer of glycocalyx on the endothelium (glycocalyx is a mucopolysaccharide adsorbed to the surfaces of the endothelial cells), which repels clotting factors and platelets, thereby preventing activation of clotting; and (3) a protein bound with the endothelial membrane, thrombomodulin, which binds thrombin. Not only does the binding of thrombin with thrombomodulin slow the clotting process by removing thrombin, but the thrombomodulin-thrombin complex also activates a plasma protein, protein $C$, that acts as an anticoagulant by inactivating activated factors V and VIII.

When the endothelial wall is damaged, its smoothness and glycocalyx-thrombomodulin layer are lost, which activates both factor XII and the platelets, thus setting off the intrinsic pathway of clotting. If factor XII and platelets come into contact with the subendothelial collagen, the activation is even more powerful.

Intact endothelial cells also produce other substances such a prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO) that inhibit platelet aggregation and initiation of blood clotting. Prostacyclin, also called prostaglandin $\mathrm{I}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PGI}_{2}\right)$, is a member of the eicosanoid family of lipids and is a vasodilator, as well as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. As discussed in Chapter 17, NO is a powerful vasodilator released from healthy vascular endothelial cells throughout the body, and it is an important inhibitor of platelet aggregation. When endothelial cells are damaged, their production of prostacyclin and NO is greatly diminished.

Antithrombin Action of Fibrin and Antithrombin III. Among the most important anticoagulants in the blood are those that remove thrombin from the blood. The most powerful of these are the following: (1) the fibrin fibers that are formed during the process of clotting; and (2) an $\alpha$ globulin called antithrombin III or antithrombinheparin cofactor.

While a clot is forming, about $85 \%$ to $90 \%$ of the thrombin formed from the prothrombin becomes adsorbed to the fibrin fibers as they develop. This adsorption helps prevent the spread of thrombin into the remaining blood and, therefore, prevents excessive spread of the clot.

The thrombin that does not adsorb to the fibrin fibers soon combines with antithrombin III. This further blocks the effect of thrombin on the fibrinogen and then also inactivates thrombin itself during the next 12 to 20 minutes.

Heparin. Heparin is another powerful anticoagulant but, because its concentration in the blood is normally low, it has significant anticoagulant effects only under special physiological conditions. However, heparin is used widely as a pharmacological agent in medical practice in much higher concentrations to prevent intravascular clotting.

The heparin molecule is a highly negatively charged conjugated polysaccharide. By itself, it has little or no anticoagulant properties, but when it combines with antithrombin III, the effectiveness of antithrombin III for removing thrombin increases by a hundredfold to a thousandfold and thus acts as an anticoagulant. Therefore, in the presence of excess heparin, the removal of free thrombin from the circulating blood by antithrombin III is almost instantaneous.

The complex of heparin and antithrombin III removes several other activated coagulation factors in addition to thrombin, further enhancing the effectiveness of anticoagulation. The others include activated factors IX through XII.

Heparin is produced by many different cells of the body, but the largest quantities are formed by the basophilic mast cells located in the pericapillary connective tissue throughout the body. These cells continually secrete small quantities of heparin that diffuse into the circulatory system. The basophil cells of the blood, which are functionally almost identical to the mast cells, release small quantities of heparin into the plasma.

Mast cells are abundant in tissue surrounding the capillaries of the lungs and, to a lesser extent, capillaries of the liver. It is easy to understand why large quantities of heparin might be needed in these areas because the capillaries of the lungs and liver receive many embolic clots that have formed in slowly flowing venous blood; sufficient production of heparin prevents further growth of the clots.

## PLASMIN CAUSES LYSIS OF BLOOD CLOTS

The plasma proteins contain a euglobulin called plasminogen (profibrinolysin) that when activated, becomes a substance called plasmin (fibrinolysin). Plasmin is a proteolytic enzyme that resembles trypsin, the most important proteolytic digestive enzyme of pancreatic secretion. Plasmin digests fibrin fibers and some other protein coagulants, such as fibrinogen, factor V, factor VIII, prothrombin, and factor XII. Therefore, whenever plasmin is formed, it can cause lysis of a clot by destroying many of the clotting factors, thereby sometimes even causing hypocoagulability of the blood.
Activation of Plasminogen to Form Plasmin, Then Clot Lysis. When a clot is formed, a large amount of plasminogen is trapped in the clot, along with other plasma proteins. This will not become plasmin or cause lysis of the clot until it is activated. The injured tissues and vascular endothelium very slowly release a powerful activator called tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA); a few days later, after the clot has stopped the bleeding, t-PA eventually
converts plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn removes the remaining unnecessary blood clot. In fact, many small blood vessels in which blood flow has been blocked by clots are reopened by this mechanism. Thus, an especially important function of the plasmin system is to remove minute clots from millions of tiny peripheral vessels that eventually would become occluded were there no way to clear them.

## CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE EXCESSIVE BLEEDING IN HUMANS

Excessive bleeding can result from a deficiency of any of the many blood-clotting factors. Three particular types of bleeding tendencies that have been studied to the greatest extent are discussed here-bleeding caused by (1) vitamin K deficiency, (2) hemophilia, and (3) thrombocytopenia (platelet deficiency).

## DECREASED PROTHROMBIN, FACTOR VII, FACTOR IX, AND FACTOR X CAUSED BY VITAMIN K DEFICIENCY

With few exceptions, almost all the blood-clotting factors are formed by the liver. Therefore, diseases of the liver such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and acute yellow atrophy (degeneration of the liver caused by toxins, infections, or other agents) can sometimes depress the clotting system so much that the patient develops a severe tendency to bleed.

Another cause of depressed formation of clotting factors by the liver is vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K is an essential factor to a liver carboxylase that adds a carboxyl group to glutamic acid residues on five of the important clotting factors-prothrombin, factor VII, factor IX, factor $X$, and protein $C$. On adding the carboxyl group to glutamic acid residues on the immature clotting factors, vitamin K is oxidized and becomes inactive. Another enzyme, vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1), reduces vitamin K back to its active form. In the absence of active vitamin K, subsequent insufficiency of these coagulation factors in the blood can lead to serious bleeding tendencies.

Vitamin K is continually synthesized in the intestinal tract by bacteria, so vitamin K deficiency seldom occurs in healthy persons as a result of the absence of vitamin K from the diet (except in neonates, before they establish their intestinal bacterial flora). However, in persons with gastrointestinal disease, vitamin K deficiency often occurs as a result of poor absorption of fats from the gastrointestinal tract because vitamin K is fat-soluble and is ordinarily absorbed into the blood along with the fats.

One of the most prevalent causes of vitamin K deficiency is failure of the liver to secrete bile into the gastrointestinal tract, which occurs as a result of obstruction of the bile ducts or of liver disease. Lack of bile prevents adequate fat digestion and absorption and, therefore,

depresses vitamin K absorption as well. Thus, liver disease often causes decreased production of prothrombin and some other clotting factors because of poor vitamin K absorption and because of the diseased liver cells. As a result, vitamin K is injected into surgical patients with liver disease or with obstructed bile ducts before the surgical procedure is performed. Ordinarily, if vitamin K is given to a deficient patient 4 to 8 hours before the operation and the liver parenchymal cells are at least halfnormal in function, sufficient clotting factors will be produced to prevent excessive bleeding during the operation.

## HEMOPHILIA

Hemophilia is a bleeding disease that occurs almost exclusively in males. In $85 \%$ of cases, it is caused by an abnormality or deficiency of factor VIII; this type of hemophilia is called hemophilia A or classic hemophilia. About 1 of every 10,000 males in the United States has classic hemophilia. In the other $15 \%$ of patients with hemophilia $B$, the bleeding tendency is caused by deficiency of factor IX. Both these factors are transmitted genetically by way of the female (X) chromosome and are recessive in their inheritance. Therefore, a woman will rarely have hemophilia because at least one of her two X chromosomes will have the appropriate genes. If one of her X chromosomes is deficient, she will be a hemophilia carrier; her male offspring will have a $50 \%$ chance of inheriting the illness, and her female offspring will have a $50 \%$ chance of inheriting the carrier status.

Although female carriers have one normal allele and usually do not develop symptomatic hemophilia, some may experience a mild bleeding trait. It is also possible for female carriers to develop mild hemophilia due to loss of part or all of the normal X chromosome (as in Turner syndrome) or inactivation (lyonization) of the X -chromosomes. For a female to inherit full-blown symptomatic hemophilia A or B, she must receive two deficient X-chromosomes, one from her carrier mother and the other from her father, who must have hemophilia. Most cases of hemophilia are inherited, but approximately one-third of hemophilia patients do not have a family history of the disease, which appears to be caused by novel mutation events.

The bleeding trait in hemophilia can have various degrees of severity, depending on the genetic deficiency. Bleeding usually does not occur except after trauma, but in some patients, the degree of trauma required to cause severe and prolonged bleeding may be so mild that it is hardly noticeable. For example, bleeding can often last for days after extraction of a tooth.

Factor VIII has two active components, a large component with a molecular weight in the millions and a smaller component with a molecular weight of about 230,000. The smaller component is most important in the intrinsic pathway for clotting, and it is deficiency of this part of factor VIII that causes classic hemophilia. Another bleeding
disease with somewhat different characteristics, called von Willebrand disease, results from loss of the large component.

When a person with classic hemophilia experiences severe prolonged bleeding, almost the only therapy that is truly effective is injection of purified factor VIII or factor IX. Both these clotting factors are now available as recombinant proteins, although they are expensive and their half-lives are relatively short; therefore, these products are not readily available for many patients with hemophilia, especially in economically disadvantaged countries.

## THROMBOCYTOPENIA

Thrombocytopenia means the presence of very low numbers of platelets in the circulating blood. People with thrombocytopenia have a tendency to bleed, as do hemophiliacs, except that the bleeding is usually from many small venules or capillaries, rather than from larger vessels, as in hemophilia. As a result, small punctate hemorrhages occur throughout all the body tissues. The skin of such a person displays many small petechiae, red or purplish blotches, giving the disease the name thrombocytopenic purpura. As noted, platelets are especially important for the repair of minute breaks in capillaries and other small vessels.

Platelet counts below 30,000/ $\mu$ l, compared with the normal value of 150,000 to $450,000 / \mu l$, increase the risk for excessive bleeding after surgery or injury. Spontaneous bleeding, however, will not ordinarily occur until the number of platelets in the blood falls below $30,000 / \mu l$. Levels as low as $10,000 / \mu l$ are frequently lethal.

Even without determining specific platelet counts in the blood, sometimes one can suspect the existence of thrombocytopenia if the person's blood clot fails to retract. As noted earlier, clot retraction is normally dependent on release of multiple coagulation factors from the large numbers of platelets entrapped in the fibrin mesh of the clot.

The major causes of thrombocytopenia include the following: (1) decreased platelet production in the bone marrow due to infections or sepsis, nutrient deficiencies, or myelodysplastic disorders, which usually also reduce production of other cells (red blood cells [RBCs] and white blood cells); (2) peripheral platelet destruction by antibodies; (3) sequestration (pooling) of platelets in the spleen, especially in individuals with portal hypertension and excessively large spleens (splenomegaly); (4) consumption of platelets in thrombi; and (4) dilution of the blood from fluid resuscitation or massive transfusion.

Most people with thrombocytopenia have the disease known as idiopathic thrombocytopenia, which means thrombocytopenia of unknown cause. In most of these people, it has been discovered that, for unknown reasons, specific antibodies have formed and react against the platelets to destroy them. Relief from bleeding for 1 to 4 days can often be effected in a patient with thrombocytopenia

by giving fresh whole blood transfusions that contain large numbers of platelets. Also, splenectomy may be helpful, sometimes resulting in an almost complete cure because the spleen normally removes large numbers of platelets from the blood.

## THROMBOEMBOLIC CONDITIONS

Thrombi and Emboli. An abnormal clot that develops in a blood vessel is called a thrombus. Once a clot has developed, continued flow of blood past the clot is likely to break it away from its attachment and cause the clot to flow with the blood; such freely flowing clots are known as emboli. Also, emboli that originate in large arteries or in the left side of the heart can flow peripherally and plug arteries or arterioles in the brain, kidneys, or elsewhere. Emboli that originate in the venous system or in the right side of the heart generally flow into the lungs to cause pulmonary arterial embolism.

Causes of Thromboembolic Conditions. The causes of thromboembolic conditions in people are usually twofold: (1) a roughened endothelial surface of a vessel-as may be caused by arteriosclerosis, infection, or trauma-is likely to initiate the clotting process; and (2) blood often clots when it flows very slowly through blood vessels, where small quantities of thrombin and other procoagulants are always being formed.

Use of Tissue Plasminogen Activator in Treating Intravascular Clots. Genetically engineered tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is available. When delivered through a catheter to an area with a thrombus, it is effective in activating plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn can dissolve some intravascular clots. For example, if used within the 1 or 2 hours after thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery, the heart is often spared serious damage.

## FEMORAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS AND MASSIVE PULMONARY EMBOLISM

Because clotting almost always occurs when blood flow is blocked for many hours in any vessel of the body, the immobility of patients confined to bed, plus the practice of propping the knees up with pillows, often causes intravascular clotting because of blood stasis in one or more of the leg veins for hours at a time. Then the clot grows, mainly in the direction of the slowly moving venous blood, sometimes growing the entire length of the leg veins and occasionally even up into the common iliac vein and inferior vena cava. About $10 \%$ of the time, a large part of the clot disengages from its attachments to the vessel wall and flows freely with the venous blood through the right side of the heart and into the pulmonary arteries to cause massive blockage of the pulmonary arteries; this is called a massive pulmonary embolism. If the clot is large enough to occlude both pulmonary arteries at the same time, immediate death ensues. If only one pulmonary
artery is blocked, death may not occur, or the embolism may lead to death a few hours to several days later because of further growth of the clot in the pulmonary vessels. However, again, t-PA therapy can be a lifesaver.

## DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION

Occasionally, the clotting mechanism becomes activated in widespread areas of the circulation, giving rise to the condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This condition often results from the presence of large amounts of traumatized or dying tissue in the body that releases great quantities of tissue factor into the blood. Frequently, the clots are small but numerous, and they plug a large share of the small peripheral blood vessels. This process occurs especially in patients with widespread septicemia, in which circulating bacteria or bacterial toxins-especially endotoxins-activate the clotting mechanisms. The plugging of small peripheral vessels greatly diminishes delivery of oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues, a situation that leads to or exacerbates circulatory shock. It is partly for this reason that septicemic shock is lethal in $35 \%$ to $50 \%$ of patients.

A peculiar effect of disseminated intravascular coagulation is that the patient, on occasion, begins to bleed. The reason for this bleeding is that so many of the clotting factors are removed by the widespread clotting that too few procoagulants remain to allow normal hemostasis of the remaining blood.

## ANTICOAGULANTS FOR CLINICAL USE

In some thromboembolic conditions, it is desirable to delay the coagulation process. Various anticoagulants have been developed for this purpose. The ones most clinically useful are heparin and the coumarins.

## HEPARIN—INTRAVENOUS ANTICOAGULANT

Commercial heparin is extracted from several different animal tissues and prepared in almost pure form. Injection of relatively small quantities, about 0.5 to 1 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight, causes the blood-clotting time to increase from a normal of about 6 minutes to 30 or more minutes. Furthermore, this change in clotting time occurs instantaneously, thereby immediately preventing or slowing further development of a thromboembolic condition.

The action of heparin lasts about 1.5 to 4 hours. The injected heparin is destroyed by an enzyme in the blood known as heparinase.

## COUMARINS AS ANTICOAGULANTS

When a coumarin, such as warfarin, is given to a patient, the amounts of active prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X, all formed by the liver, begin to fall. Warfarin causes this effect by inhibiting the enzyme VKORC1. As

discussed previously, this enzyme converts the inactive, oxidized form of vitamin K to its active, reduced form. By inhibiting VKORC1, warfarin decreases the available active form of vitamin K in the tissues. When this decrease occurs, the coagulation factors are no longer carboxylated and are biologically inactive. Over several days, the body stores of the active coagulation factors degrade and are replaced by inactive factors. Although the coagulation factors continue to be produced, they have greatly decreased coagulant activity.

After administration of an effective dose of warfarin, the coagulant activity of the blood decreases to about $50 \%$ of normal by the end of 12 hours and to about $20 \%$ of normal by the end of 24 hours. In other words, the coagulation process is not blocked immediately but must await the degradation of the active prothrombin and the other affected coagulation factors already present in the plasma. Normal coagulation usually returns 1 to 3 days after discontinuing coumarin therapy.

## PREVENTION OF BLOOD COAGULATION OUTSIDE THE BODY

Although blood removed from the body and held in a glass test tube normally clots in about 6 minutes, blood collected in siliconized containers often does not clot for 1 hour or more. The reason for this delay is that preparing the surfaces of the containers with silicone prevents contact activation of platelets and factor XII, the two principal factors that initiate the intrinsic clotting mechanism. Conversely, untreated glass containers allow contact activation of the platelets and factor XII, with the rapid development of clots.

Heparin can be used for preventing coagulation of blood outside the body, as well as in the body. Heparin is especially used in surgical procedures in which the blood must be passed through a heart-lung machine or artificial kidney machine and then back into the patient.

Various substances that decrease the concentration of calcium ions in the blood can also be used for preventing blood coagulation outside the body. For example, a soluble oxalate compound mixed in a very small quantity with a sample of blood causes precipitation of calcium oxalate from the plasma and thereby decreases the ionic calcium level so much that blood coagulation is blocked.

Any substance that deionizes the blood calcium will prevent coagulation. The negatively charged citrate ion is especially valuable for this purpose; it is mixed with blood usually in the form of sodium, ammonium, or potassium citrate. The citrate ion combines with calcium in the blood to produce a nonionized calcium compound, and the lack of ionic calcium prevents coagulation. Citrate anticoagulants have an important advantage over the oxalate anticoagulants because oxalate is toxic to the body, whereas moderate quantities of citrate can be injected intravenously. After injection, the citrate ion is removed from the blood within a few minutes by the liver and is
polymerized into glucose or metabolized directly for energy. Consequently, 500 milliliters of blood that has been rendered noncoagulable by citrate can ordinarily be transfused into a recipient within a few minutes, without dire consequences. However, if the liver is damaged, or if large quantities of citrated blood or plasma are given too rapidly (within fractions of a minute), the citrate ion may not be removed quickly enough, and the citrate can, under these conditions, greatly depress the level of calcium ion in the blood, which can result in tetany and convulsive death.

## BLOOD COAGULATION TESTS

## BLEEDING TIME

When a sharp-pointed knife is used to pierce the tip of the finger or earlobe, bleeding ordinarily lasts for 1 to 6 minutes. This time depends largely on the depth of the wound and degree of hyperemia in the finger or earlobe at the time of the test. Lack of any one of several of the clotting factors can prolong the bleeding time, but it is especially prolonged by lack of platelets.

## CLOTTING TIME

Many methods have been devised for determining bloodclotting time. The one most widely used is to collect blood in a chemically clean glass test tube and then to tip the tube back and forth about every 30 seconds until the blood has clotted. By this method, the normal clotting time is 6 to 10 minutes. Procedures using multiple test tubes have also been devised for determining clotting time more accurately.

Unfortunately, the clotting time varies widely, depending on the method used for measuring it, so it is no longer used in many clinics. Instead, measurements of the clotting factors themselves are made, using sophisticated chemical procedures.

## PROTHROMBIN TIME AND INTERNATIONAL NORMALIZED RATIO

The prothrombin time indicates the concentration of prothrombin in the blood. Figure 37-7 shows the relationship of prothrombin concentration to prothrombin time. The method for determining prothrombin time is the following.

Blood removed from the patient is immediately oxalated so that none of the prothrombin can change into thrombin. Then, a large excess of calcium ion and tissue factor is quickly mixed with the oxalated blood. The excess calcium nullifies the effect of the oxalate, and the tissue factor activates the prothrombin to thrombin reaction by means of the extrinsic clotting pathway. The time required for coagulation to take place is known as the prothrombin time. The shortness of the time is determined mainly by the prothrombin concentration. The normal

prothrombin time is about 12 seconds. In each laboratory, a curve relating prothrombin concentration to prothrombin time, such as that shown in Figure 37-7, is drawn for the method used so that the prothrombin in the blood can be quantified.

The results obtained for prothrombin time may vary considerably, even in the same individual if there are differences in activity of the tissue factor and the analytical system used to perform the test. Tissue factor is isolated from human tissues, such as placental tissue, and different batches may have different activity. The international normalized ratio (INR) was devised as a way to standardize measurements of prothrombin time. For each batch of tissue factor, the manufacturer assigns an international sensitivity index (ISI), which indicates the activity of the tissue factor with a standardized sample. The ISI usually varies between 1.0 and 2.0. The INR is the ratio of the person's prothrombin time (PT) to a normal control sample raised to the power of the ISI:

$$
\text { INR }=\left(\frac{\text { PT }_{\text {test }}}{\text { PT }_{\text {normal }}}\right)^{\mathrm{ISI}}
$$

The normal range for INR in a healthy person is 0.9 to 1.3. A high INR level (e.g., 4 or 5 ) indicates a high risk of bleeding, whereas a low INR (e.g., 0.5) suggests that there is a chance of having a clot. Patients undergoing warfarin therapy usually have an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .

Tests similar to that for prothrombin time and INR have been devised to determine the quantities of other bloodclotting factors. In each of these tests, excesses of calcium ions and all the other factors in addition to the one being tested are added to oxalated blood all at once. Then, the time required for coagulation is determined in the same manner as for prothrombin time. If the factor being tested is deficient, the coagulation time is prolonged. The time itself can then be used to quantitate the concentration of the factor.

# Pulmonary Ventilation 

The main functions of respiration are to provide oxygen to the tissues and remove carbon dioxide. The four major components of respiration are the following: (1) pulmonary ventilation, which means the inflow and outflow of air between the atmosphere and the lung alveoli; (2) diffusion of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ and carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ between the alveoli and the blood; (3) transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and body fluids to and from the body's tissue cells; and (4) regulation of ventilation and other facets of respiration. This chapter is a discussion of pulmonary ventilation; the subsequent five chapters cover other respiratory functions plus the physiology of special respiratory abnormalities.

## MECHANICS OF PULMONARY VENTILATION

## MUSCLES THAT CAUSE LUNG EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION

The lungs can be expanded and contracted in two ways: (1) by downward or upward movement of the diaphragm to lengthen or shorten the chest cavity; and (2) by elevation or depression of the ribs to increase or decrease the anteroposterior diameter of the chest cavity. Figure 38-1 shows these two methods.

Normal quiet breathing is accomplished almost entirely by movement of the diaphragm. During inspiration, contraction of the diaphragm pulls the lower surfaces of the lungs downward. Then, during expiration, the diaphragm simply relaxes, and the elastic recoil of the lungs, chest wall, and abdominal structures compresses the lungs and expels the air. During heavy breathing, however, the elastic forces are not powerful enough to cause the necessary rapid expiration, so extra force is achieved mainly by contraction of the abdominal muscles, which pushes the abdominal contents upward against the bottom of the diaphragm, thereby compressing the lungs.

The second method for expanding the lungs is to raise the rib cage. Raising the rib cage expands the lungs because, in the natural resting position, the ribs slant downward, as shown on the left side of Figure 38-1, thus
allowing the sternum to fall backward toward the vertebral column. When the rib cage is elevated, however, the ribs project almost directly forward, so the sternum also moves forward, away from the spine, making the anteroposterior thickness of the chest about $20 \%$ greater during maximum inspiration than during expiration. Therefore, all the muscles that elevate the chest cage are classified as muscles of inspiration, and the muscles that depress the chest cage are classified as muscles of expiration.

The most important muscles that raise the rib cage are the external intercostals, but others that help are the following: (1) sternocleidomastoid muscles, which lift upward on the sternum; (2) anterior serrati, which lift many of the ribs; and (3) scaleni, which lift the first two ribs.

The muscles that pull the rib cage downward during expiration are mainly the following: (1) the abdominal recti, which have the powerful effect of pulling downward on the lower ribs at the same time that they and other abdominal muscles also compress the abdominal contents upward against the diaphragm; and (2) the internal intercostals.

Figure 38-1 also shows the mechanism whereby the external and internal intercostals act to cause inspiration and expiration. To the left, the ribs during expiration are angled downward, and the external intercostals are elongated forward and downward. As they contract, they pull the upper ribs forward in relation to the lower ribs, which causes leverage on the ribs to raise them upward, thereby causing inspiration. The internal intercostals function in the opposite manner, functioning as expiratory muscles because they angle between the ribs in the opposite direction and cause opposite leverage.

## PRESSURES THAT CAUSE MOVEMENT OF AIR IN AND OUT OF THE LUNGS

See Video 38-1. The lung is an elastic structure that collapses like a balloon and expels all its air through the trachea whenever there is no force to keep it inflated. Also, there are no attachments between the lung and walls of the chest cage, except where it is suspended at its hilum from the mediastinum, the middle section of the chest cavity. Instead, the lung "floats" in the thoracic cavity, surrounded by a thin layer of pleural fluid that lubricates
