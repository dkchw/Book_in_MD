# Pulmonary Ventilation 

The main functions of respiration are to provide oxygen to the tissues and remove carbon dioxide. The four major components of respiration are the following: (1) pulmonary ventilation, which means the inflow and outflow of air between the atmosphere and the lung alveoli; (2) diffusion of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ and carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ between the alveoli and the blood; (3) transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and body fluids to and from the body's tissue cells; and (4) regulation of ventilation and other facets of respiration. This chapter is a discussion of pulmonary ventilation; the subsequent five chapters cover other respiratory functions plus the physiology of special respiratory abnormalities.

## MECHANICS OF PULMONARY VENTILATION

## MUSCLES THAT CAUSE LUNG EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION

The lungs can be expanded and contracted in two ways: (1) by downward or upward movement of the diaphragm to lengthen or shorten the chest cavity; and (2) by elevation or depression of the ribs to increase or decrease the anteroposterior diameter of the chest cavity. Figure 38-1 shows these two methods.

Normal quiet breathing is accomplished almost entirely by movement of the diaphragm. During inspiration, contraction of the diaphragm pulls the lower surfaces of the lungs downward. Then, during expiration, the diaphragm simply relaxes, and the elastic recoil of the lungs, chest wall, and abdominal structures compresses the lungs and expels the air. During heavy breathing, however, the elastic forces are not powerful enough to cause the necessary rapid expiration, so extra force is achieved mainly by contraction of the abdominal muscles, which pushes the abdominal contents upward against the bottom of the diaphragm, thereby compressing the lungs.

The second method for expanding the lungs is to raise the rib cage. Raising the rib cage expands the lungs because, in the natural resting position, the ribs slant downward, as shown on the left side of Figure 38-1, thus
allowing the sternum to fall backward toward the vertebral column. When the rib cage is elevated, however, the ribs project almost directly forward, so the sternum also moves forward, away from the spine, making the anteroposterior thickness of the chest about $20 \%$ greater during maximum inspiration than during expiration. Therefore, all the muscles that elevate the chest cage are classified as muscles of inspiration, and the muscles that depress the chest cage are classified as muscles of expiration.

The most important muscles that raise the rib cage are the external intercostals, but others that help are the following: (1) sternocleidomastoid muscles, which lift upward on the sternum; (2) anterior serrati, which lift many of the ribs; and (3) scaleni, which lift the first two ribs.

The muscles that pull the rib cage downward during expiration are mainly the following: (1) the abdominal recti, which have the powerful effect of pulling downward on the lower ribs at the same time that they and other abdominal muscles also compress the abdominal contents upward against the diaphragm; and (2) the internal intercostals.

Figure 38-1 also shows the mechanism whereby the external and internal intercostals act to cause inspiration and expiration. To the left, the ribs during expiration are angled downward, and the external intercostals are elongated forward and downward. As they contract, they pull the upper ribs forward in relation to the lower ribs, which causes leverage on the ribs to raise them upward, thereby causing inspiration. The internal intercostals function in the opposite manner, functioning as expiratory muscles because they angle between the ribs in the opposite direction and cause opposite leverage.

## PRESSURES THAT CAUSE MOVEMENT OF AIR IN AND OUT OF THE LUNGS

See Video 38-1. The lung is an elastic structure that collapses like a balloon and expels all its air through the trachea whenever there is no force to keep it inflated. Also, there are no attachments between the lung and walls of the chest cage, except where it is suspended at its hilum from the mediastinum, the middle section of the chest cavity. Instead, the lung "floats" in the thoracic cavity, surrounded by a thin layer of pleural fluid that lubricates

movement of the lungs within the cavity. Furthermore, continual suction of excess fluid into lymphatic channels maintains a slight suction between the visceral surface of the lung pleura and the parietal pleural surface of the thoracic cavity. Therefore, the lungs are held to the thoracic wall as if glued there, except that they are well lubricated and can slide freely as the chest expands and contracts.

Pleural Pressure and Its Changes During Respiration. Pleural pressure is the pressure of the fluid in the thin space between the lung pleura and chest wall pleura. This pressure is normally a slight suction, which means a slightly negative pressure. The normal pleural pressure at the beginning of inspiration is about -5 centimeters of water $\left(\mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, which is the amount of suction required to hold the lungs open to their resting level. During normal inspiration, expansion of the chest cage pulls outward on the lungs with greater force and creates more negative pressure to an average of about $-7.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

These relationships between pleural pressure and changing lung volume are demonstrated in Figure 38-2; in the lower panel shows the increasing negativity of the pleural pressure from -5 to $-7.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ during inspiration and in the upper panel an increase in lung volume of 0.5 liter. Then, during expiration, the events are essentially reversed.

Alveolar Pressure-Air Pressure Inside the Lung Alveoli. When the glottis is open and no air is flowing into or out of the lungs, the pressures in all parts of the respiratory tree, all the way to the alveoli, are equal to atmospheric pressure, which is considered to be zero reference pressure in the airways-that is, $0 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ pressure. To cause inward flow of air into the alveoli during inspiration, the pressure in the alveoli must fall to a value slightly below atmospheric pressure (below 0 ). The second curve (labeled "alveolar pressure") of Figure 38-2 demonstrates that during normal inspiration, alveolar pressure decreas-
![gu0251436699](gu0251436699.jpg)

Figure 38-2 Changes in lung volume, alveolar pressure, pleural pressure, and transpulmonary pressure during normal breathing.
es to about $-1 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. This slight negative pressure is enough to pull 0.5 liter of air into the lungs in the 2 seconds required for normal quiet inspiration.

During expiration, alveolar pressure rises to about +1 $\mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, which forces the 0.5 liter of inspired air out of the lungs during the 2 to 3 seconds of expiration.

Transpulmonary Pressure-Difference between Alveolar and Pleural Pressures. Note in Figure 38-2 that the transpulmonary pressure is the pressure difference between that in the alveoli and that on the outer surfaces of the lungs (pleural pressure); it is a measure of the elastic forces in the lungs that tend to collapse the lungs at each instant of respiration, called the recoil pressure.

![gu0351436699](gu0351436699.jpg)

Figure 38-3 Compliance diagram in a healthy person. This diagram shows changes in lung volume during changes in transpulmonary pressure (alveolar pressure minus pleural pressure).

## Compliance of the Lungs

The extent to which the lungs will expand for each unit increase in transpulmonary pressure (if enough time is allowed to reach equilibrium) is called the lung compliance. The total compliance of both lungs together in the normal adult averages about 200 ml of air $/ \mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ transpulmonary pressure. That is, every time the transpulmonary pressure increases by $1 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, the lung volume, after 10 to 20 seconds, will expand 200 ml .

Compliance Diagram of the Lungs. Figure 38-3 is a diagram relating lung volume changes to changes in pleural pressure, which, in turn, alters transpulmonary pressure. Note that the relationship is different for inspiration and expiration. Each curve is recorded by changing the pleural pressure in small steps and allowing the lung volume to come to a steady level between successive steps. The two curves are called, respectively, the inspiratory compliance curve and the expiratory compliance curve, and the entire diagram is called the compliance diagram of the lungs.

The characteristics of the compliance diagram are determined by the elastic forces of the lungs. These forces can be divided into two parts: (1) elastic forces of the lung tissue; and (2) elastic forces caused by surface tension of the fluid that lines the inside walls of the alveoli and other lung air spaces.

The elastic forces of the lung tissue are determined mainly by elastin and collagen fibers interwoven among the lung parenchyma. In deflated lungs, these fibers are in an elastically contracted and kinked state; then, when the lungs expand, the fibers become stretched and unkinked, thereby elongating and exerting even more elastic force.

The elastic forces caused by surface tension are much more complex. The significance of surface tension is shown in Figure 38-4, which compares the compliance
![gu0451436699](gu0451436699.jpg)

Figure 38-4 Comparison of the compliance diagrams of saline-filled and air-filled lungs when the alveolar pressure is maintained at atmospheric pressure $\left(0 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$ and pleural pressure is changed to change the transpulmonary pressure.
diagram of the lungs when filled with saline solution and when filled with air. When the lungs are filled with air, there is an interface between the alveolar fluid and the air in the alveoli. In lungs filled with saline solution, there is no air-fluid interface and, therefore, the surface tension effect is not present; only tissue elastic forces are operative in the lung filled with saline solution.

Note that transpleural pressures required to expand air-filled lungs are about three times as great as those required to expand lungs filled with saline solution. Thus, one can conclude that the tissue elastic forces tending to cause collapse of the air-filled lung represent only about one-third of the total lung elasticity, whereas the fluid-air surface tension forces in the alveoli represent about twothirds.

The fluid-air surface tension elastic forces of the lungs also increase tremendously when the substance called surfactant is not present in the alveolar fluid.

## Surfactant, Surface Tension, and Collapse of the Alveoli

Principle of Surface Tension. When water forms a surface with air, the water molecules on the surface of the water have an especially strong attraction for one another. As a result, the water surface is always attempting to contract. This is what holds raindrops together-a tight contractile membrane of water molecules around the entire surface of the raindrop. Now, let us reverse these principles and see what happens on the inner surfaces of the alveoli. Here, the water surface is also attempting to contract. This tends to force air out of the alveoli through the bronchi and, in doing so, causes the alveoli to try to collapse. The net effect is to cause an elastic contractile force of the entire lungs, which is called the surface tension elastic force.

Surfactant and Its Effect on Surface Tension. Surfactant is a surface-active agent in water, which means

that it greatly reduces the surface tension of water. It is secreted by special surfactant-secreting epithelial cells called type II alveolar epithelial cells, which constitute about $10 \%$ of the surface area of the alveoli. These cells are granular, containing lipid inclusions that are secreted in the surfactant into the alveoli.

Surfactant is a complex mixture of several phospholipids, proteins, and ions. The most important components are the phospholipid dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, surfactant apoproteins, and calcium ions. The dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and several less important phospholipids are responsible for reducing the surface tension. They perform this function by not dissolving uniformly in the fluid lining the alveolar surface. Instead, part of the molecule dissolves while the remainder spreads over the surface of the water in the alveoli. This surface has from one-twelfth to one-half the surface tension of a pure water surface.

Quantitatively, the surface tension of different water fluids is approximately the following: pure water, 72 dynes $/ \mathrm{cm}$; normal fluids lining the alveoli but without surfactant, 50 dynes $/ \mathrm{cm}$; normal fluids lining the alveoli and with normal amounts of surfactant included, between 5 and 30 dynes $/ \mathrm{cm}$.

Pressure in Occluded Alveoli Caused by Surface Tension. If the air passages leading from the alveoli of the lungs are blocked, the surface tension in the alveoli tends to collapse the alveoli. This collapse creates positive pressure in the alveoli, attempting to push the air out. The amount of pressure generated in this way in an alveolus can be calculated from the following formula:

$$
\text { Pressure }=\frac{2 \times \text { Surface tension }}{\text { Radius of alveolus }}
$$

For the average-sized alveolus with a radius of about 100 micrometers and lined with normal surfactant, this calculates to be about $4 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ pressure ( 3 mm Hg ). If the alveoli were lined with pure water without any surfactant, the pressure would be calculated as about $18 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ pres-sure- 4.5 times as great. Thus, one sees the importance of surfactant in reducing alveolar surface tension and therefore also reducing the effort required by the respiratory muscles to expand the lungs.

Pressure Caused by Surface Tension Is Inversely Related to Alveolar Radius. Note from the preceding formula that the smaller the alveolus, the greater the alveolar pressure caused by the surface tension. Thus, when the alveoli have half the normal radius ( 50 instead of 100 micrometers), the pressures noted earlier are doubled. This phenomenon is especially significant in small premature infants, many of whom have alveoli with radii less than $25 \%$ that of an adult person. Furthermore, surfactant does not normally begin to be secreted into the alveoli until between the sixth and seventh months of gestation and, in some cases, even later. Therefore, many premature infants have little or no surfactant in the alveoli when they are born, and their lungs have an extreme tendency to collapse, sometimes as much as six to eight times that in a normal adult person. This situation causes respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn. It
is fatal if not treated with strong measures, especially properly applied continuous positive pressure breathing.

## EFFECT OF THE THORACIC CAGE ON LUNG EXPANSIBILITY

Thus far, we have discussed the expansibility of the lungs alone, without considering the thoracic cage. The thoracic cage has its own elastic and viscous characteristics and, even if the lungs were not present in the thorax, muscular effort would still be required to expand the thoracic cage.

## Compliance of Thorax and Lungs Together

The compliance of the entire pulmonary system (the lungs and thoracic cage together) is measured while expanding the lungs of a totally relaxed or paralyzed subject. To measure compliance, air is forced into the lungs a little at a time while recording lung pressures and volumes. To inflate this total pulmonary system, almost twice as much pressure is required compared with the same lungs after removal from the chest cage. Therefore, the compliance of the combined lung-thorax system is almost exactly half that of the lungs alone- $110 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{cm}$ $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ pressure for the combined system, compared with $200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ for the lungs alone. Furthermore, when the lungs are expanded to high volumes or compressed to low volumes, the limitations of the chest become extreme. When near these limits, the compliance of the combined lung-thorax system can be less than $20 \%$ of that of the lungs alone.

## Work of Breathing

We have already pointed out that during normal quiet breathing, all respiratory muscle contraction occurs during inspiration; expiration is almost entirely a passive process caused by elastic recoil of the lungs and chest cage. Thus, under resting conditions, the respiratory muscles normally perform "work" to cause inspiration but not to cause expiration.

The work of inspiration can be divided into three fractions: (1) that required to expand the lungs against the lung and chest elastic forces, called compliance work or elastic work; (2) that required to overcome the viscosity of the lung and chest wall structures, called tissue resistance work; and (3) that required to overcome airway resistance to movement of air into the lungs, called airway resistance work.

Energy Required for Respiration. During normal quiet respiration, only $3 \%$ to $5 \%$ of the total energy expended by the body is required for pulmonary ventilation. However, during heavy exercise, the amount of energy required can increase as much as 50 -fold, especially if the person has any degree of increased airway resistance or decreased pulmonary compliance. Therefore, one of the major limitations on the intensity of exercise that can be performed is the person's ability to provide enough muscle energy for the respiratory process alone.

## PULMONARY VOLUMES AND CAPACITIES

## RECORDING CHANGES IN PULMONARY VOLUME—SPIROMETRY

Pulmonary ventilation can be studied by recording the volume movement of air into and out of the lungs, a method called spirometry. A typical basic spirometer is shown in Figure 38-5. It consists of a drum inverted over a chamber of water, with the drum counterbalanced by a weight. In the drum is a breathing gas, usually air or oxygen; a tube connects the mouth with the gas chamber. When the person breathes into and out of the chamber, the drum rises and falls, and an appropriate recording is made.

Figure 38-6 shows a spirogram indicating changes in lung volume under different conditions of breathing. For ease in describing the events of pulmonary ventilation, the air in the lungs has been subdivided in this diagram into four volumes and four capacities, which are the averages for a young adult man. Table 38-1 summarizes the average pulmonary volumes and capacities for healthy men and women.

| Pulmonary Volumes and Capacities | Men | Women |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Volume (ml) |  |  |
| Tidal volume | 500 | 400 |
| Inspiratory reserve volume | 3000 | 1900 |
| Expiratory volume | 1100 | 700 |
| Residual volume | 1200 | 1100 |
| Capacities (ml) |  |  |

| Functional residual capacity | 2300 | 1800 |
| Vital capacity | 4600 | 3100 |
| Total lung capacity | 5800 | 4200 |

## Pulmonary Volumes

Figure 38-6 lists four pulmonary lung volumes that when added together, equal the maximum volume to which the lungs can be expanded. The lung volumes shown are for average adult males, but lung volumes vary considerably depending on physical fitness, age, height, sex, and other factors, such as the altitude at which a person resides. The significance of each of these lung volumes is the following:

1. The tidal volume is the volume of air inspired or expired with each normal breath; it amounts to about 500 ml in the average healthy man.
2. The inspiratory reserve volume is the extra volume of air that can be inspired over and above the normal tidal volume when the person inspires with full force; it is usually equal to about 3000 ml .
3. The expiratory reserve volume is the maximum extra volume of air that can be expired by forceful expiration after the end of a normal tidal expiration; this volume normally amounts to about 1100 ml in men.
4. The residual volume is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after the most forceful expiration; this volume averages about 1200 ml .

## Pulmonary Capacities

In describing events in the pulmonary cycle, it is sometimes useful to consider two or more of the volumes together. Such combinations are called pulmonary capacities. To the right in Figure 38-6 are listed the important pulmonary capacities, which can be described as follows:

1. The inspiratory capacity equals the tidal volume plus the inspiratory reserve volume. This capacity is the amount of air ( $\approx 3500 \mathrm{ml}$ ) that a person can breathe in, beginning at the normal expiratory level and distending the lungs to the maximum amount.
2. The functional residual capacity equals the expiratory reserve volume plus the residual volume. This capacity is the amount of air that remains in the lungs at the end of normal expiration $\approx 2300 \mathrm{ml}$ ).

3. The vital capacity equals the inspiratory reserve volume plus the tidal volume plus the expiratory reserve volume. This capacity is the maximum amount of air a person can expel from the lungs after first filling the lungs to their maximum extent and then expiring to the maximum extent ( $\approx 4600 \mathrm{ml}$ ).
4. The total lung capacity is the maximum volume to which the lungs can be expanded with the greatest possible effort ( $\approx 5800 \mathrm{ml}$ ); it is equal to the vital capacity plus the residual volume.
Most pulmonary volumes and capacities are usually about $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ less in women than in men, and they are greater in large and athletic people than in small and asthenic people.

## ABBREVIATIONS AND SYMBOLS USED IN PULMONARY FUNCTION STUDIES

Spirometry is only one of many measurement procedures that pulmonary physicians use daily. Many of these procedures depend heavily on mathematical computations. To simplify these calculations, as well as the presentation of pulmonary function data, several abbreviations and symbols have become standardized. The more important of these are given in Table 38-2. Using these symbols, we present here a few simple algebraic equations showing some of the interrelationships among the pulmonary volumes and capacities; the student should think through and verify these interrelationships.

## DETERMINATION OF FUNCTIONAL RESIDUAL CAPACITY, RESIDUAL VOLUME, AND TOTAL LUNG CAPACITY—HELIUM DILUTION METHOD

The functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of air that remains in the lungs at the end of each normal expiration, is important to lung function. Because its value changes markedly in some types of pulmonary disease, it is often desirable to measure this capacity. The spirometer cannot be used in to measure the FRC directly because the air in the residual volume of the lungs cannot be expired into the spirometer, and this volume constitutes about half of the FRC. To measure FRC, the spirometer must be used in an indirect manner, usually by means of a helium dilution method, as follows.

A spirometer of known volume is filled with air mixed with helium at a known concentration. Before

breathing from the spirometer, the person expires normally. At the end of this expiration, the remaining volume in the lungs is equal to the FRC. At this point, the subject immediately begins to breathe from the spirometer, and the gases of the spirometer mix with the gases of the lungs. As a result, the helium becomes diluted by the FRC gases, and the volume of the FRC can be calculated from the degree of dilution of the helium, using the following formula:

$$
\mathrm{FRC}=\left(\frac{\mathrm{Ci}_{\mathrm{He}}}{\mathrm{Cf}_{\mathrm{He}}}-1\right) \mathrm{Vi}_{\mathrm{Spir}}
$$

where $F R C$ is functional residual capacity, $C i_{H e}$ is the initial concentration of helium in the spirometer, $C f_{H e}$ is the final concentration of helium in the spirometer, and $V i_{\text {Spir }}$ is the initial volume of the spirometer.

Once the FRC has been determined, the residual volume (RV) can be determined by subtracting expiratory reserve volume (ERV), as measured by normal spirometry, from the FRC. Also, the total lung capacity (TLC) can be determined by adding the inspiratory capacity (IC) to the FRC. That is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { RV }=\text { FRC }- \text { ERV } \\
& \text { and } \\
& \text { TLC }=\text { FRC }+ \text { IC }
\end{aligned}
$$

## MINUTE RESPIRATORY VOLUME EQUALS RESPIRATORY RATE TIMES TIDAL VOLUME

The minute respiratory volume is the total amount of new air moved into the respiratory passages each minute and is equal to the tidal volume times the respiratory rate per minute. The normal tidal volume is about 500 ml , and the normal respiratory rate is about 12 breaths/ min. Therefore, the minute respiratory volume averages about $6 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. A person can live for a short period with a minute respiratory volume as low as $1.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and a respiratory rate of only 2 to 4 breaths/min.

The respiratory rate occasionally rises to 40 to 50 breaths/min, and the tidal volume can become as great as the vital capacity, about 4600 ml in a young man. This can give a minute respiratory volume greater than $200 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, or more than 30 times normal. Most people cannot sustain more than half to two-thirds of these values for longer than 1 minute.

## ALVEOLAR VENTILATION

The ultimate importance of pulmonary ventilation is to renew the air in the gas exchange areas of the lungs continually, where air is in proximity to the pulmonary blood. These areas include the alveoli, alveolar sacs, alveolar ducts, and respiratory bronchioles. The rate at which new air reaches these areas is called alveolar ventilation.
![gu0751436699](gu0751436699.jpg)

Figure 38-7 Record of the changes in nitrogen concentration in the expired air after a single previous inspiration of pure oxygen. This record can be used to calculate dead space, as discussed in the text.

## DEAD SPACE AND ITS EFFECT ON ALVEOLAR VENTILATION

Some of the air a person breathes never reaches the gas exchange areas but simply fills respiratory passages, such as the nose, pharynx, and trachea, where gas exchange does not occur. This air is called dead space air because it is not useful for gas exchange.

On expiration, the air in the dead space is expired first, before any of the air from the alveoli reaches the atmosphere. Therefore, the dead space is very disadvantageous for removing the expiratory gases from the lungs.

Measurement of Dead Space Volume. A simple method for measuring dead space volume is demonstrated by the graph in Figure 38-7. In making this measurement, the subject suddenly takes a deep breath of $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$, which fills the entire dead space with pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Some oxygen also mixes with the alveolar air but does not completely replace this air. Then the person expires through a rapidly recording nitrogen meter, which makes the record shown in the figure. The first portion of the expired air comes from the dead space regions of the respiratory passageways, where the air has been completely replaced by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Therefore, in the early part of the record, only $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ appears, and the nitrogen concentration is 0 . Then, when alveolar air begins to reach the nitrogen meter, the nitrogen concentration rises rapidly because alveolar air containing large amounts of nitrogen begins to mix with the dead space air. After still more air has been expired, all the dead space air has been washed from the passages and only alveolar air remains. Therefore, the recorded nitrogen concentration reaches a plateau level equal to its concentration in the alveoli, as shown at the right in the figure. The gray area represents the air that has no nitrogen in it and is a measure of the volume of dead space air. For exact quantification, the following equation is used:

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}=\frac{\text { Gray area } \times \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}}{\text { Pink area }+ \text { Gray area }}
$$

where $V_{D}$ is dead space air and $V_{E}$ is the total volume of expired air.

Let us assume, for example, that the gray area on the graph is 30 square centimeters, the pink area is 70 square centimeters, and the total volume expired is 500 ml . The dead space would be

$$
\frac{30}{30+70} \times 500=150 \mathrm{ml}
$$

Normal Dead Space Volume. The normal dead space air in a young man is about 150 ml . Dead space air increases slightly with age.

Anatomical Versus Physiological Dead Space. The method just described for measuring the dead space measures the volume of all the space of the respiratory system other than the alveoli and their other closely related gas exchange areas; this space is called the anatomic dead space. On occasion, some of the alveoli are nonfunctional or only partially functional because of absent or poor blood flow through the adjacent pulmonary capillaries. Therefore, these alveoli must also be considered dead space. When the alveolar dead space is included in the total measurement of dead space, this is called the physiological dead space, in contradistinction to the anatomical dead space. In a person with healthy lungs, the anatomical and physiological dead spaces are nearly equal because all alveoli are functional in the normal lung but, in a person with partially functional or nonfunctional alveoli in some parts of the lungs, the physiological dead space may be as much as 10 times the volume of the anatomical dead space, or 1 to 2 liters. These problems are discussed further in Chapter 40 in relation to pulmonary gaseous exchange and in Chapter 43 in relation to certain pulmonary diseases.

## RATE OF ALVEOLAR VENTILATION

Alveolar ventilation per minute is the total volume of new air entering the alveoli and adjacent gas exchange areas each minute. It is equal to the respiratory rate times the amount of new air that enters these areas with each breath:

$$
\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}}=\operatorname{Freq} \times\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}\right)
$$

where $\dot{V}_{A}$ is the volume of alveolar ventilation per minute, Freq is the frequency of respiration per minute, $V_{T}$ is the tidal volume, and $V_{d}$ is the physiological dead space volume.

Thus, with a normal tidal volume of 500 ml , a normal dead space of 150 ml , and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/ min , alveolar ventilation equals $12 \times(500-150)$, or 4200 $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$.

Alveolar ventilation is one of the major factors determining the concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the alveoli. Therefore, almost all discussions of gaseous exchange in the following chapters on the respiratory system focus on alveolar ventilation.

## Functions of Respiratory Passageways

## Trachea, Bronchi, and Bronchioles

Figure 38-8 highlights the respiratory passageways. The air is distributed to the lungs by way of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles.

One of the most important challenges in the respiratory passageways is to keep them open and allow easy passage of air to and from the alveoli. To keep the trachea from collapsing, multiple cartilage rings extend about five-sixths of the way around the trachea. In the walls of the bronchi, less extensive curved cartilage plates also maintain a reasonable amount of rigidity yet allow sufficient motion for the lungs to expand and contract. These plates become progressively less extensive in the later generations of bronchi and are gone in the bronchioles, which usually have diameters less than 1.5 millimeters. The bronchioles are not prevented

from collapsing by the rigidity of their walls. Instead, they are kept expanded mainly by the same transpulmonary pressures that expand the alveoli. That is, as the alveoli enlarge, the bronchioles also enlarge, but not as much.

Muscular Wall of the Bronchi and Bronchioles. In all areas of the trachea and bronchi not occupied by cartilage plates, the walls are composed mainly of smooth muscle. Also, the walls of the bronchioles are almost entirely smooth muscle, with the exception of the most terminal bronchiole, called the respiratory bronchiole, which is mainly pulmonary epithelium and underlying fibrous tissue plus a few smooth muscle fibers. Many obstructive diseases of the lung result from narrowing of the smaller bronchi and larger bronchioles, often because of excessive contraction of the smooth muscle.

Resistance to Airflow in the Bronchial Tree. Under normal respiratory conditions, air flows through the respiratory passageways so easily that less than $1 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ pressure gradient from the alveoli to the atmosphere is sufficient to cause enough airflow for quiet breathing. The greatest amount of resistance to airflow occurs not in the tiny air passages of the terminal bronchioles but in some of the larger bronchioles and bronchi near the trachea. The reason for this high resistance is that there are relatively few of these larger bronchi in comparison with the approximately 65,000 parallel terminal bronchioles, through each of which only a minute amount of air must pass.

In some disease conditions, the smaller bronchioles play a far greater role in determining airflow resistance because of their small size and because they are easily occluded by the following: (1) muscle contraction in their walls; (2) edema in the walls; or (3) mucus collecting in the lumens of the bronchioles.

Nervous and Local Control of the Bronchiolar Muscu-lature-Sympathetic Dilation of the Bronchioles. Direct control of the bronchioles by sympathetic nerve fibers is relatively weak because few of these fibers penetrate to the central portions of the lung. However, the bronchial tree is very much exposed to norepinephrine and epinephrine released into the blood by sympathetic stimulation of the adrenal gland medullae. Both these hormones, especially epinephrine because of its greater stimulation of betaadrenergic receptors, cause dilation of the bronchial tree.

Parasympathetic Constriction of the Bronchioles. A few parasympathetic nerve fibers derived from the vagus nerves penetrate the lung parenchyma. These nerves secrete acetylcholine and, when activated, cause mild to moderate constriction of the bronchioles. When a disease process such as asthma has already caused some bronchiolar constriction, superimposed parasympathetic nervous stimulation often worsens the condition. When this situation occurs, administration of drugs that block the effects of acetylcholine, such as atropine, can sometimes relax the respiratory passages enough to relieve the obstruction.

Sometimes the parasympathetic nerves are also activated by reflexes that originate in the lungs. Most of these reflexes begin with irritation of the epithelial membrane of the respiratory passageways, initiated by noxious gases, dust, cigarette smoke, or bronchial infection. Also, a bronchiolar constrictor reflex often occurs when microemboli occlude small pulmonary arteries.

Local Secretory Factors May Cause Bronchiolar Constriction. Several substances formed in the lungs are often active in causing bronchiolar constriction. Two of the most important of these are histamine and slow reactive substance of anaphylaxis. Both these substances are released in the lung tissues by mast cells during allergic reactions, especially those caused by pollen in the air. Therefore, they play key roles in causing airway obstruction in allergic asthma; this is especially true of the slow reactive substance of anaphylaxis.

The same irritants that cause parasympathetic constrictor reflexes of the airways-smoke, dust, sulfur dioxide, and some of the acidic elements in smog-may also act directly on the lung tissues to initiate local, non-nervous reactions that cause obstructive constriction of the airways.

## Mucus Lining the Respiratory Passageways and Cilia Action to Clear the Passageways

All the respiratory passages, from the nose to the terminal bronchioles, are kept moist by a layer of mucus that coats the entire surface. The mucus is secreted partly by individual mucous goblet cells in the epithelial lining of the passages and partly by small submucosal glands. In addition to keeping the surfaces moist, the mucus traps small particles out of the inspired air and keeps most of these particles from ever reaching the alveoli. The mucus is removed from the passages in the following manner.

The entire surface of the respiratory passages, in the nose and the lower passages, down as far as the terminal bronchioles, is lined with ciliated epithelium, with about 200 cilia on each epithelial cell. These cilia beat continually at a rate of 10 to 20 times/sec by the mechanism explained in Chapter 2, and the direction of their "power stroke" is always toward the pharynx. That is, the cilia in the lungs beat upward, whereas those in the nose beat downward. This continual beating causes the coat of mucus to flow slowly, at a velocity of a few millimeters per minute, toward the pharynx. Then the mucus and its entrapped particles are swallowed or coughed to the exterior.

## Cough Reflex

The bronchi and trachea are so sensitive to light touch that slight amounts of foreign matter or other causes of irritation initiate the cough reflex. The larynx and carina (the point where the trachea divides into the bronchi) are especially sensitive, and the terminal bronchioles and even the alveoli are sensitive to corrosive chemical stimuli such as sulfur dioxide gas or chlorine gas. Afferent nerve impulses pass from the respiratory passages mainly through the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain. There, an automatic sequence of events is triggered by the neuronal circuits of the medulla, causing the following effects.

1. Up to 2.5 liters of air are rapidly inspired.
2. The epiglottis closes, and the vocal cords shut tightly to entrap the air within the lungs.
3. The abdominal muscles contract forcefully, pushing against the diaphragm while other expiratory muscles, such as the internal intercostals, also contract forcefully. Consequently, the pressure in the lungs rises rapidly, to as much as 100 mm Hg or more.
4. The vocal cords and epiglottis suddenly open widely, so that air under this high pressure in the lungs explodes outward. Sometimes this air is expelled at velocities ranging from 75 to 100 miles/hour.

Importantly, the strong compression of the lungs collapses the bronchi and trachea by causing their noncartilaginous parts to invaginate inward, so the exploding air actually passes through bronchial and tracheal slits. The rapidly moving air usually carries with it any foreign matter that is present in the bronchi or trachea.

## Sneeze Reflex

The sneeze reflex is very much like the cough reflex, except that it applies to the nasal passageways instead of the lower respiratory passages. The initiating stimulus of the sneeze reflex is irritation in the nasal passageways; the afferent impulses pass in the fifth cranial nerve to the medulla, where the reflex is triggered. A series of reactions similar to those for the cough reflex takes place, but the uvula is depressed, so large amounts of air pass rapidly through the nose, thus helping clear the nasal passages of foreign matter.

## Normal Respiratory Functions of the Nose

As air passes through the nose, three distinct normal respiratory functions are performed by the nasal cavities: (1) the air is warmed by the extensive surfaces of the conchae and septum, a total area of about 160 square centimeters (see Figure 38-8); (2) the air is almost completely humidified, even before it passes beyond the nose; and (3) the air is partially filtered. These functions together are called the air-conditioning function of the upper respiratory passageways. Ordinarily, the temperature of the inspired air rises to within $1^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ of body temperature and to within $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ of full saturation with water vapor before it reaches the trachea. When a person breathes air through a tube directly into the trachea (as through a tracheostomy), the cooling and especially the drying effect in the lower lung can lead to serious lung crusting and infection.

Filtration Function of the Nose. The hairs at the entrance to the nostrils are important for filtering out large particles. Much more important, though, is the removal of particles by turbulent precipitation. That is, the air passing through the nasal passageways hits many obstructing vanes-the conchae (also called turbinates, because they cause turbulence of the air), the septum, and the pharyngeal wall. Each time air hits one of these obstructions, it must change its direction of movement. The particles suspended in the air, having far more mass and momentum than air, cannot change their direction of travel as rapidly as the air can. Therefore, they continue forward, striking the surfaces of the obstructions, and are entrapped in the mucous coating and transported by the cilia to the pharynx to be swallowed.

Size of Particles Entrapped in the Respiratory Passages. The nasal turbulence mechanism for removing particles from air is so effective that almost no particles larger than 6 micrometers in diameter enter the lungs through the nose. This size is smaller than red blood cells.

Of the remaining particles, many that are between 1 and 5 micrometers settle in the smaller bronchioles as a result of gravitational precipitation. For example, terminal bronchiolar disease is common in coal miners because of settled dust particles. Some of the still smaller particles ( $<1$ micrometer in diameter) diffuse against the walls of the alveoli and adhere to the alveolar fluid. However, many particles smaller than 0.5 micrometer in diameter remain suspended in the alveolar air and are expelled by expiration. For
example, the particles of cigarette smoke are about 0.3 micrometer. Almost none of these particles are precipitated in the respiratory passageways before they reach the alveoli. Unfortunately, up to one-third of them do precipitate in the alveoli by the diffusion process, with the balance remaining suspended and expelled in the expired air.

Many of the particles that become entrapped in the alveoli are removed by alveolar macrophages, as explained in Chapter 34, and others are carried away by the lung lymphatics. An excess of particles can cause growth of fibrous tissue in the alveolar septa, leading to permanent debility.

## Vocalization

Speech involves not only the respiratory system but also the following: (1) specific speech nervous control centers in the cerebral cortex, discussed in Chapter 58; (2) respiratory control centers of the brain; and (3) the articulation and resonance structures of mouth and nasal cavities. Speech is composed of two mechanical functions: (1) phonation, which is achieved by the larynx; and (2) articulation, which is achieved by the structures of the mouth.

Phonation. The larynx, shown in Figure 38-9A, is especially adapted to act as a vibrator. The vibrating elements are the vocal folds, commonly called the vocal cords. The vocal cords protrude from the lateral walls of the larynx toward the center of the glottis; they are stretched and positioned by several specific muscles of the larynx itself.

Figure 38-9B shows the vocal cords as they are seen when looking into the glottis with a laryngoscope. During normal breathing, the cords are wide open to allow easy passage of air. During phonation, the cords move together so that passage of air between them will cause vibration. The pitch of the vibration is determined mainly by the degree of stretch of the cords, but also by how tightly the cords are approximated to one another and by the mass of their edges.

Figure 38-9A shows a dissected view of the vocal folds after removal of the mucous epithelial lining. Immediately inside each cord is a strong elastic ligament called the vocal ligament. This ligament is attached anteriorly to the large thyroid cartilage, which is the cartilage that projects forward from the anterior surface of the neck and is called the Adam's apple. Posteriorly, the vocal ligament is attached to the vocal processes of two arytenoid cartilages. The thyroid cartilage and the arytenoid cartilages articulate from below with another cartilage (not shown in Figure 38-9), the cricoid cartilage.

The vocal cords can be stretched by forward rotation of the thyroid cartilage or posterior rotation of the arytenoid cartilages, activated by muscles stretching from the thyroid cartilage and arytenoid cartilages to the cricoid cartilage. Muscles located in the vocal cords lateral to the vocal ligaments, the thyroarytenoid muscles, can pull the arytenoid cartilages toward the thyroid cartilage and, therefore, loosen the vocal cords. Also, slips of these muscles in the vocal cords can change the shapes and masses of the vocal cord edges, sharpening them to emit high-pitched sounds and blunting them for the more bass sounds.

Several other sets of small laryngeal muscles lie between the arytenoid cartilages and cricoid cartilage and can rotate these cartilages inward or outward or pull their bases together or apart to give the various configurations of the vocal cords, shown in Figure 38-9B.

Articulation and Resonance. The three major organs of articulation are the lips, tongue, and soft palate. They need not be discussed in detail here because we are all familiar with their movements during speech and other vocalizations.

The resonators include the mouth, the nose and associated nasal sinuses, the pharynx, and even the chest cavity. Again, we are familiar with the resonating qualities of these structures. For example, the function of the nasal resonators is demonstrated by the change in voice quality when a person has a severe cold that blocks the air passages to these resonators.

# Pulmonary Circulation, Pulmonary Edema, and Pleural Fluid 

The lung has two circulations, a high-pressure, low-flow circulation and a low-pressure, high-flow circulation. The high-pressure, low-flow circulation supplies systemic arterial blood to the trachea, bronchial tree (including the terminal bronchioles), supporting tissues of the lung, and outer coats (adventitia) of the pulmonary arteries and veins. The bronchial arteries, which are branches of the thoracic aorta, supply most of this systemic arterial blood at a pressure that is only slightly lower than the aortic pressure.

The low-pressure, high-flow circulation supplies venous blood from all parts of the body to the alveolar capillaries where oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ is added and carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ is removed. The pulmonary artery, which receives blood from the right ventricle, and its arterial branches carry blood to the alveolar capillaries for gas exchange, and the pulmonary veins then return the blood to the left atrium to be pumped by the left ventricle though the systemic circulation.

In this chapter, we discuss the special aspects of the pulmonary circulation that are important for gas exchange in the lungs.

## PHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PULMONARY CIRCULATORY SYSTEM

Pulmonary Vessels. The pulmonary artery extends only 5 centimeters beyond the apex of the right ventricle and then divides into right and left main branches that supply blood to the two respective lungs.

The pulmonary artery has a wall thickness one-third that of the aorta. The pulmonary arterial branches are short, and all the pulmonary arteries, even the smaller arteries and arterioles, have larger diameters than their counterpart systemic arteries. This feature, combined with the fact that the vessels are thin and distensible, gives the pulmonary arterial tree a large compliance, averaging almost $7 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, which is similar to that of the entire systemic arterial tree. This large compliance allows the pulmonary arteries to accommodate the stroke volume output of the right ventricle.

The pulmonary veins, like the pulmonary arteries, are also short. They immediately empty their effluent blood into the left atrium.

Bronchial Vessels. Blood also flows to the lungs through small bronchial arteries that originate from the systemic circulation, amounting to $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ of the total cardiac output. This bronchial arterial blood is oxygenated blood, in contrast to the partially deoxygenated blood in the pulmonary arteries. It supplies the supporting tissues of the lungs, including the connective tissue, septa, and large and small bronchi. After this bronchial and arterial blood passes through the supporting tissues, it empties into the pulmonary veins and enters the left atrium, rather than passing back to the right atrium. Therefore, the flow into the left atrium and left ventricular output are about $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ greater than that of the right ventricular output.

Lymphatics. Lymph vessels are present in all the supportive tissues of the lung, beginning in the connective tissue spaces that surround the terminal bronchioles, coursing to the hilum of the lung, and then mainly into the right thoracic lymph duct. Particulate matter entering the alveoli is partly removed by these lymph vessels, and plasma protein leaking from the lung capillaries is also removed from the lung tissues, thereby helping to prevent pulmonary edema.

## PRESSURES IN THE PULMONARY SYSTEM

Pressures in the Right Ventricle. The pressure pulse curves of the right ventricle and pulmonary artery are shown in the lower portion of Figure 39-1. These curves are contrasted with the much higher aortic pressure curve shown in the upper portion of the figure. The normal systolic pressure in the right ventricle averages about 25 mm Hg , and the diastolic pressure averages about 0 to 1 mm Hg , values that are only one-fifth those for the left ventricle.
Pressures in the Pulmonary Artery. During systole, the pressure in the pulmonary artery is essentially equal to the pressure in the right ventricle, as also shown in

![gu1051436699](gu1051436699.jpg)

Figure 39-1. Pressure pulse contours in the right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and aorta.
![gu1151436699](gu1151436699.jpg)

Figure 39-2. Pressures in the different vessels of the lungs. The red curve denotes arterial pulsations. D, Diastolic; M, mean; S, systolic.

Figure 39-1. However, after the pulmonary valve closes at the end of systole, the ventricular pressure falls precipitously, whereas the pulmonary arterial pressure falls more slowly as blood flows through the lungs.

As shown in Figure 39-2, the systolic pulmonary arterial pressure normally averages about 25 mm Hg in the human being, the diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure is about 8 mm Hg , and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure is 15 mm Hg .

Pulmonary Capillary Pressure. The mean pulmonary capillary pressure, as diagrammed in Figure 39-2, is about 7 mm Hg . The importance of this low capillary pressure is discussed in detail later in the chapter in relation to fluid exchange functions of the pulmonary capillaries.

Left Atrial and Pulmonary Venous Pressures. The mean pressure in the left atrium and major pulmonary veins averages about 2 mm Hg in the recumbent person, varying from as low as 1 mm Hg to as high as 5 mm Hg . It usually is not feasible to measure someone's left atrial pressure using a direct measuring device because it is difficult to pass a catheter through the heart chambers into the left atrium. However, the left atrial pressure can be estimated with moderate accuracy by measuring the so-called pulmonary wedge pressure. This is measured by inserting a catheter first through a peripheral vein to
the right atrium, then through the right side of the heart and through the pulmonary artery into one of the small branches of the pulmonary artery, and finally pushing the catheter until it wedges tightly in the small branch.

The pressure measured through the catheter, called the "wedge pressure," is about 5 mm Hg . Because all blood flow has been stopped in the small wedged artery, and because the blood vessels extending beyond this artery make a direct connection with the pulmonary capillaries, this wedge pressure is usually only 2 to 3 mm Hg higher than the left atrial pressure. When the left atrial pressure rises to high values, the pulmonary wedge pressure also rises. Therefore, wedge pressure measurements can be used to estimate changes in pulmonary capillary pressure and left atrial pressure in patients with congestive heart failure.

## BLOOD VOLUME OF THE LUNGS

The blood volume of the lungs is about 450 ml , about $9 \%$ of the total blood volume of the entire circulatory system. Approximately 70 ml of this pulmonary blood volume is in the pulmonary capillaries; the remainder is divided about equally between the pulmonary arteries and veins.

Lungs Serve as a Blood Reservoir. Under various physiological and pathological conditions, the quantity of blood in the lungs can vary from as little as half-normal up to twice normal. For example, when a person blows out air so hard that high pressure is built up in the lungs, such as when blowing a trumpet, as much as 250 ml of blood can be expelled from the pulmonary circulatory system into the systemic circulation. Also, loss of blood from the systemic circulation by hemorrhage can be partly compensated for by the automatic shift of blood from the lungs into the systemic vessels.

Cardiac Pathology May Shift Blood From Systemic Circulation to Pulmonary Circulation. Failure of the left side of the heart, or increased resistance to blood flow through the mitral valve as a result of mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation, causes blood to dam up in the pulmonary circulation, sometimes increasing the pulmonary blood volume as much as $100 \%$ and causing large increases in the pulmonary vascular pressures. Because the volume of the systemic circulation is about nine times that of the pulmonary system, a shift of blood from one system to the other affects the pulmonary system greatly but usually has only mild systemic circulatory effects.

## BLOOD FLOW THROUGH THE LUNGS AND ITS DISTRIBUTION

Blood flow through the lungs is essentially equal to the cardiac output. Therefore, the factors that control cardiac output-mainly peripheral factors, as discussed in Chapter 20-also control pulmonary blood flow. Under most conditions, the pulmonary vessels act as distensible tubes that enlarge with increasing pressure and narrow

Figure 39-3. Regulation of blood flow in the lungs during local tissue hypoxia. Local tissue blood flow and alveolar ventilation are normally matched for optimal gas exchange (top panel). Decreased $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ in tissue surrounding poorly ventilated alveoli causes vasoconstriction of adjacent arterioles and diverts blood flow to alveoli that are well ventilated (bottom panel).
with decreasing pressure. For adequate aeration of the blood to occur, the blood must be distributed to the segments of the lungs where the alveoli are best oxygenated. This distribution is achieved by the following mechanism.

## Decreased Alveolar Oxygen Reduces Local Alveolar Blood Flow and Regulates Pulmonary Blood Flow

Distribution. When the concentration of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the air of the alveoli decreases below normal, especially when it falls below $70 \%$ of normal (i.e., $<73 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} \mathrm{PO}_{2}$ ), the adjacent blood vessels constrict (Figure 39-3) and may increase vascular resistance more than fivefold at extremely low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ levels. This effect is opposite to the effect observed in systemic vessels, which dilate rather than constrict in response to low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ levels. Although the mechanisms that promote pulmonary vasoconstriction during hypoxia are not completely understood, low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentration may have the following effects: (1) stimulate release of, or increase sensitivity to, vasoconstrictor substances such as endothelin or reactive oxygen species; or (2) decrease release of a vasodilator, such as nitric oxide, from the lung tissue.

Some studies have suggested that hypoxia may directly induce vasoconstriction by inhibition of oxygen-sensitive potassium ion channels in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. With low partial pressures of oxygen, these channels are blocked, leading to depolarization of the cell membrane and activation of calcium channels
![gu1351436699](gu1351436699.jpg)

Figure 39-4. Blood flow at different levels in the lung of an upright person at rest (red curve) and during exercise (blue curve). Note that when the person is at rest, the blood flow is very low at the top of the lungs; most of the flow is through the bottom of the lung.
and causing the influx of calcium ions. The rise of calcium concentration then causes constriction of small arteries and arterioles.

The increase in pulmonary vascular resistance as a result of low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentration has the important function of distributing blood flow where it is most effective. That is, if some alveoli are poorly ventilated and have a low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentration, the local vessels constrict. This constriction causes the blood to flow through other areas of the lungs that are better aerated, thus providing an automatic control system for distributing blood flow to the pulmonary areas in proportion to their alveolar $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressures.

## EFFECT OF HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE GRADIENTS IN THE LUNGS ON REGIONAL PULMONARY BLOOD FLOW

In Chapter 15, we pointed out that the blood pressure in the foot of a standing person can be as much as 90 mm Hg greater than the pressure at the level of the heart. This difference is caused by hydrostatic pressure-that is, by the weight of the blood itself in the blood vessels. The same effect, but to a lesser degree, occurs in the lungs. In the upright adult, the lowest point in the lungs is normally about 30 cm below the highest point, which represents a $23-\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ pressure difference, about 15 mm Hg of which is above the heart and 8 below. That is, the pulmonary arterial pressure in the uppermost portion of the lung of a standing person is about 15 mm Hg less than the pulmonary arterial pressure at the level of the heart, and the pressure in the lowest portion of the lungs is about 8 mm Hg higher.

Such pressure differences have profound effects on blood flow through the different areas of the lungs. This effect is demonstrated by the lower curve in Figure 39-4, which depicts blood flow per unit of lung tissue at different levels of the lung in the upright person. Note that in

![gu1451436699](gu1451436699.jpg)

Figure 39-5. Mechanics of blood flow in the three blood flow zones of the lung: zone 1, no flow-alveolar air pressure (PALV) is greater than arterial pressure; zone 2, intermittent flow-systolic arterial pressure rises higher than alveolar air pressure, but diastolic arterial pressure falls below alveolar air pressure; and zone 3, continuous flow—arterial pressure and pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc) remain greater than alveolar air pressure at all times.
the standing position at rest, there is little flow in the top of the lung but about five times as much flow in the bottom. To help explain these differences, the lung is often described as being divided into three zones, as shown in Figure 39-5. In each zone, the patterns of blood flow are quite different.

## Zones 1, 2, and 3 of Pulmonary Blood Flow

The capillaries in the alveolar walls are distended by the blood pressure inside them but simultaneously are compressed by the alveolar air pressure on their outsides. Therefore, whenever the lung alveolar air pressure becomes greater than the capillary blood pressure, the capillaries close, and there is no blood flow. Under different normal and pathological lung conditions, one may find any one of three possible zones (patterns) of pulmonary blood flow, as follows:

- Zone 1: No blood flow during all portions of the cardiac cycle because the local alveolar capillary pressure in that area of the lung never rises higher than the alveolar air pressure during any part of the cardiac cycle
- Zone 2: Intermittent blood flow only during the peaks of pulmonary arterial pressure because the systolic pressure is then greater than the alveolar air pressure, but the diastolic pressure is less than the alveolar air pressure
- Zone 3: Continuous blood flow because the alveolar capillary pressure remains greater than alveolar air pressure during the entire cardiac cycle
Normally, the lungs have only zones 2 and 3 blood flow-zone 2 (intermittent flow) in the apices and zone 3 (continuous flow) in all the lower areas. For example, when a person is in the upright position, the pulmonary arterial pressure at the lung apex is about 15 mm Hg less than the pressure at the level of the heart. Therefore, the apical systolic pressure is only $10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}(25 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at heart level minus 15 mm Hg hydrostatic pressure difference). This 10 mm Hg apical blood pressure is greater than the 0 alveolar air pressure, so blood flows through the pulmonary apical capillaries during cardiac systole. Conversely, during diastole, the 8 mm Hg diastolic pressure at the level of the heart is not sufficient to push the blood up the 15 mm Hg hydrostatic pressure gradient required to cause diastolic capillary flow. Therefore, blood flow through the apical part of the lung is intermittent, with flow during systole but cessation of flow during diastole; this is called zone 2 blood flow. Zone 2 blood flow begins in normal lungs about 10 cm above the midlevel of the heart and extends from there to the top of the lungs.

In the lower regions of the lungs, from about 10 cm above the level of the heart all the way to the bottom of the lungs, the pulmonary arterial pressure during both systole and diastole remains greater than the 0 alveolar air pressure. Therefore, continuous flow occurs through the alveolar capillaries, or zone 3 blood flow. Also, when a person is lying down, no part of the lung is more than a few centimeters above the level of the heart. In this case, blood flow in a normal person is entirely zone 3 blood flow, including the lung apices.

Zone 1 Blood Flow Occurs Only Under Abnormal Conditions. Zone 1 blood flow, which means no blood flow at any time during the cardiac cycle, occurs when the pulmonary systolic arterial pressure is too low or the alveolar pressure is too high to allow flow. For example, if an upright person is breathing against a positive air pressure so that the intra-alveolar air pressure is at least 10 mm Hg greater than normal but the pulmonary systolic blood pressure is normal, one would expect zone 1 blood flow-no blood flow-in the lung apices. Another case in which zone 1 blood flow occurs is in an upright person whose pulmonary systolic arterial pressure is exceedingly low, as might occur after severe blood loss.

Exercise Increases Blood Flow Through All Parts of the Lungs. Referring again to Figure 39-4, one sees that the blood flow in all parts of the lung increases during exercise. A major reason for increased blood flow is that the pulmonary vascular pressures rise enough during exercise to convert the lung apices from a zone 2 pattern into a zone 3 pattern of flow.

![gu1551436699](gu1551436699.jpg)

Figure 39-6. Effect on mean pulmonary arterial pressure caused by increasing the cardiac output during exercise.

## Increased Cardiac Output During Heavy Exercise Is Normally Accommodated by the Pulmonary Circulation Without Large Increases in Pulmonary Artery Pressure

During heavy exercise, blood flow through the lungs may increase fourfold to sevenfold. This extra flow is accommodated in the lungs in three ways: (1) by increasing the number of open capillaries, sometimes as much as threefold; (2) by distending all the capillaries and increasing the rate of flow through each capillary more than twofold; and (3) by increasing the pulmonary arterial pressure. Normally, the first two changes decrease pulmonary vascular resistance so much that the pulmonary arterial pressure rises very little, even during maximum exercise. This effect is shown in Figure 39-6.

The ability of the lungs to accommodate greatly increased blood flow during exercise, without increasing the pulmonary arterial pressure, conserves the energy of the right side of the heart. This ability also prevents a major rise in pulmonary capillary pressure and the development of pulmonary edema.

## Function of Pulmonary Circulation When Left Atrial Pressure Rises as a Result of Left-Sided Heart Failure

The left atrial pressure in a healthy person almost never rises above +6 mm Hg , even during the most strenuous exercise. These small changes in left atrial pressure have virtually no effect on pulmonary circulatory function because this merely expands the pulmonary venules and opens up more capillaries so that blood continues to flow with almost equal ease from the pulmonary arteries.

When the left side of the heart fails, however, blood begins to dam up in the left atrium. As a result, the left atrial pressure can rise on occasion from its normal value of 1 to 5 mm Hg to as high as 40 to 50 mm Hg . The initial rise in atrial pressure, up to about 7 mm Hg , has little effect on pulmonary circulatory function. However,
when the left atrial pressure rises to greater than 7 or 8 mm Hg , further increases in left atrial pressure cause almost equally great increases in pulmonary arterial pressure, thus causing a concomitant increased load on the right heart. Any increase in left atrial pressure above 7 or 8 mm Hg increases capillary pressure almost equally as much. When the left atrial pressure rises above 30 mm Hg , causing similar increases in capillary pressure, pulmonary edema is likely to develop, as discussed later in the chapter.

## PULMONARY CAPILLARY DYNAMICS

Exchange of gases between the alveolar air and pulmonary capillary blood is discussed in the next chapter. However, it is important to note here that the alveolar walls are lined with so many capillaries that in most places, the capillaries almost touch one another side by side. Therefore, it is often said that the capillary blood flows in the alveolar walls as a "sheet of flow," rather than in individual capillaries.

Pulmonary Capillary Pressure. Although direct measurements of pulmonary capillary pressure have not been reported, indirect estimates have suggested that it normally averages about 7 mm Hg . This value is probably nearly correct because the mean left atrial pressure is about 2 mm Hg , and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure is only 15 mm Hg , so the mean pulmonary capillary pressure must lie somewhere between these two values.

Length of Time Blood Stays in the Pulmonary Capillaries. From histological studies of the total crosssectional area of all the pulmonary capillaries, it can be calculated that when the cardiac output is normal, blood passes through the pulmonary capillaries in about 0.8 second. When the cardiac output increases, this time can shorten to as little as 0.3 second. The shortened time would be much greater were it not for the fact that additional capillaries, which normally are collapsed, open up to accommodate the increased blood flow. Thus, in only a fraction of a second, blood passing through the alveolar capillaries becomes oxygenated and loses its excess carbon dioxide.

## Capillary Exchange of Fluid in the Lungs and Pulmonary Interstitial Fluid Dynamics

The dynamics of fluid exchange across the lung capillary membranes are qualitatively the same as for peripheral tissues. However, quantitatively, there are important differences, as follows:

1. The pulmonary capillary pressure is low, about 7 mm Hg , in comparison with a considerably higher functional capillary pressure in many peripheral tissues of about 17 mm Hg .
2. The interstitial fluid pressure in the lung is slightly more negative than that in peripheral subcutane-

![gu1651436699](gu1651436699.jpg)

ous tissue. (This pressure has been measured in two ways-by a micropipette inserted into the pulmonary interstitium, giving a value of about -5 mm Hg , and by measuring the absorption pressure of fluid from the alveoli, giving a value of about -8 mm Hg .)
3. The colloid osmotic pressure of the pulmonary interstitial fluid is about 14 mm Hg , in comparison with less than half this value in most peripheral tissues.
4. The alveolar walls are extremely thin, and the alveolar epithelium covering the alveolar surfaces is so weak that it can be ruptured by any positive pressure in the interstitial spaces greater than alveolar air pressure ( $>0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ), which allows dumping of fluid from the interstitial spaces into the alveoli. Now let us see how these quantitative differences affect pulmonary fluid dynamics.

## Interrelationships Between Interstitial Fluid Pressure

and Other Pressures in the Lung. Figure 39-7 shows a pulmonary capillary, pulmonary alveolus, and lymphatic capillary draining the interstitial space between the blood capillary and alveolus. Note the balance of forces at the blood capillary membrane, as follows:

|  | mmHg |
| :--: | :--: |
| Forces tending to cause movement of fluid outward from the capillaries and into the pulmonary interstitium: |  |
| - Capillary pressure | 7 |
| - Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure | 14 |
| - Negative interstitial fluid pressure | 8 |
| TOTAL OUTWARD FORCE | 29 |
| Forces tending to cause absorption of fluid into the capillaries: |  |
| - Plasma colloid osmotic pressure | 28 |
| TOTAL INWARD FORCE | 28 |

Thus, the normal outward forces are slightly greater than the inward forces, providing a mean filtration pressure at the pulmonary capillary membrane that can be calculated as $+29-28 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}=+1 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$.

This filtration pressure causes a slight continual flow of fluid from the pulmonary capillaries into the interstitial spaces and, except for a small amount that evaporates in the alveoli, this fluid is pumped back to the circulation through the pulmonary lymphatic system.

## Negative Pulmonary Interstitial Pressure and Mechanism for Keeping Alveoli Dry. What keeps the alveoli

from filling with fluid under normal conditions? The pulmonary capillaries and pulmonary lymphatic system normally maintain a slight negative pressure in the interstitial spaces; whenever extra fluid appears in the alveoli, it is sucked mechanically into the lung interstitium through the small openings between the alveolar epithelial cells. The excess fluid is then carried away through the pulmonary lymphatics. Thus, under normal conditions, the alveoli are kept "dry," except for a small amount of fluid that seeps from the epithelium onto the lining surfaces of the alveoli to keep them moist.

## Pulmonary Edema

Pulmonary edema occurs in the same way that edema occurs elsewhere in the body. Any factor that increases fluid filtration out of the pulmonary capillaries or that impedes pulmonary lymphatic function and causes the pulmonary interstitial fluid pressure to rise from the negative range into the positive range will tend to cause filling of the pulmonary interstitial spaces and alveoli with free fluid.

The most common causes of pulmonary edema are as follows:

1. Left-sided heart failure or mitral valve disease, with consequent great increases in pulmonary venous pressure and pulmonary capillary pressure and flooding of the interstitial spaces and alveoli
2. Damage to the pulmonary blood capillary membranes caused by infections such as pneumonia or by breathing noxious substances such as chlorine gas or sulfur dioxide gas
Each of these mechanisms causes rapid leakage of plasma proteins and fluid out of the capillaries and into the lung interstitial spaces and alveoli.

Pulmonary Edema Safety Factor. Experiments in animals have shown that the pulmonary capillary pressure normally must rise to a value at least equal to the colloid osmotic pressure of the plasma inside the capillaries before significant pulmonary edema will occur. To give an example, Figure 39-8 shows how different levels of left atrial pressure increase the rate of pulmonary edema formation in dogs. Remember that every time the left atrial pressure rises to high values, the pulmonary capillary pressure rises to a level 1 to 2 mm Hg greater than the left atrial pressure. In these experiments, as soon as the left atrial pressure rose above 23 mm Hg (causing the pulmonary capillary pressure to rise above 25 mm Hg ), fluid began to accumulate in the lungs. This fluid accumulation increased even more rapidly with

![gu1751436699](gu1751436699.jpg)

Figure 39-8. Rate of fluid loss into the lung tissues when the left atrial pressure (and pulmonary capillary pressure) is increased. (From Guyton AC, Lindsey AW: Effect of elevated left atrial pressure and decreased plasma protein concentration on the development of pulmonary edema. Circ Res 7:649, 1959.)
further increases in capillary pressure. The plasma colloid osmotic pressure during these experiments was equal to this 25 mm Hg critical pressure level. Therefore, in a person, whose normal plasma colloid osmotic pressure is 28 mm Hg , one can predict that the pulmonary capillary pressure must rise from the normal level of 7 mm Hg to more than 28 mm Hg to cause substantial pulmonary edema, giving an acute safety factor against pulmonary edema of 21 mm Hg .

Safety Factor in Chronic Conditions. When the pulmonary capillary pressure remains elevated chronically (for at least 2 weeks), the lungs become even more resistant to pulmonary edema because the lymph vessels expand greatly, increasing their capability of carrying fluid away from the interstitial spaces perhaps as much as 10 -fold. Therefore, in patients with chronic mitral stenosis, pulmonary capillary pressures of 40 to 45 mm Hg have been measured without the development of lethal pulmonary edema.

Rapidity of Death in Persons With Acute Pulmonary Edema. When the pulmonary capillary pressure rises even slightly above the safety factor level, lethal pulmonary edema can occur within hours, or even within 20 to 30 minutes if the capillary pressure rises 25 to 30 mm Hg above the safety factor level. Thus, in acute left-sided heart failure, in which the pulmonary capillary pressure occasionally does rise to 50 mm Hg , death may ensue in less than 30 minutes as a result of acute pulmonary edema.

## FLUID IN THE PLEURAL CAVITY

When the lungs expand and contract during normal breathing, they slide back and forth within the pleural cavity. To facilitate this movement, a thin layer of mucoid fluid lies between the parietal and visceral pleurae.

Figure 39-9 shows the dynamics of fluid exchange in the pleural space. The pleural membrane is a porous, mesenchymal, serous membrane through which small
![gu1851436699](gu1851436699.jpg)

Figure 39-9. Dynamics of fluid exchange in the intrapleural space.
amounts of interstitial fluid transude continually into the pleural space. These fluids carry tissue proteins with them, giving the pleural fluid a mucoid characteristic, which is what allows extremely easy slippage of the moving lungs.

The total amount of fluid in each pleural cavity is normally slight-only a few milliliters. Whenever the quantity becomes more than barely enough to begin flowing in the pleural cavity, the excess fluid is pumped away by lymphatic vessels opening directly from the pleural cavity into the following: (1) the mediastinum; (2) the superior surface of the diaphragm; and (3) the lateral surfaces of the parietal pleura. Therefore, the pleural space-the space between the parietal and visceral pleurae-is called a potential space because it normally is so narrow that it is not obviously a physical space.

Negative Pressure in Pleural Fluid. A negative force is always required on the outside of the lungs to keep the lungs expanded. This force is provided by negative pressure in the normal pleural space. The basic cause of this negative pressure is pumping of fluid from the space by the lymphatics, which is also the basis of the negative pressure found in most tissue spaces of the body. Because the normal collapse tendency of the lungs is about -4 mm Hg , the pleural fluid pressure must always be at least as negative as -4 mm Hg to keep the lungs expanded. Actual measurements have shown that the pressure is usually about -7 mm Hg , which is a few millimeters of mercury more negative than the collapse pressure of the lungs. Thus, the negativity of the pleural fluid pressure keeps the normal lungs pulled against the parietal pleura of the chest cavity, except for an extremely thin layer of mucoid fluid that acts as a lubricant.

## Pleural Effusion-Collection of Large Amounts of Free

Fluid in the Pleural Space. Pleural effusion is analogous to edema fluid in the tissues and can be called edema of the pleural cavity. The causes of the effusion are the same as the causes of edema in other tissues (discussed in Chapter 25), including the following: (1) blockage of lymphatic drainage from the pleural cavity; (2) cardiac failure, which causes excessively high peripheral and pulmonary capillary pressures, leading to excessive transudation of fluid into the pleural cavity; (3) greatly reduced plasma colloid osmotic pressure, thus allowing excessive transudation of fluid; and (4) infection or any other cause of inflammation of the surfaces of the pleural cavity, which increases permeability of the capillary membranes and allows rapid dumping of plasma proteins and fluid into the cavity.

# Principles of Gas Exchange; Diffusion of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Through the Respiratory Membrane 

After the alveoli are ventilated with fresh air, the next step in respiration is diffusion of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ from the alveoli into the pulmonary blood and diffusion of carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ in the opposite direction, out of the blood into the alveoli. The process of diffusion is simply the random motion of molecules in all directions through the respiratory membrane and adjacent fluids. However, in respiratory physiology, we are concerned not only with the basic mechanism by which diffusion occurs but also with the rate at which it occurs, which is a much more complex issue, requiring a deeper understanding of the physics of diffusion and gas exchange.

## Physics of Gas Diffusion and Gas Partial Pressures

## Molecular Basis of Gas Diffusion

All the gases of concern in respiratory physiology are simple molecules that are free to move among one another by diffusion. This is also true of gases dissolved in the fluids and tissues of the body.

For diffusion to occur, there must be a source of energy. This source of energy is provided by the kinetic motion of the molecules. Except at absolute zero temperature, all molecules of all matter are continually undergoing motion. For free molecules that are not physically attached to others, this means linear movement at high velocity until they strike other molecules. They then bounce away in new directions and continue moving until they strike other molecules again. In this way, the molecules move rapidly and randomly among one another.

Net Diffusion of a Gas in One Direction-Effect of a Concentration Gradient. If a gas chamber or solution has a high concentration of a particular gas at one end of the chamber and a low concentration at the other end, as shown in Figure 40-1, net diffusion of the gas will occur from the highconcentration area toward the low-concentration area. The reason is obvious. There are far more molecules at end A of the chamber to diffuse toward end B than there are molecules to diffuse in the opposite direction. Therefore, the rates of diffusion in each of the two directions are proportionately different, as demonstrated by the lengths of the arrows in the figure.

## Gas Pressures in a Mixture of Gases-Partial Pressures of Individual Gases

Pressure is caused by multiple impacts of moving molecules against a surface. Therefore, the pressure of a gas act- ing on the surfaces of the respiratory passages and alveoli is proportional to the summated force of impact of all the molecules of that gas striking the surface at any given instant. This means that the pressure is directly proportional to the concentration of the gas molecules.

In respiratory physiology, one deals with mixtures of gases, mainly oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. The rate of diffusion of each of these gases is directly proportional to the pressure caused by that gas alone, which is called the partial pressure of that gas. The concept of partial pressure can be explained as follows.

Consider air, which has an approximate composition of $79 \%$ nitrogen and $21 \%$ oxygen. The total pressure of this mixture at sea level averages 760 mm Hg . It is clear from the preceding description of the molecular basis of pressure that each gas contributes to the total pressure in direct proportion to its concentration. Therefore, $79 \%$ of the 760 mm Hg is caused by nitrogen ( 600 mm Hg ) and $21 \%$ by $\mathrm{O}_{2}(160 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$. Thus, the partial pressure of nitrogen in the mixture is 600 mm Hg , and the partial pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is 160 mm Hg ; the total pressure is 760 mm Hg , the sum of the individual partial pressures. The partial pressures of individual gases in a mixture are designated by the symbols $\mathrm{PO}_{2}, \mathrm{PCO}_{2}, \mathrm{PN}_{2}$, PHe, and so forth.

## Pressures of Gases Dissolved in Water and Tissues

Gases dissolved in water or in body tissues also exert pressure because the dissolved gas molecules are moving randomly and have kinetic energy. Furthermore, when the gas dissolved in fluid encounters a surface, such as the membrane of a cell, it exerts its own partial pressure in the same way as a gas in the gas phase. The partial pressures of the separate dissolved gases are designated the same as the partial pressures in the gas state-that is, $\mathrm{PO}_{2}, \mathrm{PCO}_{2}, \mathrm{PN}_{2}, \mathrm{PHe}$, and so forth.

Factors That Determine Partial Pressure of a Gas Dissolved in a Fluid. The partial pressure of a gas in a solution is determined not only by its concentration but also by the solubility coefficient of the gas. That is, some types of molecules, especially $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, are physically or chemically attracted to water molecules, whereas other types of molecules are repelled. When molecules are attracted, far more of them can be dissolved without building up excess partial pressure within the solution. Conversely, in the case of molecules that are repelled, high partial pressure will develop with fewer dissolved molecules. These relationships are

![gu1951436699](gu1951436699.jpg)

Figure 40-1. Diffusion of oxygen from one end of a chamber to the other. The difference between the lengths of the arrows represents net diffusion.
expressed by the following formula, which is Henry's law:

## Partial pressure $=\frac{\text { Concentration of dissolved gas }}{\text { Solubility coefficient }}$

When partial pressure is expressed in atmospheres ( 1 atmosphere [ 1 atm$]$ pressure equals 760 mm Hg ) and concentration is expressed in volume of gas dissolved in each volume of water, the solubility coefficients for important respiratory gases at body temperature are the following:

| Oxygen: | 0.024 |
| :-- | :-- |
| Carbon dioxide: | 0.57 |
| Carbon monoxide: | 0.018 |
| Nitrogen: | 0.012 |
| Helium: | 0.008 |

From this list, one can see that $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is more than 20 times as soluble as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Therefore, the partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ for a given concentration is less than one-twentieth $(5 \%)$ of that exerted by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

Diffusion of Gases Between Gas Phase in Alveoli and Dissolved Phase in Pulmonary Blood. The partial pressure of each gas in the alveolar respiratory gas mixture tends to force molecules of that gas into solution in the blood of the alveolar capillaries. Conversely, the molecules of the same gas that are already dissolved in the blood are bouncing randomly in the fluid of the blood, and some of these bouncing molecules escape back into the alveoli. The rate at which they escape is directly proportional to their partial pressure in the blood.

But, in which direction will net diffusion of the gas occur? The answer is that net diffusion is determined by the difference between the two partial pressures. If the partial pressure is greater in the gas phase in the alveoli, as is normally true for oxygen, then more molecules will diffuse into the blood than in the other direction. Alternatively, if the partial pressure of the gas is greater in the dissolved state in the blood, which is normally true for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, then net diffusion will occur toward the gas phase in the alveoli.

## Vapor Pressure of Water

When nonhumidified air is breathed into the respiratory passageways, water immediately evaporates from the surfaces of these passages and humidifies the air. This results from the fact that water molecules, like different dissolved gas molecules, are continually escaping from the water surface into the gas phase. The partial pressure that water molecules
exert to escape through the surface is called the vapor pressure of the water. At normal body temperature, $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, this vapor pressure is 47 mm Hg . Therefore, once the gas mixture has become fully humidified-that is, once it is in equilibrium with the water-the partial pressure of the water vapor in the gas mixture is 47 mm Hg . This partial pressure, like the other partial pressures, is designated as $\mathrm{Pn}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

The vapor pressure of water depends entirely on the temperature of the water. The higher the temperature, the greater the kinetic activity of the molecules and, therefore, the greater the likelihood that the water molecules will escape from the surface of the water into the gas phase. For example, the water vapor pressure at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is 5 mm Hg , and at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ it is 760 mm Hg . The most important value to remember is the vapor pressure at body temperature, 47 mm Hg . This value appears in many of our subsequent discussions.

## Pressure Difference Causes Net Diffusion of Gases Through Fluids

From the preceding discussion, it is clear that when the partial pressure of a gas is greater in one area than in another area, there will be net diffusion from the high-pressure area toward the low-pressure area. For example, returning to Figure 40-1, one can readily see that the molecules in the area of high pressure, because of their greater number, have a greater chance of moving randomly into the area of low pressure than do molecules attempting to go in the other direction. However, some molecules do bounce randomly from the low-pressure area toward the high-pressure area. Therefore, the net diffusion of gas from the area of high pressure to the area of low pressure is equal to the number of molecules bouncing in this forward direction minus the number bouncing in the opposite direction, which is proportional to the gas partial pressure difference between the two areas, called simply the pressure difference for causing diffusion.

Quantifying Net Rate of Diffusion in Fluids. In addition to the pressure difference, several other factors affect the rate of gas diffusion in a fluid: (1) the solubility of the gas in the fluid; (2) the cross-sectional area of the fluid; (3) the distance through which the gas must diffuse; (4) the molecular weight of the gas; and (5) the temperature of the fluid. In the body, the temperature remains reasonably constant and usually need not be considered.

The greater the solubility of the gas, the greater the number of molecules available to diffuse for any given partial pressure difference. The greater the cross-sectional area of the diffusion pathway, the greater the total number of molecules that diffuse. Conversely, the greater the distance the molecules must diffuse, the longer it will take the molecules to diffuse the entire distance. Finally, the greater the velocity of kinetic movement of the molecules, which is inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight, the greater the rate of diffusion of the gas. All these factors can be expressed in a single formula, as follows:

$$
D \propto \frac{\Delta P \times A \times S}{d \times \sqrt{M W}}
$$

in which $D$ is the diffusion rate, $\Delta P$ is the partial pressure difference between the two ends of the diffusion pathway, $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the pathway, $S$ is the

solubility of the gas, $d$ is the distance of diffusion, and $M W$ is the molecular weight of the gas.

It is obvious from this formula that the characteristics of the gas determine two factors of the formula-solubility and molecular weight. Together, these two factors determine the diffusion coefficient of the gas, which is proportional to $\mathrm{S} / \sqrt{\mathrm{MW}}$; that is, the relative rates at which different gases at the same partial pressure levels will diffuse are proportional to their diffusion coefficients. Assuming that the diffusion coefficient for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is 1 , the relative diffusion coefficients for different gases of respiratory importance in the body fluids are as follows:

| Oxygen: | 1.0 |
| :-- | :-- |
| Carbon dioxide: | 20.3 |
| Carbon monoxide: | 0.81 |
| Nitrogen: | 0.53 |
| Helium: | 0.95 |

## Diffusion of Gases Through Tissues

The gases that are of respiratory importance are all highly soluble in lipids and, consequently, are highly soluble in cell membranes. Because of this, the major limitation to movement of gases in tissues is the rate at which the gases can diffuse through the tissue water instead of through the cell membranes. Therefore, diffusion of gases through tissues, including through the respiratory membrane, is almost equal to the diffusion of gases in water, as given in the preceding list.

## COMPOSITIONS OF ALVEOLAR AIR AND ATMOSPHERIC AIR ARE DIFFERENT

Alveolar air does not have the same concentrations of gases as atmospheric air (Table 40-1). There are several reasons for the differences. First, alveolar air is only partially replaced by atmospheric air with each breath. Second, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is constantly being absorbed into the pulmonary blood from the alveolar air. Third, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is constantly diffusing from the pulmonary blood into the alveoli. And fourth, dry atmospheric air that enters the respiratory passages is humidified even before it reaches the alveoli.

## Air Is Humidified in the Respiratory Passages

Table 40-1 shows that atmospheric air is composed almost entirely of nitrogen and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$; it normally contains almost no $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and little water vapor. However, as soon as the atmospheric air enters the respiratory passages, it is exposed to the fluids that cover the respiratory surfaces. Even before the air enters the alveoli, it becomes almost totally humidified.

The partial pressure of water vapor at a normal body temperature of $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is 47 mm Hg , which is therefore the partial pressure of water vapor in the alveolar air. Because the total pressure in the alveoli cannot rise to more than the atmospheric pressure ( 760 mm Hg at sea level), this water vapor simply dilutes all the other gases in the inspired air. Table 40-1 also shows that humidification of

the air dilutes the oxygen partial pressure at sea level from an average of 159 mm Hg in atmospheric air to 149 mm Hg in the humidified air, and it dilutes the nitrogen partial pressure from 597 to 563 mm Hg .

## Alveolar Air Is Slowly Renewed by Atmospheric Air

In Chapter 38, we pointed out that the average functional residual capacity of the lungs (the volume of air remaining in the lungs at the end of normal expiration) measures about 2300 ml in men. Yet only 350 ml of new air is brought into the alveoli with each normal inspiration, and this same amount of old alveolar air is expired. Therefore, the volume of alveolar air replaced by new atmospheric air with each breath is only one-seventh of the total, so multiple breaths are required to exchange most of the alveolar air. Figure 40-2 shows this slow rate of renewal of the alveolar air. In the first alveolus of the figure, excess gas is present in the alveoli, but note that even at the end of 16 breaths, the excess gas still has not been completely removed from the alveoli.

Figure 40-3 demonstrates graphically the rate at which excess gas in the alveoli is normally removed, showing that with normal alveolar ventilation, about half the gas is removed in 17 seconds. When a person's rate of alveolar ventilation is only half-normal, half of the gas is removed in 34 seconds, and when the rate of ventilation is twice normal, half is removed in about 8 seconds.

![gu2151436699](gu2151436699.jpg)

Figure 40-3. Rate of removal of excess gas from alveoli.

Slow Replacement of Alveolar Air Helps Stabilize Respiratory Control. The slow replacement of alveolar air is of particular importance in preventing sudden changes in gas concentrations in the blood. This makes the respiratory control mechanism much more stable than it would be otherwise, and it helps prevent excessive increases and decreases in tissue oxygenation, tissue $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration, and tissue pH when respiration is temporarily interrupted.

## Oxygen Concentration and Partial Pressure in Alveoli

Oxygen is continually being absorbed from the alveoli into the blood of the lungs, and new $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is continually being breathed into the alveoli from the atmosphere. The more rapidly $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is absorbed, the lower its concentration in the alveoli becomes; conversely, the more rapidly new $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is breathed into the alveoli from the atmosphere, the higher its concentration becomes. Therefore, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentration in the alveoli, as well as its partial pressure, is controlled by the following: (1) the rate of absorption of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ into the blood; and (2) the rate of entry of new $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ into the lungs by the ventilatory process.

Figure 40-4 shows the effect of alveolar ventilation and rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ absorption into the blood on the alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$. One curve represents $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ absorption at a rate of 250 $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, and the other curve represents a rate of $1000 \mathrm{ml} /$ min . At a normal ventilatory rate of $4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption of $250 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, the normal operating point in Figure 40-4 is point A. The figure also shows that when 1000 ml of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is being absorbed each minute, as during moderate exercise, the rate of alveolar ventilation must increase fourfold to maintain the alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ at the normal value of 104 mm Hg .

Another effect shown in Figure 40-4 is that even an extreme increase in alveolar ventilation can never increase the alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ above 149 mm Hg as long as the person is breathing normal atmospheric air at sea level pressure, because 149 mm Hg is the maximum $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in humidified air at this pressure. If the person breathes gases that contain partial pressures of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ higher than 149 mm Hg , the alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ can approach these higher pressures at high rates of ventilation.

## $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ Concentration and Partial Pressure in Alveoli

Carbon dioxide is continually formed in the body and then carried in the blood to the alveoli; it is continually removed from the alveoli by ventilation. Figure 40-5 shows the effects on the alveolar partial pressure of $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of both alveolar ventilation and two rates of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ excretion, 200 and $800 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. One curve represents a normal rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ excretion of $200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. At the normal rate of alveolar ventilation of $4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, the operating point for alveolar $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is at point A in Figure 40-5 (i.e., 40 mm Hg ).

Two other facts are also evident from Figure 40-5. First, the alveolar $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ increases directly in proportion to the rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ excretion, as represented by the fourfold elevation of the curve (when 800 ml of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are excreted per minute). Second, the alveolar $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ decreases in inverse proportion to alveolar ventilation. Therefore, the concentrations and partial pressures of both $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the alveoli are determined by the rates of absorption or excretion of the two gases and by the amount of alveolar ventilation.

## Expired Air Is a Combination of Dead Space Air and Alveolar Air

The overall composition of expired air is determined by the following: (1) the amount of the expired air that is dead space air; and (2) the amount that is alveolar air. Figure $40-6$ shows the progressive changes in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ partial pressures in the expired air during the course of expiration. The first portion of this air, the dead space air from the respiratory passageways, is typical humidified air, as shown in Table 40-1. Then, progressively more and more alveolar air becomes mixed with the dead space air until all the dead space air has finally been washed out, and nothing but

alveolar air is expired at the end of expiration. Therefore, the method of collecting alveolar air for study is simply to collect a sample of the last portion of the expired air after forceful expiration has removed all the dead space air.

Normal expired air, containing both dead space air and alveolar air, has gas concentrations and partial pressures approximately as shown in Table 40-1 (i.e., concentrations between those of alveolar air and humidified atmospheric air).

## DIFFUSION OF GASES THROUGH THE RESPIRATORY MEMBRANE

Respiratory Unit. Figure 40-7 shows the respiratory unit (also called respiratory lobule), which is composed of a respiratory bronchiole, alveolar ducts, atria, and alveoli. There are about 300 million alveoli in the two lungs, and each alveolus has an average diameter of about 0.2 millimeter. The alveolar walls are extremely thin, and between the alveoli is an almost solid network of interconnecting capillaries, shown in Figure 40-8. Because of

![gu2751436699](gu2751436699.jpg)

Figure 40-9. Ultrastructure of the alveolar respiratory membrane, shown in cross section.
the extensiveness of the capillary plexus, the flow of blood in the alveolar wall has been described as a sheet of flowing blood. Thus, it is obvious that the alveolar gases are in very close proximity to the blood of the pulmonary capillaries. Furthermore, gas exchange between the alveolar air and pulmonary blood occurs through the membranes of all the terminal portions of the lungs, not merely in the alveoli. All these membranes are collectively known as the respiratory membrane, also called the pulmonary membrane.

Respiratory Membrane. Figure 40-9 shows the ultrastructure of the respiratory membrane drawn in cross section on the left and a red blood cell on the right. It also shows diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the alveolus into the red blood cell and diffusion of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the opposite direction. Note the following different layers of the respiratory membrane:

1. A layer of fluid containing surfactant that lines the alveolus and reduces the surface tension of alveolar fluid
2. The alveolar epithelium, composed of thin epithelial cells
3. An epithelial basement membrane
4. A thin interstitial space between the alveolar epithelium and capillary membrane
5. A capillary basement membrane that in many places fuses with the alveolar epithelial basement membrane
6. The capillary endothelial membrane

Despite the large number of layers, the overall thickness of the respiratory membrane in some areas is as little as 0.2 micrometer and averages about 0.6 micrometer, except where there are cell nuclei. From histological studies, it has been estimated that the total surface area of the respiratory membrane is about 70 square meters in healthy men, which is equivalent to the floor area of a $25 \times$ 30 -foot room. The total quantity of blood in the capillaries of the lungs at any given instant is 60 to 140 ml . Now, imagine this small amount of blood spread over the entire surface of a $25 \times 30$-foot floor, and it is easy to understand the rapidity of the respiratory exchange of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

The average diameter of the pulmonary capillaries is only about 5 micrometers, which means that red blood cells must squeeze through them. The red blood cell membrane usually touches the capillary wall, so $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ need not pass through significant amounts of plasma as they diffuse between the alveolus and red blood cell. This, too, increases the rapidity of diffusion.

## Factors Affecting Rate of Gas Diffusion Through the Respiratory Membrane

Referring to the earlier discussion of diffusion of gases in water, one can apply the same principles to diffusion of gases through the respiratory membrane. Thus, the factors that determine how rapidly a gas will pass through the membrane are the following: (1) the thickness of the membrane; (2) the surface area of the membrane; (3) the diffusion coefficient of the gas in the substance of the membrane; and (4) the partial pressure difference of the gas between the two sides of the membrane.

The thickness of the respiratory membrane occasionally increases-for example, as a result of edema fluid in the interstitial space of the membrane and in the alveoli-so the respiratory gases must then diffuse not only through the membrane but also through this fluid. Also, some pulmonary diseases cause fibrosis of the lungs, which can increase the thickness of some portions of the respiratory membrane. Because the rate of diffusion through the membrane is inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane, any factor that increases the thickness to more than two to three times normal can interfere significantly with normal respiratory exchange of gases.

The surface area of the respiratory membrane can be greatly decreased by many conditions. For example, removal of an entire lung decreases the total surface area to half-normal. Also, in emphysema, many of the alveoli coalesce, with dissolution of many alveolar walls. Therefore, the new alveolar chambers are much larger than the original alveoli, but the total surface area of the respiratory membrane is often decreased as much as fivefold because of loss of the alveolar walls. When the total surface area is decreased to about one-third to one-fourth normal, exchange of gases through the membrane is

substantially impeded, even under resting conditions, and during competitive sports and other strenuous exercise, even the slightest decrease in surface area of the lungs can be a serious detriment to respiratory exchange of gases.

The diffusion coefficient for transfer of each gas through the respiratory membrane depends on the gas's solubility in the membrane and, inversely, on the square root of the gas's molecular weight. The rate of diffusion in the respiratory membrane is almost exactly the same as that in water, for reasons explained earlier. Therefore, for a given pressure difference, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses about 20 times as rapidly as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Oxygen diffuses about twice as rapidly as nitrogen.

The pressure difference across the respiratory membrane is the difference between the partial pressure of the gas in the alveoli and the partial pressure of the gas in the pulmonary capillary blood. Therefore, the difference between these two pressures is a measure of the net tendency for the gas molecules to move through the membrane.

When the partial pressure of a gas in the alveoli is greater than the pressure of the gas in the blood, as is true for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, net diffusion from the alveoli into the blood occurs. When the pressure of the gas in the blood is greater than the partial pressure in the alveoli, as is true for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, net diffusion from the blood into the alveoli occurs.

## Diffusing Capacity of the Respiratory Membrane

The ability of the respiratory membrane to exchange a gas between the alveoli and pulmonary blood is expressed in quantitative terms by the respiratory membrane's diffusing capacity, which is defined as the volume of a gas that will diffuse through the membrane each minute for a partial pressure difference of 1 mm Hg . All the factors discussed earlier that affect diffusion through the respiratory membrane can affect this diffusing capacity.

Diffusing Capacity for Oxygen. In the average young man, the diffusing capacity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ under resting conditions averages $21 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per $m m \mathrm{Hg}$. In functional terms, what does this mean? The mean $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressure difference across the respiratory membrane during normal quiet breathing is about 11 mm Hg . Multiplying this pressure by the diffusing capacity $(11 \times 21)$ gives a total of about 230 ml of oxygen diffusing through the respiratory membrane each minute, which is equal to the rate at which the resting body uses $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

## Increased Oxygen Diffusing Capacity During Exercise.

During strenuous exercise or other conditions that greatly increase pulmonary blood flow and alveolar ventilation, the diffusing capacity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ increases to about three times the diffusing capacity under resting conditions. This increase is caused by several factors, including the following: (1) opening up of many previously dormant pulmonary capillaries or extra dilation of already open capillaries, thereby increasing the surface area of the blood into which the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ can diffuse; and (2) a better match between the ventilation of the alveoli and perfusion of the alveolar capillaries with
![gu2851436699](gu2851436699.jpg)

Figure 40-10. Diffusing capacities for carbon monoxide, oxygen, and carbon dioxide in the normal lungs under resting conditions and during exercise.
blood, called the ventilation-perfusion ratio, explained later in this chapter. Therefore, during exercise, oxygenation of the blood is increased not only by increased alveolar ventilation but also by greater diffusing capacity of the respiratory membrane for transporting $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ into the blood.

Diffusing Capacity for Carbon Dioxide. The diffusing capacity for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ has never been measured because $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses through the respiratory membrane so rapidly that the average $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in the pulmonary blood is not very different from the $\mathrm{PcO}_{2}$ in the alveoli-the average difference is less than 1 mm Hg . With currently available techniques, this difference is too small to be measured.

Nevertheless, measurements of diffusion of other gases have shown that the diffusing capacity varies directly with the diffusion coefficient of the particular gas. Because the diffusion coefficient of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is slightly more than 20 times that of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, one would expect a diffusing capacity for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ under resting conditions of about 400 to $450 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per mm Hg and during exercise of about 1200 to $1300 \mathrm{ml} /$ min per mm Hg. Figure 40-10 compares the measured or calculated diffusing capacities of carbon monoxide, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ at rest and during exercise, showing the extreme diffusing capacity of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and the effect of exercise on the diffusing capacity of each of these gases.

[^0]
[^0]:    Measurement of Diffusing Capacity—Carbon Monoxide Method. The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusing capacity can be calculated from measurements of the following: (1) alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$; (2) $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the pulmonary capillary blood; and (3) the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by the blood. However, measuring the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the pulmonary capillary blood is so difficult and imprecise that

it is not practical to measure oxygen diffusing capacity by such a direct procedure, except on an experimental basis.

To obviate the difficulties encountered in measuring oxygen diffusing capacity directly, physiologists usually measure carbon monoxide (CO) diffusing capacity instead and then calculate the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusing capacity from this. The principle of the CO method is as follows. A small amount of CO is breathed into the alveoli, and the partial pressure of the CO in the alveoli is measured from appropriate alveolar air samples. The CO pressure in the blood is essentially zero because hemoglobin combines with this gas so rapidly that its pressure never has time to build up. Therefore, the pressure difference of CO across the respiratory membrane is equal to its partial pressure in the alveolar air sample. Then, by measuring the volume of CO absorbed in a short period and dividing this by the alveolar CO partial pressure, one can determine the CO diffusing capacity accurately.

To convert CO diffusing capacity to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusing capacity, the value is multiplied by a factor of 1.23 because the diffusion coefficient for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is 1.23 times that for CO . Thus, the average diffusing capacity for CO in healthy young men at rest is $17 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per mm Hg , and the diffusing capacity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is 1.23 times this, or $21 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per mm Hg .

## Effect of Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio on Alveolar Gas Concentration

Earlier in this chapter, we learned that two factors determine the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in the alveoli: (1) the rate of alveolar ventilation; and (2) the rate of transfer of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ through the respiratory membrane. This discussion made the assumption that all the alveoli are ventilated equally, and that blood flow through the alveolar capillaries is the same for each alveolus. However, even normally to some extent, and especially in many lung diseases, some areas of the lungs are well ventilated but have almost no blood flow, whereas other areas may have excellent blood flow but little or no ventilation. In either of these conditions, gas exchange through the respiratory membrane is seriously impaired, and the person may suffer severe respiratory distress, despite normal total ventilation and normal total pulmonary blood flow, but with the ventilation and blood flow going to different parts of the lungs. Therefore, a highly quantitative concept has been developed to help us understand respiratory exchange when there is imbalance between alveolar ventilation and alveolar blood flow. This concept is called the ventilation-perfusion ratio.

In quantitative terms, the ventilation-perfusion ratio is expressed as $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$. When $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ (alveolar ventilation) is normal for a given alveolus, and $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ (blood flow) is also normal for the same alveolus, the ventilation-perfusion ratio $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}\right)$ is also said to be normal. When the ventilation $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}\right)$ is zero, yet there is still perfusion $(\dot{\mathrm{Q}})$ of the alveolus, the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is zero. Or, at the other extreme, when there is adequate ventilation $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}\right)$ but zero perfusion $(\dot{\mathrm{Q}})$, the ratio $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is infinity. At a ratio of either zero or infinity, there is no exchange of gases through the respiratory membrane of the affected alveoli. Therefore, let us explain the respiratory consequences of these two extremes.

Alveolar Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressures When $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ Equals Zero. When $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is equal to zero-that is, without any alveolar ventilation-the air in the alveolus comes to equilibrium with the blood $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ be-

Figure 40-11. Normal partial pressure of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}\right)$-partial pressure of carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{PcO}_{2}\right)$ ventilation-perfusion $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}\right)$ ratio $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2^{-}}\right.$ $\mathrm{PCO}_{2},\left(\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}\right)$ diagram.
cause these gases diffuse between the blood and alveolar air. Because the blood that perfuses the capillaries is venous blood returning to the lungs from the systemic circulation, it is the gases in this blood with which the alveolar gases equilibrate. In Chapter 41, we describe how the normal venous blood $(\dot{\mathrm{V}})$ has a $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of 40 mm Hg and a $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of 45 mm Hg . Therefore, these are also the normal partial pressures of these two gases in alveoli that have blood flow but no ventilation.

Alveolar Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressures When $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ Equals Infinity. The effect on the alveolar gas partial pressures when $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ equals infinity is entirely different from the effect when $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ equals zero because now there is no capillary blood flow to carry $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ away or to bring $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to the alveoli. Therefore, instead of the alveolar gases coming to equilibrium with the venous blood, the alveolar air becomes equal to the humidified inspired air. That is, the air that is inspired loses no $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the blood and gains no $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the blood. Furthermore, because normal inspired and humidified air has a $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of 149 mm Hg and a $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of 0 mm Hg , these will be the partial pressures of these two gases in the alveoli.

Gas Exchange and Alveolar Partial Pressures When $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ Is Normal. When there is both normal alveolar ventilation and normal alveolar capillary blood flow (normal alveolar perfusion), exchange of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ through the respiratory membrane is nearly optimal, and alveolar $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is normally at a level of 104 mm Hg , which lies between that of the inspired air ( 149 mm Hg ) and that of venous blood ( 40 mm Hg ). Likewise, alveolar $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ lies between two extremes; it is normally 40 mm Hg , in contrast to 45 mm Hg in venous blood and 0 mm Hg in inspired air. Thus, under normal conditions, the alveolar air $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ averages 104 mm Hg and the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ averages 40 mm Hg .

## $\mathrm{PO}_{2}-\mathrm{PCO}_{2}, \dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ Diagram

The concepts presented in the preceding sections are shown in graphic form in Figure 40-11, called the $\mathrm{Po}_{2^{-}}$ $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}, \dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ diagram. The curve in the diagram represents all possible $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ combinations between the limits of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ equals zero and $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ equals infinity when the gas pressures in the venous blood are normal, and the person is breathing air at sea level pressure. Thus, point $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is the plot of $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ when $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ equals zero. At this point,

the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ is 40 mm Hg , and the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is 45 mm Hg , which are the values in normal venous blood.

At the other end of the curve, when $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ equals infinity, point I represents inspired air, showing $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ to be 149 mm Hg while $\mathrm{PcO}_{2}$ is zero. Also plotted on the curve is the point that represents normal alveolar air when $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is normal. At this point, $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ is 104 mm Hg , and $\mathrm{PcO}_{2}$ is 40 mm Hg .

## Concept of Physiological Shunt (When $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ Is Below Normal)

Whenever $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is below normal, there is inadequate ventilation to provide the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ needed to fully oxygenate the blood flowing through the alveolar capillaries. Therefore, a certain fraction of the venous blood passing through the pulmonary capillaries does not become oxygenated. This fraction is called shunted blood. Also, some additional blood flows through bronchial vessels rather than through alveolar capillaries, normally about $2 \%$ of the cardiac output; this, too, is unoxygenated, shunted blood.

The total quantitative amount of shunted blood per minute is called the physiological shunt. This physiological shunt is measured in clinical pulmonary function laboratories by analyzing the concentration of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in both mixed venous blood and arterial blood, along with simultaneous measurement of cardiac output. From these values, the physiological shunt can be calculated by the following equation:

$$
\frac{\dot{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{PS}}}{\dot{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{T}}}=\frac{\mathrm{Cl}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{\mathrm{Cl}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{CV}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}
$$

in which $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{PS}}$ is the physiological shunt blood flow per minute, $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{T}}$ is cardiac output per minute, $\mathrm{Cl}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the concentration of oxygen in the arterial blood if there is an "ideal" ventilation-perfusion ratio, $\mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the measured concentration of oxygen in the arterial blood, and $\mathrm{CV}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the measured concentration of oxygen in the mixed venous blood.

The greater the physiological shunt, the greater the amount of blood that fails to be oxygenated as it passes through the lungs.

## Concept of Physiological Dead Space When $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ Greater Than Normal

When ventilation of some of the alveoli is great but alveolar blood flow is low, there is far more available oxygen in the alveoli than can be transported away from the alveoli by the flowing blood. Thus, the ventilation of these alveoli is said to be wasted. The ventilation of the anatomical dead space areas of the respiratory passageways is also wasted. The sum of these two types of wasted ventilation is called the physiological dead space. This space is measured in the clinical pulmonary function laboratory by making appropriate blood and expiratory gas measurements and by using the following equation, called the Bohr equation:

$$
\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{\text {phas }}}}{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{T}}}=\frac{\mathrm{Pa}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}}{\mathrm{Pa}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}
$$

in which $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {Dplex }}$ is the physiological dead space, $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{T}}$ is the tidal volume, $\mathrm{Pa}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is the partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the
arterial blood, and $\mathrm{PV}_{\mathrm{co} 2}$ is the average partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the entire expired air.

When the physiological dead space is great, much of the work of ventilation is wasted effort because so much of the ventilating air never reaches the blood.

## Abnormalities of Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio

Abnormal $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ in Upper and Lower Normal Lung. In a healthy person in the upright position, both pulmonary capillary blood flow and alveolar ventilation are considerably less in the upper part of the lung than in the lower part; however, the decrease of blood flow is considerably greater than the decrease in ventilation. Therefore, at the top of the lung, $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is as much as 2.5 times as great as the ideal value, which causes a moderate degree of physiological dead space in this area of the lung.

At the other extreme, at the bottom of the lung, there is slightly too little ventilation in relation to blood flow, with $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ as low as 0.6 times the ideal value. In this area, a small fraction of the blood fails to become normally oxygenated, and this represents a physiological shunt.

In both extremes, inequalities of ventilation and perfusion slightly decrease the lung's effectiveness for exchanging $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. However, during exercise, blood flow to the upper part of the lung increases markedly, so far less physiological dead space occurs, and the effectiveness of gas exchange now approaches optimum.

## Abnormal $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ in Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease

Most people who smoke for many years develop various degrees of bronchial obstruction; in many of them, this condition eventually becomes so severe that serious alveolar air trapping develops, with resultant emphysema. The emphysema, in turn, causes many of the alveolar walls to be destroyed. Thus, two abnormalities occur in smokers to cause abnormal $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$. First, because many of the small bronchioles are obstructed, the alveoli beyond the obstructions are unventilated, causing a $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ that approaches zero. Second, in the areas of the lung where the alveolar walls have mainly been destroyed but there is still alveolar ventilation, most of the ventilation is wasted because of inadequate blood flow to transport the blood gases.

Thus, in chronic obstructive lung disease, some areas of the lung exhibit serious physiological shunt, and other areas exhibit serious physiological dead space. Both conditions tremendously decrease the effectiveness of the lungs as gas exchange organs, sometimes reducing their effectiveness to as little as one-tenth normal. In fact, this condition is the most prevalent cause of pulmonary disability today.

# Transport of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in Blood and Tissue Fluids 

Once oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ has diffused from the alveoli into the pulmonary blood, it is transported to the tissue capillaries almost entirely in combination with hemoglobin. The presence of hemoglobin in the red blood cells allows the blood to transport 30 to 100 times as much $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as could be transported in the form of dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the water of the blood.

In the body's tissue cells, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ reacts with various foodstuffs to form large quantities of carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$. This $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ enters the tissue capillaries and is transported back to the lungs. Carbon dioxide, like $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, also combines with chemical substances in the blood that increase $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport 15 - to 20 -fold.

This chapter presents the physical and chemical principles of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport in the blood and tissue fluids qualitatively and quantitatively.

## TRANSPORT OF OXYGEN FROM THE LUNGS TO THE BODY TISSUES

In Chapter 40, we pointed out that gases can move from one point to another by diffusion, and that the cause of this movement is always a partial pressure difference from the first point to the next. Thus, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffuses from the alveoli into the pulmonary capillary blood because the oxygen partial pressure $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}\right)$ in the alveoli is greater than the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ in the pulmonary capillary blood. In the other tissues of the body, a higher $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ in the capillary blood than in the tissues causes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to diffuse into the surrounding cells.

Conversely, when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is metabolized in the cells to form $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, the intracellular $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ partial pressure $\left(\mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)$ rises, causing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to diffuse into the tissue capillaries. After blood flows to the lungs, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses out of the blood into the alveoli because the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in the pulmonary capillary blood is greater than that in the alveoli. Thus, the transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by the blood depends on both diffusion and the flow of blood. We now consider quantitatively the factors responsible for these effects.

## DIFFUSION OF OXYGEN FROM THE ALVEOLI TO THE PULMONARY CAPILLARY BLOOD

The top part of Figure 41-1 shows a pulmonary alveolus adjacent to a pulmonary capillary, demonstrating
diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ between alveolar air and pulmonary blood. The $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of the gaseous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the alveolus averages 104 mm Hg , whereas the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of the venous blood entering the pulmonary capillary at its arterial end averages only 40 mm Hg because a large amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ was removed from this blood as it passed through the peripheral tissues. Therefore, the initial pressure difference that causes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to diffuse into the pulmonary capillary is $104-40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, or 64 mm Hg . In the graph at the bottom of the figure, the curve shows the rapid rise in blood $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ as the blood passes through the capillary; the blood $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ rises almost to that of the alveolar air by the time the blood has moved a third of the distance through the capillary, becoming almost 104 mm Hg .

Uptake of Oxygen by the Pulmonary Blood During Exercise. During strenuous exercise, a person's body may require as much as 20 times the normal amount of oxygen. Also, because of increased cardiac output during exercise, the time that the blood remains in the pulmonary capillary may be reduced to less than onehalf normal. Yet, because of the great safety factor for diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ through the pulmonary membrane, the blood still becomes almost saturated with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by the time it leaves the pulmonary capillaries. This can be explained as follows.

First, in Chapter 40, we pointed out that the diffusing capacity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ increases almost threefold during exercise. This results mainly from increased surface area of capillaries participating in the diffusion and also from a more nearly ideal ventilation-perfusion ratio in the upper part of the lungs.

Second, note in the curve of Figure 41-1 that under nonexercising conditions, the blood becomes almost saturated with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by the time it has passed through one-third of the pulmonary capillary, and little additional $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ normally enters the blood during the latter two-thirds of its transit. That is, the blood normally stays in the lung capillaries about three times as long as needed to cause full oxygenation. Therefore, during exercise, even with a shortened time of exposure in the capillaries, the blood can still become almost fully oxygenated.

## TRANSPORT OF OXYGEN IN ARTERIAL BLOOD

About $98 \%$ of the blood that enters the left atrium from the lungs has just passed through the alveolar capillaries and has become oxygenated up to a $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of about 104 mm Hg . Another $2 \%$ of the blood has passed from the aorta through the bronchial circulation, which supplies mainly the deep tissues of the lungs and is not exposed to lung air. This blood flow is called shunt flow, meaning that blood is shunted past the gas exchange areas. On leaving the lungs, the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of the shunt blood is approximately that of normal systemic venous blood-about 40 mm Hg . When this blood combines in the pulmonary veins with the oxygenated blood from the alveolar capillaries, this so-called venous admixture of blood causes the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of the blood entering the left heart and pumped into the aorta to fall to about 95 mm Hg . These changes in blood $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ at different points in the circulatory system are shown in Figure 41-2.

![gu3351436699](gu3351436699.jpg)

Figure 41-4 Effect of blood flow and rate of oxygen consumption on tissue $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$.

## DIFFUSION OF OXYGEN FROM THE PERIPHERAL CAPILLARIES INTO THE TISSUE FLUID

When the arterial blood reaches the peripheral tissues, its $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ in the capillaries is still 95 mm Hg . Yet, as shown in Figure 41-3, the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ in the interstitial fluid that surrounds the tissue cells averages only 40 mm Hg . Thus, there is a large initial pressure difference that causes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to diffuse rapidly from the capillary blood into the tissuesso rapidly that the capillary $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ falls almost to equal the $40-\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ pressure in the interstitium. Therefore, the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of the blood leaving the tissue capillaries and entering the systemic veins is also about 40 mm Hg .

Increasing Blood Flow Raises Interstitial Fluid $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$. If the blood flow through a particular tissue is increased, greater quantities of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ are transported into the tissue, and the tissue $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ becomes correspondingly higher. This effect is shown in Figure 41-4. Note that an increase in flow to $400 \%$ of normal increases the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ from 40 mm Hg (at point A in the figure) to 66 mm Hg (at point B). However, the upper limit to which the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ can rise, even with maximal blood flow, is 95 mm Hg because this is the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressure in the arterial blood. Conversely, if blood flow through the tissue decreases, the tissue $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ also decreases, as shown at point C .

Increasing Tissue Metabolism Decreases Interstitial Fluid $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$. If the cells use more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ for metabolism than normal, the interstitial fluid $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is reduced. Figure 41-4 also

![gu3451436699](gu3451436699.jpg)

Figure 41-5 Uptake of carbon dioxide by the blood in the tissue capillaries. $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in tissue cells $=46 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$; in interstitial fluid, $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}=$ 45 mm Hg .)
demonstrates this effect, showing reduced interstitial fluid $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ when the cellular oxygen consumption is increased and increased $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ when consumption is decreased.

In summary, tissue $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is determined by a balance between (1) the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport to the tissues in the blood, and (2) the rate at which the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is used by the tissues.

## DIFFUSION OF OXYGEN FROM PERIPHERAL CAPILLARIES TO TISSUE CELLS

Oxygen is always being used by the cells. Therefore, the intracellular $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ in peripheral tissues remains lower than the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ in peripheral capillaries. Also, in many cases, there is considerable physical distance between the capillaries and cells. Therefore, the normal intracellular $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ ranges from as low as 5 mm Hg to as high as 40 mm Hg , averaging (by direct measurement in experimental animals) 23 mm Hg . Because only 1 to 3 mm Hg of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressure is normally required for full support of the chemical processes that use oxygen in the cell, even this low intracellular $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of 23 mm Hg is more than adequate and provides a large safety factor.

## DIFFUSION OF $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ FROM PERIPHERAL TISSUE CELLS INTO CAPILLARIES AND FROM PULMONARY CAPILLARIES INTO ALVEOLI

When $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is used by the cells, virtually all of it becomes $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and this transformation increases the intracellular $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$; because of this elevated tissue cell $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses from the cells into the capillaries and is then carried by the blood to the lungs. In the lungs, it diffuses from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli and is expired.

Thus, at each point in the gas transport chain, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses in the direction exactly opposite to the diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Yet, there is one major difference between diffusion of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and of $\mathrm{O}_{2}-\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can diffuse about 20 times as rapidly as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Therefore, the pressure differences required to cause $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffusion are, in each case, far less than the pressure differences required to cause $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion. The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ pressures are approximately the following:

1. Intracellular $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}, 46 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$; interstitial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}, 45$ mm Hg . Thus, there is only a 1 mm Hg pressure differential, as shown in Figure 41-5.
![gu3551436699](gu3551436699.jpg)

Figure 41-6 Diffusion of carbon dioxide from the pulmonary blood into the alveolus. (Data from Milhorn HT Jr, Pulley PE Jr: A theoretical study of pulmonary capillary gas exchange and venous admixture. Biophys J 8:337, 1968.)
2. $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of the arterial blood entering the tissues, 40 $\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg} ; \mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of the venous blood leaving the tissues, 45 mm Hg . Thus, as shown in Figure 41-5, the tissue capillary blood comes almost exactly to equilibrium with the interstitial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of 45 mm Hg .
3. $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of the blood entering the pulmonary capillaries at the arterial end, $45 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} ; \mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of the alveolar air, 40 mm Hg . Thus, only a 5 mm Hg pressure difference causes all the required $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffusion out of the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 41-6, the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of the pulmonary capillary blood falls to almost exactly equal the alveolar $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of 40 mm Hg before it has passed more than about one-third of the distance through the capillaries. This is the same effect that was observed earlier for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion, except that it is in the opposite direction.

Effect of Tissue Metabolism and Tissue Blood Flow Rate on Interstitial $\mathrm{PcO}_{2}$. Tissue capillary blood flow and tissue metabolism affect the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in ways exactly opposite to their effect on tissue $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$. Figure 41-7 shows these effects, as follows:

1. A decrease in blood flow from normal (point A) to one-quarter normal (point B) increases peripheral tissue $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ from the normal value of 45 mm Hg to an elevated level of 60 mm Hg . Conversely, increasing the blood flow to six times normal (point C ) decreases the interstitial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ from the normal value of 45 to 41 mm Hg , almost equal to the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in the arterial blood ( 40 mm Hg ) entering the tissue capillaries.
2. Note also that a 10 -fold increase in tissue metabolic rate greatly elevates the interstitial fluid $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ at all rates of blood flow, whereas decreasing the metabolism to one-quarter normal causes the interstitial fluid $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ to fall to about 41 mm Hg , closely approaching that of the arterial blood, 40 mm Hg .

Figure 41-8 Oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.

## ROLE OF HEMOGLOBIN IN OXYGEN TRANSPORT

Normally, about $97 \%$ of the oxygen transported from the lungs to the tissues is carried in chemical combination with hemoglobin in the red blood cells. The remaining $3 \%$ is transported in the dissolved state in the water of the plasma and blood cells. Thus, under normal conditions, oxygen is carried to the tissues almost entirely by hemoglobin.

## Reversible Combination of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ With Hemoglobin

The chemistry of hemoglobin is presented in Chapter 33, where we pointed out that the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule combines loosely and reversibly with the heme portion of hemoglobin. When $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is high, as in the pulmonary capillaries, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds with hemoglobin, but when $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is low, as in the tissue capillaries, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is released from hemoglobin. This is the basis for almost all $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport from the lungs to the tissues.

Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve. Figure 41-8 shows the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-hemoglobin dissociation curve, which
![gu3851436699](gu3851436699.jpg)

Figure 41-9 Effect of blood $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ on the quantity of oxygen bound with hemoglobin in each 100 ml of blood.
demonstrates a progressive increase in the percentage of hemoglobin bound with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as blood $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ increases, called the percent saturation of hemoglobin. Because the blood leaving the lungs and entering the systemic arteries usually has a $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of about 95 mm Hg , it can be seen from the dissociation curve that the usual $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation of systemic arterial blood averages $97 \%$. Conversely, in normal venous blood returning from the peripheral tissues, the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is about 40 mm Hg , and the saturation of hemoglobin averages $75 \%$.

Maximum Amount of Oxygen That Can Combine With the Hemoglobin of the Blood. The blood of a normal person contains about 15 grams of hemoglobin in each 100 ml of blood, and each gram of hemoglobin can bind with a maximum of 1.34 ml of $\mathrm{O}_{2}(1.39 \mathrm{ml}$ when the hemoglobin is chemically pure, but impurities such as methemoglobin reduce this). Therefore, 15 times 1.34 equals 20.1 , which means that on average, the 15 grams of hemoglobin in 100 ml of blood can combine with a total of about 20 ml of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ if the hemoglobin is $100 \%$ saturated. This is usually expressed as 20 volume percent. The $\mathrm{O}_{2^{-}}$ hemoglobin dissociation curve for the normal person can also be expressed in terms of volume percent of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, as shown by the far right scale in Figure 41-8, instead of percent saturation of hemoglobin.

Amount of Oxygen Released From Hemoglobin When Systemic Arterial Blood Flows Through Tissues. The total quantity of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ bound with hemoglobin in normal systemic arterial blood, which is $97 \%$ saturated, is about $19.4 \mathrm{ml} / 100 \mathrm{ml}$ of blood, as shown in Figure 41-9. On passing through the tissue capillaries, this amount is reduced, on average, to $14.4 \mathrm{ml}\left(\mathrm{Po}_{2}\right.$ of $40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, 75 \%$ saturated hemoglobin). Thus, under normal conditions, about 5 ml of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ are transported from the lungs to the tissues by each 100 ml of blood flow.

Transport of Oxygen Is Markedly Increased During Strenuous Exercise. During heavy exercise, the muscle cells use $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at a rapid rate, which in extreme cases can

cause the muscle interstitial fluid $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ to fall from the normal 40 mm Hg to as low as 15 mm Hg . At this low pressure, only 4.4 ml of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ remains bound with the hemoglobin in each 100 ml of blood, as shown in Figure 41-9. Thus, $19.4-4.4 \mathrm{ml}$, or 15 ml , is the quantity of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that is actually delivered to the tissues by each 100 ml of blood flow, meaning that three times as much $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as normal is delivered in each volume of blood that passes through the tissues. Keep in mind that the cardiac output can increase to six to seven times normal in well-trained marathon runners. Thus, multiplying the increase in cardiac output ( 6 - to 7 -fold) by the increase in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport in each volume of blood ( 3 -fold) gives a 20 -fold increase in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport to the tissues. We will see later in the chapter that several other factors facilitate delivery of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ into muscles during exercise, so muscle tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ often falls just slightly below normal, even during very strenuous exercise.

Utilization Coefficient. The percentage of the blood that gives up its $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as it passes through the tissue capillaries is called the utilization coefficient. The normal value for this is about $25 \%$, as is evident from the preceding discus-sion-that is, $25 \%$ of the oxygenated hemoglobin gives its $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues. During strenuous exercise, the utilization coefficient in the entire body can increase to $75 \%$ to $85 \%$. In local tissue areas where blood flow is extremely slow or the metabolic rate is very high, utilization coefficients approaching $100 \%$ have been recorded-that is, essentially all the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is given to the tissues.

## Hemoglobin "Buffers" Tissue Po2

Although hemoglobin is necessary for the transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues, it performs another function essential to life. This is its function as a tissue oxygen buffer system. That is, the hemoglobin in the blood is mainly responsible for stabilizing the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the tissues, which can be explained as follows.

## Hemoglobin Helps Maintain Nearly Constant $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the Tissues. Under basal conditions, the tissues require about 5 ml of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from each 100 ml of blood passing through the tissue capillaries. Referring to the $\mathrm{O}_{2^{-}}$ hemoglobin dissociation curve in Figure 41-9, note that for the normal 5 ml of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to be released per 100 ml of blood flow, the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ must fall to about 40 mm Hg . Therefore, the tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ normally cannot rise above this 40 mm Hg level because, if it did, the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ needed by the tissues would not be released from the hemoglobin. In this way, the hemoglobin normally sets an upper limit on the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the tissues at about 40 mm Hg .

Conversely, during heavy exercise, extra amounts of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (as much as 20 times normal) must be delivered from the hemoglobin to the tissues. However, this delivery of extra $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ can be achieved with little further decrease in tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ because of (1) the steep slope of the dissociation curve, and (2) the increase in tissue blood flow caused by
the decreased $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$. That is, a very small fall in $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ causes large amounts of extra $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to be released from hemoglobin. Thus, hemoglobin in the blood automatically delivers $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues at a pressure that is held rather tightly between about 15 and 40 mm Hg .

When Atmospheric Oxygen Concentration Changes Markedly, the Buffer Effect of Hemoglobin Still Maintains Almost Constant Tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$. The normal $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the alveoli is about 104 mm Hg , but as one ascends a mountain or ascends in an airplane, the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ can easily fall to less than half this amount. Alternatively, when one enters areas of compressed air, such as deep in the sea or in pressurized chambers, the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ may rise to 10 times this level. Even so, the tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ changes little.

It can be seen from the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve in Figure 41-8 that when the alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ is decreased to as low as 60 mm Hg , the arterial hemoglobin is still $89 \%$ saturated with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-only $8 \%$ below the normal saturation of $97 \%$. Furthermore, the tissues still remove about 5 ml of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from each 100 ml of blood passing through the tissues. To remove this $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ of the venous blood falls to 35 mm Hg -only 5 mm Hg below the normal value of 40 mm Hg . Thus, the tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ hardly changes, despite the marked fall in alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ from 104 to 60 mm Hg .

Conversely, when the alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ rises as high as 500 mm Hg , the maximum $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation of hemoglobin can never rise above $100 \%$, which is only $3 \%$ above the normal level of $97 \%$. Only a small amount of additional $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissolves in the fluid of the blood, as will be discussed subsequently. Then, when the blood passes through the tissue capillaries and loses several milliliters of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues, this reduces the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ of the capillary blood to a value only a few milliliters higher than the normal 40 mm Hg . Consequently, the level of alveolar $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ may vary greatly-from 60 to more than $500 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} \mathrm{PO}_{2}$-and still the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the peripheral tissues does not vary more than a few milliliters from normal, demonstrating beautifully the tissue "oxygen buffer" function of the blood hemoglobin system.

## Factors That Shift the OxygenHemoglobin Dissociation Curve—Their Importance for Oxygen Transport

The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-hemoglobin dissociation curves of Figures 41-8 and 41-9 are for normal average blood. However, several factors can displace the dissociation curve in one direction or the other, as shown in Figure 41-10. This figure shows that when the blood becomes slightly acidic, with the pH decreasing from the normal value of 7.4 to 7.2 , the $\mathrm{O}_{2^{-}}$ hemoglobin dissociation curve shifts, on average, about $15 \%$ to the right. Conversely, an increase in pH from the normal 7.4 to 7.6 shifts the curve a similar amount to the left.

In addition to pH changes, several other factors are known to shift the curve. Three of these, which shift the curve to the right are the following: (1) increased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration; (2) increased blood temperature; and (3) increased

![gu3951436699](gu3951436699.jpg)

## Increased Delivery of Oxygen to Tissues When $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Shift the OxygenHemoglobin Dissociation Curve-the Bohr Effect

A shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right in response to increases in blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ levels has a significant effect by enhancing the release of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the blood in the tissues and enhancing oxygenation of the blood in the lungs. This is called the Bohr effect, which can be explained as follows. As the blood passes through the tissues, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses from tissue cells into the blood. This diffusion increases the blood $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, which in turn raises blood $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ (carbonic acid) and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration. These effects shift the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right and downward, as shown in Figure 41-10, forcing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ away from the hemoglobin and therefore delivering increased amounts of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues.

Exactly the opposite effects occur in the lungs, where $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses from the blood into alveoli. This diffusion reduces blood $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration, shifting the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left and upward. Therefore, the quantity of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that binds with the hemoglobin at any given alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ becomes considerably increased, thus allowing greater $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport to the tissues.

## Effect of BPG to Cause Rightward Shift of the Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve

The normal BPG in the blood always keeps the $\mathrm{O}_{2^{-}}$ hemoglobin dissociation curve shifted slightly to the right. In hypoxic conditions that last longer than a few hours,
the quantity of BPG in the blood increases considerably, thus shifting the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-hemoglobin dissociation curve even farther to the right. This shift causes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to be released to the tissues at as much as 10 mm Hg higher tissue $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressure than would be the case without this increased BPG. Therefore, under some conditions, the BPG mechanism can be important for adaptation to hypoxia, especially to hypoxia caused by poor tissue blood flow.

## Rightward Shift of the OxygenHemoglobin Dissociation Curve During Exercise

During exercise, several factors shift the dissociation curve considerably to the right, thus delivering extra amounts of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the active, exercising muscle fibers. The exercising muscles, in turn, release large quantities of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$; this and several other acids released by the muscles increase the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ concentration in the muscle capillary blood. In addition, the temperature of the muscle often rises $2^{\circ}$ to $3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, which can increase $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to the muscle fibers even more. All these factors act together to shift the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve of the muscle capillary blood considerably to the right. This rightward shift of the curve forces $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to be released from blood hemoglobin to the muscle at $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ levels as great as 40 mm Hg , even when $70 \%$ of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ has already been removed from the hemoglobin. Then, in the lungs, the shift occurs in the opposite direction, allowing extra amounts of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to be picked up from alveoli.

## METABOLIC USE OF OXYGEN BY CELLS

Effect of Intracellular $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ on Oxygen Usage Rate. Only a minute level of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressure is required in the cells for normal intracellular chemical reactions to take place. The reason for this phenomenon is that the respiratory enzyme systems of the cell, discussed in Chapter 68, have been configured so that when the cellular $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ is more than $1 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, \mathrm{O}_{2}$ availability is no longer a limiting factor in the rates of the chemical reactions. Instead, the main limiting factor is the concentration of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in the cells. This effect is demonstrated in Figure 41-11, which shows the relationship between intracellular $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ and the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ usage rate at different concentrations of ADP. Note that whenever the intracellular $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ is above $1 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, \mathrm{O}_{2}$ usage rate becomes constant for any given concentration of ADP in the cell. Conversely, when the ADP concentration is altered, the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ usage changes in proportion to the change in ADP concentration.

As explained in Chapter 3, when adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is used in the cells to provide energy, it is converted into ADP. The increasing concentration of ADP increases metabolic usage of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as it combines with the various cell nutrients, releasing energy that reconverts the ADP back to ATP. Under normal operating conditions, the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ usage by the cells is controlled ultimately by the rate of energy expenditure within the cells-that is, by the rate at which ADP is formed from ATP.

![gu4051436699](gu4051436699.jpg)

Figure 41-11 Effect of intracellular adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ on rate of oxygen usage by the cells. Note that as long as the intracellular $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ remains above 1 mm Hg , the controlling factor for the rate of oxygen usage is the intracellular concentration of ADP.

## Effect of Diffusion Distance From the Capillary to the

Cell on Oxygen Usage. Tissue cells are seldom more than 50 micrometers away from a capillary, and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ normally can diffuse readily enough from the capillary to the cell to supply all the required amounts of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ for metabolism. However, occasionally, cells are located farther from the capillaries, and the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion to these cells can become so low that intracellular $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ falls below the critical level required to maintain maximal intracellular metabolism. Thus, under these conditions, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ usage by the cells is diffusion-limited and is no longer determined by the amount of ADP formed in the cells. However, this situation almost never occurs, except in pathological states.

## Effect of Blood Flow on Metabolic Use of Oxygen.

The total amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ available each minute for use in any given tissue is determined by (1) the quantity of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that can be transported to the tissue in each 100 ml of blood, and (2) the rate of blood flow. If blood flow rate falls to zero, the amount of available $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ also falls to zero. Thus, there are times when blood flow rate through a tissue can be so low that tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ falls below the critical 1 mm Hg required for intracellular metabolism. Under these conditions, the rate of tissue usage of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is blood flow-limited. Neither diffusion-limited nor blood flowlimited oxygen states can continue for long, however, because the cells receive less $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ than is required to continue the life of the cells.

## Transport of Oxygen in the Dissolved State

At the normal arterial $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of 95 mm Hg , about 0.29 ml of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is dissolved in every 100 ml of water in the blood, and when the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of the blood falls to the normal 40 mm Hg in the tissue capillaries, only 0.12 ml of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ remains dissolved. In other words, 0.17 ml of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is normally transported in the dissolved state to the tissues by each 100 ml of arterial
![gu4151436699](gu4151436699.jpg)

Figure 41-12 Carbon monoxide-hemoglobin dissociation curve. Note the extremely low carbon monoxide pressures at which carbon monoxide combines with hemoglobin.
blood flow. This value compares with almost 5 ml of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transported by the red blood cell hemoglobin. Therefore, the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transported to the tissues in the dissolved state is normally slight, only about $3 \%$ of the total, as compared with $97 \%$ transported by the hemoglobin.

During strenuous exercise, when hemoglobin release of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues increases by another 3 -fold, the relative quantity of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transported in the dissolved state falls to as little as $1.5 \%$. However, if a person breathes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at very high alveolar $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ levels, the amount transported in the dissolved state can become much greater, sometimes so much so that a serious excess of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ occurs in the tissues, and so-called $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ poisoning ensues. This condition often leads to brain convulsions and even death, as discussed in detail in Chapter 45 in relation to the high-pressure breathing of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ among deep-sea divers.

## Combination of Hemoglobin With Carbon Monoxide—Displacement of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$

Carbon monoxide (CO) combines with hemoglobin at the same point on the hemoglobin molecule as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$; it can therefore displace $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the hemoglobin and decrease the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ carrying capacity of blood. Furthermore, it binds with about 250 times as much tenacity as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which is demonstrated by the COhemoglobin dissociation curve in Figure 41-12. This curve is almost identical to the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-hemoglobin dissociation curve except that the CO partial pressures, shown on the abscissa, are at a level $1 / 500$ of those for the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-hemoglobin dissociation curve of Figure 41-8. Therefore, a CO partial pressure of only 0.4 mm Hg in the alveoli, $1 / 500$ that of normal alveolar $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ( 100 $\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg} \mathrm{PO}_{2}$ ), allows the CO to compete equally with the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ for combination with the hemoglobin and causes $50 \%$ of the hemoglobin in the blood to become bound with CO instead of with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Therefore, a CO pressure of only 0.6 mm Hg (a volume concentration < one part/1000 in air) can be lethal.

Even though the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of blood is greatly reduced in CO poisoning, the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of the blood may be normal. This situation makes exposure to CO especially dangerous because the blood is bright red, and there are no obvious signs of hypoxemia, such as a bluish color of the fingertips or lips (cyanosis). Also, $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is not reduced, and the feedback mechanism that usually stimulates an increased res-

![gu4251436699](gu4251436699.jpg)

piration rate in response to lack of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (usually reflected by a low $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ ) is absent. Because the brain is one of the first organs affected by lack of oxygen, the person may become disoriented and unconscious before becoming aware of the danger.

A patient severely poisoned with CO can be treated by administering pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ because $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at high alveolar pressure can displace CO rapidly from its combination with hemoglobin. The patient can also benefit from simultaneous administration of $5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ because this strongly stimulates the respiratory center, which increases alveolar ventilation and reduces alveolar CO. With intensive $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ therapy, CO can be removed from the blood as much as 10 times as rapidly as without therapy.

## TRANSPORT OF $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ IN BLOOD

Transport of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by the blood is not nearly as problematical as transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is because even in the most abnormal conditions, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can usually be transported in far greater quantities than can $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. However, the amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the blood has a lot to do with the acid-base balance of the body fluids, which is discussed in Chapter 31. Under normal resting conditions, an average of 4 ml of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are transported from the tissues to the lungs in each 100 ml of blood.

## CHEMICAL FORMS IN WHICH CO2 IS TRANSPORTED

To begin the process of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses out of the tissue cells in the dissolved molecular $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ form. On entering the tissue capillaries, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ initiates a host of almost instantaneous physical and chemical reactions, shown in Figure 41-13, which are essential for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport.

## Transport of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in a Dissolved State

A small portion of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is transported in the dissolved state to the lungs. Recall that the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of venous blood is 45 mm Hg and that of arterial blood is 40 mm Hg .

The amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissolved in the fluid of the blood at 45 mm Hg is about $2.7 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{dl}$ ( 2.7 volume percent). The amount dissolved at 40 mm Hg is about 2.4 ml , or a difference of 0.3 ml . Therefore, only about 0.3 ml of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is transported in the dissolved form by each 100 ml of blood flow. This is about $7 \%$ of all the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ normally transported.

## Transport of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the Form of Bicarbonate Ion

Carbonic Anhydrase Catalyzes the Reaction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ With Water in Red Blood Cells. The dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the blood reacts with water to form carbonic acid. This reaction would occur much too slowly to be of importance were it not for the fact that there is an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase inside the red blood cells, which catalyzes the reaction between $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water and accelerates its reaction rate by about 5000 -fold. Therefore, instead of requiring many seconds or minutes to occur, as is true in the plasma, the reaction occurs so rapidly in red blood cells that it reaches almost complete equilibrium within a small fraction of a second. This phenomenon allows tremendous amounts of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to react with the red blood cell water, even before the blood leaves the tissue capillaries.

Dissociation of Carbonic Acid Into Bicarbonate and Hydrogen Ions. In another fraction of a second, the carbonic acid formed in red cells $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)$ dissociates into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and bicarbonate ions $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right.$and $\left.\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$. Most of the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ ions then combine with hemoglobin in the red blood cells because the hemoglobin protein is a powerful acid-base buffer. In turn, many of the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ions diffuse from the red blood cells into the plasma while chloride ions diffuse into the red blood cells to take their place. This diffusion is made possible by the presence of a special bicarbonatechloride carrier protein in the red blood cell membrane that shuttles these two ions in opposite directions at rapid velocities. Thus, the chloride content of venous red blood cells is greater than that of arterial red blood cells, a phenomenon called the chloride shift.

The reversible combination of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with water in red blood cells under the influence of carbonic anhydrase accounts for about $70 \%$ of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transported from the tissues to the lungs. Thus, this means of transporting $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is the most important. Indeed, when a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., acetazolamide) is administered to an animal to block the action of carbonic anhydrase in the red blood cells, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport from the tissues becomes so poor that the tissue $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ may rise to 80 mm Hg instead of the normal 45 mm Hg .

Transport of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in Combination With Hemoglobin and Plasma Proteins-Carbaminohemoglobin. In addition to reacting with water, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reacts directly with amine radicals of the hemoglobin molecule to form the compound carbaminohemoglobin $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{Hgb}\right)$. This combination of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and hemoglobin is a reversible reaction

![gu4351436699](gu4351436699.jpg)

that occurs with a loose bond, so the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is easily released into the alveoli, where the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is lower than in the pulmonary capillaries.

A small amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ also reacts in the same way with the plasma proteins in tissue capillaries. This reaction is much less significant for the transport of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ because the quantity of these proteins in the blood is only one-fourth as great as the quantity of hemoglobin.

The quantity of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that can be carried from the peripheral tissues to the lungs by carbamino combination with hemoglobin and plasma proteins is about $30 \%$ of the total quantity transported-that is, normally about 1.5 ml of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in each 100 ml of blood. However, because this reaction is much slower than the reaction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with water inside the red blood cells, it is doubtful that under normal conditions this carbamino mechanism transports more than $20 \%$ of the total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

## CARBON DIOXIDE DISSOCIATION CURVE

The curve shown in Figure 41-14, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve, depicts the dependence of total blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in all its forms on $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$. Note that the normal blood $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is within a narrow range of 40 mm Hg in arterial blood and 45 mm Hg in venous blood. Note also that the normal concentration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the blood in all its different forms is about 50 volume percent, but only 4 volume percent of this is exchanged during normal transport of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the tissues to the lungs. That is, the concentration rises to about 52 volume percent as the blood passes through the tissues and falls to about 48 volume percent as it passes through the lungs.

## When Oxygen Binds With Hemoglobin, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ Is Released (the Haldane Effect) to Increase $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ Transport

Earlier in the chapter, we noted that an increase in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the blood causes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to be displaced from the hemoglobin (the Bohr effect), which is an important factor in increasing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport. The reverse is also true-binding of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ with hemoglobin tends to displace $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the blood. This effect, called the Haldane effect, is quantitatively far more important in promoting $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport than the Bohr effect in promoting $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport.
![gu4451436699](gu4451436699.jpg)

Figure 41-15 Portions of the carbon dioxide dissociation curve when the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ is 100 or 40 mm Hg . The arrow represents the Haldane effect on the transport of carbon dioxide.

The Haldane effect results from the simple fact that the combination of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ with hemoglobin in the lungs causes the hemoglobin to become a stronger acid. This displaces $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the blood and into the alveoli in two ways. First, the more highly acidic hemoglobin has less tendency to combine with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to form carbaminohemoglobin, thus displacing much of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that is present in the carbamino form from the blood. Second, the increased acidity of the hemoglobin also causes it to release an excess of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, and these ions bind with $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$to form carbonic acid, which then dissociates into water and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is released from the blood into the alveoli and, finally, into the air.

Figure 41-15 demonstrates quantitatively the significance of the Haldane effect on the transport of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the tissues to the lungs. This figure shows small portions of two $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curves: (1) when the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ is 100 mm Hg , which is the case in the blood capillaries of the lungs; and (2) when the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ is 40 mm Hg , which is the case in the tissue capillaries. Point A shows that the normal $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of 45 mm Hg in the tissues causes 52 volume percent of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to combine with the blood. On entering the lungs, the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ falls to 40 mm Hg , and the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ rises to 100 mm Hg . If the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve did not shift because of the Haldane effect, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of the blood would fall only to 50 volume percent, which would be a loss of only 2 volume percent of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. However, the increase in $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the lungs lowers the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve from the top curve to the lower curve of the figure, so the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content falls to 48 volume percent (point B). This represents an additional two volume percent loss of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Thus, the Haldane effect approximately doubles the amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ released from the blood in the lungs and approximately doubles the amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ picked up in the tissues.

## Change in Blood Acidity During $\mathrm{Co}_{2}$ Transport

The carbonic acid formed when $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ enters the blood in peripheral tissues decreases blood pH . However, reaction of this acid with the acid-base buffers of the blood pre-

vents the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration from rising very much (and the pH from falling very much). Ordinarily, arterial blood has a pH of about 7.41 and as the blood acquires $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the tissue capillaries the pH falls to a venous value of about 7.37. In other words, a pH change of 0.04 unit takes place. The reverse occurs when $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is released from the blood in the lungs, with the pH rising to the arterial value of 7.41 once again. During heavy exercise or other conditions of high metabolic activity, or when blood flow through the tissues is sluggish, the decrease in pH in the tissue blood (and in the tissues themselves) can be as much as 0.50 , about 12 times normal, thus causing significant tissue acidosis.

## RESPIRATORY EXCHANGE RATIO

The discerning student will have noted that normal transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the lungs to the tissues by each 100 ml of blood is about 5 ml , whereas normal transport of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the tissues to the lungs is about 4 ml . Thus, under normal resting conditions, only about $82 \%$ as much $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is expired from the lungs as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is taken up by the lungs. The ratio of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ output to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake is called the respiratory exchange ratio (R). That is:

$$
R=\frac{\text { Rate of carbon dioxide output }}{\text { Rate of oxygen uptake }}
$$

The value for $R$ changes under different metabolic conditions. When a person is using carbohydrates exclusively for body metabolism, R rises to 1.00 . Conversely, when a person is using fats exclusively for metabolic energy, the R level falls to as low as 0.7 . The reason for this difference is that when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is metabolized with carbohydrates, one molecule of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is formed for each molecule of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumed; when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ reacts with fats, a large share of
the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ combines with hydrogen atoms from the fats to form water instead of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. In other words, when fats are metabolized, the respiratory quotient of the chemical reactions in the tissues is about 0.70 instead of 1.00. (The tissue respiratory quotient is discussed in Chapter 72.) For a person on a normal diet consuming average amounts of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, the average value for R is considered to be 0.825 .

# Regulation of Respiration 

The nervous system normally adjusts the rate of alveolar ventilation to meet the demands of the body almost exactly so that the oxygen partial pressure $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}\right)$ and carbon dioxide partial pressure $\left(\mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)$ in the arterial blood are hardly altered, even during heavy exercise and most other types of respiratory stress. This chapter describes the function of this neurogenic system for regulation of respiration.

## RESPIRATORY CENTER

The respiratory center is composed of several groups of neurons located bilaterally in the medulla oblongata and pons of the brain stem, as shown in Figure 42-1. It is divided into three major collections of neurons: (1) a dorsal respiratory group, located in the dorsal portion of the medulla, which mainly causes inspiration; (2) a ventral respiratory group, located in the ventrolateral part of the medulla, which mainly causes expiration; and (3) the pneumotaxic center, located dorsally in the superior portion of the pons, which mainly controls rate and depth of breathing.

## DORSAL RESPIRATORY GROUP OF NEURONS CONTROLS INSPIRATION AND RESPIRATORY RHYTHM

The dorsal respiratory group of neurons plays a fundamental role in the control of respiration and extends most of the length of the medulla. Most of its neurons are located in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), although additional neurons in the adjacent reticular substance of the medulla also play important roles in respiratory control. The NTS is the sensory termination of both the vagal and the glossopharyngeal nerves, which transmit sensory signals into the respiratory center from the following: (1) peripheral chemoreceptors; (2) baroreceptors; (3) receptors in the liver, pancreas, and multiple parts of the gastrointestinal tract; and (4) several types of receptors in the lungs.

Rhythmical Inspiratory Discharges From the Dorsal Respiratory Group. The basic rhythm of respiration is generated mainly in the dorsal respiratory group of neu-
rons. Even when all the peripheral nerves entering the medulla have been sectioned, and the brain stem has been transected above and below the medulla, this group of neurons still emits repetitive bursts of inspiratory neuronal action potentials. The basic cause of these repetitive discharges is unknown. In primitive animals, neural networks have been found in which activity of one set of neurons excites a second set, which in turn inhibits the first. Then, after a period of time, the mechanism repeats itself, continuing throughout the life of the animal. Similar networks of neurons are present in the human being, located entirely within the medulla; it probably involves not only the dorsal respiratory group but adjacent areas of the medulla as well and is responsible for the basic rhythm of respiration.

Inspiratory "Ramp" Signal. The nervous signal that is transmitted to the inspiratory muscles, mainly the diaphragm, is not an instantaneous burst of action potentials. Instead, it begins weakly and increases steadily in a ramp manner for about 2 seconds in normal respiration. It then ceases abruptly for approximately the next 3 seconds, which turns off the excitation of the diaphragm and allows elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall to cause expiration. Next, the inspiratory signal begins again for another cycle; this cycle repeats again and again, with expiration occurring in between. Thus, the inspiratory signal is a ramp signal. The obvious advantage of the ramp is that it causes a steady increase in the volume of the lungs during inspiration, rather than inspiratory gasps.

Two qualities of the inspiratory ramp are controlled, as follows:

1. Control of the rate of increase of the ramp signal so that during heavy respiration, the ramp increases rapidly and therefore fills the lungs rapidly.
2. Control of the limiting point at which the ramp suddenly ceases, which is the usual method for controlling the rate of respiration. That is, the earlier the ramp ceases, the shorter the duration of inspiration. This method also shortens the duration of expiration. Thus, the frequency of respiration is increased.

Figure 42-1. Organization of the respiratory center.

## PNEUMOTAXIC CENTER LIMITS DURATION OF INSPIRATION AND INCREASES RESPIRATORY RATE

A pneumotaxic center, located dorsally in the nucleus parabrachialis of the upper pons, transmits signals to the inspiratory area. The primary effect of this center is to control the "switch-off" point of the inspiratory ramp, thereby controlling the duration of the filling phase of the lung cycle. When the pneumotaxic signal is strong, inspiration might last for as little as 0.5 second, thus filling the lungs only slightly; when the pneumotaxic signal is weak, inspiration might continue for 5 or more seconds, thus filling the lungs with much greater amounts of air.

The function of the pneumotaxic center is primarily to limit inspiration, which has a secondary effect of increasing the rate of breathing because limitation of inspiration also shortens expiration and the entire period of each respiration. A strong pneumotaxic signal can increase the rate of breathing to 30 to 40 breaths/min, whereas a weak pneumotaxic signal may reduce the rate to only 3 to 5 breaths/min.

## VENTRAL RESPIRATORY GROUP OF NEURONS—FUNCTIONS IN BOTH INSPIRATION AND EXPIRATION

Located in each side of the medulla, about 5 millimeters anterior and lateral to the dorsal respiratory group of neurons, is the ventral respiratory group of neurons, found in the nucleus ambiguus rostrally and the nucleus retroambiguus caudally. The function of this neuronal group differs from that of the dorsal respiratory group in several important ways:

1. The neurons of the ventral respiratory group remain almost totally inactive during normal quiet respiration. Therefore, normal quiet breathing is caused only by repetitive inspiratory signals from the dorsal respiratory group transmitted mainly to the diaphragm, and expiration results from elastic recoil of the lungs and thoracic cage.
2. The ventral respiratory neurons do not appear to participate in the basic rhythmical oscillation that controls respiration.
3. When the respiratory drive for increased pulmonary ventilation becomes greater than normal, respiratory signals spill over into the ventral respiratory neurons from the basic oscillating mechanism of the dorsal respiratory area. As a consequence, the ventral respiratory area also contributes extra respiratory drive.
4. Electrical stimulation of a few of the neurons in the ventral group causes inspiration, whereas stimulation of others causes expiration. Therefore, these neurons contribute to both inspiration and expiration. They are especially important in providing the powerful expiratory signals to the abdominal muscles during very heavy expiration. Thus, this area operates more or less as an overdrive mechanism when high levels of pulmonary ventilation are required, especially during heavy exercise.

## LUNG INFLATION SIGNALS LIMIT INSPIRATION-THE HERING-BREUER INFLATION REFLEX

In addition to the central nervous system respiratory control mechanisms operating entirely within the brain stem, sensory nerve signals from the lungs also help control respiration. Most importantly, located in the muscular portions of the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles throughout the lungs are stretch receptors that transmit signals through the vagi into the dorsal respiratory group of neurons when the lungs become overstretched. These signals affect inspiration in much the same way as signals from the pneumotaxic center; that is, when the lungs become overinflated, the stretch receptors activate an appropriate feedback response that "switches off" the inspiratory ramp and thus stops further inspiration. This mechanism is called the Hering-Breuer inflation reflex. This reflex also increases the rate of respiration, as is true for signals from the pneumotaxic center.

In humans, the Hering-Breuer reflex probably is not activated until the tidal volume increases to more than three times normal ( $>\approx 1.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ breath). Therefore, this reflex appears to be mainly a protective mechanism for preventing excess lung inflation rather than an important factor in normal control of ventilation.

## CONTROL OF OVERALL RESPIRATORY CENTER ACTIVITY

Up to this point, we have discussed the basic mechanisms for causing inspiration and expiration, but it is also important to know how the intensity of the respiratory control signals is increased or decreased to match the ventilatory needs of the body. For example, during heavy exercise, the rates of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ usage and carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$

formation are often increased to as much as 20 times normal, requiring commensurate increases in pulmonary ventilation. The major purpose of the rest of this chapter is to discuss this control of ventilation in accord with the respiratory needs of the body.

## CHEMICAL CONTROL OF RESPIRATION

The ultimate goal of respiration is to maintain proper concentrations of $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the tissues. It is fortunate, therefore, that respiratory activity is highly responsive to changes in each of these substances.

Excess $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the blood mainly act directly on the respiratory center, causing greatly increased strength of both the inspiratory and the expiratory motor signals to the respiratory muscles. Oxygen, in contrast, does not have a major direct effect on the respiratory center of the brain in controlling respiration. Instead, it acts almost entirely on peripheral chemoreceptors located in the carotid and aortic bodies, and these chemoreceptors in turn transmit appropriate nervous signals to the respiratory center for control of respiration.

## DIRECT CONTROL OF RESPIRATORY CENTER ACTIVITY BY $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ AND $\mathrm{H}^{+}$

Chemosensitive Area of the Respiratory Center Beneath the Medulla's Ventral Surface. We have mainly discussed three areas of the respiratory center-the dorsal respiratory group of neurons, the ventral respiratory group, and the pneumotaxic center. It is believed that none of these is affected directly by changes in blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration. Instead, an additional neuronal area, a chemosensitive area, shown in Figure 42-2, is located bilaterally, lying only 0.2 millimeter beneath the ventral surface of the medulla. This area is highly sensitive to changes in either blood $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration, and it in turn excites the other portions of the respiratory center.

Excitation of the Chemosensitive Neurons by $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Is Likely the Primary Stimulus. The sensor neurons in the chemosensitive area are especially excited by $\mathrm{H}^{+}$; in fact, it is believed that $\mathrm{H}^{+}$may be the only important direct stimulus for these neurons. However, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions do not easily cross the blood-brain barrier. For this reason, changes in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration in the blood have considerably less effect in stimulating the chemosensitive neurons than changes in blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, even though $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is believed to stimulate these neurons secondarily by changing the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ concentration, as explained in the following section.
$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ Indirectly Stimulates the Chemosensitive Neurons. Although $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ has little direct effect in stimulating the neurons in the chemosensitive area, it does have a potent indirect effect. It has this effect by reacting with the water of the tissues to form carbonic acid, which dissociates into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$; the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$then have a potent
![gu4651436699](gu4651436699.jpg)

Figure 42-2. Stimulation of the brain stem inspiratory area by signals from the chemosensitive area located bilaterally in the medulla, lying only a fraction of a millimeter beneath the ventral medullary surface. Note also that $\mathrm{H}^{+}$stimulates the chemosensitive area, but carbon dioxide in the fluid gives rise to most of the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.
direct stimulatory effect on respiration. These reactions are shown in Figure 42-2.

Why does blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ have a more potent effect in stimulating the chemosensitive neurons than blood $\mathrm{H}^{+}$? The answer is that the blood-brain barrier is not very permeable to $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, but $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ passes through this barrier almost as if the barrier did not exist. Consequently, whenever the blood $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ increases, so does the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of both the interstitial fluid of the medulla and the cerebrospinal fluid. In both these fluids, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ immediately reacts with the water to form new $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Thus, paradoxically, more $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is released into the respiratory chemosensitive sensory area of the medulla when the blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration increases than when the blood $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration increases. For this reason, respiratory center activity is increased very strongly by changes in blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, a fact that we subsequently discuss quantitatively.

Attenuated Stimulatory Effect of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ After the First 1 to 2 Days. Excitation of the respiratory center by $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is great the first few hours after the blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ first increases, but then it gradually declines over the next 1 to 2 days, decreasing to about one-fifth the initial effect. Part of this decline results from renal readjustment of the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration in the circulating blood back toward normal after the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ first increases the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration. The kidneys achieve this readjustment by increasing the blood $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, which binds with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid to reduce their concentrations. But, even more importantly, over a period of hours, the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$also slowly diffuses through the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers and combine directly with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$adjacent to the respiratory neurons as well, thus reducing the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$back to near normal. A change in blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration therefore has a potent acute effect on controlling respiratory drive but only a weak chronic effect after a few days' adaptation.

Figure 42-3. Effects of increased arterial blood $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and decreased arterial pH (increased $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration) on the rate of alveolar ventilation.

Quantitative Effects of Blood $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Concentration on Alveolar Ventilation. Figure 42-3 shows quantitatively the approximate effects of blood $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and blood pH (which is an inverse logarithmic measure of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration) on alveolar ventilation. Note especially the marked increase in ventilation caused by an increase in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in the normal range between 35 and 75 mm Hg , which demonstrates the tremendous effect that $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ changes have in controlling respiration. By contrast, the change in respiration in the normal blood pH range, which is between 7.3 and 7.5 , is less than $10 \%$ as great.

## Changes in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Have Little Direct Effect on Control of

the Respiratory Center. Changes in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentration have virtually no direct effect on the respiratory center itself to alter respiratory drive-although $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ changes do have an indirect effect, acting through the peripheral chemoreceptors, as explained in the next section.

We learned in Chapter 41 that the hemoglobin-oxygen buffer system delivers almost exactly normal amounts of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues, even when the pulmonary $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ changes from a value as low as 60 mm Hg up to a value as high as 1000 mm Hg . Therefore, except under special conditions, adequate delivery of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ can occur despite changes in lung ventilation ranging from slightly below half-normal to as high as 20 or more times normal. This is not true for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ because both the blood and tissue $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ change inversely with the rate of pulmonary ventilation; thus, the processes of animal evolution have made $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ the major controller of respiration, not $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

Figure 42-4. Respiratory control by peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies.

Yet, for those special conditions in which the tissues get into trouble for lack of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, the body has a special mechanism for respiratory control located in the peripheral chemoreceptors, outside the brain respiratory center. This mechanism responds when the blood $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ falls too low, mainly below a $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ of 70 mm Hg , as explained in the next section.

## PERIPHERAL CHEMORECEPTOR SYSTEM-ROLE OF OXYGEN IN RESPIRATORY CONTROL

In addition to control of respiratory activity by the respiratory center itself, still another mechanism is available for controlling respiration. This mechanism is the peripheral chemoreceptor system, shown in Figure 42-4. Special nervous chemical receptors, called chemoreceptors, are located in several areas outside the brain. They are especially important for detecting changes in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the blood, although they also respond to a lesser extent to changes in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentrations. The chemoreceptors transmit nervous signals to the respiratory center in the brain to help regulate respiratory activity.

Most of the chemoreceptors are in the carotid bodies. However, a few are also in the aortic bodies, shown in the lower part of Figure 42-4, and a very few are located elsewhere in association with other arteries of the thoracic and abdominal regions.

The carotid bodies are located bilaterally in the bifurcations of the common carotid arteries. Their afferent nerve fibers pass through Hering's nerves to the

![gu4951436699](gu4951436699.jpg)

Figure 42-5. Effect of arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ on impulse rate from the carotid body.
glossopharyngeal nerves and then to the dorsal respiratory area of the medulla. The aortic bodies are located along the arch of the aorta; their afferent nerve fibers pass through the vagi, also to the dorsal medullary respiratory area.

Each of the chemoreceptor bodies receives its own special blood supply through a minute artery directly from the adjacent arterial trunk. Blood flow through these bodies is extreme, 20 times the weight of the bodies themselves each minute. Therefore, the percentage of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ removed from the flowing blood is virtually zero, which means that the chemoreceptors are exposed at all times to arterial blood, not venous blood, and their $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ values are arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ values.

Decreased Arterial Oxygen Stimulates the Chemoreceptors. When the oxygen concentration in the arterial blood falls below normal, the chemoreceptors become strongly stimulated. This effect is demonstrated in Figure $42-5$, which shows the effect of different levels of arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ on the rate of nerve impulse transmission from a carotid body. Note that the impulse rate is particularly sensitive to changes in arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the range of 60 mm Hg down to 30 mm Hg , a range in which hemoglobin saturation with oxygen decreases rapidly.

## Basic Mechanism of Stimulation of the Chemoreceptors by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Deficiency. The exact means whereby low $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ excites the nerve endings in the carotid and aortic bodies are still not completely understood. However, these bodies have multiple, highly characteristic glandular-like cells, called glomus cells, that synapse directly or indirectly with the nerve endings. Current evidence suggests that these glomus cells function as the chemoreceptors and then stimulate the nerve endings (Figure 42-6). Glomus cells have $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-sensitive potassium channels that are inactivated when blood $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ decreases markedly. This inactivation causes the cell to depolarize, which in turn opens voltage-gated calcium channels and increases intracellular calcium ion concentration. The increased number of calcium ions stimulates release of a neurotransmitter that activates afferent neurons that send signals to the central nervous system and stimulate respiration. Although early studies suggested that dopamine or acetylcholine might
![gu5051436699](gu5051436699.jpg)

Figure 42-6. Carotid body glomus cell oxygen sensing. When the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ decreases below around 60 mm Hg , potassium channels close, causing cell depolarization, opening of calcium channels, and increased cytosolic calcium ion concentration. This stimulates transmitter release (adenosine triphosphate [ATP] is likely the most important), which activates afferent fibers that send signals to the central nervous system (CNS) and stimulate respiration. The mechanisms whereby low $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ influences potassium channel activity are still unclear. $\Delta \mathrm{Vm}$, Change in membrane voltage.
be the main neurotransmitters, more recent studies suggest that during hypoxia, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) may be the key excitatory neurotransmitter released by carotid body glomus cells.

Increased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Concentration Stimulates the Chemoreceptors. An increase in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration also excites the chemoreceptors and, in this way, indirectly increases respiratory activity. However, the direct effects of both these factors in the respiratory center are much more powerful than their effects mediated through the chemoreceptors (about seven times as powerful). Yet, there is one difference between the peripheral and central effects of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-the stimulation via the peripheral chemoreceptors occurs as much as five times as rapidly as central stimulation, so the peripheral chemoreceptors might be especially important in increasing the rapidity of response to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ at the onset of exercise.

## Effect of Low Arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ to Stimulate Alveolar Ventilation When Arterial $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Concentrations Remain Normal

Figure 42-7 shows the effect of low arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ on alveolar ventilation when the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentrations are

![gu5151436699](gu5151436699.jpg)

Figure 42-7. The lower red curve demonstrates the effect of different levels of arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ on alveolar ventilation, showing a 6 -fold increase in ventilation as the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ decreases from the normal level of 100 mm Hg to 20 mm Hg . The upper green line shows that the arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ was kept at a constant level during the measurements of this study; pH also was kept constant.
kept constant at their normal levels. In other words, in this figure, only the ventilatory drive caused by low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ on the chemoreceptors is active. Figure 42-7 shows almost no effect on ventilation as long as the arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ remains greater than 100 mm Hg . However, at pressures lower than 100 mm Hg , ventilation approximately doubles when the arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ falls to 60 mm Hg and can increase as much as fivefold at very low $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ values. Under these conditions, low arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ obviously drives the ventilatory process quite strongly.

Because the effect of hypoxia on ventilation is modest for $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ values greater than 60 to 80 mm Hg , the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$responses are mainly responsible for regulating ventilation in healthy humans at sea level.

## Chronic Breathing of Low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Stimulates Respiration Even More-The Phenomenon of "Acclimatization"

Mountain climbers have found that when they ascend a mountain slowly, over a period of days rather than a period of hours, they breathe much more deeply and therefore can withstand far lower atmospheric $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentrations than when they ascend rapidly. This phenomenon is called acclimatization.

The reason for acclimatization is that within 2 to 3 days, the respiratory center in the brain stem loses about $80 \%$ of its sensitivity to changes in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Therefore, the excess ventilatory blow-off of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that normally would inhibit an increase in respiration fails to occur, and low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ can drive the respiratory system to a much higher level of alveolar ventilation than under acute conditions. Instead of the $70 \%$ increase in ventilation that might occur after acute exposure to low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, the alveolar ventilation often increases by $400 \%$ to $500 \%$ after 2 to 3 days of low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$,
![gu5251436699](gu5251436699.jpg)

which helps immensely in supplying additional $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the mountain climber.

## Composite Effects of $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}, \mathrm{pH}$, and $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ on Alveolar Ventilation

Figure 42-8 gives a quick overview of the manner in which $\mathrm{Po}_{2}, \mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, and pH together affect alveolar ventilation. To understand this diagram, first observe the four red curves. These curves were recorded at different levels of arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}-40,50,60$, and 100 mm Hg . For each of these curves, the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ was changed from lower to higher levels. Thus, this family of red curves represents the combined effects of alveolar $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ on ventilation.

Now observe the green curves. Whereas the red curves were measured at a blood pH of 7.4 , the green curves were measured at a pH of 7.3 . We now have two families of curves representing the combined effects of $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ on ventilation at two different pH values. Still other families of curves would be displaced to the right at higher pH and displaced to the left at lower pH . Therefore, using this diagram, one can predict the level of alveolar ventilation for most combinations of alveolar $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$, and arterial pH .

## REGULATION OF RESPIRATION DURING EXERCISE

During strenuous exercise, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ formation can increase as much as 20 -fold. Yet, in the healthy athlete, as illustrated in Figure 42-9, alveolar ventilation ordinarily increases almost exactly in step with the increased level of oxygen metabolism. The arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}, \mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, and pH remain almost exactly normal.

In trying to analyze what causes the increased ventilation during exercise, one is tempted to ascribe this

![gu5351436699](gu5351436699.jpg)

Figure 42-9. Effect of moderate and severe exercise on oxygen consumption and ventilatory rate. (From Gray JS: Pulmonary Ventilation and Its Physiological Regulation. Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas, 1950.)
increased ventilation to increases in blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, plus a decrease in blood $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. However, measurements of arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}, \mathrm{pH}$, and $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ show that none of these values changes significantly during exercise, so none of them becomes abnormal enough to stimulate respiration as vigorously as observed during strenuous exercise. Therefore, what causes intense ventilation during exercise? At least one effect seems to be predominant. The brain, on transmitting motor impulses to the exercising muscles, is believed to transmit collateral impulses into the brain stem at the same time to excite the respiratory center. This action is analogous to the stimulation of the vasomotor center of the brain stem during exercise that causes a simultaneous increase in arterial pressure.

Actually, when a person begins to exercise, a large share of the total increase in ventilation begins immediately on initiation of the exercise, before any blood chemicals have had time to change. It is likely that most of the increase in respiration results from neurogenic signals transmitted directly into the brain stem respiratory center at the same time that signals go to the body muscles to cause muscle contraction.

Interrelationship Between Chemical and Nervous Factors in Controlling Respiration During Exercise. When a person exercises, direct nervous signals presumably stimulate the respiratory center by almost the proper amount to supply the extra $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ required for exercise and to blow off extra $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Occasionally, however, the nervous respiratory control signals are too strong or too weak. Chemical factors then play a significant role in bringing about the final adjustment of respiration required to keep the $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentrations of the body fluids as nearly normal as possible.

This process is demonstrated in Figure 42-10. The lower curve shows changes in alveolar ventilation during 1 minute of exercise, and the upper curve shows changes in arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$. Note that at the onset of exercise, the alveolar ventilation increases almost instantaneously, without an initial increase in arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$. In fact, this
![gu5451436699](gu5451436699.jpg)

Figure 42-10. Changes in alveolar ventilation (bottom curve) and arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ (top curve) during a 1-minute period of exercise and also after termination of exercise. (Data from Bainton CR: Effect of speed vs. grade and shivering on ventilation in dogs during active exercise. J Appl Physiol 33:778, 1972.)
increase in ventilation is usually great enough so that at first it actually decreases arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ below normal, as shown in the figure. The presumed reason why the ventilation forges ahead of the buildup of blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is that the brain provides an "anticipatory" stimulation of respiration at the onset of exercise, causing extra alveolar ventilation even before it is necessary. However, after 30 to 40 seconds, the amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ released into the blood from the active muscles approximately matches the increased rate of ventilation, and the arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ returns essentially to normal, even as the exercise continues. This is shown toward the end of 1 minute of exercise in the figure.

Figure 42-11 summarizes the control of respiration during exercise in another way, this time more quantitatively. The lower curve of this figure shows the effect of different levels of arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ on alveolar ventilation when the body is at rest-that is, not exercising. The upper curve shows the approximate shift of this ventilatory curve caused by neurogenic drive from the respiratory center that occurs during heavy exercise. The points indicated on the two curves show the arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ first in the resting state and then in the exercising state. Note in both cases that the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is at the normal level of 40 mm Hg . In other words, the neurogenic factor shifts the curve about 20 -fold in the upward direction, so ventilation almost matches the rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ release, thus keeping arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ near its normal value. The upper curve of Figure 42-11 also shows that if during exercise the arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ does change from its normal value of 40 mm Hg , it has an extra stimulatory effect on ventilation at a $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ value greater than 40 mm Hg and a depressant effect at a $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ value less than 40 mm Hg .

Neurogenic Control of Ventilation During Exercise May Be Partly a Learned Response. Many experiments suggest that the brain's ability to shift the ventilatory

![gu5551436699](gu5551436699.jpg)

Figure 42-11. Approximate effect of maximum exercise in an athlete to shift the alveolar $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$-ventilation response curve to a level much higher than normal. The shift, believed to be caused by neurogenic factors, is almost exactly the right amount to maintain arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ at the normal level of 40 mm Hg in the resting state and during heavy exercise.

response curve during exercise, as shown in Figure 42-11, is at least partly a learned response. That is, with repeated periods of exercise, the brain becomes progressively more able to provide the proper signals required to keep the blood $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ at its normal level. Also, there is reason to believe that even the cerebral cortex is involved in this learning because experiments that block only the cortex also block the learned response.

## Other Factors That Affect Respiration

Effect of Irritant Receptors in the Airways. The epithelium of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is supplied with sensory nerve endings called pulmonary irritant receptors that are stimulated by many factors. These receptors initiate coughing and sneezing, as discussed in Chapter 40. They may also cause bronchial constriction in persons with diseases such as asthma and emphysema.

Function of Lung J Receptors. A few sensory nerve endings have been described in the alveolar walls in juxtaposition to the pulmonary capillaries-hence, the name J receptors. They are stimulated especially when the pulmonary capillaries become engorged with blood or when pulmonary edema occurs in conditions such as congestive heart failure. Although the functional role of the J receptors is not clear, their excitation may give the person a feeling of dyspnea.

Brain Edema Depresses the Respiratory Center. The activity of the respiratory center may be depressed or even inactivated by acute brain edema resulting from a brain concussion. For example, the head might be struck against some solid object, after which the damaged brain tissues swell, compressing the cerebral arteries against the cranial vault and thus partially blocking the cerebral blood supply.

Occasionally, respiratory depression resulting from brain edema can be relieved temporarily by intravenous injection of a hypertonic solution, such as a highly concentrated mannitol solution. These solutions osmotically remove some of the fluids of the brain, thus relieving intracranial pressure and sometimes re-establishing respiration within a few minutes.

Overdosage of Anesthetics and Narcotics. Perhaps the most prevalent cause of respiratory depression and respiratory arrest is overdosage with anesthetics or narcotics. For example, sodium pentobarbital depresses the respiratory center considerably more than many other anesthetics, such as halothane. At one time, morphine was used as an anesthetic, but this drug is now used only as an adjunct to anesthetics because it greatly depresses the respiratory center while having less ability to anesthetize the cerebral cortex.

Because of their capacity to cause respiratory depression, opioids are responsible for a high proportion of fatal drug overdoses around the world. In the United States, approximately 70,000 people died from drug overdose in 2017, largely due to respiratory arrest.

Periodic Breathing. An abnormality of respiration called periodic breathing occurs in several disease conditions. The person breathes deeply for a short interval and then breathes slightly or not at all for an additional interval, with the cycle repeating itself over and over. One type of periodic breathing, Cheyne-Stokes breathing, is characterized by slowly waxing and waning respiration occurring about every 40 to 60 seconds, as illustrated in Figure 42-12.

Basic Mechanism of Cheyne-Stokes Breathing. The basic cause of Cheyne-Stokes breathing is the following. When a person overbreathes, thus blowing off too much $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the pulmonary blood while at the same time increasing blood $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, it takes several seconds before the changed pulmonary blood can be transported to the brain and inhibit the excess ventilation. By this time, the person has already overventilated for an extra few seconds. Therefore, when the overventilated blood finally reaches the brain respiratory center, the center becomes depressed to an excessive amount, at which point the opposite cycle begins-that is, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ increases, and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ decreases in the alveoli. Again, it takes a few seconds before the brain can respond to these new changes. When the brain does respond, the person breathes hard once again and the cycle repeats.

The basic cause of Cheyne-Stokes breathing occurs in everyone. However, under normal conditions, this mechanism is highly damped. That is, the fluids of the blood and respiratory center control areas have large amounts of dissolved and chemically bound $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Therefore, normally, the lungs cannot build up enough extra $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or depress the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ sufficiently in a few seconds to cause the next cycle of the periodic breathing. However, under two separate conditions, the damping factors can be overridden, and Cheyne-Stokes breathing does occur:

1. When a long delay occurs for transport of blood from the lungs to the brain, changes in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the alveoli can continue for many more seconds than usual. Under these conditions, the storage capacities of the alveoli and pulmonary blood for these gases are exceeded; then, after a few more seconds, the periodic respiratory drive becomes extreme and Cheyne-Stokes breathing begins. This type of Cheyne-Stokes breathing often occurs in patients with severe cardiac failure because blood flow is slow, thus delaying the transport of blood gases from the lungs to the brain. In patients with chronic heart failure, Cheyne-Stokes breathing can sometimes occur on and off for months.
2. A second cause of Cheyne-Stokes breathing is increased negative feedback gain in the respiratory control areas, which means that a change in blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ causes a far greater change in ventilation than normally. For example, instead of the normal two- to threefold increase in ventilation that occurs when the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ rises 3 mm Hg , the same $3-\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ rise might increase ventilation by 10 - to 20 -fold. The brain feedback tendency for periodic breathing is now strong enough to cause Cheyne-Stokes breathing without extra blood flow delay between the lungs and brain. This type of Cheyne-Stokes breathing occurs mainly in patients with damage to the respiratory centers of the brain. The brain damage often turns off the respiratory drive entirely for a few seconds, and then an extra-intense increase in blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ turns it back on with great force. Cheyne-Stokes breathing of this type is frequently a prelude to death from brain malfunction. Typical records of changes in pulmonary and respiratory center $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ during Cheyne-Stokes breathing are shown in Figure 42-12. Note that the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of the pulmonary blood changes in advance of the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of the respiratory neurons. However, the depth of respiration corresponds with the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in the brain, not with the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in the pulmonary blood where the ventilation is occurring.

## Sleep Apnea

The term apnea means absence of spontaneous breathing. Occasional apneas occur during normal sleep, but in persons with sleep apnea, the frequency and duration are greatly increased, with episodes of apnea lasting for 10 seconds or longer and occurring 300 to 500 times each night. Sleep apneas can be caused by obstruction of the upper airways, especially the pharynx, or by an impaired central nervous system respiratory drive.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea Is Caused by Blockage of the Upper Airway. The muscles of the pharynx normally keep this passage open to allow air to flow into the lungs during inspiration. During sleep, these muscles usually relax, but the airway passage remains open enough to permit adequate airflow. Some people have an especially narrow passage, and relaxation of these muscles during sleep causes the pharynx to close completely so that air cannot flow into the lungs.

In persons with sleep apnea, loud snoring and labored breathing occur soon after falling asleep. The snoring proceeds, often becoming louder, and is then interrupted by a long silent period during which no breathing (apnea) occurs. These periods of apnea result in significant decreases in $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ and increases in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, which greatly stimulate respiration. This stimulation, in turn, causes sudden attempts to breathe, which result in loud snorts and gasps followed by snoring and repeated episodes of apnea. The periods of apnea and labored breathing are repeated several hundred times during the night, resulting in fragmented restless sleep. Therefore, patients with sleep apnea usually have excessive daytime drowsiness, as well as other disorders, including increased sympathetic activity, high heart rate, pulmonary and systemic hypertension, and a greatly elevated risk for cardiovascular disease.

Obstructive sleep apnea usually occurs in older obese persons in whom there is increased fat deposition in the soft tissues of the pharynx or compression of the pharynx due to excessive fat masses in the neck. In a few individuals, sleep apnea may be associated with nasal obstruction, a very large tongue, enlarged tonsils, or certain shapes of the palate that greatly increase resistance to the flow of air to the lungs during inspiration. The most common treatments of obstructive sleep apnea include the following: (1) surgery to remove excess fat tissue at the back of the throat (a procedure called uvulopalatopharyngoplasty), remove enlarged tonsils or adenoids, or create an opening in the trachea (tracheostomy) to bypass the obstructed airway during sleep; and (2) nasal ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
"Central" Sleep Apnea Occurs When the Neural Drive to Respiratory Muscles Is Transiently Abolished. In a few persons with sleep apnea, the central nervous system drive to the ventilatory muscles transiently ceases. Disorders that can cause cessation of the ventilatory drive during sleep include damage to the central respiratory centers or abnormalities of the respiratory neuromuscular apparatus. Patients affected by central sleep apnea may have decreased ventilation, even when they are awake, although they are fully capable of normal voluntary breathing. During sleep, their breathing disorders usually worsen, resulting in more frequent episodes of apnea that decrease $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ and increase $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ until a critical level is reached that eventually stimulates respiration. These transient instabilities of respiration cause restless sleep and clinical features similar to those observed in people with obstructive sleep apnea.

In most patients, the cause of central sleep apnea is unknown, although instability of the respiratory drive can result from strokes or other disorders that make the respiratory centers of the brain less responsive to the stimulatory effects of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Patients with this disease are extremely sensitive to even small doses of sedatives or narcotics, which further reduce the responsiveness of the respiratory centers to the stimulatory effects of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Medications that stimulate the respiratory centers can sometimes be helpful, but ventilation with CPAP at night is usually necessary.

In some cases, sleep apnea may be caused by a combination of obstructive and central mechanisms. This "mixed" type of sleep apnea is estimated to account for approximately $15 \%$ of all sleep apnea cases, whereas pure "central" sleep apnea accounts for less than $1 \%$ of cases. The most common cause of sleep apnea is obstruction of the upper airway.

## Voluntary Control of Respiration

Thus far, we have discussed mainly the involuntary system for control of respiration. However, we all know that respiration can be controlled voluntarily for short periods, and that a person can hyperventilate or hypoventilate to such an extent that serious derangements in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}, \mathrm{pH}$, and $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ can occur in the blood. In fact, the world record for duration of voluntary breath-holding (apnea) under static resting conditions (and not hyperventilating with pure oxygen before the attempt) is reported to be 11 minutes and 54 seconds. Hyperventilation with pure oxygen and expelling large amounts of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ before the apnea attempt has permitted individuals to hold their breath underwater for over 24 minutes. Ultra-elite apnea competitors are able to suppress respiratory urges to the point where oxygen saturations fall to as low as about $50 \%$, and unconsciousness limits the duration of breath-holding.

# CHAPTER 43 

## Respiratory Insufficiency-Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, Oxygen Therapy

Diagnosis and treatment of most respiratory disorders depend heavily on understanding the basic physiological principles of respiration and gas exchange. Some respiratory diseases result from inadequate ventilation. Others are caused by abnormalities of diffusion through the pulmonary membrane or abnormal blood transport of gases between the lungs and tissues. Therapy is often entirely different for these diseases, so it is not satisfactory simply to make a diagnosis of "respiratory insufficiency."

## USEFUL METHODS FOR STUDYING RESPIRATORY ABNORMALITIES

In the previous few chapters, we discussed several methods for studying respiratory abnormalities, including measuring vital capacity, tidal air, functional residual capacity, dead space, physiologic shunt, and physiological dead space. This array of measurements is only part of the armamentarium of the clinical pulmonary physiologist. Some other tools are described here.

## STUDY OF BLOOD GASES AND BLOOD pH

Among the most fundamental of all tests of pulmonary performance are determinations of the blood partial pressure of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}\right)$, carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$, and pH . It is often important to make these measurements rapidly as an aid in determining appropriate therapy for acute respiratory distress or acute abnormalities of acid-base balance. The following simple and rapid methods have been developed to make these measurements within minutes, using no more than a few drops of blood.

Determination of Blood pH. Blood pH is measured using a glass pH electrode of the type commonly used in chemical laboratories. However, the electrodes used for this purpose are miniaturized. The voltage generated by the glass electrode is a direct measure of pH and is generally read directly from a voltmeter scale, or it is recorded on a chart.

Determination of Blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. A glass electrode pH meter can also be used to determine blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. When a
weak solution of sodium bicarbonate is exposed to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ gas, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissolves in the solution until an equilibrium state is reached. In this equilibrium state, the pH of the solution is a function of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and bicarbonate ion $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$concentrations in accordance with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation explained in Chapter 31:

$$
\mathrm{pH}=6.1+\log \frac{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}
$$

When the glass electrode is used to measure $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in blood, a miniature glass electrode is surrounded by a thin plastic membrane. A solution of sodium bicarbonate of known concentration is in the space between the electrode and plastic membrane. Blood is then superfused onto the outer surface of the plastic membrane, allowing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to diffuse from the blood into the bicarbonate solution. Only a drop or so of blood is required. Next, the pH is measured by the glass electrode, and the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is calculated using the formula that was previously provided.

Determination of Blood $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$. The concentration of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in a fluid can be measured by a technique called polarography. Electric current is made to flow between a small negative electrode and the solution. If the voltage of the electrode is more than -0.6 volt different from the voltage of the solution, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ will deposit on the electrode. Furthermore, the rate of current flow through the electrode will be directly proportional to the concentration of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (and therefore to $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ as well). In practice, a negative platinum electrode with a surface area of about 1 square millimeter is used, and this electrode is separated from the blood by a thin plastic membrane that allows diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ but not diffusion of proteins or other substances that will "poison" the electrode.

Often, all three of the measuring devices for $\mathrm{pH}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ are built into the same apparatus, and all these measurements can be made within a minute or so using a single droplet-sized sample of blood. Thus, changes in the blood gas levels and pH can be followed almost moment by moment at the bedside.

## MEASUREMENT OF MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY FLOW

In many respiratory diseases, particularly in asthma, the resistance to airflow becomes especially great during expiration, sometimes causing tremendous difficulty in breathing. This condition has led to the concept called maximum expiratory flow, which can be defined as follows. When a person expires with great force, the expiratory airflow reaches a maximum flow beyond which the flow cannot be increased any more, even with greatly increased additional force. This is the maximum expiratory flow. The maximum expiratory flow is much greater when the lungs are filled with a large volume of air than when they are almost empty. These principles can be understood by referring to Figure 43-1.

Figure 43-1A shows the effect of increased pressure applied to the outsides of the alveoli and air passageways caused by compressing the chest cage. The arrows indicate that the same pressure compresses the outsides of the alveoli and bronchioles. Therefore, not only does this pressure force air from the alveoli toward the bronchioles, but it also tends to collapse the bronchioles at the same time, which will oppose movement of air to the exterior. Once the bronchioles have almost completely collapsed, further expiratory force can still increase the alveolar pressure greatly, but it also increases the degree of bronchiolar collapse and airway resistance by an equal amount, thus preventing further increase in flow. Therefore, beyond a critical degree of expiratory force, a maximum expiratory flow has been reached.

Figure 43-1B shows the effect of different degrees of lung collapse (and therefore also of bronchiolar collapse)

Figure 43-1. A, Collapse of the respiratory passageway during maximum expiratory effort, an effect that limits expiratory flow rate. B, Effect of lung volume on the maximum expiratory airflow, showing decreasing maximum expiratory airflow as the lung volume becomes smaller.
on the maximum expiratory flow. The curve recorded in this section shows the maximum expiratory flow at all levels of lung volume after a healthy person first inhales as much air as possible and then expires with maximum expiratory effort until he or she can expire at no greater rate. Note that the person quickly reaches a maximum expiratory airflow of more than $400 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. However, regardless of how much additional expiratory effort the person exerts, this is still the maximum flow rate that he or she can achieve.

Note also that as the lung volume becomes smaller, the maximum expiratory flow rate also becomes less. The main reason for this phenomenon is that in the enlarged lung, the bronchi and bronchioles are held open partially by way of elastic pull on their outsides by lung structural elements. However, as the lung becomes smaller, these structures are relaxed so that the bronchi and bronchioles are collapsed more easily by external chest pressure, thus progressively reducing the maximum expiratory flow rate as well.

Abnormalities of the Maximum Expiratory FlowVolume Curve. Figure 43-2 shows the normal maximum expiratory flow-volume curve, along with two additional flow-volume curves recorded in two types of lung diseases: constricted lungs and partial airway obstruction. Note that the constricted lungs have both reduced total lung capacity (TLC) and reduced residual volume (RV). Furthermore, because the lung cannot expand to a normal maximum volume, even with the greatest possible expiratory effort, the maximal expiratory flow cannot rise to equal that of the normal curve. Constricted lung diseases include fibrotic diseases of the lung, such as tuberculosis and silicosis, and diseases that constrict the chest cage, such as kyphosis, scoliosis, and fibrotic pleurisy.

In diseases with airway obstruction, it is usually much more difficult to expire than to inspire because the closing tendency of the airways is greatly increased by the extra positive pressure required in the chest to cause expiration. By contrast, the extra negative pleural pressure that occurs during inspiration actually "pulls" the airways open at the
![gu5851436699](gu5851436699.jpg)

Figure 43-2. Effect of two respiratory abnormalities-constricted lungs and airway obstruction-on the maximum expiratory flowvolume curve. RV, Residual volume; TLC, total lung capacity.

same time that it expands the alveoli. Therefore, air tends to enter the lung easily but then becomes trapped in the lungs. Over a period of months or years, this effect increases both the TLC and RV, as shown by the green curve in Figure 43-2. Also, because of the obstruction of the airways, and because they collapse more easily than normal airways, the maximum expiratory flow rate is greatly reduced.

The classic disease that causes severe airway obstruction is asthma. Serious airway obstruction also occurs in some stages of emphysema.

## FORCED EXPIRATORY VITAL CAPACITY AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME

Another useful clinical pulmonary test, and one that is also easy to perform, is to record the forced expiratory vital capacity (FVC) on a spirometer. Such a recording is shown in Figure 43-3A for a person with normal lungs and in Figure 43-3B for a person with partial airway obstruction. In performing the FVC maneuver, the person first inspires maximally to the TLC and then exhales into the spirometer with maximum expiratory effort as rapidly and as completely as possible. The total distance of the downslope of the lung volume record represents the FVC, as shown in the figure.

Now, study the difference between the two records for (1) normal lungs and (2) partial airway obstruction. The total volume changes of the FVCs are not greatly different, indicating only a moderate difference in basic lung volumes in the two persons. There is, however, a major difference in the amounts of air that these persons can expire each second, especially during the first second. Therefore, it is customary to compare the recorded forced expiratory volume during the first second $\left(\mathrm{FEV}_{1}\right)$ with the

normal value. In the normal person (see Figure 43-3A), the percentage of the FVC that is expired in the first second divided by the total FVC ( $\mathrm{FEV}_{1} / \mathrm{FVC} \%$ ) is $80 \%$. However, note in Figure 43-3B that with airway obstruction, this value decreases to only $47 \%$. In persons with serious airway obstruction, as often occurs with acute asthma, this value can decrease to less than $20 \%$.

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SPECIFIC PULMONARY ABNORMALITIES

## CHRONIC PULMONARY EMPHYSEMA

The term pulmonary emphysema literally means excess air in the lungs. However, this term is usually used to describe a complex obstructive and destructive process of the lungs caused by many years of smoking. It results from the following major pathophysiological changes in the lungs:

1. Chronic infection, caused by inhaling smoke or other substances that irritate the bronchi and bronchioles. The chronic infection seriously deranges the normal protective mechanisms of the airways, including partial paralysis of the cilia of the respiratory epithelium, an effect caused by nicotine. As a result, mucus cannot be moved easily out of the passageways. Also, stimulation of excess mucus secretion occurs, which further exacerbates the condition. There is also inhibition of the alveolar macrophages, so they become less effective in combating infection.
2. The infection, excess mucus, and inflammatory edema of the bronchiolar epithelium together cause chronic obstruction of many of the smaller airways.
3. The obstruction of the airways makes it especially difficult to expire, thus causing entrapment of air in the alveoli and overstretching them. This effect, combined with the lung infection, causes marked destruction of as much as $50 \%$ to $80 \%$ of the alveolar walls. Therefore, the final picture of the emphysematous lung is that shown in Figure 43-4 (top) and 43-5.
The physiological effects of chronic emphysema are variable, depending on the severity of the disease and the relative degrees of bronchiolar obstruction versus lung parenchymal destruction. The different abnormalities include the following:
4. The bronchiolar obstruction increases airway resistance and results in greatly increased work of breathing. It is especially difficult for the person to move air through the bronchioles during expiration because the compressive force on the outside of the lung not only compresses the alveoli but also compresses the bronchioles, which further increases their resistance during expiration.
5. The marked loss of alveolar walls greatly decreases the diffusing capacity of the lung. This reduces the

ability of the lungs to oxygenate the blood and remove $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the blood.
3. The obstructive process is frequently much worse in some parts of the lungs than in other parts, so some portions of the lungs are well ventilated, whereas other portions are poorly ventilated. This situation often causes extremely abnormal ventilationperfusion ratios, with a very low $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \mathrm{Q}$ in some parts (physiological shunt), resulting in poor aeration of the blood, and a very high $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \mathrm{Q}$ in other parts (physiological dead space), resulting in wasted
![gu6051436699](gu6051436699.jpg)

ventilation, with both effects occurring in the same lungs.
4. Loss of large portions of the alveolar walls also decreases the number of pulmonary capillaries through which blood can pass. As a result, the pulmonary vascular resistance often increases markedly, causing pulmonary hypertension, which in turn overloads the right side of the heart and frequently causes right-sided heart failure.
Chronic emphysema usually progresses slowly over many years. Both hypoxia and hypercapnia develop because of hypoventilation of many alveoli plus loss of alveolar walls. The net result of all these effects is severe, prolonged, devastating air hunger that can last for years until the hypoxia and hypercapnia cause death-a high penalty to pay for smoking.

## PNEUMONIA—LUNG INFLAMMATION AND FLUID IN ALVEOLI

The term pneumonia includes any inflammatory condition of the lung in which some or all of the alveoli are filled with fluid and blood cells, as shown in Figure 43-5. A common type of pneumonia is bacterial pneumonia, caused most frequently by pneumococci. This disease begins with infection in the alveoli; the pulmonary membrane becomes inflamed and highly porous so that fluid and even red and white blood cells leak out of the blood into the alveoli. Thus, the infected alveoli become progressively filled with fluid and cells, and the infection spreads by extension of bacteria or virus from alveolus to alveolus. Eventually, large areas of the lungs, sometimes whole lobes or even a whole lung, become "consolidated," which means that they are filled with fluid and cellular debris.

In persons with pneumonia, the gas exchange functions of the lungs decline in different stages of the disease. In early stages, the pneumonia process might well be localized to only one lung, with alveolar ventilation being reduced while blood flow through the lung continues normally. This condition causes two major pulmonary abnormalities: (1) reduction in the total available surface area of the respiratory membrane; and (2) a decreased
![gu6151436699](gu6151436699.jpg)

Figure 43-5. Lung alveolar changes in pneumonia and emphysema.

ventilation-perfusion ratio. Both these effects cause hypoxemia (low blood $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ) and hypercapnia (high blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ).

Figure 43-6 shows the effect of the decreased ventilation-perfusion ratio in pneumonia. The blood passing through the aerated lung becomes $97 \%$ saturated with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, whereas that passing through the unaerated lung is about $60 \%$ saturated. Therefore, the average saturation of the blood pumped by the left heart into the aorta is only about $78 \%$, which is far below normal.

## ATELECTASIS—COLLAPSE OF THE ALVEOLI

Atelectasis means collapse of the alveoli. It can occur in localized areas of a lung or in an entire lung. Common causes of atelectasis are (1) total obstruction of the airway and (2) lack of surfactant in the fluids lining the alveoli.

Airway Obstruction Causes Lung Collapse. The airway obstruction type of atelectasis usually results from the following: (1) blockage of many small bronchi with mucus; or (2) obstruction of a major bronchus by a large mucous plug or some solid object, such as a tumor. The air entrapped beyond the block is absorbed within minutes to hours by the blood flowing in the pulmonary capillaries. If the lung tissue is pliable enough, this will lead simply to collapse of the alveoli. However, if the lung is rigid because of fibrotic tissue and cannot collapse, absorption of air from the alveoli creates very negative pressures within the alveoli, which pull fluid out of the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli, thus causing the alveoli to fill completely with edema fluid. This process almost always is the effect that occurs when an entire lung becomes atelectatic, a condition called massive collapse of the lung.

The effects on overall pulmonary function caused by massive collapse (atelectasis) of an entire lung are shown in Figure 43-7. Collapse of the lung tissue
![gu6251436699](gu6251436699.jpg)

Figure 43-6. Effect of pneumonia on percentage saturation of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ in the pulmonary artery, the right and left pulmonary veins, and the aorta.
not only occludes the alveoli but also almost always increases the resistance to blood flow through the pulmonary vessels of the collapsed lung. This resistance increase occurs partially because of the lung collapse, which compresses and folds the vessels as the volume of the lung decreases. In addition, hypoxia in the collapsed alveoli causes additional vasoconstriction, as explained in Chapter 39.

Because of the vascular constriction, blood flow through the atelectatic lung is greatly reduced. Fortunately, most of the blood is routed through the ventilated lung and therefore becomes well aerated. In the situation shown in Figure 43-7, five-sixths of the blood passes through the aerated lung, and only onesixth passes through the unaerated lung. As a result, the overall ventilation-perfusion ratio is only moderately compromised, so the aortic blood has only mild $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ desaturation, despite total loss of ventilation in an entire lung.

Lack of "Surfactant" as a Cause of Lung Collapse. The secretion and function of surfactant in the alveoli were discussed in Chapter 38. Surfactant is secreted by special alveolar epithelial cells into the fluids that coat the inside surface of the alveoli. The surfactant in turn decreases the surface tension in the alveoli by 2 - to 10 -fold, which normally plays a major role in preventing alveolar collapse. However, in several conditions, such as in hyaline membrane disease (also called respiratory distress syndrome), which often occurs in newborn premature babies, the quantity of surfactant secreted by the alveoli is so greatly depressed that the surface tension of the alveolar fluid becomes several times greater than normal. This surfactant deficiency causes a serious tendency for the lungs of these babies to collapse or to become filled with fluid. As explained in Chapter 38, many of these infants die of suffocation when large portions of the lungs become atelectatic.

## ASTHMA-SPASMODIC CONTRACTION OF SMOOTH MUSCLES IN BRONCHIOLES

Asthma is characterized by spastic contraction of the smooth muscle in the bronchioles, which partially obstructs the bronchioles and causes extremely difficult breathing. The prevalence of asthma has been increasing and affects $7 \%$ to $8 \%$ of all people in the United States, with even higher rates in some groups such as non-Hispanic blacks. The World Health Organization estimates that over 235 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, although some estimates of asthma prevalence are as high as 339 million people.

The usual cause of asthma is contractile hypersensitivity of the bronchioles in response to foreign substances in the air. In about $70 \%$ of patients younger than 30 years, the asthma is caused by allergic hypersensitivity, especially sensitivity to plant pollens. In older people, the cause is almost always hypersensitivity to nonallergenic types of irritants in the air, such as irritants in smog.

The typical allergic person tends to form abnormally large amounts of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, and these antibodies cause allergic reactions when they react with the specific antigens that have caused them to develop in the first place, as explained in Chapter 35. In persons with asthma, these antibodies are mainly attached to mast cells that are present in the lung interstitium in close association with the bronchioles and small bronchi. When an asthmatic person breathes in pollen to which he or she is sensitive (i.e., to which the person has developed IgE antibodies), the pollen reacts with the mast cell-attached antibodies and causes the mast cells to release several different substances. Among them are the following: (1) histamine; (2) slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (which is a mixture of leukotrienes); (3) eosinophilic chemotactic factor; and (4) bradykinin. The combined effects of all these factors, especially the slowreacting substance of anaphylaxis, are to produce the following: (1) localized edema in the walls of the small bronchioles, as well as secretion of thick mucus into the bronchiolar lumens; and (2) spasm of the bronchiolar smooth muscle. Therefore, the airway resistance increases greatly.

As discussed earlier in this chapter, the bronchiolar diameter becomes reduced more during expiration than during inspiration in persons with asthma as a result of bronchiolar collapse during expiratory effort that compresses the outsides of the bronchioles. Because the bronchioles of the asthmatic lungs are already partially occluded, further occlusion resulting from the external pressure creates especially severe obstruction during expiration. That is, the asthmatic person often can inspire quite adequately but has great difficulty expiring. Clinical measurements show (1) greatly reduced maximum expiratory rate, and (2) reduced timed expiratory volume. Also, all this together results in dyspnea, or "air hunger," discussed later in this chapter.

The functional residual capacity and residual volume of the lung become especially increased during an acute asthma attack because of the difficulty in expiring air from the lungs. Also, over a period of years, the chest cage becomes permanently enlarged, causing a so-called barrel chest, and both the functional residual capacity and lung residual volume become permanently increased.

## TUBERCULOSIS

In tuberculosis, the tubercle bacilli cause a peculiar tissue reaction in the lungs, including (1) invasion of the infected tissue by macrophages, and (2) "walling off" of the lesion by fibrous tissue to form the socalled tubercle. This walling-off process helps limit further transmission of the tubercle bacilli in the lungs and therefore is part of the protective process against extension of the infection. However, in about 3\% of people in whom tuberculosis develops, if the disease is not treated, the walling-off process fails, and tubercle bacilli spread throughout the lungs, often causing extreme destruction of lung tissue, with formation of large abscess cavities.

Thus, tuberculosis in its late stages is characterized by many areas of fibrosis throughout the lungs, as well as by reduced total amount of functional lung tissue. These effects cause the following: (1) increased "work" on the part of the respiratory muscles to cause pulmonary ventilation and reduced vital capacity and breathing capacity; (2) reduced total respiratory membrane surface area and increased thickness of the respiratory membrane, causing progressively diminished pulmonary diffusing capacity; and (3) abnormal ventilation-perfusion ratio in the lungs, further reducing overall pulmonary diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

## HYPOXIA AND OXYGEN THERAPY

Almost any of the conditions discussed in the past few sections of this chapter can cause serious cellular hypoxia throughout the body. Sometimes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ therapy is of great value, other times it is of moderate value, and at still other times it is of almost no value. Therefore, it is important to understand the different types of hypoxia, and then we can discuss the physiological principles of oxygen therapy. The following is a descriptive classification of the causes of hypoxia:

1. Inadequate oxygenation of the blood in the lungs because of extrinsic reasons
a. Deficiency of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the atmosphere
b. Hypoventilation (neuromuscular disorders)
2. Pulmonary disease
a. Hypoventilation caused by increased airway resistance or decreased pulmonary compliance
b. Abnormal alveolar ventilation-perfusion ratio (including increased physiological dead space or increased physiological shunt)
c. Diminished respiratory membrane diffusion

3. Venous-to-arterial shunts (right-to-left cardiac shunts)
4. Inadequate $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport to the tissues by the blood
a. Anemia or abnormal hemoglobin
b. General circulatory deficiency
c. Localized circulatory deficiency (peripheral, cerebral, coronary vessels)
d. Tissue edema
5. Inadequate tissue capability of using $\mathrm{O}_{2}$
a. Poisoning of cellular oxidation enzymes
b. Diminished cellular metabolic capacity for using oxygen because of toxicity, vitamin deficiency, or other factors
This classification of the types of hypoxia is mainly selfevident from the discussions earlier in the chapter. Only one type of hypoxia in the classification needs further elaboration-the hypoxia caused by inadequate capability of the body's tissue cells to use $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

Inadequate Tissue Capability to Use Oxygen. The classic cause of inability of the tissues to use $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is cyanide poisoning, in which the action of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase is blocked by cyanide to such an extent that the tissues simply cannot use $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, even when plenty is available. Also, deficiencies of some of the tissue cellular oxidative enzymes or of other elements in the tissue oxidative system can lead to this type of hypoxia. A special example occurs in the disease beriberi, in which several important steps in tissue utilization of oxygen and the formation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are compromised because of vitamin $B$ deficiency.

Effects of Hypoxia on the Body. Hypoxia, if severe enough, can cause death of cells throughout the body, but in less severe degrees, it mainly causes (1) depressed mental activity, sometimes culminating in coma, and (2) reduced work capacity of the muscles. These effects are specifically discussed in Chapter 44 in relation to highaltitude physiology.

## OXYGEN THERAPY IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF HYPOXIA

$\mathrm{O}_{2}$ can be administered by the following: (1) placing the patient's head in a "tent" that contains air fortified with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$; (2) allowing the patient to breathe pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or high concentrations of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from a mask; or (3) administering $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ through an intranasal tube.

Recalling the basic physiological principles of the different types of hypoxia, one can readily decide when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ therapy will be of value and, if so, how valuable.

In atmospheric hypoxia, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ therapy can completely correct the depressed $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ level in the inspired gases and, therefore, provide $100 \%$ effective therapy.

In hypoventilation hypoxia, a person breathing 100\% $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ can move five times as much $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ into the alveoli with each breath as when breathing normal air. Therefore, here again, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ therapy can be extremely beneficial. However, this $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ therapy provides no benefit for the excess blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ also caused by the hypoventilation.
![gu6451436699](gu6451436699.jpg)

Figure 43-8. Absorption of oxygen into the pulmonary capillary blood in pulmonary edema, with and without oxygen tent therapy.

In hypoxia caused by impaired alveolar membrane diffusion, essentially the same result occurs as in hypoventilation hypoxia because $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ therapy can increase the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the lung alveoli from the normal value of about 100 mm Hg to as high as 600 mm Hg . This action raises the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressure gradient for diffusion of oxygen from the alveoli to the blood from the normal value of 60 mm Hg to as high as 560 mm Hg , an increase of more than $800 \%$. This highly beneficial effect of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ therapy in diffusion hypoxia is demonstrated in Figure 43-8, which shows that the pulmonary blood in this patient with pulmonary edema picks up $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ three to four times as rapidly as would occur with no therapy.

In hypoxia caused by anemia, abnormal hemoglobin transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, circulatory deficiency, or physiological shunt, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ therapy is of much less value because normal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is already available in the alveoli. Instead, the problem is that one or more of the mechanisms for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the tissues are deficient. Even so, a small amount of extra $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, between $7 \%$ and $30 \%$, can be transported in the dissolved state in the blood when alveolar $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is increased to maximum, even though the amount transported by the hemoglobin is hardly altered. This small amount of extra $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ may be the difference between life and death.

In the different types of hypoxia caused by inadequate tissue use of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, there is no abnormality of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ pickup by the lungs or of transport to the tissues. Instead, the tissue metabolic enzyme system is simply incapable of using the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that is delivered. Therefore, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ therapy provides no measurable benefit.

## CYANOSIS

The term cyanosis means blueness of the skin; its cause is excessive amounts of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the skin blood vessels, especially in the capillaries. This deoxygenated hemoglobin has an intense dark blue-purple color that is transmitted through the skin.

In general, definite cyanosis appears whenever the arterial blood contains more than 5 grams of deoxygenated

hemoglobin in each 100 ml of blood. A person with anemia almost never becomes cyanotic because there is not enough hemoglobin for 5 grams to be deoxygenated in 100 ml of arterial blood. Conversely, in a person with excess red blood cells, as in polycythemia vera, the great excess of available hemoglobin that can become deoxygenated leads frequently to cyanosis, even under otherwise normal conditions.

## HYPERCAPNIA—EXCESS CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE BODY FLUIDS

One might suspect, on first thought, that any respiratory condition that causes hypoxia would also cause hypercapnia. However, hypercapnia usually occurs in association with hypoxia only when the hypoxia is caused by hypoventilation or circulatory deficiency for the following reasons.

Hypoxia caused by too little $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the air, too little hemoglobin, or poisoning of the oxidative enzymes involves only the availability of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or use of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by the tissues. Therefore, it is readily understandable that hypercapnia is not associated with these types of hypoxia.

In hypoxia resulting from poor diffusion through the pulmonary membrane or the tissues, serious hypercapnia usually does not occur at the same time because $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses 20 times as rapidly as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. If hypercapnia does begin to occur, this immediately stimulates pulmonary ventilation, which corrects the hypercapnia but not necessarily the hypoxia.

Conversely, in hypoxia caused by hypoventilation, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transfer between the alveoli and the atmosphere is affected as much as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transfer. Hypercapnia then occurs along with the hypoxia. In circulatory deficiency, diminished flow of blood decreases $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ removal from the tissues, resulting in tissue hypercapnia in addition to tissue hypoxia. However, the transport capacity of the blood for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is more than three times that for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, and thus the resulting tissue hypercapnia is much less than the tissue hypoxia.

When the alveolar $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ rises above about 60 to 75 mm Hg , an otherwise normal person by then is breathing about as rapidly and deeply as he or she can, and air hunger, also called dyspnea, becomes severe.

If the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ rises to 80 to 100 mm Hg , the person becomes lethargic and sometimes even semicomatose. Anesthesia and death can result when the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ rises to 120 to 150 mm Hg . At these higher levels of $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, the excess $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ now begins to depress respiration rather than stimulate it, thus causing a vicious circle: (1) more $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, (2) further decrease in respiration, (3) then more $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and so forth-culminating rapidly in a respiratory death.

## DYSPNEA

Dyspnea means mental anguish associated with inability to ventilate enough to satisfy the demand for air. A common synonym is air hunger.

At least three factors often enter into the development of the sensation of dyspnea: (1) abnormality of respiratory gases in the body fluids, especially hypercapnia and, to a much less extent, hypoxia; (2) the amount of work that must be performed by the respiratory muscles to provide adequate ventilation; and (3) state of mind.

A person becomes especially dyspneic from excess buildup of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the body fluids. At times, however, the levels of both $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the body fluids are normal but, to attain this normality of the respiratory gases, the person has to breathe forcefully. In these cases, the forceful activity of the respiratory muscles frequently gives the person a sensation of dyspnea.

Most people have the sensation of severe dyspnea after only 1 to 2 minutes of voluntary breath-holding (apnea). However, as discussed in Chapter 42, some individuals can train themselves to suppress respiratory urges for more than 10 minutes, despite buildup of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and very low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the body fluids.

Finally, dyspnea may be experienced because of an abnormal state of mind, even though the person's respiratory functions, as well as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the body fluids, may be normal. This condition is called neurogenic dyspnea or emotional dyspnea. For example, almost anyone momentarily thinking about the act of breathing may suddenly start taking breaths a little more deeply than ordinarily because of a feeling of mild dyspnea. This feeling is greatly enhanced in people who have a psychological fear of not being able to receive a sufficient quantity of air, such as when entering a small or crowded room.

## ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION

Resuscitator. Many types of respiratory resuscitators are available, and each has its own characteristic principles of operation. The resuscitator shown in Figure 43-9A consists of a tank supply of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or air, a mechanism for applying intermittent positive pressure and, with some machines, negative pressure as well, and a mask that fits over the face of the patient or a connector for joining the equipment to an endotracheal tube. This apparatus forces air through the mask or endotracheal tube into the lungs of the patient during the positive-pressure cycle of the resuscitator and then usually allows the air to flow passively out of the lungs during the remainder of the cycle.

Earlier resuscitators often caused damage to the lungs because of excessive positive pressure. Their usage was at one time greatly decried. However, resuscitators now have adjustable positive-pressure limits that are commonly set at 12 to $15 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ pressure for normal lungs, but sometimes much higher for noncompliant lungs.

Tank Respirator (the "Iron Lung"). Figure 43-9B shows the tank respirator with a patient's body inside the tank and the head protruding through a flexible but airtight collar. At the end of the tank, opposite the patient's head,

![gu6551436699](gu6551436699.jpg)

Figure 43-9. A, Resuscitator. B, Tank respirator.
a motor-driven leather diaphragm moves back and forth with sufficient excursion to raise and lower the pressure inside the tank. As the leather diaphragm moves inward, positive pressure develops around the body and causes expiration; as the diaphragm moves outward, negative pressure causes inspiration. Check valves on the respirator control the positive and negative pressures. Ordinarily, these pressures are adjusted so that the negative pressure that causes inspiration falls to -10 to $-20 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, and the positive pressure rises to 0 to $+5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

Use of the tank respirator is now largely obsolete in modern medicine with the development of superior mechanical ventilators that push air into the airways with positive pressure.

## Effect of the Resuscitator and the Tank Respirator on

Venous Return. When air is forced into the lungs under positive pressure by a resuscitator, or when the pressure around the patient's body is reduced by the tank respirator, the pressure inside the lungs becomes greater than pressure everywhere else in the body. Flow of blood into the chest and heart from the peripheral veins becomes
impeded. As a result, use of excessive pressures with the resuscitator or tank respirator can reduce the cardiac output, sometimes to lethal levels. For example, continuous exposure for more than a few minutes to more than 30mm Hg positive pressure in the lungs can cause death because of inadequate venous return to the heart.

# Aviation, High Altitude, and Space Physiology 

As humans have ascended to higher and higher altitudes in aviation, mountain climbing, and space exploration, it has become progressively more important to understand the effects of altitude and low gas pressures on the human body. This chapter deals with these problems and acceleratory forces, weightlessness, and other challenges to body homeostasis that occur at high altitudes and in space flight.

## EFFECTS OF LOW OXYGEN PRESSURE ON THE BODY

## Barometric Pressures at Different Altitudes. Table

44-1 lists the approximate barometric and oxygen pressures at different altitudes, showing that at sea level, the barometric pressure is 760 mm Hg ; at 10,000 feet, it is only 523 mm Hg ; and at 50,000 feet, it is 87 mm Hg . This decrease in barometric pressure is the basic cause of all the hypoxia problems in high-altitude physiology, because as the barometric pressure decreases, the atmospheric oxygen partial pressure $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}\right)$ decreases proportionately, remaining at all times slightly less than $21 \%$ of the total barometric pressure; at sea level, $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is about 159 mm Hg , but at 50,000 feet, $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is only 18 mm Hg .

## ALVEOLAR $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ AT DIFFERENT ELEVATIONS

## Carbon Dioxide and Water Vapor Decrease the Alveolar Oxygen. Even at high altitudes, carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ is

continually excreted from the pulmonary blood into the alveoli. In addition, water vaporizes into the inspired air from the respiratory surfaces. These two gases dilute the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the alveoli, thus reducing the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentration. Water vapor pressure in the alveoli remains at 47 mm Hg as long as the body temperature is normal, regardless of altitude.

In the case of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, during exposure to very high altitudes, the alveolar partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)$ falls from the sea level value of 40 mm Hg to lower values. In the acclimatized person, who increases ventilation about fivefold, the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ falls to about 7 mm Hg because of increased respiration.

Now let us see how the pressures of these two gases affect the alveolar $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. For example, assume that the barometric pressure falls from the normal sea level value of

760 to 253 mm Hg , which is the usual measured value at the top of 29,028 -foot Mount Everest. Of this, 47 mm Hg must be water vapor, leaving only 206 mm Hg for all the other gases. In the acclimatized person, 7 mm Hg of the 206 mm Hg must be $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, leaving only 199 mm Hg . If there were no use of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by the body, one-fifth of this 199 mm Hg would be $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and four-fifths would be nitro-gen-that is, the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ in the alveoli would be 40 mm Hg . However, some of this remaining alveolar $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is continually being absorbed into the blood, leaving about 35 mm $\mathrm{Hg} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressure in the alveoli. At the summit of Mount Everest, only the best acclimatized people can barely survive when breathing air. However, the effect is very different when the person is breathing pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, as we see in the following discussions.

Alveolar $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ at Different Altitudes. The fifth column of Table 44-1 shows the approximate $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ values in the alveoli at different altitudes when one is breathing air for both the unacclimatized and the acclimatized person. At sea level, the alveolar $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is 104 mm Hg . At 20,000 feet altitude, it falls to about 40 mm Hg in the unacclimatized person but only to 53 mm Hg in the acclimatized person. The reason for the difference between these two is that alveolar ventilation increases much more in the acclimatized person than in the unacclimatized person, as we discuss later.

Saturation of Hemoglobin With Oxygen at Different Altitudes. Figure 44-1 shows arterial blood $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation at different altitudes while a person is breathing air and while breathing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Up to an altitude of about 10,000 feet, even when air is breathed, the arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation remains at least as high as $90 \%$. Above 10,000 feet, the arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation falls rapidly, as shown by the blue curve of the figure, until it is slightly less than $70 \%$ at 20,000 feet and much less at still higher altitudes.

## EFFECT OF BREATHING PURE OXYGEN ON ALVEOLAR $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ AT DIFFERENT ALTITUDES

When a person breathes pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ instead of air, most of the space in the alveoli formerly occupied by nitrogen becomes
