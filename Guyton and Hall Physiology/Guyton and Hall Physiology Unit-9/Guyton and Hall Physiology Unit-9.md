# Aviation, High Altitude, and Space Physiology 

As humans have ascended to higher and higher altitudes in aviation, mountain climbing, and space exploration, it has become progressively more important to understand the effects of altitude and low gas pressures on the human body. This chapter deals with these problems and acceleratory forces, weightlessness, and other challenges to body homeostasis that occur at high altitudes and in space flight.

## EFFECTS OF LOW OXYGEN PRESSURE ON THE BODY

## Barometric Pressures at Different Altitudes. Table

44-1 lists the approximate barometric and oxygen pressures at different altitudes, showing that at sea level, the barometric pressure is 760 mm Hg ; at 10,000 feet, it is only 523 mm Hg ; and at 50,000 feet, it is 87 mm Hg . This decrease in barometric pressure is the basic cause of all the hypoxia problems in high-altitude physiology, because as the barometric pressure decreases, the atmospheric oxygen partial pressure $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}\right)$ decreases proportionately, remaining at all times slightly less than $21 \%$ of the total barometric pressure; at sea level, $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is about 159 mm Hg , but at 50,000 feet, $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is only 18 mm Hg .

## ALVEOLAR $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ AT DIFFERENT ELEVATIONS

## Carbon Dioxide and Water Vapor Decrease the Alveolar Oxygen. Even at high altitudes, carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ is

continually excreted from the pulmonary blood into the alveoli. In addition, water vaporizes into the inspired air from the respiratory surfaces. These two gases dilute the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the alveoli, thus reducing the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentration. Water vapor pressure in the alveoli remains at 47 mm Hg as long as the body temperature is normal, regardless of altitude.

In the case of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, during exposure to very high altitudes, the alveolar partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)$ falls from the sea level value of 40 mm Hg to lower values. In the acclimatized person, who increases ventilation about fivefold, the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ falls to about 7 mm Hg because of increased respiration.

Now let us see how the pressures of these two gases affect the alveolar $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. For example, assume that the barometric pressure falls from the normal sea level value of

760 to 253 mm Hg , which is the usual measured value at the top of 29,028 -foot Mount Everest. Of this, 47 mm Hg must be water vapor, leaving only 206 mm Hg for all the other gases. In the acclimatized person, 7 mm Hg of the 206 mm Hg must be $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, leaving only 199 mm Hg . If there were no use of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by the body, one-fifth of this 199 mm Hg would be $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and four-fifths would be nitro-gen-that is, the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ in the alveoli would be 40 mm Hg . However, some of this remaining alveolar $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is continually being absorbed into the blood, leaving about 35 mm $\mathrm{Hg} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressure in the alveoli. At the summit of Mount Everest, only the best acclimatized people can barely survive when breathing air. However, the effect is very different when the person is breathing pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, as we see in the following discussions.

Alveolar $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ at Different Altitudes. The fifth column of Table 44-1 shows the approximate $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ values in the alveoli at different altitudes when one is breathing air for both the unacclimatized and the acclimatized person. At sea level, the alveolar $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is 104 mm Hg . At 20,000 feet altitude, it falls to about 40 mm Hg in the unacclimatized person but only to 53 mm Hg in the acclimatized person. The reason for the difference between these two is that alveolar ventilation increases much more in the acclimatized person than in the unacclimatized person, as we discuss later.

Saturation of Hemoglobin With Oxygen at Different Altitudes. Figure 44-1 shows arterial blood $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation at different altitudes while a person is breathing air and while breathing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Up to an altitude of about 10,000 feet, even when air is breathed, the arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation remains at least as high as $90 \%$. Above 10,000 feet, the arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation falls rapidly, as shown by the blue curve of the figure, until it is slightly less than $70 \%$ at 20,000 feet and much less at still higher altitudes.

## EFFECT OF BREATHING PURE OXYGEN ON ALVEOLAR $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ AT DIFFERENT ALTITUDES

When a person breathes pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ instead of air, most of the space in the alveoli formerly occupied by nitrogen becomes

occupied by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. At 30,000 feet, an aviator could have an alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ as high as 139 mm Hg instead of 18 mm Hg when breathing air (see Table 44-1).

The red curve of Figure 44-1 shows arterial blood hemoglobin $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation at different altitudes when a person is breathing pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Note that the saturation remains above $90 \%$ until the aviator ascends to about 39,000 feet; then it falls rapidly to about $50 \%$ at about 47,000 feet.

The "Ceiling" When Breathing Air and When Breathing Oxygen in an Unpressurized Airplane. When comparing the two arterial blood $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation curves in Figure 44-1, one notes that an aviator breathing pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in an unpressurized airplane can ascend to far higher altitudes than one breathing air. For example, the arterial saturation at 47,000 feet when one is breathing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is about $50 \%$ and is equivalent to the arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation at 23,000 feet when one is breathing air. In addition, because an unacclimatized person usually can remain conscious until the arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation falls to $50 \%$, the ceiling for an aviator for short exposure times in an unpressurized airplane when breathing air is about 23,000 feet and,
when breathing pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, is about 47,000 feet, provided that the equipment supplying the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ operates perfectly.

## ACUTE EFFECTS OF HYPOXIA

Some of the important acute effects of hypoxia in the unacclimatized person breathing air, beginning at an altitude of about 12,000 feet, are drowsiness, lassitude, mental and muscle fatigue, sometimes headache, occasionally nausea, and sometimes euphoria. These effects progress to a stage of twitchings or seizures above 18,000 feet and, above 23,000 feet in the unacclimatized person, end in coma, followed shortly thereafter by death.

One of the most important effects of hypoxia is decreased mental proficiency, which decreases judgment, memory, and performance of discrete motor movements. For example, if an unacclimatized aviator stays at 15,000 feet for 1 hour, mental proficiency ordinarily falls to about $50 \%$ of normal and, after 18 hours at this level, it falls to about $20 \%$ of normal.

## ACCLIMATIZATION TO LOW $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$

A person remaining at high altitudes for days, weeks, or years becomes more and more acclimatized to the low $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$, so it causes fewer deleterious effects on the body. After acclimatization, it becomes possible for the person to work harder without hypoxic effects or to ascend to still higher altitudes.

The principal means whereby acclimatization comes about are as follows: (1) a great increase in pulmonary ventilation; (2) increased numbers of red blood cells; (3) increased diffusing capacity of the lungs; (4) increased vascularity of the peripheral tissues; and (5) increased ability of the tissue cells to use $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, despite low $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$.

Increased Pulmonary Ventilation-Role of Arterial Chemoreceptors. Immediate exposure to low $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and this stimulation increases alveolar ventilation to a maximum of about 1.65 times normal. Therefore, compensation occurs within seconds for the high altitude, and this alone allows the

person to rise several thousand feet higher than would be possible without the increased ventilation. If the person remains at a very high altitude for several days, the chemoreceptors increase ventilation still more, up to about five times normal.

The immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation on rising to a high altitude blows off large quantities of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, reducing the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and increasing the pH of the body fluids. These changes inhibit the brain stem respiratory center and thereby oppose the effect of low $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ to stimulate respiration via the peripheral arterial chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies. However, this inhibition fades away during the ensuing 2 to 5 days, allowing the respiratory center to respond with full force to the peripheral chemoreceptor stimulus from hypoxia, and ventilation increases to about five times normal.

The cause of this fading inhibition is believed to be mainly a reduction of bicarbonate ion concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as in the brain tissues. This reduction, in turn, decreases the pH in the fluids surrounding the chemosensitive neurons of the respiratory center, thus increasing the respiratory stimulatory activity of the center.

An important mechanism for the gradual decrease in bicarbonate concentration is compensation by the kidneys for the respiratory alkalosis, as discussed in Chapter 31. The kidneys respond to decreased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ by reducing hydrogen ion secretion and increasing bicarbonate excretion. This metabolic compensation for the respiratory alkalosis gradually reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentrations and pH toward normal and removes part of the inhibitory effect on respiration of a low hydrogen ion concentration. Thus, the respiratory centers are much more responsive to the peripheral chemoreceptor stimulus caused by the hypoxia after the kidneys compensate for the alkalosis.

Increase in Red Blood Cells and Hemoglobin Concentration During Acclimatization. As discussed in Chapter 33, hypoxia is a major stimulus for increasing red blood cell production. Ordinarily, when a person remains exposed to low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ for weeks at a time, the hematocrit rises slowly from a normal value of $40 \%$ to $45 \%$ to an average of about $60 \%$, with an average increase in whole blood hemoglobin concentration from a normal value of $15 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ to about $20 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$.

In addition, the blood volume also increases, often by $20 \%$ to $30 \%$, and this increase, multiplied by the increased blood hemoglobin concentration, gives an increase in total body hemoglobin of $50 \%$ or more.

Increased Diffusing Capacity After Acclimatization. The normal diffusing capacity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ through the pulmonary membrane is about $21 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ per minute, and this diffusing capacity can increase as much as 3 -fold during exercise. A similar increase in diffusing capacity occurs at high altitudes.

Part of the increase results from increased pulmonary capillary blood volume, which expands the capillaries and increases the surface area through which $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ can diffuse into the blood. Another part of this increase results from an increase in lung air volume, which expands the surface area of the alveolar-capillary interface still more. A final part results from an increase in pulmonary arterial blood pressure, which forces blood into greater numbers of alveolar capillaries than normal, especially in the upper parts of the lungs, which are poorly perfused under usual conditions.

Peripheral Circulatory System Changes During Acclimatization-Increased Tissue Capillarity. The cardiac output often increases as much as $30 \%$ immediately after a person ascends to a high altitude but then decreases back toward normal over a period of weeks as the blood hematocrit increases, so the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transported to the peripheral body tissues remains about normal.

Another circulatory adaptation is growth of increased numbers of systemic circulatory capillaries in the nonpulmonary tissues, called angiogenesis. This adaptation occurs especially in animals born and bred at high altitudes but less so in animals that become exposed to high altitudes later in life.

In active tissues exposed to chronic hypoxia, the increase in capillarity is especially marked. For example, capillary density in right ventricular muscle increases markedly because of the combined effects of hypoxia and excess workload on the right ventricle caused by pulmonary hypertension at high altitude.

Cellular Acclimatization. In animals native to altitudes of 13,000 to 17,000 feet, cell mitochondria and cellular oxidative enzyme systems are slightly more plentiful than in sea level inhabitants. Therefore, it is presumed that the tissue cells of high altitude-acclimatized human beings also can use $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ more effectively than can their sea level counterparts.

## HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTORS-A "MASTER SWITCH" FOR THE BODY'S RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are DNA-binding transcription factors that respond to decreased oxygen availability and activate several genes that encode proteins needed for adequate oxygen delivery to tissues and energy metabolism. HIFs are found in virtually all oxygenbreathing species, ranging from primitive worms to humans. Some of the genes controlled by HIFs, especially HIF-1, include the following:

- Genes associated with vascular endothelial growth factor, which stimulates angiogenesis
- Erythropoietin genes that stimulate red blood cell production
- Mitochondrial genes involved with energy utilization

Oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curves for blood of high-altitude residents (red curve) and sea level residents (blue curve) showing the respective arterial and venous $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ levels and oxygen contents as recorded in their native surroundings. (Data from Pan American Health Organization. Oxygen-dissociation curves for bloods of high-altitude and sea-level residents. Life at high altitudes. Washington, DC: Pan American Health Organization Scientific Publication No. 140, 1966.)

- Glycolytic enzyme genes involved with anaerobic metabolism
- Genes that increase availability of nitric oxide, which causes pulmonary vasodilation
In the presence of adequate oxygen, the subunits of HIF required to activate various genes are downregulated and inactivated by specific HIF hydroxylases. In hypoxia, the HIF hydroxylases are themselves inactive, allowing the formation of a transcriptionally active HIF complex. Thus, the HIFs serve as a "master switch" that permits the body to respond appropriately to hypoxia.


## NATURAL ACCLIMATIZATION OF NATIVE PEOPLE LIVING AT HIGH ALTITUDES

Many native people in the Andes and in the Himalayas live at altitudes above 13,000 feet. One group in the Peruvian Andes lives at an altitude of 17,500 feet and works in a mine at an altitude of 19,000 feet. Many of these natives are born at these high altitudes and live there all their lives. They are superior to even the best-acclimatized lowlanders in all aspects of acclimatization, even though the lowlanders might have lived at high altitudes for 10 or more years. Acclimatization of the natives begins in infancy. The chest size, especially, is greatly increased, whereas the body size is somewhat decreased, giving a high ratio of ventilatory capacity to body mass. The hearts of natives, which from birth onward pump extra amounts of cardiac output, are also considerably larger than the hearts of lowlanders.

Delivery of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by the blood to the tissues is also highly facilitated in these natives. For example, Figure 44-2 shows $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-hemoglobin dissociation curves for natives who live at sea level and for their counterparts who live at 15,000 feet. Note that the arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the natives

Table 44-2 Differences in Work Capacities

|  | Work Capacity <br> (\% of Normal) |
| :-- | :--: |
| Unacclimatized | 50 |
| Acclimatized for 2 months | 68 |
| Native living at 13,200 feet but <br> working at 17,000 feet | 87 |

at a high altitude is only 40 mm Hg but, because of the greater quantity of hemoglobin, the quantity of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in their arterial blood is greater than that in the blood of the natives at the lower altitude. Note also that the venous $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the high-altitude natives is only 15 mm Hg less than the venous $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ for the lowlanders, despite the very low arterial $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$, indicating that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport to the tissues is exceedingly effective in the naturally acclimatized high-altitude natives.

## REDUCED WORK CAPACITY AT HIGH ALTITUDES AND POSITIVE EFFECT OF ACCLIMATIZATION

In addition to the mental depression caused by hypoxia, the work capacity of all muscles, cardiac as well as skeletal muscle, is greatly decreased in a state of hypoxia. In general, work capacity is reduced in direct proportion to the decrease in maximum rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake that the body can achieve.

To give an idea of the importance of acclimatization in increasing work capacity, consider the large differences in work capacities as a percentage of normal for unacclimatized and acclimatized people at an altitude of 17,000 feet, shown in Table 44-2. Thus, naturally acclimatized native persons can achieve a daily work output even at a high altitude almost equal to that of a lowlander at sea level, but even well-acclimatized lowlanders can almost never achieve this result.

## ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS AND HIGHALTITUDE PULMONARY EDEMA

A small percentage of people who ascend rapidly to high altitudes become acutely sick and can die if not given $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or rapidly moved to a low altitude. The sickness begins from a few hours up to about 2 days after ascent. Two events frequently occur:

1. Acute cerebral edema. This edema is believed to result from local vasodilation of the cerebral blood vessels, which is caused by the hypoxia. Dilation of the arterioles increases blood flow into the capillaries, thus increasing capillary pressure, which in turn causes fluid to leak into the cerebral tissues. Chemical factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and inflammatory cytokines may also contribute to edema by increasing endothelial cell permeability. The cerebral edema can then lead to severe disorientation and other effects related to cerebral dysfunction.

2. Acute pulmonary edema. The cause of acute pulmonary edema is still uncertain, but may be explained by the following. The severe hypoxia causes the pulmonary arterioles to constrict powerfully, but the constriction is much greater in some parts of the lungs than in other parts, so more and more of the pulmonary blood flow is forced through fewer and fewer still unconstricted pulmonary vessels. The postulated result is that the capillary pressure in these areas of the lungs becomes especially high, and local edema occurs. Extension of the process to progressively more areas of the lungs leads to spreading pulmonary edema and severe pulmonary dysfunction that can be lethal. Allowing the person to breathe $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ usually reverses the process within hours. The same chemical factors that have been suggested to increase capillary permeability in the brain may also contribute to increased pulmonary capillary permeability and edema in the lungs.

## CHRONIC MOUNTAIN SICKNESS

Occasionally, a person who remains at a high altitude too long experiences chronic mountain sickness, in which the following effects occur:

1. The red blood cell mass and hematocrit become exceptionally high.
2. The pulmonary arterial pressure becomes elevated even more than the normal elevation that occurs during acclimatization.
3. The right side of the heart becomes greatly enlarged.
4. The peripheral arterial pressure begins to fall.
5. Congestive heart failure ensues.
6. Death often follows unless the person is moved to a lower altitude.
There are probably three main causes of this sequence of events:
7. The red blood cell mass becomes so great that the blood viscosity increases severalfold. This increased viscosity tends to decrease tissue blood flow so that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery also begins to decrease.
8. The pulmonary arterioles become vasoconstricted because of the lung hypoxia. This vasoconstriction results from the hypoxic vascular constrictor effect that normally operates to divert blood flow from low $-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to high $-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ alveoli, as explained in Chapter 39. However, because all the alveoli are now in the low $-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ state, all the arterioles become constricted, the pulmonary arterial pressure rises excessively, and the right side of the heart fails.
9. The alveolar arteriolar spasm diverts much of the blood flow through nonalveolar pulmonary vessels, thus causing an excess of pulmonary shunt blood flow where the blood is poorly oxygenated, which further compounds the problem. Most people with this condition recover within days or weeks when they are moved to a lower altitude.

## Effects of Acceleratory Forces on the Body in Aviation and Space Physiology

Because of rapid changes in velocity and direction of motion in airplanes or spacecraft, several types of acceleratory forces affect the body during flight. At the beginning of flight, simple linear acceleration occurs, at the end of flight, deceleration occurs, and every time the vehicle turns, centrifugal acceleration occurs.

## Centrifugal Acceleratory Forces

When an airplane makes a turn, the force of centrifugal acceleration is determined by the following relationship:

$$
f=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}
$$

in which $f$ is centrifugal acceleratory force, $m$ is the mass of the object, $v$ is velocity of travel, and $r$ is the radius of curvature of the turn. From this formula, it is obvious that as the velocity increases, the force of centrifugal acceleration increases in proportion to the square of the velocity. It is also obvious that the force of acceleration is directly proportional to the sharpness of the turn (the less the radius).

Measurement of Acceleratory Force-"G." When an aviator is simply sitting in his seat, the force with which he or she is pressing against the seat results from the pull of gravity and is equal to the person's weight. The intensity of this force is said to be +1 G because it is equal to the pull of gravity. If the force with which the person presses against the seat becomes five times the normal weight during pull-out from a dive, the force acting on the seat is +5 G .

If the airplane goes through an outside loop so that the person is held down by the seat belt, negative $G$ is applied to the body. If the force with which the person is held down by the seat belt is equal to the weight of the body, the negative force is -1 G .

## Effects of Centrifugal Acceleratory Force on the Body (Positive G)

Effects on the Circulatory System. The most important effect of centrifugal acceleration is on the circulatory system because blood is mobile and can be translocated by centrifugal forces.

When an aviator is subjected to positive $G$, blood is centrifuged toward the lowermost part of the body. Thus, if the centrifugal acceleratory force is +5 G and the person is in an immobilized standing position, the pressure in the veins of the feet becomes greatly increased (to $\approx 450 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ). In the sitting position, the pressure becomes nearly 300 mm Hg . In addition, as pressure in the vessels of the lower body increases, these vessels passively dilate so that a major portion of the blood from the upper body is translocated into the lower vessels. Because the heart cannot pump unless blood returns to it, the greater the quantity of blood "pooled" in this way in the lower body, the less is available for the cardiac output.

Figure 44-3 shows the changes in systolic and diastolic arterial pressures (top and bottom curves, respectively) in the upper body when a centrifugal acceleratory force of +3.3 G is suddenly applied to a sitting person. Note that both these pressures fall below 22 mm Hg for the first few seconds after the acceleration begins but then return to a

![gu0301920862](gu0301920862.jpg)

Figure 44-3. Changes in systolic (top of curve) and diastolic (bottom of curve) arterial pressures after abrupt and continuing exposure of a sitting person to an acceleratory force from top to bottom of 3.3 G. (Data from Martin EE, Henry JP: Effects of time and temperature upon tolerance to positive acceleration. J Aviation Med 22:382, 1951.)
systolic pressure of about 55 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of 20 mm Hg within another 10 to 15 seconds. This secondary recovery is caused mainly by activation of the baroreceptor reflexes.

Acceleration greater than 4 to 6 G causes "blackout" of vision within a few seconds and unconsciousness shortly thereafter. If this great degree of acceleration is continued, the person will die.

Effects on the Vertebrae. Extremely high acceleratory forces for even a fraction of a second can fracture the vertebrae. The degree of positive acceleration that the average person can withstand in the sitting position before vertebral fracture occurs is about 20 G .

Negative G. The effects of negative $G$ on the body are less dramatic acutely but possibly more damaging permanently than the effects of positive G. An aviator can usually go through outside loops up to negative acceleratory forces of -4 to -5 G without causing permanent harm, although causing intense momentary hyperemia of the head. Occasionally, psychotic disturbances lasting for 15 to 20 minutes occur as a result of brain edema.

Occasionally, negative $G$ forces can be so great (e.g., -20 G ), and centrifugation of the blood into the head is so great, that the cerebral blood pressure reaches 300 to 400 mm Hg , sometimes causing small vessels on the surface of the head and in the brain to rupture. However, the vessels inside the cranium show less tendency for rupture than would be expected for the following reason. The cerebrospinal fluid is centrifuged toward the head at the same time that blood is centrifuged toward the cranial vessels, and the greatly increased pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid acts as a cushioning buffer on the outside of the brain to prevent intracerebral vascular rupture.

Because the eyes are not protected by the cranium, intense hyperemia occurs in them during strong negative $G$. As a result, the eyes often become temporarily blinded with what is called redout.

Protection of the Body Against Centrifugal Acceleratory Forces. Specific procedures and apparatus have been developed to protect aviators against the circulatory collapse that might occur during positive G. First, if the aviator tightens his or her abdominal muscles to an extreme degree and leans forward to compress the abdomen, some of the pooling of blood in the large vessels of the abdomen can be prevented, delaying the onset of blackout. Also, special
![gu0401920862](gu0401920862.jpg)

Figure 44-4. Acceleratory forces during takeoff of a spacecraft.
"anti-G" suits have been developed to prevent pooling of blood in the lower abdomen and legs. The simplest of these applies positive pressure to the legs and abdomen by inflating compression bags as the G force increases.

Theoretically, a pilot submerged in a tank or suit of water might experience little effect of $G$ forces on the circulation because the pressures developed in the water pressing on the outside of the body during centrifugal acceleration would almost exactly balance the forces acting in the body. However, the presence of air in the lungs still allows for displacement of the heart, lung tissues, and diaphragm into seriously abnormal positions despite submersion in water. Therefore, even if this procedure were used, the limit of safety almost certainly would still be less than 10 G .

## Effects of Linear Acceleratory Forces on the Body

Acceleratory Forces in Space Travel. Unlike an airplane, a spacecraft cannot make rapid turns, and therefore centrifugal acceleration is of little importance except when the spacecraft goes into abnormal gyrations. However, blast-off acceleration and landing deceleration can be tremendous; both are types of linear acceleration, with one being positive and the other negative.

Figure 44-4 shows an approximate profile of acceleration during blastoff in a three-stage spacecraft, demonstrating that the first-stage booster causes acceleration as high as 9 G and the second-stage booster as high as 8 G . In the standing position, the human body could not withstand this much acceleration, but in a semireclining position transverse to the axis of acceleration, this amount of acceleration can be withstood easily, despite the fact that the acceleratory forces continue for as long as several minutes at a time. Therefore, the reason for the reclining seats used by astronauts can be understood.

Problems also occur during deceleration when the spacecraft re-enters the atmosphere. A person traveling at Mach 1 (the speed of sound and of fast airplanes) can be safely decelerated in a distance of about 0.12 mile, whereas a person traveling at a speed of Mach 100 (a speed possible in interplanetary space travel) would require a distance of about 10,000 miles for safe deceleration. The principal reason for this difference is that the total amount of energy that must be dispelled during deceleration is proportional

to the square of the velocity, which alone increases the required distance for decelerations between Mach 1 versus Mach 100 by about 10,000-fold. Therefore, deceleration must be accomplished much more slowly from a high velocity than from a lower velocity.

Deceleratory Forces Associated With Parachute Jumps.
When the parachuting aviator leaves the airplane, the velocity of fall is at first exactly 0 feet $/ \mathrm{sec}$. However, because of the acceleratory force of gravity, within 1 second the velocity of fall is $32 \mathrm{feet} / \mathrm{sec}$ (if there is no air resistance), in 2 seconds it is $64 \mathrm{feet} / \mathrm{sec}$, and so on. As the velocity of fall increases, the air resistance tending to slow the fall also increases. Finally, the deceleratory force of the air resistance exactly balances the acceleratory force of gravity, so after falling for about 12 seconds, the person will be falling at a terminal velocity of 109 to 119 miles/ hour ( $175 \mathrm{feet} / \mathrm{sec}$ ). If the parachutist has already reached terminal velocity before opening the parachute, an "opening shock load" of up to 1200 pounds could occur on the parachute shrouds.

The usual-sized parachute slows the fall of the parachutist to about one ninth the terminal velocity. In other words, the speed of landing is about $20 \mathrm{feet} / \mathrm{sec}$, and the force of impact against the earth is $1 / 81$, the impact force without a parachute. Even so, the force of impact is still great enough to cause considerable damage to the body unless the parachutist is properly trained in landing. Actually, the force of impact with the earth is about the same as that which would be experienced by jumping without a parachute from a height of about 6 feet. Unless forewarned, the parachutist will be tricked by her or his senses into striking the earth with extended legs, and this position, on landing, will result in tremendous deceleratory forces along the skeletal axis of the body, resulting in fracture of his pelvis, vertebrae, or leg. Consequently, the trained parachutist strikes the earth with knees bent but muscles taut to cushion the shock of landing.

## "Artificial Climate" in the Sealed Spacecraft

Because there is no atmosphere in outer space, an artificial atmosphere and climate must be produced in a spacecraft. Most importantly, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentration must remain high enough and the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration low enough to prevent suffocation. In some earlier space missions, a capsule atmosphere containing pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at about 260 mm Hg pressure was used but, in modern space travel, gases about equal to those in normal air are used, with four times as much nitrogen as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and a total pressure of 760 mm Hg . The presence of nitrogen in the mixture greatly diminishes the likelihood of fire and explosion. It also protects against development of local patches of lung atelectasis that often occur when breathing pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ because $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is absorbed rapidly when small bronchi are temporarily blocked by mucous plugs.

For space travel lasting more than several months, it is impractical to carry along an adequate $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ supply. For this reason, recycling techniques have been proposed to use the same $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ over and over again. Some recycling processes depend on purely physical procedures, such as electrolysis of water to release $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Others depend on biological methods, such as use of algae with their large store of chlorophyll to release $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by the process of photosynthesis. A completely satisfactory system for recycling has yet to be achieved.

## Weightlessness (Microgravity) in Space

A person in an orbiting satellite or a nonpropelled spacecraft experiences weightlessness, or a state of nearzero G force, sometimes called microgravity. That is, the person is not drawn toward the bottom, sides, or top of the spacecraft but simply floats inside its chambers. The cause of this weightlessness is not failure of gravity to pull on the body because gravity from any nearby heavenly body is still active. However, the gravity acts on the spacecraft and the person at the same time so that both are pulled with exactly the same acceleratory forces and in the same direction. For this reason, the person simply is not attracted toward any specific wall of the spacecraft.

Physiological Challenges of Weightlessness (Microgravity). The physiological challenges of weightlessness have not proved to be of much significance as long as the period of weightlessness is not too long. Most of the problems that do occur are related to three effects of the weightlessness: (1) motion sickness during the first few days of travel; (2) translocation of fluids within the body because of failure of gravity to cause normal hydrostatic pressures; and (3) diminished physical activity because no strength of muscle contraction is required to oppose the force of gravity.

Almost $50 \%$ of astronauts experience motion sickness, with nausea and sometimes vomiting, during the first 2 to 5 days of space travel. This motion sickness probably results from an unfamiliar pattern of motion signals arriving in the equilibrium centers of the brain and, at the same time, lack of gravitational signals.

The observed effects of a prolonged stay in space are the following: (1) decrease in blood volume; (2) decrease in red blood cell mass; (3) decrease in muscle strength and work capacity; (4) decrease in maximum cardiac output; and (5) loss of calcium and phosphate from the bones, as well as loss of bone mass. Most of these same effects also occur in people who lie in bed for an extended period. For this reason, exercise programs are carried out by astronauts during prolonged space missions.

In previous space laboratory expeditions, in which the exercise program was less vigorous, the astronauts had severely decreased work capacities for the first few days after returning to Earth. They also tended to faint (and still do, to some extent) when they stood up during the first day or so after return to gravity because of diminished blood volume and diminished responses of the arterial pressure control mechanisms.

Cardiovascular, Muscle, and Bone "Deconditioning" During Prolonged Exposure to Weightlessness. During very long space flights and prolonged exposure to microgravity, gradual "deconditioning" effects occur on the cardiovascular system, skeletal muscles, and bone, despite rigorous exercise during the flight. Studies of astronauts on space flights lasting several months have shown that they may lose as much $1.0 \%$ of their bone mass each month, even though they continue to exercise. Substantial atrophy of cardiac and skeletal muscles also occurs during prolonged exposure to a microgravity environment.

One of the most serious effects is cardiovascular "deconditioning," which includes decreased work capacity, reduced blood volume, impaired baroreceptor reflexes, and reduced orthostatic tolerance. These changes greatly limit the astronaut's ability to stand upright or perform normal daily activities after returning to the full gravitational force of Earth.

Astronauts returning from space flights lasting 4 to 6 months are also susceptible to bone fractures and may require several weeks before they return to preflight cardiovascular, bone, and muscle fitness. As space flights become longer in preparation for possible human exploration of other planets, such as Mars, the effects of prolonged microgravity could pose a very serious threat to astronauts after they land, especially in the event of an emergency landing. Therefore, considerable research effort has been directed toward developing countermeasures, in addition to exercise, that can prevent or more effectively attenuate these changes. One such countermeasure that is being tested is the application of intermittent "artificial gravity" caused by short periods (e.g., 1 hour each day) of centrifugal acceleration of the astronauts while they sit in specially designed short-arm centrifuges that create forces of up to 2 to 3 G .

# Physiology of Deep-Sea Diving and Other Hyperbaric Conditions 

When people descend beneath the sea, the pressure around them increases progressively as they go to greater depths. To keep the lungs from collapsing, air must be supplied at very high pressure to keep them inflated. This maneuver exposes the blood in the lungs to extremely high alveolar gas pressures, a condition called hyperbarism. Beyond certain limits, these high pressures cause major alterations in body physiology and can be lethal.

Relationship of Pressure to Sea Depth. A column of seawater 33 feet ( 10.1 meters) deep exerts the same pressure at its bottom as the pressure of the atmosphere above the sea. Therefore, a person 33 feet beneath the ocean surface is exposed to 2 atmospheres ( 2 atm ) pressure, with 1 atm of pressure caused by the weight of the air above the water and the second atmosphere caused by the weight of the water. At 66 feet, the pressure is 3 atm , and so forth, in accord with the table in Figure 45-1.

## Effect of Sea Depth on the Volume of Gases-Boyle's

Law. Another important effect of depth is the compression of gases to smaller and smaller volumes. The illustration in Figure 45-1 shows a bell jar at sea level containing 1 liter of air. At 33 feet beneath the sea, where the pressure is 2 atm , the volume has been compressed to only a halfliter, and at 8 atm ( 233 feet) it has been compressed to oneeighth liter. Thus, the volume to which a given quantity of gas is compressed is inversely proportional to the pressure. This principle of physics is called Boyle's law, and it is extremely important in diving physiology because increased pressure can collapse the air chambers of the diver's body, especially the lungs, and may cause serious damage.

Often in this chapter it is necessary to refer to actual volume versus sea level volume. For example, we might speak of an actual volume of 1 liter at a depth of 300 feet; this is the same quantity of air as a sea level volume of 10 liters.

## EFFECT OF HIGH PARTIAL PRESSURES OF INDIVIDUAL GASES ON THE BODY

The individual gases to which a diver is exposed when breathing air are nitrogen, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$; each of these, at times, can cause significant physiological effects at high pressures.

## NITROGEN NARCOSIS AT HIGH NITROGEN PRESSURES

About four-fifths of the air is nitrogen. At sea level pressure, the nitrogen has no significant effect on bodily function, but at high pressures, it can cause varying degrees of narcosis. When the diver remains beneath the sea for 1 hour or more and is breathing compressed air, the depth at which the first symptoms of mild narcosis appear is about 120 feet. At this level, the diver begins to exhibit joviality and loss of many of his or her cares. At 150 to 200 feet, the diver becomes drowsy. At 200 to 250 feet, the person's strength wanes considerably, and the diver often becomes too clumsy to perform the work required. Beyond 250 feet ( 8.5 atm pressure), the diver usually becomes almost useless as a result of nitrogen narcosis if he or she remains at these depths too long.

Nitrogen narcosis has characteristics similar to those of alcohol intoxication, and for this reason it has frequently been called "raptures of the depths." The mechanism of this narcotic effect is believed to be the same as that of most other gas anesthetics. That is, it dissolves in the fatty substances in neuronal membranes and, because of its physical effect on altering ionic conductance through the membranes, it reduces neuronal excitability. Ascent to a shallower depth reverses the narcosis within a few minutes, with no known long-term effects if the ascent is not too rapid.

## OXYGEN TOXICITY AT HIGH PRESSURES

## Effect of Very High $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ on Blood Oxygen Transport.

When the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the blood rises above 100 mm Hg , the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissolved in the water of the blood increases markedly. This effect is shown in Figure 45-2, which depicts the same $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-hemoglobin dissociation curve as that shown in Chapter 41 but with the alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ extended to more than 3000 mm Hg . Also depicted by the lowest curve in the figure is the volume of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissolved in the fluid of the blood at each $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ level. Note that in the normal range of alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}(<120 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$, almost none of the total $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the blood is accounted for by dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, but as the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressure rises into the thousands of mm Hg , a large portion of the total $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is then dissolved in the water of the blood, in addition to that bound with hemoglobin.

![gu0501920862](gu0501920862.jpg)

Figure 45-1. Effect of sea depth on pressure (top) and on gas volume (bottom).
![gu0601920862](gu0601920862.jpg)

Figure 45-2. Quantity of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissolved in the fluid of the blood and in combination with hemoglobin at very high $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ values.

Effect of High Alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ on Tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$. Let us assume that the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the lungs is about 3000 mm Hg ( 4 atm pressure). Referring to Figure 45-2, one finds that this pressure represents a total $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content in each 100 ml of blood of about 29 volumes percent, as demonstrated by point A in the figure, which means 20 volumes percent bound with hemoglobin and 9 volumes percent dissolved in the blood water. As this blood passes through the tissue capillaries, and the tissues use their normal amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, about 5 ml from each 100 ml of blood, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content on leaving the tissue capillaries is still 24 volumes percent (point B in the figure). At this point, the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ is approximately 1200 mm Hg , which means that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is delivered to the tissues at this extremely high pressure instead of at the normal value of 40 mm Hg . Thus, once the alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ rises above a critical level, the hemoglobin- $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ buffer mechanism (discussed in Chapter 41) is no longer capable of keeping the tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ in the normal safe range, between 20 and 60 mm Hg .

Acute Oxygen Poisoning. The extremely high tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ that occurs when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is breathed at a very high alveolar $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressure can be detrimental to many of the body's tissues. For example, breathing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at 4 atm pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}=\right.$ 3040 mm Hg ) will cause brain seizures followed by coma in most people within 30 to 60 minutes. The seizures often occur without warning and, for obvious reasons, are likely to be lethal to divers submerged beneath the sea.

Other symptoms encountered in acute $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ poisoning include nausea, muscle twitchings, dizziness, disturbances of vision, irritability, and disorientation. Exercise greatly increases the diver's susceptibility to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ toxicity, causing symptoms to appear much earlier and with far greater severity than in the resting person.

Excessive Intracellular Oxidation as a Cause of Nervous System Oxygen Toxicity—Oxidizing Free Radicals. Molecular $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ has little capability of oxidizing other chemical compounds. Instead, it must first be converted into an active form of oxygen. There are several forms of active oxygen, called oxygen free radicals. One of the most important of these is the superoxide free radical $\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$, and another is the peroxide radical in the form of hydrogen peroxide. Even when the tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ is normal at the level of 40 mm Hg , small amounts of free radicals are continually being formed from the dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Fortunately, the tissues also contain several enzymes that rapidly remove these free radicals, including peroxidases, catalases, and superoxide dismutases. Therefore, as long as the hemo-globin- $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ buffering mechanism maintains a normal tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$, the oxidizing free radicals are removed rapidly enough that they have little or no effect in the tissues.

Above a critical alveolar $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ (i.e., $>\approx 2 \mathrm{~atm} \mathrm{Po}_{2}$ ), the hemoglobin- $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ buffering mechanism fails, and the tissue $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ can then rise to hundreds or thousands of mm Hg . At these high levels, the amounts of oxidizing free radicals literally swamp the enzyme systems designed to remove them, and now they can have serious destructive and even

lethal effects on the cells. One of the principal effects is to oxidize the polyunsaturated fatty acids that are essential components of many of the cell membranes. Another effect is to oxidize some of the cellular enzymes, thus damaging the cellular metabolic systems severely. The nervous tissues are especially susceptible because of their high lipid content. Therefore, most of the acute lethal effects of acute $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ toxicity are caused by brain dysfunction.

Chronic Oxygen Poisoning Causes Pulmonary Disability. A person can be exposed to only 1 atm pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ almost indefinitely without developing the acute oxygen toxicity of the nervous system just described. However, after only about 12 hours of $1 \mathrm{~atm} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ exposure, lung passageway congestion, pulmonary edema, and atelectasis caused by damage to the linings of the bronchi and alveoli begin to develop. The reason for this effect in the lungs but not in other tissues is that the air spaces of the lungs are directly exposed to the high $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressure, but $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is delivered to the other body tissues at almost normal $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ because of the hemoglobin- $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ buffer system.

## CARBON DIOXIDE TOXICITY AT GREAT DEPTHS IN THE SEA

If the diving gear is properly designed and functions properly, the diver has no problem due to toxicity because depth alone does not increase the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ partial pressure in the alveoli. This is true because depth does not increase the rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production in the body, and as long as the diver continues to breathe a normal tidal volume and expires the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as it is formed, alveolar $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ pressure will be maintained at a normal value.

In certain types of diving gear, however, such as the diving helmet and some types of rebreathing apparatuses, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can build up in the dead space air of the apparatus and be rebreathed by the diver. Up to an alveolar $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ pressure $\left(\mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)$ of about 80 mm Hg , twice that in normal alveoli, the diver usually tolerates this buildup by increasing the minute respiratory volume a maximum of 8 - to 11 -fold to compensate for the increased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Beyond 80 mm Hg alveolar $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, however, the situation becomes intolerable, and eventually the respiratory center begins to be depressed, rather than excited, because of the negative tissue metabolic effects of high $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$. The diver's respiration then begins to fail rather than compensate. In addition, the diver experiences severe respiratory acidosis and varying degrees of lethargy, narcosis, and finally even anesthesia, as discussed in Chapter 43.

## DECOMPRESSION OF THE DIVER AFTER EXCESS EXPOSURE TO HIGH PRESSURE

When a person breathes air under high pressure for a long time, the amount of nitrogen dissolved in the body fluids increases. This is because blood flowing through the pulmonary capillaries becomes saturated with nitrogen to the
same high pressure as that in the alveolar breathing mixture, and over several more hours, enough nitrogen is carried to all the tissues of the body to raise their tissue nitrogen partial pressure to equal the nitrogen pressure in the breathing air.

Because nitrogen is not metabolized by the body, it remains dissolved in all the body tissues until the nitrogen pressure in the lungs is decreased back to some lower level, at which time the nitrogen can be removed by the reverse respiratory process. However, this removal often takes hours to occur and is the source of multiple problems, collectively called decompression sickness.

Volume of Nitrogen Dissolved in the Body Fluids at Different Depths. At sea level, almost exactly 1 liter of nitrogen is dissolved in the entire body. Slightly less than one-half of this nitrogen is dissolved in the water of the body, and a little more than one-half is dissolved in the fat of the body, because nitrogen is five times as soluble in fat as in water.

After the diver has become saturated with nitrogen, the sea level volume of nitrogen dissolved in the body at different depths is as follows:

| Feet | Liters |
| :-- | :-- |
| 0 | 1 |
| 33 | 2 |
| 100 | 4 |
| 200 | 7 |
| 300 | 10 |

Several hours are required for the gas pressures of nitrogen in all the body tissues to come nearly to equilibrium with the gas pressure of nitrogen in the alveoli. The reason for this requirement is that the blood does not flow rapidly enough, and the nitrogen does not diffuse rapidly enough, to cause instantaneous equilibrium. The nitrogen dissolved in the water of the body comes to almost complete equilibrium in less than 1 hour, but the fat tissue, which requires five times as much transport of nitrogen and has a relatively poor blood supply, reaches equilibrium only after several hours. Thus, if a person remains under water at a deep level for only a few minutes, not much nitrogen dissolves in the body fluids and tissues, whereas if the person remains at a deep level for several hours, both the body water and body fat become saturated with nitrogen.

Decompression Sickness (Also Known as Bends, Compressed Air Sickness, Caisson Disease, Diver's Paralysis, Dysbarism). If a diver has been beneath the sea long enough that large amounts of nitrogen have dissolved in the body, and the diver then suddenly comes back to the surface of the sea, significant quantities of nitrogen bubbles can develop in the body fluids, either intracellularly or extracellularly, and can cause minor or serious damage in almost any area of the body, depending on the number

![gu0701920862](gu0701920862.jpg)

Figure 45-3. Gaseous pressures inside and outside the body showing (A) saturation of the body to high gas pressures when breathing air at a total pressure of 5000 mm Hg and (B) the great excesses of intrabody pressures responsible for bubble formation in the tissues when the lung intra-alveolar pressure body is suddenly returned from 5000 mm Hg to the normal pressure of 760 mm Hg .
and sizes of bubbles formed. This phenomenon is called decompression sickness.

The principles underlying bubble formation are shown in Figure 45-3. In Figure 45-3A, the diver's tissues have become equilibrated to a high dissolved nitrogen pressure $\left(\mathrm{PN}_{2}=3918 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\right)$, about 6.5 times the normal amount of nitrogen in the tissues. As long as the diver remains deep beneath the sea, the pressure against the outside of the body ( 5000 mm Hg ) compresses all the body tissues sufficiently to keep the excess nitrogen gas dissolved. However, when the diver suddenly rises to sea level (Figure 45-3B), the pressure on the outside of the body becomes only 1 $\mathrm{atm}(760 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$, while the gas pressure inside the body fluids is the sum of the pressures of water vapor, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and nitrogen, or a total of $4065 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, 97 \%$ of which is caused by the nitrogen. Obviously, this total value of 4065 mm Hg is far greater than the $760-\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ pressure on the outside of the body. Therefore, the gases can escape from the dissolved state and form bubbles, composed almost entirely of nitrogen, both in the tissues and in the blood, where they plug many small blood vessels. The bubbles may not appear for many minutes to hours because sometimes the gases can remain dissolved in the "supersaturated" state for hours before bubbling.

Symptoms of Decompression Sickness ("Bends"). The symptoms of decompression sickness are caused by gas bubbles blocking many blood vessels in different tissues. At first, only the smallest vessels are blocked by minute bubbles, but as the bubbles coalesce, progressively larger
vessels are affected. Tissue ischemia and sometimes tissue death result.

In most people with decompression sickness, the symptoms are pain in the joints and muscles of the legs and arms, affecting $85 \%$ to $90 \%$ of persons who experience decompression sickness. The joint pain accounts for the term "bends" that is often applied to this condition.

In $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of people with decompression sickness, nervous system symptoms occur, ranging from dizziness in about $5 \%$ to paralysis or collapse and unconsciousness in as many as $3 \%$. The paralysis may be temporary, but in some cases, damage is permanent.

Finally, about 2\% of people with decompression sickness experience "the chokes," caused by massive numbers of microbubbles plugging the capillaries of the lungs. This condition is characterized by serious shortness of breath, often followed by severe pulmonary edema and, occasionally, death.

## Nitrogen Elimination From the Body; Decompression

Tables. If a diver is brought to the surface slowly, enough of the dissolved nitrogen can usually be eliminated by expiration through the lungs to prevent decompression sickness. About two-thirds of the total nitrogen is liberated in 1 hour, and about $90 \%$ is liberated in 6 hours.

Tables that detail procedures for safe decompression have been prepared by the US Navy. To give the reader an idea of the decompression process, a diver who has been breathing air and has been on the sea bottom for 60 minutes at a depth of 190 feet undergoes decompression according to the following schedule:

- 10 minutes at 50 -feet depth
- 17 minutes at 40 -feet depth
- 19 minutes at 30 -feet depth
- 50 minutes at 20 -feet depth
- 84 minutes at 10 -feet depth

Thus, for a work period on the sea bottom of only 1 hour, the total time for decompression is about 3 hours.

Tank Decompression and Treatment of Decompression Sickness. Another procedure widely used for decompression of professional divers is to put the diver into a pressurized tank and then gradually lower the pressure back to normal atmospheric pressure, using essentially the same time schedule as noted earlier.

Tank decompression is even more important for treating people in whom symptoms of decompression sickness develop minutes or even hours after they have returned to the surface. In this case, the diver undergoes recompression immediately to a deep level, and then decompression is carried out over a period several times as long as the usual decompression period.
"Saturation Diving" and Use of Helium-Oxygen Mixtures in Deep Dives. When divers must work at very deep levels-between 250 feet and nearly 1000 feet-they frequently live in a large compression tank for days or weeks at a time, remaining compressed at a pressure level near that at which they will be working. This procedure keeps

the tissues and fluids of the body saturated with the gases to which they will be exposed while diving. Then, when they return to the same tank after working, there are no significant changes in pressure, so decompression bubbles do not occur.

In very deep dives, especially during saturation diving, helium is usually used in the gas mixture instead of nitrogen for three reasons: (1) it has only about one-fifth the narcotic effect of nitrogen; (2) only about one-half as much volume of helium dissolves in the body tissues as nitrogen, and the volume that does dissolve diffuses out of the tissues during decompression several times as rapidly as does nitrogen, thus reducing the problem of decompression sickness; and (3) the low density of helium (one-seventh the density of nitrogen) keeps the airway resistance for breathing at a minimum, which is very important because highly compressed nitrogen is so dense that airway resistance can become extreme, sometimes making the work of breathing beyond endurance.

Finally, in very deep dives, it is important to reduce the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentration in the gaseous mixture because otherwise $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ toxicity would result. For example, at a depth of 700 feet ( 22 atm pressure), a $1 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ mixture will provide all the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ required by the diver, whereas a $21 \%$ mixture of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (the percentage in air) delivers a $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ to the lungs of more than 4 atm , a level very likely to cause seizures in as little as 30 minutes.

## SELF-CONTAINED UNDERWATER BREATHING APPARATUS (SCUBA) DIVING

Before the 1940s, almost all diving was done using a diving helmet connected to a hose through which air was pumped to the diver from the surface. Then, in 1943, the French explorer Jacques Cousteau popularized a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, known as SCUBA. The type of SCUBA used in more than $99 \%$ of all sports and commercial diving is the open-circuit demand system shown in Figure 45-4. This system consists of the following components: (1) one or more tanks of compressed air or some other breathing mixture; (2) a first-stage "reducing" valve for reducing the very high pressure from the tanks to a low pressure level; (3) a combination inhalation "demand" valve and exhalation valve that allows air to be pulled into the lungs with slight negative pressure of breathing and then to be exhaled into the sea at a pressure level slightly positive to the surrounding water pressure; and (4) a mask and tube system with small "dead space."

The demand system operates as follows. The first-stage reducing valve reduces the pressure from the tanks so that the air delivered to the mask has a pressure only a few mm Hg greater than the surrounding water pressure. The breathing mixture does not flow continually into the mask. Instead, with each inspiration, slight extra negative pressure in the demand valve of the mask pulls the diaphragm of the valve open, and this action automatically releases air from the tank into the mask and lungs. In this way, only the amount of air needed for inhalation enters
![gu0801920862](gu0801920862.jpg)

the mask. Then, on expiration, the air cannot go back into the tank but, instead, is expired into the water.

The most important problem with SCUBA is the limited amount of time a diver can remain beneath the water surface; For example, only a few minutes are possible at a 200 -foot depth. The reason for this limitation is that tremendous airflow from the tanks is required to wash $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ out of the lungs-the greater the depth, the greater the airflow in terms of quantity of air per minute required because the volumes have been compressed to small sizes.

## Special Physiological Problems in Submarines

Escape From Submarines. Essentially the same problems encountered in deep sea diving are often found in relation to submarines, especially when it is necessary to escape from a submerged submarine. Escape is possible from as deep as 300 feet without use of any apparatus. However, proper use of rebreathing devices, especially when using helium, can theoretically allow escape from as deep as 600 feet or perhaps more.

One of the major problems of escape is prevention of air embolism. As the person ascends, the gases in the lungs expand and sometimes rupture a pulmonary blood vessel, forcing the gases to enter the vessel and cause air embolism of the circulation. Therefore, as the person ascends, he or she must make a special effort to exhale continually.

Health Problems in the Submarine Internal Environment. Except for escape, submarine medicine generally centers on several engineering problems to keep hazards out of the internal environment. First, in atomic subma-

rines, there is the problem of radiation hazards, but with appropriate shielding, the amount of radiation received by the crew submerged beneath the sea has been less than the normal amount of radiation received above the surface of the sea from cosmic rays.

Second, poisonous gases, on occasion, escape into the atmosphere of the submarine and must be controlled rapidly. For example, during several weeks' submergence, cigarette smoking by the crew can liberate enough carbon monoxide, if not removed rapidly, to cause carbon monoxide poisoning. On occasion, even Freon gas has been found to diffuse out of refrigeration systems in sufficient quantity to cause toxicity.

## Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy

The intense oxidizing properties of high-pressure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (hyperbaric oxygen) can have valuable therapeutic effects in several important clinical conditions. Therefore, large pressure tanks are now available in many medical centers into which patients can be placed and treated with hyperbaric $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is usually administered at $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ values of 2 to 3 atm pressure through a mask or intratracheal tube, whereas the gas around the body is normal air compressed to the same high-pressure level.

The same oxidizing free radicals responsible for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ toxicity are also believed to be responsible for at least some of the therapeutic benefits. Some of the conditions in which hyperbaric $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ therapy has been especially beneficial are described next.

One successful use of hyperbaric $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ has been for treatment of gas gangrene. The bacteria that cause this condition, clostridial organisms, grow best under anaerobic conditions and stop growing at $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ pressures greater than about

70 mm Hg . Therefore, hyperbaric oxygenation of the tissues can frequently stop the infectious process entirely and thus convert a condition that formerly was almost $100 \%$ fatal into one that is cured in most cases by early treatment with hyperbaric therapy.

Other conditions in which hyperbaric $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ therapy has been either valuable or possibly valuable include decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism, carbon monoxide poisoning, osteomyelitis, and myocardial infarction.

# Organization of the Nervous System, Basic Functions of Synapses, and Neurotransmitters 

The nervous system is unique in the vast complexity of thought processes and control actions that it can perform. Each minute it receives literally millions of bits of information from the different sensory nerves and sensory organs and then integrates all these to determine responses to be made by the body.

Before beginning this discussion of the nervous system, the reader should review Chapters 5 and 7, which present the principles of membrane potentials and transmission of signals in nerves and through neuromuscular junctions.

## GENERAL DESIGN OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

## CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM NEURON: THE BASIC FUNCTIONAL UNIT

The central nervous system is estimated to contain 80 to 100 billion neurons. Figure 46-1 shows a typical neuron of a type found in the brain motor cortex. Incoming signals enter this neuron through synapses located mostly on the neuronal dendrites, but also on the cell body. For different types of neurons, there may be only a few hundred or as many as 200,000 such synaptic connections from input fibers. In contrast, the output signal travels via a single axon leaving the neuron. Then, this axon may have many separate branches to other parts of the nervous system or peripheral body.

A special feature of most synapses is that the signal normally passes only in the forward direction, from the axon of a preceding neuron to dendrites on cell membranes of subsequent neurons. This feature forces the signal to travel in required directions to perform specific nervous functions.

## SENSORY PART OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM-SENSORY RECEPTORS

Most activities of the nervous system are initiated by sensory experiences that excite sensory receptors, whether visual receptors in the eyes, auditory receptors in the ears, tactile receptors on the surface of the body, or other types
of receptors. These sensory experiences can either cause immediate reactions from the brain, or memories of the experiences can be stored in the brain for minutes, weeks, or years and determine bodily reactions at some future date.

Figure 46-2 shows the somatic portion of the sensory system, which transmits sensory information from the receptors of the entire body surface and from some deep structures. This information enters the central nervous system through peripheral nerves and is conducted immediately to multiple sensory areas in (1) the spinal cord at all levels; (2) the reticular substance of the medulla, pons, and mesencephalon of the brain; (3) the cerebellum; (4) the thalamus; and (5) areas of the cerebral cortex.

## MOTOR PART OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM-EFFECTORS

The most important eventual role of the nervous system is to control the various bodily activities. This task is achieved by controlling (1) contraction of appropriate skeletal muscles throughout the body; (2) contraction of smooth muscle in the internal organs; and (3) secretion of active chemical substances by both exocrine and endocrine glands in many parts of the body. These activities are collectively called motor functions of the nervous system, and the muscles and glands are called effectors because they are the actual anatomical structures that perform the functions dictated by the nerve signals.

Figure 46-3 shows the "skeletal" motor nerve axis of the nervous system for controlling skeletal muscle contraction. Operating parallel to this axis is another system, called the autonomic nervous system, for controlling smooth muscles, glands, and other internal bodily systems; this system is discussed in Chapter 61.

Note in Figure 46-3 that the skeletal muscles can be controlled from many levels of the central nervous system, including (1) the spinal cord; (2) the reticular substance of the medulla, pons, and mesencephalon; (3) the basal ganglia; (4) the cerebellum; and (5) the motor cortex. Each of these areas has its own specific role. The lower regions are concerned primarily with automatic,
