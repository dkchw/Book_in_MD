# Overview of the Circulation: Pressure, Flow, and Resistance 

The function of the circulation is to serve the needs of the body tissues-to transport nutrients to the tissues, to transport waste products away, transport hormones from one part of the body to another and, in general, to maintain an appropriate environment in all the tissue fluids for survival and optimal function of the cells.

The rate of blood flow through many tissues is controlled mainly in response to their need for nutrients and removal of waste products of metabolism. In some organs, such as the kidneys, the circulation serves additional functions. Blood flow to the kidney, for example, is far in excess of its metabolic requirements and is related to its excretory function, which requires that a large volume of blood be filtered each minute.

The heart and blood vessels, in turn, are controlled to provide the cardiac output and arterial pressure needed to supply adequate tissue blood flow. What are the mechanisms for controlling blood volume and blood flow, and how does this process relate to the other functions of the circulation? These are some of the topics and questions that we discuss in this section on the circulation.

## PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CIRCULATION

The circulation, shown in Figure 14-1, is divided into the systemic circulation and the pulmonary circulation. Because the systemic circulation supplies blood flow to all the tissues of the body except the lungs, it is also called the greater circulation or peripheral circulation.

Functional Parts of the Circulation. Before discussing the details of circulatory function, it is important to understand the role of each part of the circulation.

The function of the arteries is to transport blood under high pressure to the tissues. For this reason, the arteries have strong vascular walls, and blood flows at a high velocity in the arteries.

The arterioles are the last small branches of the arterial system; they act as control conduits through which blood is released into the capillaries. Arterioles have strong muscular walls that can close the arterioles completely or, by relaxing, can dilate the vessels severalfold; thus, the arterioles can vastly alter blood flow in each tissue in response to its needs.

The function of the capillaries is to exchange fluid, nutrients, electrolytes, hormones, and other substances between the blood and interstitial fluid. To serve this role, the capillary walls are thin and have numerous minute capillary pores permeable to water and other small molecular substances.

The venules collect blood from the capillaries and gradually coalesce into progressively larger veins.

The veins function as conduits for transport of blood from the venules back to the heart. The veins also serve as a major reservoir of extra blood. Because the pressure in the venous system is low, the venous walls are thin. Even so, they are muscular enough to contract or expand and thereby serve as

a controllable reservoir for the extra blood, either a small or a large amount, depending on the needs of the circulation.

## Volumes of Blood in the Different Parts of the

Circulation. Figure 14-1 provides an overview of the circulation and lists the percentages of total blood volume in major segments of the circulation. For example, about $84 \%$ of the entire blood volume of the body is in the systemic circulation, and $16 \%$ is in the heart and lungs. Of the $84 \%$ in the systemic circulation, approximately $64 \%$ is in the veins, $13 \%$ is in the arteries, and $7 \%$ is in the systemic arterioles and capillaries. The heart contains $7 \%$ of the blood, and the pulmonary vessels contain $9 \%$.

Most surprising is the low blood volume in the capillaries. It is here, however, that the most important function of the circulation occurs-diffusion of substances back and forth between the blood and tissues, as discussed in Chapter 16.

Cross-Sectional Areas and Velocities of Blood Flow. If all the systemic vessels of each type were put side by side, their approximate total cross-sectional areas for the average human would be as follows:

| Vessel | Cross-Sectional Area $\left(\mathrm{cm}^{2}\right)$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| Aorta | 2.5 |
| Small arteries | 20 |
| Arterioles | 40 |
| Capillaries | 2500 |
| Venules | 250 |
| Small veins | 80 |
| Venae cavae | 8 |

Note particularly that the cross-sectional areas of the veins are much larger than those of the arteries, averaging about four times those of the corresponding arteries. This difference explains the large blood storage capacity of the venous system in comparison with the arterial system.

Because the same volume of blood flow (F) must pass through each segment of the circulation each minute, the velocity of blood flow (v) is inversely proportional to the vascular cross-sectional area (A):

$$
\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{F} / \mathrm{A}
$$

Thus, under resting conditions, the velocity averages about $33 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{sec}$ in the aorta but is only $1 / 1000$ as rapid in the capillaries-about $0.3 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{sec}$. However, because the capillaries have a typical length of only 0.3 to 1 millimeter, the blood remains in the capillaries for only 1 to 3 seconds, which is surprising because all diffusion of nutrient food substances and electrolytes that occurs through the capillary walls must be performed in this short time.

Pressures in the Various Portions of the Circulation. Because the heart pumps blood continually into the aorta, the mean pressure in the aorta is high, averaging about 100 mm Hg . Also, because heart pumping is pulsatile, the arterial pressure normally alternates between an average systolic pressure level of 120 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure level of 80 mm Hg under resting conditions, as shown on the left side of Figure 14-2.

As the blood flows through the systemic circulation, its mean pressure falls progressively to about 0 mm Hg by the time it reaches the termination of the superior and inferior venae cavae where they empty into the right atrium of the heart.

The pressure in many of the systemic capillaries varies from as high as 35 mm Hg near the arteriolar ends to as low as 10 mm Hg near the venous ends, but their average functional pressure in most vascular beds is about 17 mm Hg , a pressure low enough that little of the plasma leaks through the minute pores of the capillary walls, even though nutrients can diffuse easily through these same pores to the outlying tissue cells. In some capillaries, such as the glomerular capillaries of the kidneys, the pressure is considerably higher, averaging about 60 mm Hg and causing much higher rates of fluid filtration.

At the far-right side of Figure 14-2, note the respective pressures in the different parts of the pulmonary circulation. In the pulmonary arteries, the pressure is pulsatile, just as in the aorta, but the pressure is far less; pulmonary artery systolic pressure averages about 25 mm Hg and diastolic pressure averages about 8 mm Hg , with a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of only 16 mm Hg . The mean pulmonary capillary pressure averages only 7 mm Hg . Yet, the total blood flow through the lungs each minute is the same as through the systemic circulation. The low pressures of the pulmonary system are in accord with the needs of the lungs because all that is required is to expose the blood in the pulmonary capillaries to oxygen and other gases in the pulmonary alveoli.

## BASIC PRINCIPLES OF CIRCULATORY FUNCTION

Although the details of circulatory function are complex, three basic principles underlie all functions of the system.

1. Blood flow to most tissues is controlled according to the tissue needs. When tissues are active, they need an increased supply of nutrients and therefore more blood flow than when at rest, occasionally as much as 20 to 30 times the resting level. However, the heart normally cannot increase its cardiac output more than four to seven times higher than resting levels. Therefore, it is not possible simply to increase blood flow everywhere in the body when a particular tissue demands increased flow. Instead, the microvessels of each tissue, especially the arterioles, continuously monitor tissue needs, such as the availability of oxygen and other nutrients and the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other tissue waste products. These microvessels, in turn, dilate or constrict to control local blood flow at the level required for the tissue activity. Also, nervous control of the circulation from the central nervous system and hormones provides additional help in controlling tissue blood flow.
![gu03687650e1](gu03687650e1.jpg)

Figure 14-3. Interrelationships of pressure, resistance, and blood flow. $P_{1}$, Pressure at the origin of the vessel; $P_{2}$, pressure at the other end of the vessel.
2. Cardiac output is the sum of all the local tissue flows. When blood flows through a tissue, it immediately returns by way of the veins to the heart. The heart responds automatically to this increased inflow of blood by pumping it immediately back into the arteries. Thus, as long as the heart is functioning normally, it acts as an automaton, responding to the demands of the tissues. The heart, however, often needs help in the form of special nerve signals to make it pump the required amounts of blood flow.
3. Arterial pressure regulation is generally independent of either local blood flow control or cardiac output control. The circulatory system is provided with an extensive system for controlling the arterial blood pressure. For example, if at any time the pressure falls significantly below the normal level of about 100 mm Hg , a barrage of nervous reflexes elicits a series of circulatory changes to raise the pressure back toward normal within seconds. The nervous signals especially do the following: (a) increase the force of heart pumping; (b) cause contraction of the large venous reservoirs to provide more blood to the heart; and (c) cause generalized constriction of the arterioles in many tissues so that more blood accumulates in the large arteries to increase the arterial pressure. Then, over more prolonged periods-hours and days-the kidneys play an additional major role in pressure control by secreting pressure-controlling hormones and regulating blood volume.
Thus, the needs of the individual tissues are served specifically by the circulation. In the remainder of this chapter, we begin to discuss the basic control of tissue blood flow, cardiac output, and arterial pressure.

## INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF PRESSURE, FLOW, AND RESISTANCE

Blood flow through a blood vessel is determined by two factors: (1) pressure difference of the blood between the two ends of the vessel, also sometimes called the pressure gradient along the vessel, which pushes the blood through the vessel; and (2) the impediment to blood flow through the vessel, which is called vascular resistance. Figure 14-3 demonstrates these relationships, showing a blood vessel segment located anywhere in the circulatory system.

![gu04687650e1](gu04687650e1.jpg)

Figure 14-4. A, Electromagnetic flowmeter showing generation of an electrical voltage in a wire as it passes through an electromagnetic field. B, Generation of an electrical voltage in electrodes on a blood vessel when the vessel is placed in a strong magnetic field, and blood flows through the vessel. C, Modern electromagnetic flowmeter probe for chronic implantation around blood vessels. N and S refer to the magnet's north and south poles.
$\mathrm{P}_{1}$ represents the pressure at the origin of the vessel and $\mathrm{P}_{2}$ is the pressure at the other end. Resistance occurs as a result of friction between the flowing blood and the intravascular endothelium all along the inside of the vessel. The flow through the vessel can be calculated by the following formula, which is called Ohm's law:

$$
\mathrm{F}=\frac{\Delta \mathrm{P}}{\mathrm{R}}
$$

in which F is blood flow, $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ is the pressure difference $\left(\mathrm{P}_{1}\right.$ - $\mathrm{P}_{2}$ ) between the two ends of the vessel, and R is the resistance. This formula states that the blood flow is directly proportional to the pressure difference but inversely proportional to the resistance.

Note that it is the difference in pressure between the two ends of the vessel, not the absolute pressure in the vessel, that determines flow rate. For example, if the pressure at both ends of a vessel is 100 mm Hg and no difference exists between the two ends, there will be no flow, despite the presence of 100 mm Hg pressure.

Ohm's law, illustrated in the preceding formula, expresses one of the most important of all the relationships that the reader needs to understand to comprehend the hemodynamics of the circulation. Because of the extreme importance of this formula, the reader should also become familiar with its other algebraic forms:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \mathrm{P} & =\mathrm{F} \times \mathrm{R} \\
\mathrm{R} & =\frac{\Delta \mathrm{P}}{\mathrm{~F}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## BLOOD FLOW

Blood flow rate means the quantity of blood that passes a given point in the circulation in a given period of time.

Ordinarily, blood flow is expressed in milliliters per minute or liters per minute, but it can be expressed in milliliters per second or in any other units of flow and time.

The overall blood flow in the total circulation of an adult person at rest is about $5000 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. This is called the cardiac output because it is the amount of blood pumped into the aorta by the heart each minute.

Methods for Measuring Blood Flow. Many mechanical and mechanoelectrical flowmeter devices can be inserted in series with a blood vessel or, in some cases, applied to the outside of the vessel to measure blood flow.

Electromagnetic Flowmeter. An electromagnetic flowmeter, the principles of which are illustrated in Figure 14-4, can be used to measure blood flow experimentally without opening the blood vessel. Figure 14-4A shows the generation of electromotive force (electrical voltage) in a wire that is moved rapidly in a cross-wise direction through a magnetic field. This is the well-known principle for production of electricity by the electric generator. Figure 14-4B shows that the same principle applies for generation of electromotive force in blood that is moving through a magnetic field. In this case, a blood vessel is placed between the poles of a strong magnet, and electrodes are placed on the two sides of the vessel perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force. When blood flows through the vessel, an electrical voltage proportional to the rate of blood flow is generated between the two electrodes, and this voltage is recorded using an appropriate voltmeter or electronic recording apparatus. Figure 14-4C shows an actual probe that is placed on a large blood vessel to record its blood flow. The probe contains both the strong magnet and the electrodes.

A special advantage of the electromagnetic flowmeter is that it can record changes in flow in less than $1 / 100$ of a second, allowing for the accurate recording of pulsatile changes in flow, as well as steady flow.

Ultrasonic Doppler Flowmeter. Another type of flowmeter that can be applied to the outside of the vessel and that has many of the same advantages as the electromagnetic flowmeter is the ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter, shown in Figure 14-5. A minute piezoelectric crystal is mounted at one end in the wall of the device. This crystal, when energized with an appropriate electronic apparatus, transmits ultrasound at a frequency of several hundred thousand cycles per second downstream along the flowing blood. A portion of the sound is reflected by the red blood cells in the flowing blood. The reflected ultrasound waves then travel backward from the blood cells toward the crystal. These reflected waves have a lower frequency than the transmitted wave because the red blood cells are moving away from the transmitter crystal. This effect is called the Doppler effect. (It is the same effect that one experiences when a train approaches and passes by while blowing its whistle. Once the whistle has passed by the person, the pitch of the sound from the whistle suddenly becomes much lower than when the train is approaching.)

For the flowmeter shown in Figure 14-5, the highfrequency ultrasound wave is intermittently cut off, and the reflected wave is received back onto the crystal and greatly amplified by the electronic apparatus. Another portion of the electronic apparatus determines the frequency difference between the transmitted wave and the reflected wave, thus determining the velocity of blood flow. As long as the diameter of a blood vessel does not change, changes in blood flow in the vessel are directly related to changes in flow velocity.

Like the electromagnetic flowmeter, the ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter is capable of recording rapid pulsatile changes in flow, as well as steady flow.

Laminar Flow of Blood in Vessels. When blood flows at a steady rate through a long smooth blood vessel, it flows in streamlines, with each layer of blood remaining the same distance from the vessel wall. Also, the centralmost portion of the blood stays in the center of the vessel. This type of flow is called laminar flow or streamline flow, in contrast to turbulent flow, which is blood flowing in all directions in the vessel and continually mixing in the vessel, as discussed subsequently.

## Parabolic Velocity Profile During Laminar Flow.

When laminar flow occurs, the velocity of flow in the center of the vessel is far greater than that toward the outer edges. This phenomenon is demonstrated in Figure 14-6. In Figure 14-6A, a vessel contains two fluids, the one at the left colored by a dye and the one
![gu05687650e1](gu05687650e1.jpg)

Figure 14-5. Ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter.
![gu06687650e1](gu06687650e1.jpg)

Figure 14-6. A, Two fluids (one dyed red, and the other clear) before flow begins. B, The same fluids 1 second after flow begins. C, Turbulent flow, with elements of the fluid moving in a disorderly pattern.
at the right a clear fluid, but there is no flow in the vessel. When the fluids are made to flow, a parabolic interface develops between them, as shown 1 second later in Figure 14-6B. The portion of fluid adjacent to the vessel wall has hardly moved, the portion slightly away from the wall has moved a small distance, and the portion in the center of the vessel has moved a long distance. This effect is called the parabolic profile for velocity of blood flow.

The cause of the parabolic profile is as follows. The fluid molecules touching the wall move slowly because of adherence to the vessel wall. The next layer of molecules slips over these, the third layer over the second, the fourth layer over the third, and so forth. Therefore, the fluid in the middle of the vessel can move rapidly because many layers of slipping molecules exist between the middle of the vessel and the vessel wall. Thus, each layer toward the center flows progressively more rapidly than the outer layers.

## Turbulent Flow of Blood Under Some Conditions.

When the rate of blood flow becomes too great, when it passes by an obstruction in a vessel, when it makes a sharp turn, or when it passes over a rough surface, the flow may then become turbulent, or disorderly, rather than streamlined (Figure 14-6C). Turbulent flow means that the blood flows crosswise in the vessel and along the vessel, usually forming whorls in the blood, called eddy currents. These eddy currents are similar to the whirlpools that can be seen in a rapidly flowing river at a point of obstruction. When eddy currents are present, the blood flows with much greater resistance than when the flow is streamlined because eddies add to the overall friction of flow in the vessel tremendously.

The tendency for turbulent flow increases in direct proportion to the velocity of blood flow, the diameter of the blood vessel, and the density of the blood and is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the blood, in accordance with the following equation:

$$
\mathrm{Re}=\frac{\mathrm{v} \cdot \mathrm{~d} \cdot \rho}{\eta}
$$

where Re is Reynolds' number, the measure of the tendency for turbulence to occur, $v$ is the mean velocity of blood flow (in $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{sec}$ ), $d$ is the vessel diameter (in centimeters), $\rho$ is density (in grams/ml), and $\eta$ is the viscosity (in poise). The viscosity of blood is normally about $1 / 30$ poise, and the density is only slightly greater than 1 . When Reynolds' number rises above 200 to 400, turbulent flow will occur at some branches of vessels but will die out along the smooth portions of the vessels. However, when Reynolds' number rises above approximately 2000, turbulence will usually occur, even in a straight, smooth vessel.

Reynolds' number for flow in the vascular system normally rises to 200 to 400 , even in large arteries. As a result, there is almost always some flow turbulence at the branches of these vessels. In the proximal portions of the aorta and pulmonary artery, Reynolds' number can rise to several thousand during the rapid phase of ejection by the ventricles, which causes considerable turbulence in the proximal aorta and pulmonary artery, where many conditions are appropriate for turbulence, such as the following: (1) high velocity of blood flow; (2) pulsatile nature of the flow; (3) sudden change in vessel diameter; and (4) large vessel diameter. However, in small vessels, Reynolds' number is almost never high enough to cause turbulence.

## BLOOD PRESSURE

Standard Units of Pressure. Blood pressure almost always is measured in millimeters of mercury ( mm Hg ) because the mercury manometer has been used as the standard reference for measuring pressure since its invention in 1846 by Poiseuille. Actually, blood pressure means the force exerted by the blood against any unit area of the vessel wall. If the pressure in a vessel is 100 mm Hg , this means that the force exerted is sufficient to push a column of mercury against gravity up to a level 50 millimeters high.

Occasionally, pressure is measured in centimeters of water $\left(\mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$. A pressure of $10 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ means a pressure sufficient to raise a column of water against gravity to a height of 10 centimeters. One millimeter of mercury pressure equals 1.36 centimeters of water pressure because the specific gravity of mercury is 13.6 times that of water, and 1 centimeter is 10 times as great as 1 millimeter.

High-Fidelity Methods for Measuring Blood Pressure. The mercury in a manometer has so much inertia that it cannot rise and fall rapidly. For this reason, the mercury manometer, although excellent for recording steady pressures, cannot respond to pressure changes that occur more rapidly than about one cycle every 2 to 3 seconds. Whenever it is desired to record rapidly changing pressures, some other type of pressure recorder is necessary. Figure 14-7 demonstrates the basic principles of three electronic pressure transducers commonly used for converting blood pressure and/ or rapid changes in pressure into electrical signals and then
recording the electrical signals on a high-speed electrical recorder. Each of these transducers uses a very thin, highly stretched metal membrane that forms one wall of the fluid chamber. The fluid chamber, in turn, is connected through a needle or catheter inserted into the blood vessel in which the pressure is to be measured. When the pressure is high, the membrane bulges slightly and, when it is low, it returns toward its resting position.

In Figure 14-7A, a simple metal plate is placed a few hundredths of a centimeter above the membrane. When the membrane bulges, the membrane comes closer to the plate, which increases the electrical capacitance between these two, and this change in capacitance can be recorded using an appropriate electronic system.

In Figure 14-7B, a small iron slug rests on the membrane, and this slug can be displaced upward into a center space inside an electrical wire coil. Movement of the iron into the coil increases the inductance of the coil, and this too can be recorded electronically.

Finally, in Figure 14-7C, a very thin, stretched resistance wire is connected to the membrane. When this wire is stretched greatly, its resistance increases; when it is stretched less, its resistance decreases. These changes can also be recorded by an electronic system.

The electrical signals from the transducer are sent to an amplifier and then to an appropriate recording device. With some of these high-fidelity types of recording systems, pressure cycles up to 500 cycles/sec have been recorded accurately. In common use are recorders capable of registering pressure changes that occur as rapidly as 20 to 100 cycles/ sec in the manner shown on the recorder in Figure 14-7C.

## RESISTANCE TO BLOOD FLOW

Units of Resistance. Resistance is the impediment to blood flow in a vessel, but it cannot be measured by any direct means. Instead, resistance must be calculated from measurements of blood flow and pressure difference between two points in the vessel. If the pressure difference between two points is 1 mm Hg and the flow is $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{sec}$, the resistance is said to be 1 peripheral resistance unit, usually abbreviated PRU.

Expression of Resistance in CGS Units. Occasionally, a basic physical unit called the CGS (centimeters, grams, seconds) unit is used to express resistance. This unit is dyne $\mathrm{sec} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Resistance in these units can be calculated by the following formula:

$$
\mathrm{R}\left(\text { in } \frac{\text { dyne } \mathrm{sec}}{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}\right)=\frac{1333 \times \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}}{\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{sec}}
$$

Total Peripheral Vascular Resistance and Total Pulmonary Vascular Resistance. The rate of blood flow through the entire circulatory system is equal to the rate of blood pumping by the heart-that is, it is equal to the cardiac output. In an adult human, this averages approximately $100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{sec}$. The pressure difference from the systemic arteries to the systemic veins is about 100 mm Hg . Therefore, the resistance of the entire systemic circulation, called the total peripheral resistance, is about 100/100, or 1 PRU.

In conditions in which all the blood vessels throughout the body become strongly constricted, the total peripheral resistance occasionally rises to as high as 4 PRU. Conversely, when the vessels become greatly dilated, the resistance can fall to as little as 0.2 PRU.

In the pulmonary system, the mean pulmonary arterial pressure averages 16 mm Hg and the mean left atrial pressure averages 2 mm Hg , giving a net pressure difference of 14 mm . Therefore, when the cardiac output is normal at about $100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{sec}$, the total pulmonary vascular resistance calculates to be about 0.14 PRU (about one seventh that in the systemic circulation).

Conductance of Blood in a Vessel Is the Reciprocal of Resistance. Conductance is a measure of the blood flow through a vessel for a given pressure difference. This measurement is generally expressed in terms of $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{sec}$ per mm Hg pressure, but it can also be expressed in terms of $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{sec}$ per mm Hg or in any other units of blood flow and pressure.

It is evident that conductance is the exact reciprocal of resistance in accord with the following equation:

$$
\text { Conductance }=\frac{1}{\text { Resistance }}
$$

![gu08687650e1](gu08687650e1.jpg)

Figure 14-8. A, Demonstration of the effect of vessel diameter on blood flow. B, Concentric rings of blood flowing at different velocities; the farther away from the vessel wall, the faster the flow. d, diameter; $P$, pressure difference between the two ends of the vessels.

Small Changes in Vessel Diameter Markedly Change Its Conductance. Slight changes in the diameter of a vessel cause tremendous changes in the vessel's ability to conduct blood when the blood flow is streamlined. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 14-8A, which shows three vessels with relative diameters of 1,2 , and 4 but with the same pressure difference of 100 mm Hg between the two ends of the vessels. Although the diameters of these vessels increase only fourfold, the respective flows are 1,16 , and $256 \mathrm{ml} /$ min , which is a 256 -fold increase in flow. Thus, the conductance of the vessel increases in proportion to the fourth power of the diameter, in accordance with the following formula:

$$
\text { Conductance }=\text { Diameter }^{4}
$$

Poiseuille's Law. The cause of this great increase in conductance when the diameter increases can be explained by referring to Figure 14-8B, which shows cross sections of a large and small vessel. The concentric rings inside the vessels indicate that the velocity of flow in each ring is different from that in the adjacent rings because of laminar flow, which was discussed earlier in the chapter. That is, the blood in the ring touching the wall of the vessel is barely flowing because of its adherence to the vascular endothelium. The next ring of blood toward the center of the vessel slips past the first ring and, therefore, flows more rapidly. Likewise, the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth rings flow at progressively increasing velocities. Thus, the blood that is near the wall of the vessel flows slowly, whereas that in the middle of the vessel flows much more rapidly.

In the small vessel, essentially all the blood is near the wall, so the extremely rapidly flowing central stream of blood simply does not exist. By integrating the velocities of all the concentric rings of flowing blood and multiplying them by the areas of the rings, one can derive the following formula, known as Poiseuille's law:

$$
\mathrm{F}=\frac{\pi \Delta \operatorname{Pr}^{4}}{8 \eta l}
$$

in which F is the rate of blood flow, $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ is the pressure difference between the ends of the vessel, r is the radius of the vessel, $l$ is length of the vessel, and $\eta$ is viscosity of the blood.

Note particularly in this equation that the rate of blood flow is directly proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel, which demonstrates once again that the diameter of a blood vessel (which is equal to twice the radius) plays the greatest role of all factors in determining the rate of blood flow through a vessel.

Importance of the Vessel Diameter Fourth Power Law in Determining Arteriolar Resistance. In the systemic circulation, about two thirds of the total systemic resistance to blood flow is resistance in the small arterioles. The internal diameters of the arterioles range from as little as 4 micrometers to as much as 25 micrometers. However, their strong vascular walls allow the internal diameters to change tremendously, often as much as fourfold. From the fourth power law discussed earlier, which relates blood flow to diameter of the vessel, one can see that a fourfold increase in vessel diameter can increase the flow as much as 256 -fold. Thus, this fourth power law makes it possible for the arterioles, responding with only small changes in diameter to nervous signals or local tissue chemical signals, either to turn off the blood flow to the tissue almost completely or, at the other extreme, to cause a vast increase in flow. Ranges of blood flow of more than 100 -fold in separate tissue areas have been recorded between the limits of maximum arteriolar constriction and maximum arteriolar dilation.

Resistance to Blood Flow in Series and Parallel Vascular Circuits. Blood pumped by the heart flows from the high-pressure part of the systemic circulation (i.e., aorta) to the low-pressure side (i.e., vena cava) through many miles of blood vessels arranged in series and in parallel. The arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins are collectively arranged in series. When blood vessels are arranged in series, flow through each blood vessel is the same, and the total resistance to blood flow ( $\mathrm{R}_{\text {total }}$ ) is equal to the sum of the resistances of each vessel:

$$
R_{\text {total }}=R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}+R_{4} \ldots
$$

The total peripheral vascular resistance is therefore equal to the sum of resistances of the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins. In the example shown in Figure 14-9A, the total vascular resistance is equal to the sum of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$.

Blood vessels branch extensively to form parallel circuits that supply blood to the many organs and tissues of the body. This parallel arrangement permits each tissue to regulate its own blood flow, to a great extent, independently of flow to other tissues.

For blood vessels arranged in parallel (Figure 14-9B), the total resistance to blood flow is expressed as follows:
![gu09687650e1](gu09687650e1.jpg)

Figure 14-9. Vascular resistance (R). A, In series. B, In parallel.

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text {total }}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}+\frac{1}{R_{4}} \ldots
$$

It is obvious that for a given pressure gradient, far greater amounts of blood will flow through this parallel system than through any of the individual blood vessels. Therefore, the total resistance is far less than the resistance of any single blood vessel. Flow through each of the parallel vessels in Figure 14-9B is determined by the pressure gradient and its own resistance, not the resistance of the other parallel blood vessels. However, increasing the resistance of any of the blood vessels increases the total vascular resistance.

It may seem paradoxical that adding more blood vessels to a circuit reduces the total vascular resistance. Many parallel blood vessels, however, make it easier for blood to flow through the circuit because each parallel vessel provides another pathway, or conductance, for blood flow. The total conductance ( $\mathrm{C}_{\text {total }}$ ) for blood flow is the sum of the conductance of each parallel pathway:

$$
C_{\text {total }}=C_{1}+C_{2}+C_{3}+C_{4} \ldots
$$

For example, brain, kidney, muscle, gastrointestinal, skin, and coronary circulations are arranged in parallel, and each tissue contributes to the overall conductance of the systemic circulation. Blood flow through each tissue is a fraction of the total blood flow (cardiac output) and is determined by the resistance (the reciprocal of conductance) for blood flow in the tissue, as well as the pressure gradient. Therefore, amputation of a limb or surgical removal of a kidney also removes a parallel circuit and reduces the total vascular conductance and total blood flow (i.e., cardiac output) while increasing the total peripheral vascular resistance.

## Effect of Blood Hematocrit and Blood Viscosity on Vascular Resistance and Blood Flow

Note that another important factor in Poiseuille's equation is the viscosity of the blood. The greater the viscosity, the lower the flow in a vessel if all other factors are constant. Furthermore, the viscosity of normal blood is about three times as great as the viscosity of water.

What makes the blood so viscous? It is mainly the large numbers of suspended red cells in the blood, each

Figure 14-10. Hematocrit values in a healthy (normal) person and in patients with anemia and polycythemia. The numbers refer to the percentage of the blood composed of red blood cells.
of which exerts frictional drag against adjacent cells and against the wall of the blood vessel.

Hematocrit-the Proportion of Blood That Is Red Blood Cells. If a person has a hematocrit of 40 , this means that $40 \%$ of the blood volume is cells, and the remainder is plasma. The hematocrit of adult men averages about 42 , whereas that of women averages about 38. These values can vary greatly, depending on whether the person has anemia, the degree of bodily activity, and the altitude at which the person resides. These changes in hematocrit are discussed in relationship to the red blood cells and their oxygen transport function in Chapter 33.

Hematocrit is determined by centrifuging blood in a calibrated tube, as shown in Figure 14-10. The calibration allows direct reading of the percentage of cells.

Increasing Hematocrit Markedly Increases Blood Viscosity. The viscosity of blood increases markedly as the hematocrit increases, as shown in Figure 14-11. The viscosity of whole blood at a normal hematocrit is about 3 to 4 , which means that three to four times as much pressure is required to force whole blood as to force water through the same blood vessel. When the hematocrit rises to 60 or 70 , which it often does in persons with polycythemia, the blood viscosity can become as great as 10 times that of water, and its flow through blood vessels is greatly retarded.

Other factors that affect blood viscosity are the plasma protein concentration and types of proteins in the plasma, but these effects are so much less than the effect

Figure 14-12. Effect of changes in arterial pressure over a period of several minutes on blood flow in a tissue such as skeletal muscle. Note that between pressures of 70 and 175 mm Hg , blood flow is autoregulated. The blue line shows the effect of sympathetic nerve stimulation or vasoconstriction by hormones such as norepinephrine, angiotensin II, vasopressin, or endothelin on this relationship. Reduced tissue blood flow is rarely maintained for more than a few hours because of the activation of local autoregulatory mechanisms that eventually return blood flow toward normal.
of hematocrit that they are not significant considerations in most hemodynamic studies. The viscosity of blood plasma is about 1.5 times that of water.

## EFFECTS OF PRESSURE ON VASCULAR RESISTANCE AND TISSUE BLOOD FLOW

Autoregulation Attenuates the Effect of Arterial Pressure on Tissue Blood Flow. From the discussion thus far, one might expect an increase in arterial pressure to cause a proportionate increase in blood flow through the body's tissues. However, the effect of arterial pressure on blood flow in many tissues is usually far less than one might expect, as shown in Figure 14-12. This is because an increase in arterial pressure not only increases the force that pushes blood through the vessels, but also initiates compensatory increases in vascular resistance within a few seconds through activation of the local control mechanisms, discussed in Chapter 17. Conversely, with reductions in arterial pressure, vascular

![gu13687650e1](gu13687650e1.jpg)

Figure 14-13. Effect of arterial pressure on blood flow through a passive blood vessel at different degrees of vascular tone caused by increased or decreased sympathetic stimulation of the vessel.
resistance is promptly reduced in most tissues, and blood flow is maintained at a relatively constant rate. The ability of each tissue to adjust its vascular resistance and to maintain normal blood flow during changes in arterial pressure between approximately 70 and 175 mm Hg is called blood flow autoregulation.

Note in Figure 14-12 that changes in blood flow can be caused by strong sympathetic stimulation, which constricts the blood vessels. Likewise, hormonal vasoconstrictors, such as norepinephrine, angiotensin II, vasopressin, or endothelin, can also reduce blood flow, at least transiently.

Blood flow changes rarely last for more than a few hours in most tissues, even when increases in arterial pressure or increased levels of vasoconstrictors are sustained. The reason for the relative constancy of blood flow is that each tissue's local autoregulatory mechanisms eventually override most of the effects of vasoconstrictors to provide a blood flow that is appropriate for the needs of the tissue.

## Pressure-Flow Relationship in Passive Vascular Beds.

In isolated blood vessels or in tissues that do not exhibit autoregulation, changes in arterial pressure may have important effects on blood flow. The effect of pressure on blood flow may be greater than that predicted by Poiseuille's equation, as shown by the upward curving lines in Figure 14-13. The reason for this is that increased arterial pressure not only increases the force that pushes blood through the vessels, but also distends the elastic vessels, actually decreasing vascular resistance. Conversely, decreased arterial pressure in passive blood vessels increases resistance as the elastic vessels gradually collapse due to reduced distending pressure. When pressure falls below a critical level, called the critical closing pressure, flow ceases because the blood vessels are completely collapsed.

Sympathetic stimulation and other vasoconstrictors can alter the passive pressure-flow relationship shown in Figure 14-13. Thus, inhibition of sympathetic activity greatly dilates the vessels and can increase the blood flow
![gu14687650e1](gu14687650e1.jpg)

Figure 14-14. Illustration of the effects of vessel wall tension and shear stress on blood vessels. Wall tension develops in response to transmural pressure gradients and causes stretch of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells in all directions.

twofold or more. Conversely, very strong sympathetic stimulation can constrict the vessels so much that blood flow occasionally decreases to as low as zero for a few seconds, despite high arterial pressure.

In reality, there are few physiological conditions in which tissues display the passive pressure-flow relationship shown in Figure 14-13. Even in tissues that do not effectively autoregulate blood flow during acute changes in arterial pressure, blood flow is regulated according to the needs of the tissue when the pressure changes are sustained, as discussed in Chapter 17.

Vascular Wall Tension. Tension on the blood vessel wall develops in response to transmural pressure gradients and causes vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells to stretch in all directions (Figure 14-14A). According to the law of Laplace, wall tension ( T ) for a thin-walled tube is proportional to the transmural pressure gradient $(\Delta \mathrm{P})$ times the radius $(r)$ of the blood vessel divided by its wall thickness (h):

$$
\mathrm{T}=\Delta \mathrm{P} \times(r / \mathrm{h})
$$

Thus, larger blood vessels exposed to high pressures, such as the aorta, must have stronger walls to withstand higher levels of tension and are generally reinforced with fibrous bands of collagen. In contrast, capillaries have a much smaller radii and therefore are exposed to much lower wall tension, permitting them to withstand pressures as high as 65 to 70 mm Hg in some organs such as the kidneys. As discussed in Chapter 17, chronic changes in blood pressure lead to remodeling of blood vessels to accommodate the associated changes in wall tension.

Vascular Shear Stress. As blood flows it creates a frictional force, or drag, on the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels (see Figure 14-14B). This force, called shear stress, is proportional to the flow velocity and viscosity of the blood, inversely related to the radius cubed, and generally is expressed in force/unit area (e.g., dynes $/ \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ ). In clinical practice, there is no single commonly used method for measuring shear stress. However, despite its relatively low magnitude compared to contractile forces or wall stretch from blood pressure, shear stress is important in the development and adaptation of the vascular system
to accommodate the blood flow requirements of the tissues. Endothelial cells contain multiple proteins that together serve as mechanical sensors and regulate signaling pathways that shape the vasculature during embryonic development and continue altering blood vessel morphology to optimize delivery of blood to tissues in adult life, as discussed further in Chapter 17.

# Vascular Distensibility and Functions of the Arterial and Venous Systems 

## VASCULAR DISTENSIBILITY

A valuable characteristic of the vascular system is that all blood vessels are distensible. The distensible nature of the arteries allows them to accommodate the pulsatile output of the heart and to average out the pressure pulsations. This capability provides smooth continuous flow of blood through the very small blood vessels of the tissues.

The most distensible of all the vessels are the veins. Even slight increases in venous pressure cause the veins to store 0.5 to 1.0 liter of extra blood. Therefore, the veins provide a reservoir for storing large quantities of extra blood that can be called into use whenever blood is required elsewhere in the circulation.

Units of Vascular Distensibility. Vascular distensibility normally is expressed as the fractional increase in volume for each millimeter of mercury rise in pressure, in accordance with the following formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Vascular distensibility }= \\
& \text { Increase in volume } \\
& \text { Increase in pressure } \times \text { Original volume }
\end{aligned}
$$

That is, if 1 mm Hg causes a vessel that originally contained 10 ml of blood to increase its volume by 1 ml , the distensibility would be 0.1 per mm Hg , or $10 \%$ per mm Hg .

The Veins Are Much More Distensible Than the Arteries. The walls of the arteries are thicker and far stronger than those of the veins. Consequently, the veins, on average, are about eight times more distensible than the arteries. That is, a given increase in pressure causes about eight times as much increase in blood in a vein as in an artery of comparable size.

In the pulmonary circulation, the pulmonary vein distensibilities are similar to those of the systemic circulation. However, the pulmonary arteries normally operate under pressures about one sixth of those in the systemic arterial system, and their distensibilities are correspondingly greater-about six times the distensibility of systemic arteries.

## VASCULAR COMPLIANCE (OR VASCULAR CAPACITANCE)

In hemodynamic studies, it usually is much more important to know the total quantity of blood that can be stored in a given portion of the circulation for each mm Hg pressure rise than to know the distensibilities of the individual vessels. This value is called the compliance or capacitance of the respective vascular bed; that is:

$$
\text { Vascular compliance }=\frac{\text { Increase in volume }}{\text { Increase in pressure }}
$$

Compliance and distensibility are quite different. A highly distensible vessel that has a small volume may have far less compliance than a much less distensible vessel that has a large volume because compliance is equal to distensibility times volume.

The compliance of a systemic vein is about 24 times that of its corresponding artery because it is about 8 times as distensible and has a volume about 3 times as great ( 8 $\times 3=24)$.

## VOLUME-PRESSURE CURVES OF THE ARTERIAL AND VENOUS CIRCULATIONS

A convenient method for expressing the relationship of pressure to volume in a vessel or in any portion of the circulation is to use a volume-pressure curve. The red and blue solid curves in Figure 15-1 represent, respectively, the volumepressure curves of the normal systemic arterial system and venous system, showing that when the arterial system of the average adult person (including all the large arteries, small arteries, and arterioles) is filled with about 700 ml of blood, the mean arterial pressure is 100 mm Hg but, when it is filled with only 400 ml of blood, the pressure falls to zero.

In the entire systemic venous system, the volume normally ranges from 2000 to 3500 ml , and a change of several hundred ml in this volume is required to change the venous pressure by only 3 to 5 mm Hg . This requirement mainly explains why as much as one-half liter of blood can be transfused into a healthy person in only a few minutes without greatly altering the function of the circulation.

![gu15687650e1](gu15687650e1.jpg)

Figure 15-1. Volume-pressure curves of the systemic arterial and venous systems, showing the effects of stimulation or inhibition of the sympathetic nerves to the circulatory system.

## Effect of Sympathetic Stimulation or Sympathetic Inhibition on the Volume-Pressure Relationships of the Arterial and Venous Systems. Also shown

in Figure 15-1 are the effects on the volume-pressure curves when the vascular sympathetic nerves are excited or inhibited. It is evident that an increase in vascular smooth muscle tone caused by sympathetic stimulation increases the pressure at each volume of the arteries or veins, whereas sympathetic inhibition decreases the pressure at each volume. Control of the vessels by the sympathetics in this manner is a valuable means for diminishing the dimensions of one segment of the circulation, thus transferring blood to other segments. For example, an increase in vascular tone throughout the systemic circulation can cause large volumes of blood to shift into the heart, which is one of the principal methods that the body uses to rapidly increase heart pumping.

Sympathetic control of vascular capacitance is also highly important during hemorrhage. Enhancement of sympathetic tone, especially to the veins, reduces the vessel sizes enough that the circulation continues to operate almost normally, even when as much as $25 \%$ of the total blood volume has been lost.

## Delayed Compliance (Stress-Relaxation) of Vessels.

The term delayed compliance means that a vessel exposed to increased volume at first exhibits a large increase in pressure, but progressive delayed stretching of smooth muscle in the vessel wall allows the pressure to return toward normal over a period of minutes to hours. This effect is shown in Figure 15-2. In this figure, the pressure is recorded in a small segment of a vein that is occluded at both ends. An extra volume of blood is suddenly injected until the pressure rises from 5 to 12 mm Hg . Even though none of the blood is removed after it is injected, the pressure begins to decrease immediately and approaches about 9 mm Hg after several minutes. Thus, the volume of blood injected causes immediate elastic distention of the vein, but then the smooth muscle fibers of the

Figure 15-2. Effect on the intravascular pressure of injecting a volume of blood into a venous segment and later removing the excess blood, demonstrating the principle of delayed compliance.
vein begin to creep to longer lengths, and their tensions correspondingly decrease. This effect is a characteristic of all smooth muscle and is called stress-relaxation, as explained in Chapter 8.

Delayed compliance is a valuable mechanism whereby the circulation can accommodate extra blood when necessary, such as after a large transfusion. Delayed compliance in the reverse direction is one way in which the circulation automatically adjusts itself over a period of minutes or hours to diminished blood volume after serious hemorrhage.

## ARTERIAL PRESSURE PULSATIONS

With each beat of the heart, a new surge of blood fills the arteries. Were it not for distensibility of the arterial system, all this new blood would have to flow through the peripheral blood vessels almost instantaneously, only during cardiac systole, and no flow would occur during diastole. However, the compliance of the arterial tree normally reduces the pressure pulsations to almost no pulsations by the time the blood reaches the capillaries; therefore, tissue blood flow is mainly continuous with very little pulsation.

The pressure pulsations at the root of the aorta are illustrated in Figure 15-3. In a healthy young adult, the pressure at the top of each pulse, called the systolic pressure, is about 120 mm Hg . At the lowest point of each pulse, called the diastolic pressure, it is about 80 mm Hg . The difference between these two pressures, about 40 mm Hg , is called the pulse pressure.

Two major factors affect the pulse pressure: (1) the stroke volume output of the heart; and (2) the compliance (total distensibility) of the arterial tree. A third less important factor is the character of ejection from the heart during systole.

In general, the greater the stroke volume output, the greater the amount of blood that must be accommodated in the arterial tree with each heartbeat and, therefore, the greater the pressure rise and fall during systole and diastole, thus causing a greater pulse pressure. Conversely, the less the compliance of the arterial system, the greater

Figure 15-4. Aortic pressure pulse contours in arteriosclerosis, aortic stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus, and aortic regurgitation.
the rise in pressure for a given stroke volume of blood pumped into the arteries. For example, as demonstrated by the middle top curves in Figure 15-4, the pulse pressure in old age sometimes rises to twice normal because the arteries have stiffened with arteriosclerosis and therefore are relatively noncompliant.

In effect, pulse pressure is determined approximately by the ratio of stroke volume output to compliance of the arterial tree. Any condition of the circulation that affects either of these two factors also affects the pulse pressure:

Pulse pressure $=$ Stroke volume/arterial compliance

## ABNORMAL PRESSURE PULSE CONTOURS

Some pathophysiological conditions of the circulation cause abnormal contours of the pressure pulse wave in addition to altering the pulse pressure. Especially distinctive among these conditions are aortic stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus, and aortic regurgitation, each of which is shown in Figure 15-4.

In persons with aortic valve stenosis, the diameter of the aortic valve opening is reduced significantly, and the aortic
![gu19687650e1](gu19687650e1.jpg)

Figure 15-5. Progressive stages in transmission of the pressure pulse along the aorta.
pressure pulse is decreased significantly because of diminished blood flow outward through the stenotic valve.

In persons with patent ductus arteriosus, $50 \%$ or more of the blood pumped into the aorta by the left ventricle flows immediately backward through the wide open ductus into the pulmonary artery and lung blood vessels, thus allowing the diastolic pressure to fall very low before the next heartbeat and increasing the pulse pressure.

In persons with aortic regurgitation, the aortic valve is absent or does not close completely. Therefore, after each heartbeat, the blood that has just been pumped into the aorta flows immediately backward into the left ventricle. As a result, the aortic pressure can fall all the way to zero between heartbeats. Also, there is no incisura in the aortic pulse contour because there is no aortic valve to close.

## TRANSMISSION OF PRESSURE PULSES TO THE PERIPHERAL ARTERIES

When the heart ejects blood into the aorta during systole, only the proximal portion of the aorta initially becomes distended because the inertia of the blood prevents sudden blood movement all the way to the periphery. However, the rising pressure in the proximal aorta rapidly overcomes this inertia, and the wavefront of distention spreads farther and farther along the aorta, as shown in Figure 15-5. This phenomenon is called transmission of the pressure pulse in the arteries.

![gu20687650e1](gu20687650e1.jpg)

Figure 15-6. Changes in the pulse pressure contour as the pulse wave travels toward the smaller vessels.

The velocity of pressure pulse transmission is 3 to $5 \mathrm{~m} /$ sec in the normal aorta, 7 to $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$ in the large arterial branches, and 15 to $35 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$ in the small arteries. In general, the greater the compliance of each vascular segment, the slower the velocity, which explains the slow transmission in the aorta and the much faster transmission in the much less compliant small distal arteries. In the aorta, the velocity of transmission of the pressure pulse is 15 or more times the velocity of blood flow because the pressure pulse is simply a moving wave of pressure that involves little forward total movement of blood volume.

Pressure Pulses Are Damped in the Smaller Arteries, Arterioles, and Capillaries. Figure 15-6 shows typical changes in the pressure pulse contours as the pulse travels into the peripheral vessels. Note especially in the three lower curves that the intensity of pulsation becomes progressively less in the smaller arteries, arterioles and, especially, capillaries. In fact, only when the aortic pulsations are extremely large or the arterioles are greatly dilated can pulsations be observed in the capillaries.

This progressive diminution of the pulsations in the periphery is called damping of the pressure pulses. The cause of this damping is twofold: (1) resistance to blood movement in the vessels; and (2) compliance of the vessels. The resistance damps the pulsations because a small amount of blood must flow forward at the pulse wave front to distend the next segment of the vessel; the greater the resistance, the more difficult it is for this to occur. The compliance damps the pulsations because the more compliant a vessel, the greater the quantity of blood required at the pulse wave front to cause an increase in pressure.

Therefore, the degree of damping is almost directly proportional to the product of resistance times compliance.

## CLINICAL METHODS FOR MEASURING SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURES

It is not practical to use pressure recorders that require needle insertion into an artery for making routine arterial pressure measurements in human patients, although these types of recorders are used on occasion when special studies are necessary. Instead, the clinician determines systolic and diastolic pressures through indirect means, usually by the auscultatory method.

Auscultatory Method. Figure 15-7 shows the auscultatory method for determining systolic and diastolic arterial pressures. A stethoscope is placed over the antecubital artery, and a blood pressure cuff is inflated around the upper arm. As long as the cuff continues to compress the arm with too little pressure to close the brachial artery, no sounds are heard from the antecubital artery with the stethoscope. However, when the cuff pressure is great enough to close the artery during part of the arterial pressure cycle, a sound is then heard with each pulsation. These sounds are called Korotkoff sounds, named after Nikolai Korotkoff, a Russian physician, who described them in 1905.

Korotkoff sounds are believed to be caused mainly by blood jetting through the partly occluded vessel and by vibrations of the vessel wall. The jet causes turbulence in the vessel beyond the cuff, and this turbulence sets up the vibrations heard through the stethoscope.

In determining blood pressure by the auscultatory method, the pressure in the cuff is first elevated well above arterial systolic pressure. As long as this cuff pressure is higher than systolic pressure, the brachial artery remains collapsed so that no blood jets into the lower artery during any part of the pressure cycle. Therefore, no Korotkoff sounds are heard in the lower artery. Then the cuff pressure gradually is reduced. Just as soon as the pressure in the cuff falls below systolic pressure (point B, Figure 15-7), blood begins to flow through the artery beneath the cuff during the peak of systolic pressure, and one begins to hear tapping sounds from the antecubital artery in synchrony with the heartbeat. As soon as these sounds begin to be heard, the pressure level indicated by the manometer connected to the cuff is about equal to the systolic pressure.

As the pressure in the cuff is lowered still more, the Korotkoff sounds change in quality, having less of the tapping quality and more of a rhythmical and harsher quality. Then, finally, when the pressure in the cuff falls near diastolic pressure, the sounds suddenly change to a muffled quality (point C, Figure 15-7). One notes the manometer pressure when the Korotkoff sounds change to the muffled quality, and this pressure is about equal to the diastolic pressure, although it slightly overestimates

![gu21687650e1](gu21687650e1.jpg)

Figure 15-7. Auscultatory method for measuring systolic and diastolic arterial pressures.
the diastolic pressure determined by direct intra-arterial catheter. As the cuff pressure falls a few mm Hg further, the artery no longer closes during diastole, which means that the basic factor causing the sounds (the jetting of blood through a squeezed artery) is no longer present. Therefore, the sounds disappear entirely. Many clinicians believe that the pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds completely disappear should be used as the diastolic pressure, except in situations in which the disappearance of sounds cannot reliably be determined because sounds are audible, even after complete deflation of the cuff. For example, in patients with arteriovenous fistulas for hemodialysis or with aortic insufficiency, Korotkoff sounds may be heard after complete deflation of the cuff.

The auscultatory method for determining systolic and diastolic pressures is not entirely accurate, but it usually
gives values within $10 \%$ of those determined by direct catheter measurement from inside the arteries.

Automated Oscillometric Method. Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures are often measured using automated oscillometric devices. These devices use a sphygmomanometer cuff, like the auscultatory method, but with an electronic pressure sensor to detect cuff pressure oscillations that occur when blood flows through an artery, often the brachial artery. Oscillometric arterial pressure devices use specific electronic algorithms to inflate and deflate the cuff automatically and interpret the cuff pressure oscillations. When the cuff is inflated, and its pressure exceeds systolic pressure, there is no blood flow in the artery and no oscillation of the cuff pressure. As the cuff is slowly deflated, blood begins to spurt through the artery, and the cuff pressure then oscillates in synchrony with the cyclic expansion and contraction of the artery. As the cuff pressure declines, the oscillations increase in amplitude to a maximum, which corresponds to the mean arterial pressure. The oscillation amplitude then declines as the cuff pressure falls below the patient's diastolic pressure and blood flows smoothly through the artery. Using device-specific algorithms, the cuff pressure oscillations are automatically converted into digital systolic and diastolic pressures signals, as well as heart rate, and displayed.

Oscillometric arterial pressure monitors require less skill than the auscultatory technique and can be used by the patient at home, avoiding the so-called white-coat effect that raises blood pressure in some patients when a health care professional is present. These devices, however, must be calibrated for accuracy and can yield unreliable measurements in patients when the cuff size is inappropriate or in some abnormal circulatory conditions, such as severe arteriosclerosis, which increases stiffness of the artery wall.

Normal Arterial Pressures as Measured by the Auscultatory and Oscillatory Methods. Figure 15-8 shows the approximate normal systolic and diastolic arterial pressures at different ages. The progressive increase in pressure with age results from the effects of aging on the blood pressure control mechanisms. We shall see in Chapter 19 that the kidneys are primarily responsible for this long-term regulation of arterial pressure; it is well known that the kidneys exhibit definitive changes with age, especially after the age of 50 years.

A slight extra increase in systolic pressure usually occurs beyond the age of 60 years. This increase results from decreasing distensibility, or hardening, of the arteries, which is often a result of atherosclerosis. The final effect is a higher systolic pressure with considerable increase in pulse pressure, as previously explained.

Mean Arterial Pressure. The mean arterial pressure is the average of the arterial pressures measured millisecond by millisecond over a period of time. It is not equal to the average of the systolic and diastolic pressures because at

![gu22687650e1](gu22687650e1.jpg)

Figure 15-8. Changes in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures with age. The shaded areas show the approximate normal ranges.
normal heart rates, a greater fraction of the cardiac cycle is spent in diastole than in systole. Thus, the arterial pressure remains closer to diastolic pressure than to systolic pressure during the greater part of the cardiac cycle. The mean arterial pressure is therefore determined about $60 \%$ by the diastolic pressure and $40 \%$ by the systolic pressure. Note in Figure 15-8 that the mean pressure (solid green line) at all ages is nearer to the diastolic pressure than to the systolic pressure. However, at very high heart rates, diastole comprises a smaller fraction of the cardiac cycle, and the mean arterial pressure is more closely approximated as the average of systolic and diastolic pressures.

## VEINS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS

The veins provide passageways for flow of blood to the heart, but they also perform other special functions that are necessary for operation of the circulation. Of special importance is that they are capable of constricting and enlarging and thereby storing small or large quantities of blood and making this blood available when required by the remainder of the circulation. The peripheral veins can also propel blood forward by means of a so-called venous pump, and they even help regulate cardiac output, an exceedingly important function described in detail in Chapter 20.

## VENOUS PRESSURES—RIGHT ATRIAL PRESSURE (CENTRAL VENOUS PRESSURE) AND PERIPHERAL VENOUS PRESSURES

Blood from all the systemic veins flows into the right atrium of the heart. Therefore, the pressure in the right atrium is called the central venous pressure.

Right atrial pressure is regulated by a balance between (1) the ability of the heart to pump blood out of the right atrium and ventricle into the lungs and (2) the tendency for blood to flow from the peripheral veins into the right atrium. If the right heart is pumping strongly, the right atrial pressure decreases. Conversely, weakness of the heart elevates the right atrial pressure. Also, any effect
that causes rapid inflow of blood into the right atrium from the peripheral veins elevates the right atrial pressure. Some factors that can increase this venous return and thereby increase the right atrial pressure are as follows: (1) increased blood volume; (2) increased large vessel tone throughout the body with resultant increased peripheral venous pressures; and (3) dilation of the arterioles, which decreases the peripheral resistance and allows rapid flow of blood from the arteries into the veins.

The same factors that regulate right atrial pressure also contribute to the regulation of cardiac output because the amount of blood pumped by the heart depends on both the ability of the heart to pump and the tendency for blood to flow into the heart from the peripheral vessels. Therefore, we discuss regulation of right atrial pressure in much more depth in Chapter 20 in connection with cardiac output regulation.

The normal right atrial pressure is about 0 mm Hg , which is equal to the atmospheric pressure around the body. It can increase to 20 to 30 mm Hg under very abnormal conditions, such as the following: (1) serious heart failure; or (2) after massive transfusion of blood, which greatly increases the total blood volume and causes excessive quantities of blood to attempt to flow into the heart from the peripheral vessels.

The lower limit to the right atrial pressure is usually about -3 to -5 mm Hg below atmospheric pressure, which is also the pressure in the chest cavity that surrounds the heart. The right atrial pressure approaches these low values when the heart pumps with exceptional vigor or when blood flow into the heart from the peripheral vessels is greatly depressed, such as after severe hemorrhage.

## Venous Resistance and Peripheral Venous Pressure

Large veins have so little resistance to blood flow when they are distended that the resistance then is almost zero. However, as shown in Figure 15-9, most of the large veins that enter the thorax are compressed at many points by the surrounding tissues, so that blood flow is impeded at these points. For example, the veins from the arms are compressed by their sharp angulations over the first rib. Also, the pressure in the neck veins often falls so low that the atmospheric pressure on the outside of the neck causes these veins to collapse. Finally, veins coursing through the abdomen are often compressed by different organs and by the intra-abdominal pressure, so they usually are at least partially collapsed to an ovoid or slitlike state. For these reasons, the large veins do usually offer some resistance to blood flow, and thus the pressure in the more peripheral small veins in a person lying down is usually +4 to +6 mm Hg greater than the right atrial pressure.

Effect of High Right Atrial Pressure on Peripheral Venous Pressure. When the right atrial pressure rises above its normal value of 0 mm Hg , blood begins to back

![gu23687650e1](gu23687650e1.jpg)

Figure 15-9. Compression points that tend to collapse the veins entering the thorax.
up in the large veins. This backup of blood enlarges the veins, and even the collapse points in the veins open up when the right atrial pressure rises above +4 to +6 mm Hg . Then, as the right atrial pressure rises further, the additional increase causes a corresponding rise in peripheral venous pressure in the limbs and elsewhere. Because heart function must be impaired significantly to cause a rise in right atrial pressure as high as +4 to +6 mm Hg , the peripheral venous pressure is not noticeably elevated, even in the early stages of heart failure, as long as the person is at rest.

## Effect of Intra-abdominal Pressure on Venous

Pressures of the Leg. The pressure in the abdominal cavity of a recumbent person normally averages about +6 mm Hg , but it can rise to +15 to +30 mm Hg as a result of pregnancy, large tumors, abdominal obesity, or excessive fluid (called ascites) in the abdominal cavity. When the intra-abdominal pressure rises, the pressure in the veins of the legs must rise above the abdominal pressure before the abdominal veins will open and allow the blood to flow from the legs to the heart. Thus, if the intra-abdominal pressure is +20 mm Hg , the lowest possible pressure in the femoral veins is also about +20 mm Hg .

## Effect of Gravitational Pressure on Venous Pressure

In any body of water that is exposed to air, the pressure at the surface of the water is equal to atmospheric pressure, but the pressure rises 1 mm Hg for each 13.6 millimeters of distance below the surface. This pressure results from the weight of the water and therefore is called gravitational pressure or hydrostatic pressure.
![gu24687650e1](gu24687650e1.jpg)

Figure 15-10. Effect of gravitational pressure on the venous pressures throughout the body in the standing person.

Gravitational pressure also occurs in the vascular system because of the weight of the blood in the vessels, as shown in Figure 15-10. When a person is standing, the pressure in the right atrium remains about 0 mm Hg because the heart pumps any excess blood that attempts to accumulate at this point into the arteries. However, in an adult who is standing absolutely still, the pressure in the veins of the feet is about +90 mm Hg simply because of the gravitational weight of the blood in the veins between the heart and the feet. The venous pressures at other levels of the body are proportionately between 0 and 90 mm Hg .

In the arm veins, the pressure at the level of the top rib is usually about +6 mm Hg because of compression of the subclavian vein as it passes over this rib. The gravitational pressure down the length of the arm is then determined by the distance below the level of this rib. Thus, if the gravitational difference between the level of the rib and the hand is +29 mm Hg , this gravitational pressure is added to the +6 mm Hg pressure caused by compression of the vein as it crosses the rib, making a total of +35 mm Hg pressure in the veins of the hand.

The neck veins of a person standing upright collapse almost completely all the way to the skull because of

atmospheric pressure on the outside of the neck. This collapse causes the pressure in these veins to remain at zero along their entire extent. Any tendency for the pressure to rise above this level opens the veins and allows the pressure to fall back to zero because of flow of the blood. Conversely, any tendency for the neck vein pressure to fall below zero collapses the veins still more, which further increases their resistance and again returns the pressure back to zero.

The veins inside the skull, on the other hand, are in a chamber (the skull cavity) that cannot collapse. Consequently, negative pressure can exist in the dural sinuses of the head; in the standing position, the venous pressure in the sagittal sinus at the top of the brain is about -10 mm Hg because of the hydrostatic "suction" between the top of the skull and the base of the skull. Therefore, if the sagittal sinus is opened during surgery, air can be sucked immediately into the venous system; the air may even pass downward to cause air embolism in the heart and death.

## Effect of the Gravitational Factor on Arterial and

Other Pressures. The gravitational factor also affects pressures in the peripheral arteries and capillaries. For example, a standing person who has a mean arterial pressure of 100 mm Hg at the level of the heart has an arterial pressure in the feet of about 190 mm Hg . Therefore, when the arterial pressure is stated to be 100 mm Hg , this generally means that 100 mm Hg is the pressure at the gravitational level of the heart but not necessarily elsewhere in the arterial vessels.

## Venous Valves and the Venous Pump: Their Effects on Venous Pressure

Were it not for valves in the veins, the gravitational pressure effect would cause the venous pressure in the feet always to be about +90 mm Hg in a standing adult. However, every time the legs move, the muscles tighten and compress the veins in or adjacent to the muscles, which squeezes the blood out of the veins. However, the valves in the veins, shown in Figure 15-11, are arranged so that the direction of venous blood flow can only be toward the heart. Consequently, every time a person moves the legs or even tenses the leg muscles, a certain amount of venous blood is propelled toward the heart. This pumping system is known as the venous pump or muscle pump, and it is efficient enough that under ordinary circumstances, the venous pressure in the feet of a walking adult remains less than +20 mm Hg .

If a person stands perfectly still, the venous pump does not work, and the venous pressures in the lower legs increase to the full gravitational value of 90 mm Hg in about 30 seconds. The pressures in the capillaries also increase greatly, causing fluid to leak from the circulatory system into the tissue spaces. As a result, the legs swell, and the blood volume diminishes; $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of the blood volume can be lost from the circulatory system

within the 15 to 30 minutes of standing absolutely still, which may lead to fainting, as sometimes occurs when a soldier is made to stand at attention. This situation can be avoided by simply flexing the leg muscles periodically and slightly bending the knees, thus permitting the venous pump to work.

Venous Valve Incompetence Causes Varicose Veins. The valves of the venous system may become incompetent or even be destroyed when the veins have been overstretched by excess venous pressure lasting weeks or months, which can occur in pregnancy or when a person stands most of the time. Stretching the veins increases their cross-sectional areas, but the leaflets of the valves do not increase in size. Therefore, the leaflets of the valves no longer close completely. With this lack of complete closure, the pressure in the veins of the legs increases greatly because of failure of the venous pump, which further increases the sizes of the veins and finally destroys the function of the valves entirely. Thus, the person develops what are called varicose veins, which are characterized by large bulbous protrusions of the veins beneath the skin of the entire leg, particularly the lower leg.

Whenever people with varicose veins stand for more than a few minutes, the venous and capillary pressures become very high, and leakage of fluid from the capillaries causes constant edema in the legs. The edema, in turn, prevents adequate diffusion of nutritional materials from the capillaries to the muscle and skin cells, so the muscles become painful and weak, and the skin may even become gangrenous and ulcerate. The best treatment for such a condition is continual elevation of the legs to a level at least as high as the heart. Tight binders or long compression stockings on the legs also can be of considerable assistance in preventing the edema and its sequelae.

Clinical Estimation of Venous Pressure Venous pressure often can be estimated by simply observing the degree of distention of the peripheral veins, especially of the neck veins. For example, in the sitting position, the neck veins are never distended in the normal, quietly resting person. However, when the right atrial pressure becomes increased to as much as +10 mm Hg , the lower veins of the neck begin to protrude and, at +15 mm Hg atrial pressure, essentially all the veins in the neck become distended.

Direct Measurement of Venous Pressure and Right Atrial Pressure Venous pressure can be measured easily by inserting a needle directly into a vein and connecting it to a pressure recorder. The only means whereby right atrial pressure can be measured accurately is by inserting a catheter through the peripheral veins and into the right atrium. Pressures measured through such central venous catheters are often used in some types of hospitalized cardiac patients to provide a constant assessment of the heart-pumping ability.

Pressure Reference Level for Measuring Venous and Other Circulatory Pressures Although we have spoken of right atrial pressure as being 0 mm Hg and arterial pressure as being 100 mm Hg , we have not stated the gravitational level in the circulatory system to which this pressure is referred. There is one point in the circulatory system at which gravitational pressure factors caused by changes in body position of a healthy person usually do not affect the pressure measurement by more than 1 to 2 mm Hg . This is at or near the level of the tricuspid valve, as shown by the crossed axes in Figure 15-12. Therefore, all circulatory pressure measurements discussed in this text are referred to this level, which is called the reference level for pressure measurement.

The reason for the lack of gravitational effects at the tricuspid valve is that the heart automatically prevents significant gravitational changes in pressure at this point in the following way. If the pressure at the tricuspid valve rises slightly above normal, the right ventricle fills to a greater extent than usual, causing the heart to pump blood more rapidly and therefore decreasing the pressure at the tricuspid valve back toward the normal mean value. Conversely, if the pressure falls, the right ventricle fails to fill adequately, its pumping decreases, and blood dams up in the venous system until the pressure at the tricuspid level again rises to the normal value. In other words, the heart acts as a feedback regulator of pressure at the tricuspid valve.

When a person is lying on his or her back, the tricuspid valve is located at almost exactly $60 \%$ of the chest thickness in front of the back. This is the zero pressure reference level for a person lying down.

## BLOOD RESERVOIR FUNCTION OF THE VEINS

We indicated in Chapter 14 that more than $60 \%$ of all the blood in the circulatory system is usually in the veins. For this reason, and also because the veins are so compliant, the venous system serves as a blood reservoir for the circulation.

When blood is lost from the body, and the arterial pressure begins to fall, nervous signals are elicited from the carotid sinuses and other pressure-sensitive areas of the
![gu26687650e1](gu26687650e1.jpg)

Figure 15-12. Reference point for circulatory pressure measurement (located near the tricuspid valve).
circulation, as discussed in Chapter 18. These signals, in turn, elicit nerve signals from the brain and spinal cord, mainly through sympathetic nerves to the veins, causing them to constrict. This process takes up much of the slack in the circulatory system caused by the lost blood. Even after as much as $20 \%$ of the total blood volume has been lost, the circulatory system often functions almost normally because of this variable reservoir function of the veins.

## SPECIFIC BLOOD RESERVOIRS

Certain portions of the circulatory system are so extensive and/or so compliant that they are called specific blood reservoirs. These reservoirs include the following: (1) the spleen, which sometimes can decrease in size sufficiently to release as much as 100 ml of blood into other areas of the circulation; (2) the liver, the sinuses of which can release several hundred milliliters of blood into the remainder of the circulation; (3) the large abdominal veins, which can contribute as much as 300 ml ; and (4) the venous plexus beneath the skin, which also can contribute several hundred milliliters. The heart and lungs, although not parts of the systemic venous reservoir system, may also be considered blood reservoirs. The heart, for example, shrinks during sympathetic stimulation and in this way can contribute some 50 to 100 ml of blood; the lungs can contribute another 100 to 200 ml when the pulmonary pressures decrease to low values.

## THE SPLEEN IS A RESERVOIR FOR RED BLOOD CELLS

Figure 15-13 shows that the spleen has two separate areas for storing blood, the venous sinuses and the pulp. The sinuses can swell in the same way as any other part of the venous system and store whole blood.

In the splenic pulp, the capillaries are so permeable that whole blood, including the red blood cells, oozes through the capillary walls into a trabecular mesh, forming the red pulp. The red cells are trapped by the trabeculae while the plasma flows on into the venous sinuses and then into the general circulation. As a consequence, the

![gu27687650e1](gu27687650e1.jpg)

Figure 15-13. Functional structures of the spleen.
red pulp of the spleen is a special reservoir that contains large quantities of concentrated red blood cells. These concentrated red blood cells can then be expelled into the general circulation whenever the sympathetic nervous system becomes excited and causes the spleen and its vessels to contract. As much as 50 ml of concentrated red blood cells can be released into the circulation, raising the hematocrit by $1 \%$ to $2 \%$.

In other areas of the splenic pulp are islands of white blood cells, which collectively are called the white pulp. Here, lymphoid cells are manufactured that are similar to those manufactured in the lymph nodes. They are part of the body's immune system, described in Chapter 35.

Blood-Cleansing Function of the Spleen-Removal of Old Cells Blood cells passing through the splenic pulp before entering the sinuses undergo thorough squeezing. Therefore, it is to be expected that fragile red blood cells would not withstand the trauma. For this reason, many of the red blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. After the cells rupture, the released hemoglobin and cell stroma are digested by the reticuloendothelial cells of the spleen, and the products of digestion are mainly reused by the body as nutrients, often used for making new blood cells.

Reticuloendothelial Cells of the Spleen. The pulp of the spleen contains many large phagocytic reticuloendothelial cells, and the venous sinuses are lined with similar cells. These cells function as part of a cleansing system for the blood, acting in concert with a similar system of reticuloendothelial cells in the venous sinuses of the liver. When the blood is invaded by infectious agents, the reticuloendothelial cells of the spleen rapidly remove substances such as debris, bacteria, and parasites. Also, in many chronic infections, the spleen enlarges in the same manner as lymph nodes and then performs its cleansing function even more avidly.

# The Microcirculation and Lymphatic System: Capillary Fluid Exchange, Interstitial Fluid, and Lymph Flow 

The most purposeful functions of the microcirculation are the transport of nutrients to the tissues and removal of cell excreta. The small arterioles control blood flow to each tissue, and local conditions in the tissues, in turn, control the diameters of the arterioles. Thus, each tissue, in most cases, controls its own blood flow in relationship to its individual needs as discussed in Chapter 17.

The walls of the capillaries are thin and constructed of single-layer, highly permeable endothelial cells. Therefore, water, cell nutrients, and cell excreta can all interchange quickly and easily between the tissues and circulating blood.

The peripheral circulation of the entire body has about 10 billion capillaries, with a total surface area estimated to be 500 to 700 square meters (about one eighth the surface area of a football field). It is rare that any single functional cell of the body is more than 20 to 30 micrometers away from a capillary.

## STRUCTURE OF THE MICROCIRCULATION AND CAPILLARY SYSTEM

The microcirculation of each organ is organized to serve that organ's specific needs. In general, each nutrient artery entering an organ branches six to eight times before the arteries become small enough to be called arterioles, which generally have internal diameters of only 10 to 15 micrometers. Then, the arterioles branch two to five times, reaching diameters of 5 to 9 micrometers at their ends, where they supply blood to the capillaries.

The arterioles are highly muscular, and their diameters can change by many times. The metarterioles (the terminal arterioles) do not have a continuous muscular coat, but smooth muscle fibers encircle the vessel at intermittent points, as shown in Figure 16-1.

At the point where each true capillary originates from a metarteriole, a smooth muscle fiber usually encircles the capillary. This structure is called the precapillary sphincter. This sphincter can open and close the entrance to the capillary.

The venules are larger than the arterioles and have a much weaker muscular coat. Yet, the pressure in the venules is much less than that in the arterioles, so the
venules can still contract considerably, despite the weak muscle.

This typical arrangement of the capillary bed is not found in all parts of the body, although a similar arrangement may serve the same purposes. Most importantly, the metarterioles and precapillary sphincters are in close contact with the tissues they serve. Therefore, the local conditions of the tissues-such as the concentrations of nutrients, end products of metabolism, and hydrogen ions-can cause direct effects on the vessels to control local blood flow in each small tissue area.

Structure of the Capillary Wall. Figure 16-2 shows the ultramicroscopic structure of typical endothelial cells in the capillary wall as found in most organs of the body, especially in muscles and connective tissue. Note that the wall is composed of a unicellular layer of endothelial cells and is surrounded by a thin basement membrane on the outside of the capillary. The total thickness of the capillary wall is only about 0.5 micrometer. The internal diameter of the capillary is 4 to 9 micrometers, barely large enough for red blood cells and other blood cells to squeeze through.

Pores in the Capillary Membrane. Figure 16-2 shows two small passageways connecting the interior of the capillary with the exterior. One of these passageways is an intercellular cleft, which is the thin-slitted, curving channel that lies at the top of the figure between adjacent endothelial cells. Each cleft is interrupted periodically by short ridges of protein attachments that hold the endothelial cells together but, between these ridges, fluid can percolate freely through the cleft. The cleft normally has a uniform spacing, with a width of about 6 to 7 nanometers ( 60 to 70 angstroms $[\AA]$ ), which is slightly smaller than the diameter of an albumin protein molecule.

Because the intercellular clefts are located only at the edges of the endothelial cells, they usually represent no more than $1 / 1000$ of the total surface area of the capillary wall. Nevertheless, the rate of thermal motion of water molecules, as well as most water-soluble ions and small solutes, is so rapid that all these substances diffuse with ease between the interior and exterior of the capillaries through these slit pores, the intercellular clefts.

![gu28687650e1](gu28687650e1.jpg)

Figure 16-1. Components of the microcirculation.

Present in the endothelial cells are many minute plasmalemmal vesicles, also called caveolae (small caves). These plasmalemmal vesicles form from oligomers of proteins called caveolins that are associated with molecules of cholesterol and sphingolipids. Although the precise functions of caveolae are still unclear, they are believed to play a role in endocytosis (the process whereby the cell engulfs material from outside the cell) and transcytosis of macromolecules across the interior of the endothelial cells. The caveolae at the surface of the cell appear to imbibe small packets of plasma or extracellular fluid that contain plasma proteins. These vesicles can then move slowly through the endothelial cell. Some of these vesicles may coalesce to form vesicular channels all the way through the endothelial cell, as shown in Figure 16-2.

Special Types of Pores in Capillaries of Certain Organs. The pores in capillaries of some organs have special characteristics to meet the specific needs of the organs. Some of these characteristics are as follows:

1. In the brain, the junctions between the capillary endothelial cells are mainly tight junctions that allow only extremely small molecules such as water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide to pass into or out of the brain tissues.
2. In the liver, the clefts between the capillary endothelial cells are nearly wide open so that almost all dissolved substances of the plasma, including the plasma proteins, can pass from the blood into the liver tissues.
3. The pores of the gastrointestinal capillary membranes are midway in size between those of the muscles and those of the liver.
![gu29687650e1](gu29687650e1.jpg)

Figure 16-2. Structure of the capillary wall. Note especially the intercellular cleft at the junction between adjacent endothelial cells. It is believed that most water-soluble substances diffuse through the capillary membrane along the clefts. Small membrane invaginations, called caveolae, are believed to play a role in transporting macromolecules across the cell membrane. Caveolae contain caveolins, which are proteins that interact with cholesterol and polymerize to form the caveolae.
4. In the glomerular capillaries of the kidney, numerous small oval windows called fenestrae penetrate all the way through the middle of the endothelial cells so that tremendous amounts of small molecular and ionic substances (but not the large molecules of the plasma proteins) can filter through the glomeruli without having to pass through the clefts between the endothelial cells.

## FLOW OF BLOOD IN THE CAPILLARIES-VASOMOTION

Blood usually does not flow continuously through the capillaries. Instead, it flows intermittently, turning on and off every few seconds or minutes. The cause of this intermittency is the phenomenon called vasomotion, which means intermittent contraction of the metarterioles and precapillary sphincters (and sometimes even the very small arterioles).

Regulation of Vasomotion. The most important factor affecting the degree of opening and closing of the metarterioles and precapillary sphincters that has been found thus far is the concentration of oxygen in the tissues. When the rate of oxygen usage by the tissue is greatso that tissue oxygen concentration decreases below

![gu30687650e1](gu30687650e1.jpg)

Figure 16-3. Diffusion of fluid molecules and dissolved substances between the capillary and interstitial fluid spaces.
normal-the intermittent periods of capillary blood flow occur more often, and the duration of each period of flow lasts longer, thereby allowing the capillary blood to carry increased quantities of oxygen (as well as other nutrients) to the tissues. This effect, along with multiple other factors that control local tissue blood flow, is discussed in Chapter 17.

Average Function of the Capillary System. Despite the fact that blood flow through each capillary is intermittent, so many capillaries are present in the tissues that their overall function becomes averaged. That is, there is an average rate of blood flow through each tissue capillary bed, an average capillary pressure within the capillaries, and an average rate of transfer of substances between the blood of the capillaries and the surrounding interstitial fluid. In the remainder of this chapter, we are concerned with these averages, although it should be remembered that the average functions are, in reality, the functions of billions of individual capillaries, each operating intermittently in response to local conditions in the tissues.

## EXCHANGE OF WATER, NUTRIENTS, AND OTHER SUBSTANCES BETWEEN THE BLOOD AND INTERSTITIAL FLUID

Diffusion Through the Capillary Membrane Is the Most Important Means of Transferring Substances Between Plasma and Interstitial Fluid. Figure 16-3 illustrates that as the blood flows along the lumen of the capillary, tremendous numbers of water molecules and dissolved particles diffuse back and forth through the capillary wall, providing continual mixing between the interstitial fluid and plasma. Electrolytes, nutrients, and waste products of metabolism all diffuse easily through the capillary membrane. The proteins are the only dissolved con-
stituents in the plasma and interstitial fluids that do not readily pass through the capillary membrane.

Lipid-Soluble Substances Diffuse Directly Through the Cell Membranes of the Capillary Endothelium. If a substance is lipid-soluble, it can diffuse directly through the cell membranes of the capillary without having to go through the pores. Such substances include oxygen and carbon dioxide. Because these substances can permeate all areas of the capillary membrane, their rates of transport through the capillary membrane are many times faster than the rates for lipid-insoluble substances, such as sodium ions and glucose, which can go only through the pores.

Water-Soluble, Non-Lipid-Soluble Substances Diffuse Through Intercellular Pores in the Capillary Membrane. Many substances needed by the tissues are soluble in water but cannot pass through the lipid membranes of the endothelial cells; these include water molecules, sodium ions, chloride ions, and glucose. Although only $1 / 1000$ of the surface area of the capillaries is represented by the intercellular clefts between the endothelial cells, the velocity of thermal molecular motion in the clefts is so great that even this small area is sufficient to allow tremendous diffusion of water and water-soluble substances through these cleft pores. To give an idea of the rapidity with which these substances diffuse, the rate at which water molecules diffuse through the capillary membrane is about 80 times greater than the rate at which plasma itself flows linearly along the capillary. That is, the water of the plasma is exchanged with the water of the interstitial fluid 80 times before the plasma can flow the entire distance through the capillary.

Effect of Molecular Size on Passage Through the Pores. The width of the capillary intercellular cleft pores, 6 to 7 nanometers, is about 20 times the diameter of the water molecule, which is the smallest molecule that normally passes through the capillary pores. The diameters of plasma protein molecules, however, are slightly greater than the width of the pores. Other substances, such as sodium ions, chloride ions, glucose, and urea, have intermediate diameters. Therefore, the permeability of the capillary pores for different substances varies according to their molecular diameters.

Table 16-1 lists the relative permeabilities of the capillary pores in skeletal muscle for various substances, demonstrating, for example, that the permeability for glucose molecules is 0.6 times that for water molecules, whereas the permeability for albumin molecules is very slightonly one $1 / 1000$ that for water molecules.

A word of caution must be stated at this point. The capillaries in various tissues have extreme differences in their permeabilities. For example, the membranes of the liver capillary sinusoids are so permeable that even plasma proteins pass through these walls, almost as easily

Table 16-1 Relative Permeability of Skeletal Muscle Capillary Pores to Different-Sized Molecules

| Substance | Molecular Weight | Permeability |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Water | 18 | 1.00 |
| NaCl | 58.5 | 0.96 |
| Urea | 60 | 0.8 |
| Glucose | 180 | 0.6 |
| Sucrose | 342 | 0.4 |
| Inulin | 5000 | 0.2 |

| Hemoglobin | 68,000 | 0.01 |
| Albumin | 69,000 | 0.001 |

as water and other substances. Also, the permeability of the renal glomerular membrane for water and electrolytes is about 500 times the permeability of the muscle capillaries, but this is not true for the plasma proteins. For these proteins, the capillary permeabilities are very slight, as in other tissues and organs. When we study these different organs later in this text, it should become clear why some tissues require greater degrees of capillary permeability than other tissues. For example, greater degrees of capillary permeability are required for the liver to transfer tremendous amounts of nutrients between the blood and liver parenchymal cells and for the kidneys to allow filtration of large quantities of fluid for the formation of urine.

## Diffusion Through the Capillary Membrane Is Proportional to the Concentration Difference Between the

Two Sides of the Membrane. The greater the difference between the concentrations of any given substance on the two sides of the capillary membrane, the greater the net movement of the substance in one direction through the membrane. For example, the concentration of oxygen in capillary blood is normally greater than in the interstitial fluid. Therefore, large quantities of oxygen normally move from the blood toward the tissues. Conversely, the concentration of carbon dioxide is greater in the tissues than in the blood, which causes excess carbon dioxide to move into the blood and to be carried away from the tissues.

The rates of diffusion through the capillary membranes of most nutritionally important substances are so great that only slight concentration differences cause more than adequate transport between the plasma and interstitial fluid. For example, the concentration of oxygen in the interstitial fluid immediately outside the capillary is no more than a few percent less than its concentration in the plasma of the blood, yet this slight difference causes enough oxygen to move from the blood into the interstitial spaces to provide all the oxygen required for tissue metabolism-often as much as several liters of oxygen per minute during very active states of the body.

Figure 16-4. Structure of the interstitium. Proteoglycan filaments are everywhere in the spaces between the collagen fiber bundles. Free fluid vesicles and small amounts of free fluid in the form of rivulets occasionally also occur.

## INTERSTITIUM AND INTERSTITIAL FLUID

About one sixth of the total volume of the body consists of spaces between cells, which collectively are called the interstitium. The fluid in these spaces is called the interstitial fluid.

The structure of the interstitium is shown in Figure 16-4. It contains two major types of solid structures: (1) collagen fiber bundles; and (2) proteoglycan filaments. The collagen fiber bundles extend long distances in the interstitium. They are extremely strong and provide most of the tensional strength of the tissues. The proteoglycan filaments, however, are extremely thin, coiled or twisted molecules composed of about $98 \%$ hyaluronic acid and $2 \%$ protein. These molecules are so thin that they cannot be seen with a light microscope and are difficult to demonstrate, even with the electron microscope. Nevertheless, they form a mat of very fine reticular filaments aptly described as a brush pile.

Gel in the Interstitium. The fluid in the interstitium is derived by filtration and diffusion from the capillaries. It contains almost the same constituents as plasma except for much lower concentrations of proteins because proteins do not easily pass outward through the pores of the capillaries. The interstitial fluid is entrapped mainly in the minute spaces among the proteoglycan filaments. This combination of proteoglycan filaments and fluid entrapped within them has the characteristics of a gel; it is therefore called tissue gel.

Because of the large number of proteoglycan filaments, it is difficult for fluid to flow easily through the tissue gel. Instead, fluid mainly diffuses through the gel; that is, it moves molecule by molecule from one place to another by kinetic thermal motion rather than by large numbers of molecules moving together.

Diffusion through the gel occurs about $95 \%$ to $99 \%$ as rapidly as it does through free fluid. For the short distances between the capillaries and tissue cells, this diffusion allows for rapid transport through the interstitium, not only of water molecules but also of substances such as electrolytes, low-molecular-weight nutrients, cellular excreta, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.

Free Fluid in the Interstitium. Although almost all the fluid in the interstitium normally is entrapped within the tissue gel, occasionally small rivulets of free fluid and small free fluid vesicles are also present, which means fluid that is free of the proteoglycan molecules and therefore can flow freely. When a dye is injected into the circulating blood, it often can be seen to flow through the interstitium in the small rivulets, usually coursing along the surfaces of collagen fibers or surfaces of cells.

The amount of free fluid present in most normal tissues is slight, usually less than $1 \%$. Conversely, when the tissues develop edema, these small pockets and rivulets of free fluid expand tremendously until one half or more of the edema fluid becomes free-flowing fluid, independent of the proteoglycan filaments.

## FLUID FILTRATION ACROSS CAPILLARIES

The hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries tends to force fluid and its dissolved substances through the capillary pores into the interstitial spaces. Conversely, osmotic pressure caused by the plasma proteins (called colloid osmotic pressure) tends to cause fluid movement by osmosis from the interstitial spaces into the blood. This osmotic pressure exerted by the plasma proteins normally prevents significant loss of fluid volume from the blood into the interstitial spaces.

Also important is the lymphatic system, which returns to the circulation the small amounts of excess protein and fluid that leak from the blood into the interstitial spaces. In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss the mechanisms that control capillary filtration and lymph flow function together to regulate the respective volumes of the plasma and interstitial fluid.

## Hydrostatic and Colloid Osmotic Forces Determine Fluid Movement Through the Capillary Membrane.

Figure 16-5 shows the four primary forces that determine whether fluid will move out of the blood into the interstitial fluid or in the opposite direction. These forces, called Starling forces, were named after the physiologist Ernest Starling who first demonstrated their importance:

1. The capillary hydrostatic pressure $(\mathrm{Pc})$, which tends to force fluid outward through the capillary membrane
2. The interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (Pif), which tends to force fluid inward through the capillary membrane when Pif is positive but outward when Pif is negative
![gu32687650e1](gu32687650e1.jpg)

Figure 16-5. Fluid pressure and colloid osmotic pressure forces operate at the capillary membrane and tend to move fluid outward or inward through the membrane pores.
3. The capillary plasma colloid osmotic pressure $(\Pi p)$, which tends to cause osmosis of fluid inward through the capillary membrane
4. The interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure (Пif), which tends to cause osmosis of fluid outward through the capillary membrane
If the sum of these forces-the net filtration pressureis positive, there will be a net fluid filtration across the capillaries. If the sum of the Starling forces is negative, there will be a net fluid absorption from the interstitial spaces into the capillaries. The net filtration pressure (NFP) is calculated as follows:

$$
\mathrm{NFP}=\mathrm{Pc}-\mathrm{Pif}-\Pi \mathrm{p} \div \Pi \mathrm{if}
$$

As discussed later, the NFP is slightly positive under normal conditions, resulting in a net filtration of fluid across the capillaries into the interstitial space in most organs. The rate of fluid filtration in a tissue is also determined by the number and size of the pores in each capillary, as well as the number of capillaries in which blood is flowing. These factors are usually expressed together as the capillary filtration coefficient $\left(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$. The $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ is therefore a measure of the capacity of the capillary membranes to filter water for a given NFP and is usually expressed as $\mathrm{ml} /$ min per mm Hg NFP.

The rate of capillary fluid filtration is therefore determined as follows:

Filtration $=\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}} \times$ NFP
In the following sections, we discuss each of the forces that determine the rate of capillary fluid filtration.

## CAPILLARY HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE

Various methods have been used to estimate the capillary hydrostatic pressure: (1) direct micropipette cannulation of the capillaries, which gives an average capillary pressure of about 25 mm Hg in some tissues, such as the skeletal muscle and gut, and (2) indirect functional measurement of the capillary pressure, which gives a capillary pressure averaging about 17 mm Hg in these tissues.

## Micropipette Method for Measuring Capillary Pressure.

To measure pressure in a capillary by cannulation, a microscopic glass pipette is thrust directly into the capillary, and the pressure is measured by an appropriate micromanometer system. Using this method, capillary pressures have been measured in exposed tissues of animals and in large capillary loops of the eponychium at the base of the fingernail in humans. These measurements have given pressures of 30 to 40 mm Hg in the arterial ends of the capillaries, 10 to 15 mm Hg in the venous ends, and about 25 mm Hg in the middle.

In some capillaries, such as the glomerular capillaries of the kidneys, the pressures measured by the micropipette method are much higher, averaging about 60 mm Hg . The peritubular capillaries of the kidneys, in contrast, have a hydrostatic pressure that averages only about 13 mm Hg . Thus, the capillary hydrostatic pressures in different tissues are highly variable, depending on the particular tissue and the physiological condition.

## INTERSTITIAL FLUID HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE

There are several methods for measuring interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure, each of which gives slightly different values, depending on the method used and the tissue in which the pressure is measured. In loose subcutaneous tissue, interstitial fluid pressure measured by the different methods is usually a few millimeters of mercury less than atmospheric pressure; that is, the values are called negative interstitial fluid pressure. In other tissues that are surrounded by capsules, such as the kidneys, the interstitial pressure is generally positive (i.e., greater than atmospheric pressure). The methods most widely used have been: (1) measurement of the pressure with a micropipette inserted into the tissues; (2) measurement of the pressure from implanted perforated capsules; and (3) measurement of the pressure from a cotton wick inserted into the tissue. These different methods provide different values for interstitial hydrostatic pressure, even in the same tissues.

Measurement of Interstitial Fluid Pressure Using Micropipettes. The same type of micropipette used for measuring capillary pressure can also be used in some tissues for measuring interstitial fluid pressure. The tip of the micropipette is about 1 micrometer in diameter, but even this is 20 or more times larger than the sizes of the spaces between the proteoglycan filaments of the interstitium. Therefore, the pressure that is measured is probably the pressure in a free fluid pocket.

Pressures measured using the micropipette method range from -2 to +2 mm Hg in loose tissues, such as skin but, in most cases, they average slightly less than atmospheric pressure.

Measurement of Interstitial Free Fluid Pressure in Implanted Perforated Hollow Capsules. Interstitial free fluid pressure measured when using 2-centimeter diameter capsules in normal loose subcutaneous tissue averages about -6 mm Hg but, with smaller capsules, the values are not greatly different from the -2 mm Hg measured by the micropipette.

## Interstitial Fluid Pressures in Tightly Encased Tissues.

Some tissues of the body are surrounded by tight encasements, such as the cranial vault around the brain, the strong fibrous capsule around the kidney, the fibrous sheaths around the muscles, and the sclera around the eye. In most of these tissues, regardless of the method used for measurement, the interstitial fluid pressures are positive. However, these interstitial fluid pressures almost invariably are still less than the pressures exerted on the outsides of the tissues by their encasements. For example, the cerebrospinal fluid pressure surrounding the brain of an animal lying on its side averages about +10 mm Hg , whereas the brain interstitial fluid pressure averages about +4 to +6 mm Hg . In the kidneys, the capsular pressure surrounding the kidney averages about +13 mm Hg , whereas the reported renal interstitial fluid pressures have averaged about +6 mm Hg . Thus, if one remembers that the pressure exerted on the skin is atmospheric pressure, which is considered to be zero pressure, one might formulate a general rule that the normal interstitial fluid pressure is usually several millimeters of mercury negative with respect to the pressure that surrounds each tissue.

In most natural cavities of the body, where there is free fluid in dynamic equilibrium with the surrounding interstitial fluids, the pressures that have been measured have been negative. Some of these cavities and pressure measurements are as follows:

- Intrapleural space: -8 mm Hg
- Joint synovial spaces: -4 to -6 mm Hg
- Epidural space: -4 to -6 mm Hg

Summary: Interstitial Fluid Pressure in Loose Subcutaneous Tissue Usually Subatmospheric. Although the aforementioned different methods give slightly different values for interstitial fluid pressure, most physiologists believe that the interstitial fluid pressure in loose subcutaneous tissue is, in normal conditions, slightly less subatmospheric, averaging about -3 mm Hg .

Pumping by the Lymphatic System—Basic Cause of the Negative Interstitial Fluid Pressure. The lymphatic system is discussed later in the chapter, but first we need to understand the basic role that this system plays in determining interstitial fluid pressure. The lymphatic system is a kind of scavenger system that removes excess fluid, excess protein molecules, debris, and other matter from the tissue spaces. Normally, when fluid enters the terminal lymphatic capillaries, the lymph vessel walls automatically contract for a few seconds and pump the fluid into the blood circulation. This overall process creates the slight negative pressure that has been measured for fluid in the interstitial spaces.

## PLASMA COLLOID OSMOTIC PRESSURE

Plasma Proteins Cause Colloid Osmotic Pressure. As discussed in Chapter 4, only the molecules or ions that fail

to pass through the pores of a semipermeable membrane exert osmotic pressure. Because the proteins are the only dissolved constituents in the plasma and interstitial fluids that do not readily pass through the capillary pores, it is the proteins of the plasma and interstitial fluids that are responsible for the osmotic pressures on the two sides of the capillary membrane. To distinguish this osmotic pressure from that which occurs at the cell membrane, it is called colloid osmotic pressure or oncotic pressure. The term colloid osmotic pressure is derived from the fact that a protein solution resembles a colloidal solution, despite the fact that it is actually a true molecular solution.

## Normal Values for Plasma Colloid Osmotic Pressure.

The colloid osmotic pressure of normal human plasma averages about $28 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} ; 19 \mathrm{~mm}$ of this pressure is caused by molecular effects of the dissolved protein, and 9 mm is caused by the Donnan effect-that is, extra osmotic pressure caused by sodium, potassium, and the other cations bound to the plasma proteins.

Effect of the Different Plasma Proteins on Colloid Osmotic
Pressure. The plasma proteins are a mixture that contains albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen, with an average molecular weight of $69,000,140,000$, and 400,000 , respectively. Thus, 1 gram of globulin contains only half as many molecules as 1 gram of albumin, and 1 gram of fibrinogen contains only one sixth as many molecules as 1 gram of albumin. It should be recalled from the discussion of osmotic pressure in Chapter 4 that osmotic pressure is determined by the number of molecules dissolved in a fluid rather than by the mass of these molecules. The following chart gives both the relative mass concentrations ( $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dl}$ ) of the different types of proteins in normal plasma and their respective contributions to the total plasma colloid osmotic pressure (Пр). These values include the Donnan effect of ions bound to the plasma proteins:

|  | $\mathbf{g} / \mathbf{d l}$ | Пp (mm Hg) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Albumin | 4.5 | 21.8 |
| Globulins | 2.5 | 6.0 |
| Fibrinogen | $\underline{0.3}$ | $\underline{0.2}$ |
| Total | 7.3 | 28.0 |

Thus, about $80 \%$ of the total colloid osmotic pressure of the plasma results from the albumin, $20 \%$ from the globulins, and almost none from fibrinogen. Therefore, from the point of view of capillary and tissue fluid dynamics, it is mainly albumin that is important.

## INTERSTITIAL FLUID COLLOID OSMOTIC PRESSURE

Although the size of the usual capillary pore is smaller than the molecular sizes of the plasma proteins, this is not true of all the pores. Therefore, small amounts of plasma proteins do leak into the interstitial spaces through pores and by transcytosis in small vesicles.

The total quantity of protein in the entire 12 liters of interstitial fluid of the body is slightly greater than the
total quantity of protein in the plasma but, because this volume is four times the volume of plasma, the average protein concentration of the interstitial fluid of most tissues is usually only $40 \%$ of that in plasma, or about $3 \mathrm{~g} /$ dl. Quantitatively, the average interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure for this concentration of proteins is about 8 mm Hg .

## FLUID VOLUME EXCHANGE THROUGH THE CAPILLARY MEMBRANE

The different factors affecting fluid movement through the capillary membrane have been discussed, so we can put all these factors together to see how the capillary system maintains normal fluid volume distribution between the plasma and interstitial fluid.

The average capillary pressure at the arterial ends of the capillaries is 15 to 25 mm Hg greater than at the venous ends. Because of this difference, fluid filters out of the capillaries at their arterial ends but, at their venous ends, fluid is reabsorbed back into the capillaries (see Figure 16-3). Thus, a small amount of fluid actually "flows" through the tissues from the arterial ends of the capillaries to the venous ends. The dynamics of this flow are as follows.

Analysis of the Forces Causing Filtration at the Arterial End of the Capillary. The approximate average forces operative at the arterial end of the capillary that cause movement through the capillary membrane are shown as follows:

|  | mm Hg |
| :--: | :--: |
| Forces Tending to Move Fluid Outward |  |
| Capillary hydrostatic pressure (arterial end of capillary) | 30 |
| Negative interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure | 3 |
| Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure | 8 |
| TOTAL OUTWARD FORCE | 41 |
| Forces Tending to Move Fluid Inward |  |
| Plasma colloid osmotic pressure | 28 |
| TOTAL INWARD FORCE | 28 |
| Summation of Forces |  |
| Outward | 41 |
| Inward | 28 |
| NET OUTWARD FORCE (AT ARTERIAL END) | 13 |

Thus, the summation of forces at the arterial end of the capillary shows a net filtration pressure of 13 mm Hg , tending to move fluid outward through the capillary pores. This 13 mm Hg filtration pressure causes, on average, about $1 / 200$ of the plasma in the flowing blood to filter out of the arterial ends of the capillaries into the interstitial spaces each time the blood passes through the capillaries.

Analysis of Reabsorption at the Venous End of the Capillary. The low blood pressure at the venous end of the capillary changes the balance of forces in favor of absorption as follows:

|  | mm Hg |
| :--: | :--: |
| Forces Tending to Move Fluid Inward |  |
| Plasma colloid osmotic pressure | 28 |
| TOTAL INWARD FORCE | 28 |
| Forces Tending to Move Fluid Outward |  |
| Capillary hydrostatic pressure (venous end of capillary) | 10 |
| Negative interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure | 3 |
| Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure | 8 |
| TOTAL OUTWARD FORCE | 21 |
| Summation of Forces |  |
| Inward | 28 |
| Outward | 21 |
| NET INWARD FORCE | 7 |

Thus, there is a net reabsorption pressure of 7 mm Hg at the venous ends of the capillaries. This reabsorption pressure is considerably less than the filtration pressure at the capillary arterial ends, but remember that the venous capillaries are more numerous and more permeable than the arterial capillaries. Thus less reabsorption pressure is required to cause inward movement of fluid.

The reabsorption pressure causes about nine tenths of the fluid that has filtered out of the arterial ends of the capillaries to be reabsorbed at the venous ends. The remaining one tenth flows into the lymph vessels and returns to the circulating blood.

## STARLING EQUILIBRIUM FOR CAPILLARY EXCHANGE

Ernest Starling pointed out more than a century ago that under normal conditions, a state of near-equilibrium exists in most capillaries. That is, the amount of fluid filtering outward from the arterial ends of capillaries almost exactly equals the fluid returned to the circulation by absorption. The slight disequilibrium that does occur accounts for the fluid that is eventually returned to the circulation by way of the lymphatics.

The following chart shows the principles of the Starling equilibrium. For this chart, the pressures in the arterial and venous capillaries are averaged to calculate mean the functional capillary pressure for the entire length of the capillary. This mean functional capillary pressure is calculated to be 17.3 mm Hg .

|  | mm Hg |
| :-- | :--: |
| Mean Forces Tending to Move Fluid Outward |  |
| Mean capillary pressure | 17.3 |
| Negative interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure | 3.0 |


|  | mm Hg |
| :-- | :--: |
| Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure | 8.0 |
| TOTAL OUTWARD FORCE | 28.3 |
| Mean Forces Tending to Move Fluid Inward |  |
| Plasma colloid osmotic pressure | 28.0 |
| TOTAL INWARD FORCE | 28.0 |
| Summation of Mean Forces |  |
| Outward | 28.3 |
| Inward | 28.0 |
| NET OUTWARD FORCE | 0.3 |

Thus, for the total capillary circulation, we find a nearequilibrium between the total outward forces, 28.3 mm Hg , and the total inward force, 28.0 mm Hg . This slight imbalance of forces, 0.3 mm Hg , causes slightly more filtration of fluid into the interstitial spaces than reabsorption. This slight excess of filtration is called net filtration, and it is the fluid that must be returned to the circulation through the lymphatics. The normal rate of net filtration in the entire body, not including the kidneys, is only about $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$.

## CAPILLARY FILTRATION COEFFICIENT

In the previous example, an average net imbalance of forces at the capillary membranes of 0.3 mm Hg causes net fluid filtration in the entire body of $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. Expressing the net fluid filtration rate for each mm Hg imbalance, one finds a net filtration rate of $6.67 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ of fluid per mm Hg for the entire body. This value is called the whole body capillary filtration coefficient.

The filtration coefficient can also be expressed for separate parts of the body in terms of the rate of filtration per minute per mm Hg per 100 grams of tissue. On this basis, the capillary filtration coefficient of the average tissue is about $0.01 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per mm Hg per 100 g of tissue. However, because of extreme differences in permeabilities and surface areas of the capillary systems in different tissues, this coefficient varies more than 100 -fold among the different tissues. It is very small in brain and muscle, moderately large in subcutaneous tissue, large in the intestine, and extremely large in the liver and glomerulus of the kidney, where the capillary surface is large, and the pores are numerous or wide open. By the same token, the permeation of proteins through the capillary membranes also varies greatly. The concentration of protein in the interstitial fluid of muscles is about $1.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$; in subcutaneous tissue, it is 2 $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dl}$; in the intestine, it is $4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$; and, in the liver, it is $6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$.

Effect of Abnormal Imbalance of Forces at the Capillary Membrane. If the mean capillary pressure rises significantly above the average value of 17 mm Hg , the net force tending to cause filtration of fluid into the tissue spaces rises. Thus, a $20-\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ rise in mean capillary pressure causes an increase in net filtration pressure from 0.3 to 20.3 mm Hg ,

![gu33687650e1](gu33687650e1.jpg)

which results in 68 times as much net filtration of fluid into the interstitial spaces as normally occurs. To prevent accumulation of excess fluid in these spaces would require 68 times the normal flow of fluid into the lymphatic system, an amount that is 2 to 5 times too much for the lymphatics to carry away. As a result, fluid will begin to accumulate in the interstitial spaces and edema will result.

Conversely, if the capillary pressure falls very low, net reabsorption of fluid into the capillaries will occur instead of net filtration, and the blood volume will increase at the expense of the interstitial fluid volume. These effects of imbalance at the capillary membrane in relationship to the development of the different types of edema are discussed in Chapter 25.

## LYMPHATIC SYSTEM

The lymphatic system represents an accessory route through which fluid can flow from the interstitial spaces into the blood. Most importantly, the lymphatics can carry proteins and large particulate matter away from the tissue spaces, neither of which can be removed by absorption directly into the blood capillaries. This return of proteins to the blood from the interstitial spaces is an essential function, without which we would die within about 24 hours.

## LYMPH CHANNELS OF THE BODY

Almost all tissues of the body have special lymph channels that drain excess fluid directly from the interstitial spaces. The exceptions include the superficial portions of the skin, central nervous system, endomysium of muscles, and bones. However, even these tissues have minute interstitial channels called prelymphatics through which interstitial fluid can flow; this fluid eventually empties into lymphatic vessels or, in the case of the brain, into the cerebrospinal fluid and then directly back into the blood.

Essentially all the lymph vessels from the lower part of the body eventually empty into the thoracic duct, which in turn empties into the blood venous system at the juncture of the left internal jugular vein and left subclavian vein, as shown in Figure 16-6.

Lymph from the left side of the head, left arm, and parts of the chest region also enters the thoracic duct before it empties into the veins.

Lymph from the right side of the neck and head, right arm, and parts of the right thorax enters the right lymph duct (much smaller than the thoracic duct), which empties into the blood venous system at the juncture of the right subclavian vein and internal jugular vein.

Figure 16-7. Special structure of the lymphatic capillaries that permits passage of substances of high molecular weight into the lymph.

Terminal Lymphatic Capillaries and Their Permeability. Most of the fluid filtering from the arterial ends of blood capillaries flows among the cells and finally is reabsorbed back into the venous ends of the blood capillaries but, on average, about one tenth of the fluid instead enters the lymphatic capillaries and returns to the blood through the lymphatic system rather than through the venous capillaries. The total quantity of all this lymph is normally only 2 to $3 \mathrm{~L} /$ day.

The fluid that returns to the circulation by way of the lymphatics is extremely important because substances of high molecular weight, such as proteins, cannot be absorbed from the tissues in any other way, although they can enter the lymphatic capillaries almost unimpeded. The reason for this mechanism is a special structure of the lymphatic capillaries, demonstrated in Figure 16-7. This figure shows the endothelial cells of the lymphatic capillary attached by anchoring filaments to the surrounding connective tissue. At the junctions of adjacent endothelial cells, the edge of one endothelial cell overlaps the edge of the adjacent cell in such a way that the overlapping edge is free to flap inward, thus forming a minute valve that opens to the interior of the lymphatic capillary. Interstitial fluid, along with its suspended particles, can push the valve open and flow directly into the lymphatic capillary. However, this fluid has difficulty leaving the capillary once it has entered because any backflow closes the flap valve. Thus, the lymphatics have valves at the very tips of the terminal lymphatic capillaries, as well as valves along their larger vessels, up to the point where they empty into the blood circulation.

## FORMATION OF LYMPH

Lymph is derived from interstitial fluid that flows into the lymphatics. Therefore, lymph as it first enters the terminal lymphatics has almost the same composition as the interstitial fluid.
![gu35687650e1](gu35687650e1.jpg)

Figure 16-8. Relationship between interstitial fluid pressure and lymph flow in the leg of a dog. Note that lymph flow reaches a maximum when the interstitial pressure $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{if}}\right)$ rises slightly above atmospheric pressure $(0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$. (Courtesy Dr. Harry Gibson and Dr. Aubrey Taylor.)

The protein concentration in the interstitial fluid of most tissues averages about $2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$, and the protein concentration of lymph flowing from these tissues is near this value. Lymph formed in the liver has a protein concentration as high as $6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$, and lymph formed in the intestines has a protein concentration as high as 3 to $4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$. Because about two thirds of all lymph normally is derived from the liver and intestines, the thoracic duct lymph, which is a mixture of lymph from all areas of the body, usually has a protein concentration of 3 to $5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$.

The lymphatic system is also one of the major routes for absorption of nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract, especially for absorption of virtually all fats in food, as discussed in Chapter 66. After a fatty meal, thoracic duct lymph sometimes contains as much as $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ fat.

Finally, even large particles, such as bacteria, can push their way between the endothelial cells of the lymphatic capillaries and in this way enter the lymph. As the lymph passes through the lymph nodes, these particles are almost entirely removed and destroyed, as discussed in Chapter 34.

## RATE OF LYMPH FLOW

About $100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ of lymph flows through the thoracic duct of a resting human, and approximately another 20 ml flows into the circulation each hour through other channels, making a total estimated lymph flow of about 120 $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ or 2 to $3 \mathrm{~L} /$ day.

## Effect of Interstitial Fluid Pressure on Lymph Flow.

Figure 16-8 shows the effect of different levels of interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure on lymph flow, as measured in animals. Note that normal lymph flow is very little at interstitial fluid pressures more negative than the normal

![gu36687650e1](gu36687650e1.jpg)

Figure 16-9. Structure of lymphatic capillaries and a collecting lymphatic, with the lymphatic valves also shown.
value of -6 mm Hg . Then, as the pressure rises to 0 mm Hg (atmospheric pressure), flow increases more than 20fold. Therefore, any factor that increases interstitial fluid pressure also increases lymph flow if the lymph vessels are functioning normally. Such factors include the following:

- Elevated capillary hydrostatic pressure
- Decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure
- Increased interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure
- Increased permeability of the capillaries

All these factors favor net fluid movement into the interstitium, thus increasing interstitial fluid volume, interstitial fluid pressure, and lymph flow all at the same time.

However, note in Figure 16-8 that when the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure becomes 1 or 2 mm Hg greater than atmospheric pressure ( $>0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ), lymph flow fails to rise any further at still higher pressures. This results from the fact that the increasing tissue pressure not only increases entry of fluid into the lymphatic capillaries, but also compresses the outside surfaces of the larger lymphatics, thus impeding lymph flow. At the higher pressures, these two factors balance each other, so lymph flow reaches a maximum flow rate. This maximum flow rate is illustrated by the upper level plateau in Figure 16-8.

Lymphatic Pump Increases Lymph Flow. Valves exist in all lymph channels. Figure 16-9 shows typical valves for collecting lymphatics into which the lymphatic capillaries empty.

Videos of exposed lymph vessels in animals and in humans have shown that when a collecting lymphatic or larger lymph vessel becomes stretched with fluid, the smooth muscle in the wall of the vessel automatically contracts. Furthermore, each segment of the lymph vessel between successive valves functions as a separate automatic pump. That is, even slight filling of a segment causes it to contract, and the fluid is pumped through the next valve into the next lymphatic segment. This fluid fills the subsequent segment and a few seconds later it also contracts, with the process continuing all along the lymph vessel until the fluid is finally emptied into the blood circulation. In a very large lymph vessel, such as the thoracic
duct, this lymphatic pump can generate pressure as high as 50 to 100 mm Hg .

Pumping Caused by External Intermittent Compression of the Lymphatics. In addition to the pumping caused by intrinsic intermittent contraction of the lymph vessel walls, any external factor that intermittently compresses the lymph vessel can also cause pumping. In order of their importance, such factors are as follows:

- Contraction of surrounding skeletal muscles
- Movement of the parts of the body
- Pulsations of arteries adjacent to the lymphatics
- Compression of the tissues by objects outside the body

The lymphatic pump becomes very active during exercise, often increasing lymph flow 10- to 30 -fold. Conversely, during periods of rest, lymph flow is sluggish (almost zero).

Lymphatic Capillary Pump. The terminal lymphatic capillary is also capable of pumping lymph, in addition to the pumping by the larger lymph vessels. As explained earlier in the chapter, the anchoring filaments on the walls of the lymphatic capillaries tightly adhere to the surrounding tissue cells. Therefore, each time excess fluid enters the tissue and causes the tissue to swell, the anchoring filaments pull on the wall of the lymphatic capillary, and fluid flows into the terminal lymphatic capillary through the junctions between the endothelial cells. Then, when the tissue is compressed, the pressure inside the capillary increases and causes the overlapping edges of the endothelial cells to close like valves. Therefore, the pressure pushes the lymph forward into the collecting lymphatic instead of backward through the cell junctions.

The lymphatic capillary endothelial cells also contain a few contractile actomyosin filaments. In some animal tissues (e.g., a bat wing), these filaments have been observed to cause rhythmical contraction of the lymphatic capillaries in the same rhythmic way that many of the small blood vessels and larger lymphatic vessels contract. Therefore, it is probable that at least part of lymph pumping results from lymph capillary endothelial cell contraction in addition to contraction of the larger muscular lymphatics.

## Summary of Factors That Determine Lymph Flow.

From the previous discussion, one can see that the two primary factors that determine lymph flow are (1) the interstitial fluid pressure and (2) the activity of the lymphatic pump. Therefore, one can state that, roughly, the rate of lymph flow is determined by the product of interstitial fluid pressure times the activity of the lymphatic pump.

## Lymphatic System Plays a Key Role in Controlling Interstitial Fluid Protein Concentration, Volume, and Pressure

It is already clear that the lymphatic system functions as an overflow mechanism to return excess proteins and excess fluid volume from the tissue spaces to the circulation. Therefore, the lymphatic system also plays a central role in controlling the following: (1) concentration of proteins in the interstitial fluids; (2) volume of interstitial fluid; and (3) interstitial fluid pressure. Here is an explanation of how these factors interact.

1. Remember that small amounts of proteins leak continuously out of the blood capillaries into the interstitium. Only minute amounts, if any, of the leaked proteins return to the circulation by way of the venous ends of the blood capillaries. Therefore, these proteins tend to accumulate in the interstitial fluid, which in turn increases the colloid osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluids.
2. The increasing colloid osmotic pressure in the interstitial fluid shifts the balance of forces at the blood capillary membranes in favor of fluid filtration into the interstitium. Therefore, in effect, fluid is translocated osmotically outward through the capillary wall by the proteins and into the interstitium, thus increasing both interstitial fluid volume and interstitial fluid pressure.
3. The increasing interstitial fluid pressure greatly increases the rate of lymph flow, which carries away the excess interstitial fluid volume and excess protein that has accumulated in the spaces.
Thus, once the interstitial fluid protein concentration reaches a certain level and causes comparable increases in interstitial fluid volume and pressure, the return of protein and fluid by way of the lymphatic system becomes great enough to balance the rate of leakage of these into the interstitium from the blood capillaries. Therefore, the quantitative values of all these factors reach a steady state, and they remain balanced at these steady state levels until some factor changes the rate of leakage of proteins and fluid from the blood capillaries.

## Significance of Negative Interstitial Fluid Pressure for Holding Body Tissues Together

Traditionally, it has been assumed that the different tissues of the body are held together entirely by connective tissue fibers. However, connective tissue fibers are very weak or even absent at many places in the body, particularly at points where tissues slide over one another (e.g., skin sliding over the back of the hand or over the face). Yet, even at these places, the tissues are held together by the negative interstitial fluid pressure, which is actually a partial vacuum. When the tissues lose their negative pressure, fluid accumulates in the spaces, and the condition known as edema occurs. This condition is discussed in Chapter 25.

# Local and Humoral Control of Tissue Blood Flow 

## LOCAL CONTROL OF BLOOD FLOW IN RESPONSE TO TISSUE NEEDS

A fundamental principle of circulatory function is that most tissues have the ability to control their own local blood flow in proportion to their specific metabolic needs. Some of the specific needs of the tissues for blood flow include the following:

1. Delivery of oxygen to the tissues
2. Delivery of other nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids
3. Removal of carbon dioxide from the tissues
4. Removal of hydrogen ions from the tissues
5. Maintenance of proper concentrations of ions in the tissues
6. Transport of various hormones and other substances to the different tissue.
Certain organs have special requirements. For example, blood flow to the skin determines heat loss from the body and, in this way, helps control body temperature. Also, delivery of adequate quantities of blood plasma to the kidneys allows the kidneys to filter and excrete the waste products of the body and to regulate body fluid volumes and electrolytes.

We shall see that these factors exert extreme degrees of local blood flow control and that different tissues place different levels of importance on these factors in controlling blood flow.

Variations in Blood Flow in Different Tissues and Organs. Note the very large blood flows listed in Table 17-1 for some organs-for example, several hundred milliliters per minute per 100 grams of thyroid or adrenal gland tissue and a total blood flow of $1350 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ in the liver, which is $95 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} / 100 \mathrm{~g}$ of liver tissue.

Also note the extremely large blood flow through the kidneys- $1100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. This extreme amount of flow is required for the kidneys to perform their function of cleansing the blood of waste products and regulating composition of the body fluids precisely.

Conversely, most surprising is the low blood flow to all the inactive muscles of the body-only a total of $750 \mathrm{ml} /$ min -even though the muscles constitute between $30 \%$ and $40 \%$ of the total body mass. In the resting state, the
metabolic activity of the muscles is low, as is the blood flow-only $4 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} / 100 \mathrm{~g}$. Yet, during heavy exercise, muscle metabolic activity can increase more than 60 -fold and the blood flow as much as 20 -fold, increasing to as high as $16,000 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ in the body's total muscle vascular bed (or $80 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} / 100 \mathrm{~g}$ of muscle).

Importance of Blood Flow Control by the Local Tissues. The following question might be asked: Why not continuously provide a very large blood flow through every tissue of the body that would always be enough to supply the tissue's needs, regardless of whether the activity of the tissue is small or large? The answer is equally simple; such a mechanism would require many times more blood flow than the heart can pump.

Experiments have shown that the blood flow to each tissue usually is regulated at the minimal level that will supply the tissue's requirements-no more, no less. For example, in tissues for which the most important requirement is delivery of oxygen, the blood flow is always controlled at a level only slightly more than that required to maintain full tissue oxygenation but no more than this. By controlling local blood flow in such an exact way, the tissues almost never experience oxygen nutritional deficiency, and the workload on the heart is kept at a minimum.

## MECHANISMS OF BLOOD FLOW CONTROL

Local blood flow control can be divided into two phases, acute control and long-term control. Acute control is achieved by rapid changes in local vasodilation or vasoconstriction of the arterioles, metarterioles, and precapillary sphincters that occur within seconds to minutes to provide rapid maintenance of appropriate local tissue blood flow. Long-term control means slow, controlled changes in flow over a period of days, weeks, or even months. In general, these long-term changes provide even better control of the flow in proportion to the needs of the tissues. These changes come about as a result of an increase or decrease in the physical sizes and numbers of blood vessels supplying the tissues.

## ACUTE CONTROL OF LOCAL BLOOD FLOW

## Increases in Tissue Metabolism Increase Tissue Blood Flow

Figure 17-1 shows the approximate acute effect on blood flow of increasing the rate of metabolism in a local tissue, such as in a skeletal muscle. Note that an increase in metabolism up to eight times normal increases the blood flow acutely about fourfold.

Reduced Oxygen Availability Increases Tissue Blood Flow. One of the most necessary of the metabolic nutrients is oxygen. Whenever the availability of oxygen to
![gu38687650e1](gu38687650e1.jpg)

Figure 17-2. Effect of decreasing arterial oxygen saturation on blood flow through an isolated dog leg.
the tissues decreases, such as during the following: (1) at a high altitude at the top of a high mountain; (2) in pneumonia; (3) in carbon monoxide poisoning (which poisons the ability of hemoglobin to transport oxygen); or (4) in cyanide poisoning (which poisons the ability of the tissues to use oxygen), the blood flow through the tissues increases markedly. Figure 17-2 shows that as the arterial oxygen saturation decreases to about $25 \%$ of normal, the blood flow through an isolated leg increases about threefold; that is, the blood flow increases almost enough, but not quite enough, to make up for the decreased amount of oxygen in the blood, thus almost maintaining a relatively constant supply of oxygen to the tissues.

Total cyanide poisoning of oxygen usage by a local tissue area can cause local blood flow to increase as much as sevenfold, thus demonstrating the extreme effect of oxygen deficiency to increase blood flow. The mechanisms whereby changes in tissue metabolism or oxygen availability alter tissue blood flow are not fully understood, but two main theories have been proposed, the vasodilator theory and the oxygen demand theory.

Vasodilator Theory for Acute Local Blood Flow Regulation-Possible Special Role of Adenosine. According to the vasodilator theory, the greater the rate of metabolism or the less the availability of oxygen or some other nutrients to a tissue, the greater the rate of formation of vasodilator substances in the tissue cells. The vasodilator substances are then believed to diffuse through the tissues to the precapillary sphincters, metarterioles, and arterioles to cause dilation. Some of the different vasodilator substances that have been suggested are adenosine, carbon dioxide, adenosine phosphate compounds, histamine, potassium ions, and hydrogen ions.

Vasodilator substances may be released from the tissue in response to oxygen deficiency. For example, experiments have shown that decreased oxygen availability can cause adenosine and lactic acid (containing hydrogen ions) to be released into the spaces between the tissue cells; these substances then cause intense acute vasodilation

and therefore are responsible, or partially responsible, for the local blood flow regulation. Other vasodilator substances, such as carbon dioxide, lactic acid, and potassium ions, also tend to increase in the tissues when blood flow is reduced and cell metabolism continues at the same rate, or when cell metabolism is suddenly increased. An increase in the concentration of vasodilator metabolites causes vasodilation of the arterioles, thus increasing the tissue blood flow and returning the tissue concentration of the metabolites toward normal.

Many physiologists believe that adenosine is an important local vasodilator for controlling local blood flow. For example, minute quantities of adenosine are released from heart muscle cells when coronary blood flow becomes too little, and this release of adenosine causes enough local vasodilation in the heart to return coronary blood flow to normal. Also, whenever the heart becomes more active than normal, the heart's metabolism increases, causing increased utilization of oxygen, followed by (1) decreased oxygen concentration in the heart muscle cells with (2) consequent degradation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which (3) increases the release of adenosine. It is believed that much of this adenosine leaks out of the heart muscle cells to cause coronary vasodilation, providing increased coronary blood flow to supply the increased nutrient demands of the active heart.

Although research evidence is less clear, many physiologists also have suggested that the same adenosine mechanism is an important controller of blood flow in skeletal muscle and many other tissues, as well as in the heart. However, it has been difficult to prove that sufficient quantities of any single vasodilator substance, including adenosine, are formed in the tissues to cause all the measured increase in blood flow. It is likely that a combination of several different vasodilators released by the tissues contributes to blood flow regulation.

## Oxygen Demand Theory for Local Blood Flow Control.

Although the vasodilator theory is widely accepted, several critical facts have made other physiologists favor another theory, which can be called the oxygen demand theory or, more accurately, the nutrient demand theory (because other nutrients besides oxygen are involved). Oxygen is one of the metabolic nutrients required to cause vascular muscle contraction, with other nutrients required as well. Therefore, in the absence of adequate oxygen, it is reasonable to believe that the blood vessels would relax and therefore dilate. Also, increased utilization of oxygen in the tissues as a result of increased metabolism theoretically could decrease the availability of oxygen to the smooth muscle fibers in the local blood vessels, causing local vasodilation.

A mechanism whereby oxygen availability could operate is shown in Figure 17-3. This figure shows a tissue vascular unit, consisting of a metarteriole with a single sidearm capillary and its surrounding tissue. At the origin of the capillary is a precapillary sphincter and around
![gu39687650e1](gu39687650e1.jpg)

Figure 17-3. Diagram of a tissue unit area for an explanation of acute local feedback control of blood flow, showing a metarteriole passing through the tissue and a sidearm capillary with its precapillary sphincter for controlling capillary blood flow.
the metarteriole are several other smooth muscle fibers. When observing such a tissue under a microscope, the precapillary sphincters are normally completely open or completely closed. The number of precapillary sphincters that are open at any given time is roughly proportional to the requirements of the tissue for nutrition. The precapillary sphincters and metarterioles open and close cyclically several times per minute, with the duration of the open phases being proportional to the metabolic needs of the tissues for oxygen. The cyclical opening and closing is called vasomotion.

Because smooth muscle requires oxygen to remain contracted, one might assume that the strength of contraction of the sphincters would increase with an increase in oxygen concentration. Consequently, when the oxygen concentration in the tissue rises above a certain level, the precapillary and metarteriole sphincters presumably would close until the tissue cells consume the excess oxygen. However, when the excess oxygen is gone and the oxygen concentration falls low enough, the sphincters open once more to begin the cycle again.

Thus, on the basis of available data, either the vasodilator substance theory or oxygen demand theory could explain acute local blood flow regulation in response to the metabolic needs of the tissues. It is probably a combination of the two mechanisms.

Possible Role of Other Nutrients Besides Oxygen in Control of Local Blood Flow. Under special conditions, it has been shown that the lack of glucose in the perfusing blood can cause local tissue vasodilation. It also is possible that this same effect occurs when other nutrients, such as amino acids or fatty acids, are deficient, although

![gu40687650e1](gu40687650e1.jpg)

Figure 17-4. Reactive hyperemia in a tissue after temporary occlusion of the artery supplying blood flow and active hyperemia following increased tissue metabolic activity.
this is still uncertain. In addition, vasodilation occurs in the vitamin deficiency disease beriberi, in which the patient has deficiencies of the vitamin B substances thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin. In this disease, the peripheral vascular blood flow almost everywhere in the body often increases twofold to threefold. Because all these vitamins are necessary for oxygen-induced phosphorylation, which is required to produce ATP in the tissue cells, one can understand how deficiency of these vitamins might lead to diminished smooth muscle contractile ability and therefore local vasodilation as well.

## Special Examples of Acute Metabolic Control of Local Blood Flow

The mechanisms we have described thus far for local blood flow control are called metabolic mechanisms because they all function in response to the metabolic needs of the tissues. Two additional special examples of metabolic control of local blood flow are reactive hyperemia and active hyperemia (Figure 17-4).

## Reactive Hyperemia Occurs After Tissue Blood Supply Is Blocked for a Short Time. When the blood supply to a tissue is blocked for a few seconds to as long as 1 hour or more and then is unblocked, blood flow through the tissue usually increases immediately to four to seven times normal. This increased flow will continue for a few seconds if the block has lasted only a few seconds but sometimes continues for as long as many hours if the blood flow has been stopped for an hour or more. This phenomenon is called reactive hyperemia.
![gu41687650e1](gu41687650e1.jpg)

Figure 17-5. Effect of different levels of arterial pressure on blood flow through a muscle. The solid red curve shows the effect if the arterial pressure is raised over a period of a few minutes. The dashed green curve shows the effect if the arterial pressure is raised slowly over many weeks.

Reactive hyperemia is another manifestation of the local metabolic blood flow regulation mechanism-that is, lack of flow sets into motion all the factors that cause vasodilation. After short periods of vascular occlusion, the extra blood flow during the reactive hyperemia phase lasts long enough to repay almost exactly the tissue oxygen deficit that has accrued during the period of occlusion. This mechanism emphasizes the close connection between local blood flow regulation and delivery of oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues.

Active Hyperemia Occurs When Tissue Metabolic Rate Increases. When a tissue becomes highly active, such as an exercising muscle, a gastrointestinal gland during a hypersecretory period, or even the brain during increased mental activity, the rate of blood flow through the tissue increases (see Figure 17-4). The increase in local metabolism causes the cells to devour tissue fluid nutrients rapidly and release large quantities of vasodilator substances. The result is dilation of local blood vessels and increased local blood flow. In this way, the active tissue receives the additional nutrients required to sustain its new level of function. As noted earlier, active hyperemia in skeletal muscle can increase local muscle blood flow as much as 20 -fold during intense exercise.

## Autoregulation of Blood Flow During Changes in Arterial Pressure-Metabolic and Myogenic Mechanisms

In any tissue of the body, a rapid increase in arterial pressure causes an immediate rise in blood flow. However, within less than 1 minute, the blood flow in most tissues returns almost to the normal level, even though the arterial pressure is kept elevated. This return of flow toward normal is called autoregulation. After autoregulation has occurred, the local blood flow in most tissues will be related to arterial pressure approximately in accord with the solid acute curve in Figure 17-5. Note that between

arterial pressures of about 70 and 175 mm Hg , the blood flow increases only $20 \%$ to $30 \%$, even though the arterial pressure increases $150 \%$. In some tissues, such as the brain and heart, this autoregulation is even more precise.

For almost a century, two views have been proposed to explain this acute autoregulation mechanism. They have been called the metabolic theory and the myogenic theory.

The metabolic theory can be understood easily by applying the basic principles of local blood flow regulation discussed in previous sections. Thus, when the arterial pressure becomes too great, the excess flow provides too much oxygen and too many other nutrients to the tissues and washes out the vasodilators released by the tissues. These nutrients (especially oxygen) and decreased tissue levels of vasodilators then cause the blood vessels to constrict and return flow to nearly normal, despite the increased pressure.

The myogenic theory, however, suggests that another mechanism not related to tissue metabolism explains the phenomenon of autoregulation. This theory is based on the observation that a sudden stretch of small blood vessels causes the smooth muscle of the vessel wall to contract. Therefore, it has been proposed that when high arterial pressure stretches the vessel, reactive vascular constriction results, which reduces blood flow nearly back to normal. Conversely, at low pressures, the degree of stretch of the vessel is less, so the smooth muscle relaxes, reducing vascular resistance and helping to return flow toward normal.

The myogenic response is inherent to vascular smooth muscle and can occur in the absence of neural or hormonal influences. It is most pronounced in arterioles but can also be observed in arteries, venules, veins, and even lymphatic vessels. Myogenic contraction is initiated by stretch-induced vascular depolarization, which then rapidly increases calcium ion entry from the extracellular fluid into the cells, causing them to contract. Changes in vascular pressure may also open or close other ion channels that influence vascular contraction. The precise mechanisms whereby changes in pressure cause opening or closing of vascular ion channels are still uncertain but likely involve mechanical effects of pressure on extracellular proteins that are tethered to cytoskeleton elements of the vascular wall or to the ion channels themselves.

The myogenic mechanism appears to be important in preventing excessive stretching of blood vessels when blood pressure is increased. However, the role of the myogenic mechanism in blood flow regulation is unclear because this pressure-sensing mechanism cannot detect changes in blood flow in the tissue directly. Metabolic factors appear to override the myogenic mechanism in circumstances in which the metabolic demands of the tissues are significantly increased, such as during vigorous muscle exercise, which causes dramatic increases in skeletal muscle blood flow.

## Special Mechanisms for Acute Blood Flow Control in Specific Tissues

Although the general mechanisms for local blood flow control discussed thus far are present in almost all tissues of the body, distinctly different mechanisms operate in a few special areas. All mechanisms are discussed throughout this text in relation to specific organs, but two notable mechanisms are as follows:

1. In the kidneys, blood flow control is significantly vested in a mechanism called tubuloglomerular feedback, in which the composition of the fluid in the early distal tubule is detected by an epithelial structure of the distal tubule, called the macula densa. This structure is located where the distal tubule lies adjacent to the afferent and efferent arterioles at the nephron juxtaglomerular apparatus. When too much fluid filters from the blood through the glomerulus into the tubular system, feedback signals from the macula densa cause constriction of the afferent arterioles, thereby reducing renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate back to nearly normal. The details of this mechanism are discussed in Chapter 27.
2. In the brain, in addition to control of blood flow by tissue oxygen concentration, the concentrations of carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions play prominent roles. An increase of either or both of these substances dilates the cerebral vessels and allows rapid washout of the excess carbon dioxide or hydrogen ions from the brain tissues. This mechanism is important because the level of excitability of the brain is highly dependent on exact control of both carbon dioxide concentration and hydrogen ion concentration. This special mechanism for cerebral blood flow control is presented in Chapter 62.
3. In the skin, blood flow control is closely linked to body temperature regulation. Cutaneous and subcutaneous flow regulates heat loss from the body by metering the flow of heat from the core to the surface of the body, where heat is lost to the environment. Skin blood flow is controlled largely by the central nervous system through the sympathetic nerves, as discussed in Chapter 74. Although skin blood flow is only about $3 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} / 100$ g of tissue in cool weather, large changes from that value can occur as needed. When humans are exposed to body heating, skin blood flow may increase greatly, to as high as 7 to $8 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ for the entire body. When body temperature is reduced, skin blood flow decreases, falling to barely above zero at very low temperatures. Even with severe vasoconstriction, skin blood flow is usually great enough to meet the basic metabolic demands of the skin.

![gu42687650e1](gu42687650e1.jpg)

Figure 17-6. Nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzyme in endothelial cells synthesizes nitric oxide (NO) from arginine and oxygen. NO activates soluble guanylate cyclases in vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in conversion of cyclic guanosine triphosphate (cGTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which ultimately causes the blood vessels to relax.

## Control of Tissue Blood Flow: Endothelium-Derived Relaxing or Constricting Factors

The endothelial cells lining the blood vessels synthesize several substances that when released, can affect the degree of relaxation or contraction of the vascular wall. For many of these endothelium-derived relaxing or constrictor factors, the physiological roles are just beginning to be understood.

Nitric Oxide Is a Vasodilator Released from Healthy Endothelial Cells. The most important of the endotheliumderived relaxing factors is nitric oxide (NO), a lipophilic gas that is released from endothelial cells in response to a variety of chemical and physical stimuli. Endothelialderived nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzymes synthesize NO from arginine and oxygen and by reduction of inorganic nitrate. After diffusing out of the endothelial cell, NO has a half-life in the blood of only about 6 seconds and acts mainly in the local tissues, where it is released. NO activates soluble guanylate cyclases in vascular smooth muscle cells (Figure 17-6), resulting in the conversion of cyclic guanosine triphosphate (cGTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and activation of cGMPdependent protein kinase (PKG), which has several actions that cause the blood vessels to relax.

The flow of blood through the arteries and arterioles causes shear stress on the endothelial cells because of viscous drag of the blood against the vascular walls. This stress contorts the endothelial cells in the direction of flow and causes significant increase in NO release. The NO then relaxes the blood vessels, fortunately, because the local metabolic mechanisms for controlling tissue blood flow mainly dilate the very small arteries and arterioles in each tissue. Yet, when blood flow through a microvascular portion of the circulation increases, this action secondarily stimulates the release of NO from
larger vessels as a result of increased flow and shear stress in these vessels. The released NO increases the diameters of the larger upstream blood vessels whenever microvascular blood flow increases downstream. Without such a response, the effectiveness of local blood flow control would be decreased because a significant part of the resistance to blood flow is in the upstream small arteries.

NO synthesis and release from endothelial cells are also stimulated by some vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II, which bind to specific receptors on endothelial cells. The increased NO release protects against excessive vasoconstriction.

When endothelial cells are damaged by chronic hypertension or atherosclerosis, impaired NO synthesis may contribute to excessive vasoconstriction and worsening of the hypertension and endothelial damage. If untreated, this may eventually cause vascular injury and damage to vulnerable tissues such as the heart, kidneys, and brain.

Even before NO was discovered, clinicians used nitroglycerin, amyl nitrate, and other nitrate derivatives to treat patients who had angina pectoris-that is, severe chest pain caused by ischemia of the heart muscle. These drugs, when broken down chemically, release NO and cause dilation of blood vessels throughout the body, including the coronary blood vessels.

Other important applications of NO physiology and pharmacology are the development and clinical use of drugs (e.g., sildenafil) that inhibit cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5), an enzyme that degrades cGMP. By preventing the degradation of cGMP, the PDE-5 inhibitors effectively prolong the actions of NO to cause vasodilation. The primary clinical use of the PDE-5 inhibitors is to treat erectile dysfunction. Penile erection is caused by parasympathetic nerve impulses through the pelvic nerves to the penis, where the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and NO are released. By preventing the degradation of NO, the PDE-5 inhibitors enhance the dilation of the blood vessels in the penis and aid in erection, as discussed in Chapter 81.

Endothelin Is a Powerful Vasoconstrictor Released From Damaged Endothelium. Endothelial cells also release vasoconstrictor substances. The most important of these is endothelin, a large, 27 -amino acid peptide that requires only minute amounts (nanograms) to cause powerful vasoconstriction. This substance is present in the endothelial cells of all or most blood vessels but greatly increases when the vessels are injured. The usual stimulus for release is damage to the endothelium, such as that caused by crushing the tissues or injecting a traumatizing chemical into the blood vessel. After severe blood vessel damage, local release of endothelin and subsequent vasoconstriction helps prevent extensive bleeding from arteries as large as 5 millimeters in diameter that might have been torn open by crushing injury.

Increased endothelin release is also believed to contribute to vasoconstriction when the endothelium is

damaged by hypertension. Drugs that block endothelin receptors have been used to treat pulmonary hypertension but generally have not been used for lowering blood pressure in patients with systemic arterial hypertension.

## LONG-TERM BLOOD FLOW REGULATION

Thus far, most of the mechanisms for local blood flow regulation that we have discussed act within a few seconds to a few minutes after the local tissue conditions have changed. Yet, even after full activation of these acute mechanisms, the blood flow usually is adjusted only about three quarters of the way to the exact additional requirements of the tissues. For example, when the arterial pressure suddenly increases from 100 to 150 mm Hg , the blood flow increases almost instantaneously, by about $100 \%$. Then, within 30 seconds to 2 minutes, the flow decreases back to about $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ above the original control value. This example illustrates the rapidity of the acute mechanisms for local blood flow regulation, but also demonstrates that the regulation is still incomplete because a $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ excess blood flow remains in some tissues.

However, over a period of hours, days, and weeks, a long-term type of local blood flow regulation develops in addition to the acute control. This long-term regulation gives far more complete control of blood flow. In the aforementioned example, if the arterial pressure remains at 150 mm Hg indefinitely, the blood flow through the tissues gradually approaches almost exactly the normal flow level within a few weeks. Figure 17-5 shows (dashed green curve) the extreme effectiveness of this long-term local blood flow regulation. Note that once the long-term regulation has had time to occur, long-term changes in arterial pressure between 50 and 200 mm Hg have little effect on the rate of local blood flow.

Long-term regulation of blood flow is especially important when the metabolic demands of a tissue change. Thus, if a tissue becomes chronically overactive and requires increased quantities of oxygen and other nutrients, the arterioles and capillary vessels usually increase both in number and size within a few weeks to match the needs of the tissue, unless the circulatory system has become pathological or too old to respond.

## Blood Flow Regulation by Changes in Tissue Vascularity

A key mechanism for long-term local blood flow regulation is to change the amount of vascularity of the tissues. For example, if the metabolism in a tissue is increased for a prolonged period, vascularity increases, a process generally called angiogenesis; if the metabolism is decreased, vascularity decreases. Figure 17-7 shows the large increase in the number of capillaries in a rat anterior tibialis muscle that was stimulated electrically to contract for short periods each day for 30 days, compared with the unstimulated muscle in the other leg of the animal.
![gu43687650e1](gu43687650e1.jpg)

The 30 days of intermittent electrical stimulation converted the predominantly fast-twitch, glycolytic anterior tibialis muscle to a predominantly slow-twitch, oxidative muscle with increased numbers of capillaries and decreased fiber diameter, as shown.

Thus, actual physical reconstruction of the tissue vasculature occurs to meet the needs of the tissues. This reconstruction occurs rapidly (within days) in young animals. It also occurs rapidly in new growth tissue, such as in cancerous tissue, but occurs much more slowly in old, well-established tissues. Therefore, the time required for long-term regulation to take place may be only a few days in the neonate or as long as months in older adults. Furthermore, the final degree of response is much better in younger than in older tissues; thus, in the neonate, the vascularity will adjust to match almost exactly the needs of the tissue for blood flow, whereas in older tissues, vascularity frequently lags far behind the needs of the tissues.

Role of Oxygen in Long-Term Regulation. Oxygen is important not only for acute control of local blood flow but also for long-term control. One example of this is

increased vascularity in tissues of animals that live at high altitudes, where the atmospheric oxygen is low. In premature babies who are put into oxygen tents for therapeutic purposes, the excess oxygen causes almost immediate cessation of new vascular growth in the retina of the premature baby's eyes and even causes degeneration of some of the small vessels that already have formed. When the infant is taken out of the oxygen tent, explosive overgrowth of new vessels then occurs to make up for the sudden decrease in available oxygen. Often, so much overgrowth occurs that the retinal vessels grow out from the retina into the eye's vitreous humor, eventually causing blindness, a condition called retrolental fibroplasia.

Importance of Vascular Growth Factors in Formation of New Blood Vessels. A dozen or more factors that increase growth of new blood vessels have been found, almost all of which are small peptides. The four factors that have been best characterized are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor, plateletderived growth factor (PDGF), and angiogenin, each of which has been isolated from tissues that have inadequate blood supply. Deficiency of tissue oxygen induces expression of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), transcription factors that in turn upregulate gene expression and the formation of vascular growth factors (also called angiogenic factors).

Angiogenesis begins with new vessels sprouting from other small vessels. The first step is dissolution of the basement membrane of the endothelial cells at the point of sprouting. This step is followed by rapid reproduction of new endothelial cells, which stream outward through the vessel wall in extended cords directed toward the source of the angiogenic factor. The cells in each cord continue to divide and rapidly fold over into a tube. Next, the tube connects with another tube budding from another donor vessel (another arteriole or venule) and forms a capillary loop through which blood begins to flow. If the flow is great enough, smooth muscle cells eventually invade the wall, so some of the new vessels eventually grow to be new arterioles or venules or perhaps even larger vessels. Thus, angiogenesis explains how metabolic factors in local tissues can cause growth of new vessels.

Certain other substances, such as some steroid hormones, have the opposite effect on small blood vessels, occasionally even causing dissolution of vascular cells and disappearance of vessels. Therefore, blood vessels can also be made to disappear when they are not needed. Peptides produced in the tissues can also block the growth of new blood vessels. For example, angiostatin, a fragment of the protein plasminogen, is a naturally occurring inhibitor of angiogenesis. Endostatin is another antiangiogenic peptide derived from the breakdown of collagen type XVII. Although the precise physiological functions of these antiangiogenic substances are still unknown, there is great interest in their potential use in arresting blood
vessel growth in cancerous tumors and therefore preventing the large increases in blood flow needed to sustain the nutrient supply of rapidly growing tumors.

Vascularity Determined by Maximum Blood Flow Need, Not by Average Need. An especially valuable characteristic of long-term vascular control is that vascularity is determined mainly by the maximum level of blood flow required by the tissue rather than by average need. For example, during heavy exercise, the need for whole-body blood flow often increases to six to eight times the resting blood flow. This great excess of flow may not be required for more than a few minutes each day. Nevertheless, even this short time of need can cause enough angiogenic factors to be formed by the muscles to increase their vascularity as required. Were it not for this capability, every time a person attempted heavy exercise, the muscles would fail to receive the required nutrients, especially the required oxygen, and thus the muscles would fail to contract.

However, after extra vascularity does develop, the extra blood vessels normally remain mainly vasoconstricted, opening to allow extra flow only when appropriate local stimuli such as a lack of oxygen, nerve vasodilatory stimuli, or other stimuli call forth the required extra flow.

## Blood Flow Regulation by Development of Collateral Circulation

In most tissues of the body, when an artery or a vein is blocked, a new vascular channel usually develops around the blockage and allows at least partial resupply of blood to the affected tissue. The first stage in this process is dilation of small vascular loops that already connect the vessel above the blockage to the vessel below. This dilation occurs within the first minute or two, indicating that the dilation is likely mediated by metabolic factors. After this initial opening of collateral vessels, the blood flow often is still less than $25 \%$ of that required to supply all the tissue needs. However, further opening occurs within the ensuing hours, so that within 1 day as much as half the tissue needs may be met and, within a few days, the blood flow is usually sufficient to meet the tissue needs.

The collateral vessels continue to grow for many months thereafter, usually forming multiple small collateral channels rather than one single large vessel. Under resting conditions, the blood flow may return to nearly normal, but the new channels seldom become large enough to supply the blood flow needed during strenuous tissue activity. Thus, development of collateral vessels follows the usual principles of acute and longterm local blood flow control; the acute control is rapid metabolic dilation, followed chronically by growth and enlargement of new vessels over a period of weeks and months.

An important example of the development of collateral blood vessels occurs after thrombosis of one of the coronary arteries. By the age of 60 years, many people

have experienced closure or at least partial occlusion of at least one of the smaller branch coronary vessels, but they are not aware of it because collateral blood vessels have developed rapidly enough to prevent myocardial damage. When collateral blood vessels are unable to develop quickly enough to maintain blood flow because of the rapidity or severity of the coronary insufficiency, serious heart attacks can occur.

## Vascular Remodeling in Response to Chronic Changes in Blood Flow or Blood Pressure

Vascular growth and remodeling are critical components of tissue development and growth and occur as an adaptive response to long-term changes in blood pressure or blood flow. For example, after several months of chronic exercise training, vascularity of the trained muscles increases to accommodate their higher blood flow requirements. In addition to changes in capillary density, there may also be changes in the structure of large blood vessels in response to long-term changes in blood pressure and blood flow. When blood pressure is chronically elevated above normal, for example, the large and small arteries and arterioles remodel to accommodate the increased mechanical wall stress of the higher blood pressure. In most tissues, the small arteries and arterioles rapidly respond (within seconds) to increased arterial pressure with vasoconstriction, which helps autoregulate tissue blood flow, as discussed previously. The vasoconstriction decreases lumen diameter, which in turn tends to normalize the vascular wall tension (T), which, according to Laplace's equation, is the product of the radius (r) of the blood vessel and its pressure (P): $\mathrm{T}=\mathrm{r} \times \mathrm{P}$

In small blood vessels that constrict in response to increased blood pressure, the vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells gradually-over a period of several days or weeks-rearrange themselves around the smaller lumen diameter, a process called inward eutrophic remodeling, with no change in the total cross-sectional area of the vascular wall (Figure 17-8). In larger arteries that do not constrict in response to the increased pressure, the vessel wall is exposed to increased wall tension that stimulates a hypertrophic remodeling response and an increase in the crosssectional area of the vascular wall. The hypertrophic response increases the size of vascular smooth muscle cells and stimulates formation of additional extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin, that reinforce the strength of the vascular wall to withstand the higher blood pressures. However, this hypertrophic response also makes the large blood vessels stiffer, which is a hallmark of chronic hypertension.

Another example of vascular remodeling is the change that occurs when a large vein (often the saphenous vein) is implanted in a patient for a coronary artery bypass graft procedure. Veins are normally exposed to much lower
![gu44687650e1](gu44687650e1.jpg)

Figure 17-8. Vascular remodeling in response to a chronic increase in blood pressure or blood flow. In small arteries and arterioles that constrict in response to increased blood pressure, inward eutrophic remodeling typically occurs because the lumen diameter is smaller and the vascular wall is thicker, but the total cross-sectional area of the vessel wall is hardly changed. In large blood vessels that do not constrict in response to increased blood pressure, there may be hypertrophic remodeling, with increases in thickness and total crosssectional area of the vascular wall. If blood vessels are exposed to chronic increases in blood flow, there is typically outward remodeling, with increases in lumen diameter, little change in wall thickness, and increased total cross-sectional area of the vascular wall. If the blood vessel is exposed to long-term increases in blood pressure and blood flow, there is usually outward hypertrophic remodeling, with increases in lumen diameter, wall thickness, and total cross-sectional area of the vascular wall. Chronic reductions in blood pressure and blood flow have the opposite effects, as previously described.
pressures than arteries and have much thinner walls, but when a vein is sewn onto the aorta and connected to a coronary artery, it is exposed to increases in intraluminal pressure and wall tension. The increased wall tension initiates hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells and increased extracellular matrix formation, which thicken and strengthen the wall of the vein; as a result, several months after implantation into the arterial system, the vein will typically have a wall thickness similar to that of an artery.

Vascular remodeling also occurs when a blood vessel is exposed chronically to increased or decreased blood flow. The creation of a fistula connecting a large artery and large vein, thereby completely bypassing high-resistance small vessels and capillaries, provides an especially interesting example of remodeling in the affected artery and vein. In patients with renal failure who undergo dialysis, an

arteriovenous (A-V) fistula directly from the radial artery to the antecubital vein of the forearm is created to permit vascular access for dialysis. The blood flow rate in the radial artery may increase as much as 10 to 50 times the normal flow rate, depending on the patency of the fistula. As a result of the high flow rate and high shear stress on the vessel wall, the luminal diameter of the radial artery increases progressively (outward remodeling), whereas the thickness of the vessel wall may remain unchanged, resulting in an increase in cross-sectional area of the vascular wall. In contrast, wall thickness, lumen diameter, and cross-sectional area of the vascular wall on the venous side of the fistula increase in response to increases in pressure and blood flow (outward hypertrophic remodeling). This pattern of remodeling is consistent with the idea that long-term increases in vascular wall tension cause hypertrophy and increased wall thickness in large blood vessels, whereas increased blood flow rate and shear stress cause outward remodeling and increased luminal diameter to accommodate the increased blood flow.

Chronic reductions in blood pressure and blood flow have effects opposite to those previously described. When blood flow is greatly reduced, the diameter of the vascular lumen is also reduced and, when blood pressure is reduced, the thickness of the vascular wall usually decreases. Thus, vascular remodeling is an important adaptive response of the blood vessels to tissue growth and development, as well as to physiological and pathological changes in blood pressure and blood flow to the tissues.

## HUMORAL CONTROL OF THE CIRCULATION

Humoral control of the circulation means control by substances secreted or absorbed into the body fluids, such as hormones and locally produced factors. Some of these substances are formed by special glands and transported in the blood throughout the entire body. Others are formed in local tissue areas and cause only local circulatory effects. Among the most important of the humoral factors that affect circulatory function are those described in the following sections.

## VASOCONSTRICTORS

Norepinephrine and Epinephrine. Norepinephrine is an especially powerful vasoconstrictor hormone; epinephrine is less powerful as a vasoconstrictor and, in some tissues, even causes mild vasodilation. (A special example of vasodilation caused by epinephrine is that which occurs to dilate the coronary arteries during increased heart activity.)

When the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated in most parts of the body during stress or exercise, the sympathetic nerve endings in the individual tissues release norepinephrine, which excites the heart and constricts the veins and arterioles. In addition, the sympathetic nerves to the adrenal medullae cause these glands to
secrete norepinephrine and epinephrine into the blood. These hormones then circulate to all areas of the body and cause almost the same effects on the circulation as direct sympathetic stimulation, thus providing a dual system of control: (1) direct nerve stimulation; and (2) indirect effects of norepinephrine and/or epinephrine in the circulating blood.

Angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is another powerful vasoconstrictor substance. As little as one millionth of a gram can increase the arterial pressure of a person by 50 mm Hg or more.

The effect of angiotensin II is to constrict the small arterioles powerfully. If this constriction occurs in an isolated tissue area, the blood flow to that area can be severely depressed. However, the real importance of angiotensin II is that it normally acts on many arterioles of the body at the same time to increase the total peripheral resistance and decrease sodium and water excretion by the kidneys, thereby increasing the arterial pressure. Thus, this hormone plays an integral role in the regulation of arterial pressure, as is discussed in detail in Chapter 19.

Vasopressin. Vasopressin, also called antidiuretic hormone, is even more powerful than angiotensin II as a vasoconstrictor, thus making it one of the body's most potent vascular constrictor substances. It is formed in nerve cells in the hypothalamus of the brain (see Chapters 29 and 76) but is then transported downward by nerve axons to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is finally secreted into the blood.

It is clear that vasopressin could have enormous effects on circulatory function. Yet, because only minute amounts of vasopressin are secreted in most physiological conditions, most physiologists have thought that vasopressin plays little role in vascular control. However, experiments have shown that the concentration of circulating blood vasopressin after severe hemorrhage can increase enough to attenuate reductions in arterial pressure markedly. In some cases, this action can, by itself, bring the arterial pressure almost back up to normal.

Vasopressin has the major function of greatly increasing water reabsorption from the renal tubules back into the blood (discussed in Chapter 29) and therefore helps control body fluid volume. That is why this hormone is also called antidiuretic hormone.

## VASODILATORS

Bradykinin. Several substances called kinins cause powerful vasodilation when formed in the blood and tissue fluids of some organs. The kinins are small polypeptides that are split away by proteolytic enzymes from $\alpha_{2}$-globulins in the plasma or tissue fluids. A proteolytic enzyme of particular importance for this purpose is kallikrein, which is present in the blood and tissue fluids in an inactive form. This inactive kallikrein is activated by

maceration of the blood, tissue inflammation, or other similar chemical or physical effects on the blood or tissues. As kallikrein becomes activated, it acts immediately on $\alpha_{2}$-globulin to release a kinin called kallidin, which is then converted by tissue enzymes into bradykinin. Once formed, bradykinin persists for only a few minutes because it is inactivated by the enzyme carboxypeptidase or by converting enzyme, the same enzyme that also plays an essential role in activating angiotensin, as discussed in Chapter 19. The activated kallikrein enzyme is destroyed by a kallikrein inhibitor that is also present in body fluids.

Bradykinin causes both powerful arteriolar dilation and increased capillary permeability. For example, injection of 1 microgram of bradykinin into the brachial artery of a person increases blood flow through the arm as much as sixfold, and even smaller amounts injected locally into tissues can cause marked local edema resulting from an increase in capillary pore size.

Kinins appear to play special roles in regulating blood flow and capillary leakage of fluids in inflamed tissues. It is also believed that bradykinin plays a normal role to help regulate blood flow in the skin, as well as in the salivary and gastrointestinal glands.

Histamine. Histamine is released in almost every tissue of the body if the tissue becomes damaged or inflamed or is the subject of an allergic reaction. Most of the histamine is derived from mast cells in the damaged tissues and from basophils in the blood.

Histamine has a powerful vasodilator effect on the arterioles and, like bradykinin, has the ability to increase capillary porosity greatly, allowing leakage of fluid and plasma protein into the tissues. In many pathological conditions, the intense arteriolar dilation and increased capillary porosity produced by histamine cause large quantities of fluid to leak out of the circulation into the tissues, inducing edema. The local vasodilatory and edemaproducing effects of histamine are especially prominent during allergic reactions and are discussed in Chapter 35.

## VASCULAR CONTROL BY IONS AND OTHER CHEMICAL FACTORS

Many different ions and other chemical factors can dilate or constrict local blood vessels. The following list details some of their specific effects:

1. An increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration causes vasoconstriction because of the general effect of calcium to stimulate smooth muscle contraction, as discussed in Chapter 8.
2. An increase in potassium ion concentration, within the physiological range, causes vasodilation. This effect results from the ability of potassium ions to inhibit smooth muscle contraction.
3. An increase in magnesium ion concentration causes powerful vasodilation because magnesium ions inhibit smooth muscle contraction.
4. An increase in hydrogen ion concentration (decrease in pH ) causes dilation of the arterioles. Conversely, a slight decrease in hydrogen ion concentration causes arteriolar constriction.
5. Anions that have significant effects on blood vessels are acetate and citrate, both of which cause mild degrees of vasodilation.
6. An increase in carbon dioxide concentration causes moderate vasodilation in most tissues but marked vasodilation in the brain. Also, carbon dioxide in the blood, acting on the brain vasomotor center, has an extremely powerful indirect effect, transmitted through the sympathetic nervous vasoconstrictor system, that causes widespread vasoconstriction throughout the body.

## Most Vasodilators or Vasoconstrictors Have Little Effect on Long-Term Blood Flow Unless They Alter the Metabolic Rate of the Tissues.

In most experimental studies, tissue blood flow and cardiac output (the sum of flow to all the body's tissues) are not substantially altered, except for 1 or 2 days, when large amounts of powerful vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II or vasodilators such as bradykinin are chronically infused. Why is blood flow not significantly altered in most tissues, even in the presence of very large amounts of these vasoactive agents?

To answer this question, we must return to one of the fundamental principles of circulatory function that was previously discussed-the ability of each tissue to autoregulate its own blood flow according to the metabolic needs and other functions of the tissue. Administration of a powerful vasoconstrictor, such as angiotensin II, may cause transient decreases in tissue blood flow and cardiac output but usually has little long-term effect if it does not alter metabolic rate of the tissues. Likewise, most vasodilators cause only short-term changes in tissue blood flow and cardiac output if they do not alter tissue metabolism. Therefore, blood flow is generally regulated according to the specific needs of the tissues, as long as the arterial pressure is adequate to perfuse the tissues.

# Nervous Regulation of the Circulation and Rapid Control of Arterial Pressure 

## NERVOUS REGULATION OF THE CIRCULATION

As discussed in Chapter 17, adjustment of blood flow in the tissues and organs of the body is mainly the function of local tissue control mechanisms. In this chapter, we discuss how nervous control of the circulation has more global functions, such as redistributing blood flow to different areas of the body, increasing or decreasing pumping activity by the heart, and providing rapid control of systemic arterial pressure.

The nervous system controls the circulation almost entirely through the autonomic nervous system. The total function of this system is presented in Chapter 61, and this subject was also introduced in Chapter 17. In this chapter, we consider additional specific anatomical and functional characteristics.

## AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

The most important part of the autonomic nervous system for regulating the circulation is the sympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system, however, contributes importantly to regulation of heart function, as described later in the chapter.

Sympathetic Nervous System. Figure 18-1 shows the anatomy of sympathetic nervous control of the circulation. Sympathetic vasomotor nerve fibers leave the spinal cord through all the thoracic spinal nerves and through the first one or two lumbar spinal nerves. They then pass immediately into a sympathetic chain, one of which lies on each side of the vertebral column. Next, they pass by two routes to the circulation: (1) through specific sympathetic nerves that innervate mainly the vasculature of the internal viscera and the heart, as shown on the right side of Figure 18-1; and (2) almost immediately into peripheral portions of the spinal nerves distributed to the vasculature of the peripheral areas. The precise pathways of these fibers in the spinal cord and in the sympathetic chains are discussed in Chapter 61.

Sympathetic Innervation of the Blood Vessels. Figure 18-2 shows the distribution of sympathetic nerve fibers to the blood vessels, demonstrating that in most tissues, all the vessels except the capillaries are innervated. Precapillary sphincters and metarterioles are innervated in some tissues, such as the mesenteric blood vessels, although their sympathetic innervation is usually not as dense as in the small arteries, arterioles, and veins.

The innervation of the small arteries and arterioles allows sympathetic stimulation to increase resistance to blood flow and thereby decrease the rate of blood flow through the tissues.

The innervation of the large vessels, particularly of the veins, makes it possible for sympathetic stimulation to decrease the volume of these vessels. This decrease in volume can push blood into the heart and thereby plays a major role in regulation of heart pumping, as we explain later in this and subsequent chapters.

Sympathetic Stimulation Increases Heart Rate and Contractility. Sympathetic fibers also go directly to the heart, as shown in Figure 18-1. As discussed in Chapter 9, sympathetic stimulation markedly increases the activity of the heart, both increasing the heart rate and enhancing its strength and volume of pumping.

Parasympathetic Stimulation Decreases Heart Rate and Contractility. Although the parasympathetic nervous system is exceedingly important for many other autonomic functions of the body, such as control of multiple gastrointestinal actions, it plays only a minor role in regulating vascular function in most tissues. Its most important circulatory effect is to control heart rate by way of parasympathetic nerve fibers to the heart in the vagus nerves, shown in Figure 18-1 by the dashed red line from the brain medulla directly to the heart.

The effects of parasympathetic stimulation on heart function were discussed in detail in Chapter 9. Principally, parasympathetic stimulation causes a marked decrease in heart rate and a slight decrease in heart muscle contractility.

Figure 18-1. Anatomy of sympathetic nervous control of the circulation. Also, shown by the dashed red line, is a vagus nerve that carries parasympathetic signals to the heart.

## Sympathetic Vasoconstrictor System and Its Control by the Central Nervous System

The sympathetic nerves carry large numbers of vasoconstrictor nerve fibers and only a few vasodilator fibers. The vasoconstrictor fibers are distributed to essentially all segments of the circulation, but more to some tissues than to others. This sympathetic vasoconstrictor effect is especially powerful in the kidneys, intestines, spleen, and skin

but is much less potent in skeletal muscle, heart, and the brain.

Vasomotor Center in the Brain and Its Control of the Vasoconstrictor System. Located bilaterally mainly in the reticular substance of the medulla and lower third of the pons is an area called the vasomotor center, shown in Figure 18-1 and Figure 18-3. This center transmits parasympathetic impulses through the vagus nerves to the heart and sympathetic impulses through the spinal cord and peripheral sympathetic nerves to virtually all arteries, arterioles, and veins of the body.

Although the total organization of the vasomotor center is still unclear, experiments have made it possible to identify certain important areas in this center:

1. A vasoconstrictor area located bilaterally in the anterolateral portions of the upper medulla. The neurons originating in this area distribute their fibers

![gu48687650e1](gu48687650e1.jpg)

Figure 18-4. Effect of total spinal anesthesia on the arterial pressure, showing a marked decrease in pressure resulting from loss of vasomotor tone.
to all levels of the spinal cord, where they excite preganglionic vasoconstrictor neurons of the sympathetic nervous system.
2. A vasodilator area located bilaterally in the anterolateral portions of the lower half of the medulla. The fibers from these neurons project upward to the vasoconstrictor area just described, inhibiting the vasoconstrictor activity of this area and causing vasodilation.
3. A sensory area located bilaterally in the nucleus tractus solitarius in the posterolateral portions of the medulla and lower pons. The neurons of this area receive sensory nerve signals from the circulatory system mainly through the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, and output signals from this sensory area then help control activities of the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator areas of the vasomotor center, thus providing reflex control of many circulatory functions. An example is the baroreceptor reflex for controlling arterial pressure, described later in this chapter.

Continuous Partial Constriction of Blood Vessels by Sympathetic Vasoconstrictor Tone. Under normal conditions, the vasoconstrictor area of the vasomotor center transmits signals continuously to the sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve fibers over the entire body, causing slow firing of these fibers at a rate of about 0.5 to 2 impulses per second. This continual firing is called sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. These impulses normally maintain a partial state of constriction in the blood vessels, called vasomotor tone.

Figure 18-4 demonstrates the significance of vasoconstrictor tone. In the experiment shown in this figure, a spinal anesthetic was administered to an animal. This anesthetic blocked all transmission of sympathetic nerve impulses from the spinal cord to the periphery. As a result, the arterial pressure fell from 100 to 50 mm Hg , demonstrating the effect of the loss of vasoconstrictor
tone throughout the body. A few minutes later, a small amount of the hormone norepinephrine was injected into the blood (norepinephrine is the principal vasoconstrictor hormonal substance secreted at the endings of the sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve fibers). As this injected hormone was transported in the blood to blood vessels, the vessels once again became constricted, and the arterial pressure rose to a level even greater than normal for 1 to 3 minutes until the norepinephrine was destroyed.

Control of Heart Activity by the Vasomotor Center. At the same time that the vasomotor center regulates the amount of vascular constriction, it also controls heart activity. The lateral portions of the vasomotor center transmit excitatory impulses through the sympathetic nerve fibers to the heart when there is a need to increase heart rate and contractility. Conversely, when there is a need to decrease heart pumping, the medial portion of the vasomotor center sends signals to the adjacent dorsal motor nuclei of the vagus nerves, which then transmit parasympathetic impulses through the vagus nerves to the heart to decrease heart rate and heart contractility. Therefore, the vasomotor center can increase or decrease heart activity. Heart rate and the strength of heart contractions ordinarily increase when vasoconstriction occurs and ordinarily decrease when vasoconstriction is inhibited.

## Control of the Vasomotor Center by Higher Nervous

Centers. Large numbers of small neurons located throughout the reticular substance of the pons, mesencephalon, and diencephalon can excite or inhibit the vasomotor center. This reticular substance is shown in Figure 18-3. In general, the neurons in the more lateral and superior portions of the reticular substance cause excitation, whereas the more medial and inferior portions cause inhibition.

The hypothalamus plays a special role in controlling the vasoconstrictor system because it can exert powerful excitatory or inhibitory effects on the vasomotor center. The posterolateral portions of the hypothalamus cause mainly excitation, whereas the anterior portion can cause mild excitation or inhibition, depending on the precise part of the anterior hypothalamus that is stimulated.

Many parts of the cerebral cortex can also excite or inhibit the vasomotor center. Stimulation of the motor cortex, for example, excites the vasomotor center because of impulses transmitted downward into the hypothalamus and then to the vasomotor center. Also, stimulation of the anterior temporal lobe, orbital areas of the frontal cortex, anterior part of the cingulate gyrus, amygdala, septum, and hippocampus can all excite or inhibit the vasomotor center, depending on the precise portions of these areas that are stimulated and the intensity of the stimulus. Thus, widespread basal areas of the brain can have profound effects on cardiovascular function.

Norepinephrine Is the Sympathetic Vasoconstrictor Neurotransmitter. The substance secreted at the endings

of the vasoconstrictor nerves is almost entirely norepinephrine, which acts directly on the alpha-adrenergic receptors of the vascular smooth muscle to cause vasoconstriction, as discussed in Chapter 61.

Adrenal Medullae and Their Relationship to the Sympathetic Vasoconstrictor System. Sympathetic impulses are transmitted to the adrenal medullae at the same time that they are transmitted to the blood vessels. These impulses cause the medullae to secrete epinephrine and norepinephrine into the circulating blood. These two hormones are carried in the blood stream to all parts of the body, where they act directly on all blood vessels and usually cause vasoconstriction. In a few tissues, epinephrine causes vasodilation because it also stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors, which dilates rather than constricts certain vessels, as discussed in Chapter 61.

Sympathetic Vasodilator System and Its Control by the Central Nervous System. The sympathetic nerves to skeletal muscles carry sympathetic vasodilator fibers, as well as constrictor fibers. In some animals, such as the cat, these dilator fibers release acetylcholine, not norepinephrine, at their endings. However, in primates, the vasodilator effect is believed to be caused by epinephrine exciting specific beta-adrenergic receptors in the muscle vasculature.

The pathway for central nervous system (CNS) control of the vasodilator system is shown by the dashed lines in Figure 18-3. The principal area of the brain controlling this system is the anterior hypothalamus.

Possible Role of the Sympathetic Vasodilator System. The sympathetic vasodilator system does not appear to play a major role in the control of the circulation in humans because complete block of the sympathetic nerves to the muscles hardly affects the ability of these muscles to control their own blood flow in many physiological conditions. Yet, some experiments have suggested that at the onset of exercise, the sympathetic system might cause initial vasodilation in skeletal muscles to allow an anticipatory increase in blood flow, even before the muscles require increased nutrients. There is evidence in humans that this sympathetic vasodilator response in skeletal muscles may be mediated by circulating epinephrine, which stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors, or by nitric oxide released from the vascular endothelium in response to stimulation by acetylcholine.

Emotional Fainting-Vasovagal Syncope. An interesting vasodilatory reaction occurs in people who experience intense emotional disturbances that cause fainting. In this case, the muscle vasodilator system becomes activated and, at the same time, the vagal cardioinhibitory center transmits strong signals to the heart to slow the heart rate markedly. The arterial pressure falls rapidly, which reduces blood flow to the brain and causes the person to lose consciousness. This overall effect is called vasovagal syncope. Emotional fainting begins with disturbing thoughts in the cerebral cortex. The pathway probably then goes to the vasodilatory center of the anterior hypothalamus next to the vagal centers of the medulla, to the heart through the vagus nerves, and also through the spinal cord to the sympathetic vasodilator nerves of the muscles.

## Role of the Nervous System in Rapid Control of Arterial Pressure

One of the most important functions of nervous control of the circulation is its capability to cause rapid increases in arterial pressure. For this purpose, the entire vasoconstrictor and cardioaccelerator functions of the sympathetic nervous system are stimulated together. At the same time, there is reciprocal inhibition of parasympathetic vagal inhibitory signals to the heart. Thus, the following three major changes occur simultaneously, each of which helps increase arterial pressure:

1. Most arterioles of the systemic circulation are constricted, which greatly increases the total peripheral resistance, thereby increasing the arterial pressure.
2. The veins especially (but the other large vessels of the circulation as well) are strongly constricted. This constriction displaces blood out of the large peripheral blood vessels toward the heart, thus increasing the volume of blood in the heart chambers. The stretch of the heart then causes the heart to beat with greater force and therefore to pump increased quantities of blood. This also increases the arterial pressure.
3. Finally, the heart is directly stimulated by the autonomic nervous system, further enhancing cardiac pumping. Much of this enhanced cardiac pumping is caused by an increase in the heart rate, which sometimes increases to as much as three times normal. In addition, sympathetic nervous signals directly increase the contractile force of the heart muscle, increasing the capability of the heart to pump larger volumes of blood. During strong sympathetic stimulation, the heart can pump about two times as much blood as under normal conditions, which contributes still more to the acute rise in arterial pressure.

Nervous Control of Arterial Pressure Is Rapid. An especially important characteristic of nervous control of arterial pressure is its rapidity of response, beginning within seconds and often increasing the pressure to two times normal within 5 to 10 seconds. Conversely, sudden inhibition of nervous cardiovascular stimulation can decrease the arterial pressure to as little as half-normal within 10 to 40 seconds. Therefore, nervous control is the most rapid mechanism for arterial pressure regulation.

## INCREASES IN ARTERIAL PRESSURE DURING MUSCLE EXERCISE AND OTHER STRESSES

An important example of the nervous system's ability to increase arterial pressure is the rise in pressure that occurs during muscle exercise. During heavy exercise, the muscles require greatly increased blood flow. Part of this increase results from local vasodilation of the muscle vasculature caused by increased metabolism of the muscle cells, as explained in Chapter 17. An additional increase results from simultaneous elevation of arterial pressure

caused by sympathetic stimulation of the overall circulation during exercise. In heavy exercise, the arterial pressure rises by about $30 \%$ to $40 \%$, which further increases blood flow by almost 2 -fold.

The increase in arterial pressure during exercise results mainly from effects of the nervous system. At the same time that the motor areas of the brain become activated to cause exercise, most of the reticular activating system of the brain stem is also activated, which includes greatly increased stimulation of the vasoconstrictor and cardioacceleratory areas of the vasomotor center. These effects rapidly increase the arterial pressure to keep pace with the increase in muscle activity.

In many other types of stress besides muscle exercise, a similar rise in pressure can also occur. For example, during extreme fright, the arterial pressure sometimes rises by as much as 75 to 100 mm Hg within a few seconds. This response is called the alarm reaction, and it provides an elevated arterial pressure that can immediately supply blood to the muscles of the body that might be needed to respond instantly to enable flight from danger.

## REFLEX MECHANISMS FOR MAINTAINING NORMAL ARTERIAL PRESSURE

Aside from the exercise and stress functions of the autonomic nervous system to increase arterial pressure,
multiple subconscious special nervous control mechanisms operate all the time to maintain the arterial pressure at or near normal. Almost all these are negative feedback reflex mechanisms, described in the following sections.

## Baroreceptor Arterial Pressure Control System—Baroreceptor Reflexes

The best known of the nervous mechanisms for arterial pressure control is the baroreceptor reflex. Basically, this reflex is initiated by stretch receptors, called baroreceptors or pressoreceptors, located at specific points in the walls of several large systemic arteries. A rise in arterial pressure stretches the baroreceptors and causes them to transmit signals into the CNS. Feedback signals are then sent back through the autonomic nervous system to the circulation to reduce arterial pressure down toward the normal level.

Physiologic Anatomy of the Baroreceptors and Their Innervation. Baroreceptors are spray-type nerve endings that lie in the walls of the arteries and are stimulated when stretched. A few baroreceptors are located in the wall of almost every large artery of the thoracic and neck regions but, as shown in Figure 18-5, baroreceptors are extremely abundant in the following regions: (1) the wall of each internal carotid artery, slightly above the carotid bifurcation, an area known as the carotid sinus; and (2) the wall of the aortic arch.

Figure 18-6. Activation of the baroreceptors at different levels of arterial pressure. $\Delta \mathrm{I}$, Change in carotid sinus nerve impulses per second; $\Delta P$, change in arterial blood pressure (in mm Hg ).

Figure 18-5 shows that signals from the carotid baroreceptors are transmitted through small Hering's nerves to the glossopharyngeal nerves in the high neck and then to the nucleus tractus solitarius in the medullary area of the brain stem. Signals from the aortic baroreceptors in the arch of the aorta are transmitted through the vagus nerves to the same nucleus tractus solitarius of the medulla.

Response of the Baroreceptors to Changes in Arterial Pressure. Figure 18-6 shows the effects of different arterial pressure levels on the rate of impulse transmission in a Hering's carotid sinus nerve. Note that the carotid sinus baroreceptors are not stimulated at all by pressures between 0 and 50 to 60 mm Hg but, above these levels, they respond progressively more rapidly and reach a maximum at about 180 mm Hg . The responses of the aortic baroreceptors are similar to those of the carotid receptors except that they operate, in general, at arterial pressure levels about 30 mm Hg higher.

Note especially that in the normal operating range of arterial pressure, around 100 mm Hg , even a slight change in pressure causes a strong change in the baroreflex signal to readjust arterial pressure back toward normal. Thus, the baroreceptor feedback mechanism functions most effectively in the pressure range where it is most needed.

The baroreceptors respond rapidly to changes in arterial pressure; the rate of impulse firing increases in the fraction of a second during each systole and decreases again during diastole. Furthermore, the baroreceptors respond much more to a rapidly changing pressure than to a stationary pressure. That is, if the mean arterial pressure is 150 mm Hg but at that moment is rising rapidly, the rate of impulse transmission may be as much as twice that when the pressure is stationary at 150 mm Hg .

## Circulatory Reflex Initiated by the Baroreceptors.

After the baroreceptor signals have entered the nucleus tractus solitarius of the medulla, secondary signals inhibit

the vasoconstrictor center of the medulla and excite the vagal parasympathetic center. The net effects are as follows: (1) vasodilation of the veins and arterioles throughout the peripheral circulatory system; and (2) decreased heart rate and strength of heart contraction. Therefore, excitation of the baroreceptors by high pressure in the arteries reflexly causes the arterial pressure to decrease because of a decrease in peripheral resistance and a decrease in cardiac output. Conversely, low pressure has the opposite effects, reflexly causing the pressure to rise back toward normal.

Figure 18-7 shows a typical reflex change in arterial pressure caused by occluding the two common carotid arteries. This reduces the carotid sinus pressure; as a result, signals from the baroreceptors decrease and cause less inhibitory effect on the vasomotor center. The vasomotor center then becomes much more active than usual, causing the aortic arterial pressure to rise and remain elevated during the 10 minutes that the carotids are occluded. Removal of the occlusion allows the pressure in the carotid sinuses to rise, and the carotid sinus reflex now causes the aortic pressure to fall almost immediately to slightly below normal as a momentary overcompensation and then return to normal in another minute.

Baroreceptors Attenuate Blood Pressure Changes During Changes in Body Posture. The ability of the baroreceptors to maintain relatively constant arterial pressure in the upper body is important when a person stands up after lying down. Immediately on standing, the arterial pressure in the head and upper part of the body tends to fall, and marked reduction of this pressure could cause loss of consciousness. However, the falling pressure at the baroreceptors elicits an immediate reflex, resulting in strong sympathetic discharge throughout the body that minimizes the decrease in pressure in the head and upper body.

## Pressure Buffer Function of the Baroreceptor Control

System. Because the baroreceptor system opposes increases or decreases in arterial pressure, it is called a pressure buffer system, and the nerves from the baroreceptors are called buffer nerves.

Figure 18-8 shows the importance of this buffer function of the baroreceptors. The upper panel in this figure shows an arterial pressure recording for 2 hours from a normal dog, and the lower panel shows an arterial pressure recording from a dog whose baroreceptor nerves from the carotid sinuses and the aorta had been removed. Note the extreme variability of pressure in the denervated dog caused by simple events of the day, such as lying down, standing, excitement, eating, defecation, and noises.

Figure 18-9 shows the frequency distributions of the mean arterial pressures recorded for a 24 -hour day in the normal dog and the denervated dog. Note that when the baroreceptors were functioning normally, the mean arterial pressure remained within a narrow range of between 85 and 115 mm Hg throughout the day and, for most of the day, it remained at about 100 mm Hg . After denervation of the baroreceptors, however, the frequency distribution curve flattened, showing that the pressure range increased 2.5 -fold, frequently falling to as low as 50 mm Hg or rising to more than 160 mm Hg . Thus, one can see the extreme variability of pressure in the absence of the arterial baroreceptor system.

(Modified from Cowley AW Jr, Liard JP, Guyton AC: Role of baroreceptor reflex in daily control of arterial blood pressure and other variables in dogs. Circ Res 32:564, 1973.)

A primary purpose of the arterial baroreceptor system is therefore to reduce the minute by minute variation in arterial pressure to about one-third that which would occur if the baroreceptor system were not present.

Are the Baroreceptors Important in Long-Term Regulation of Arterial Pressure? Although the arterial baroreceptors provide powerful moment to moment control of arterial pressure, their importance in long-term blood pressure regulation has been controversial. One reason that the baroreceptors have been considered by some physiologists to be relatively unimportant in chronic regulation of arterial pressure is that they tend to reset in 1 to 2 days to the pressure level to which they are exposed. That is, if the arterial pressure rises from the normal value of 100 to 160 mm Hg , a very high rate of baroreceptor impulses is at first transmitted. During the next few minutes, the rate of firing diminishes considerably. Then, it diminishes much more slowly during the next 1 to 2 days, at the end of which time the rate of firing will have returned to nearly normal, despite the fact that the mean arterial pressure still remains at 160 mm Hg . Conversely, when the arterial pressure falls to a very low level, the baroreceptors at first transmit no impulses but gradually, over 1 to 2 days, the rate of baroreceptor firing returns toward the control level.

This resetting of the baroreceptors may attenuate their potency as a control system for correcting disturbances that tend to change arterial pressure for longer than a few days at a time. Experimental studies, however, have suggested that the baroreceptors do not completely reset and may therefore contribute to long-term blood pressure regulation, especially by influencing sympathetic nerve activity of the kidneys. For example, with prolonged increases in arterial pressure, the baroreceptor reflexes may mediate

decreases in renal sympathetic nerve activity that promote increased excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys. This action, in turn, causes a gradual decrease in blood volume, which helps restore arterial pressure toward normal. Thus, long-term regulation of mean arterial pressure by the baroreceptors requires interaction with additional systems, principally the renal-body fluid-pressure control system (along with its associated nervous and hormonal mechanisms), discussed in Chapters 19 and 30.

Experimental studies and clinical trials have shown that chronic electrical stimulation of carotid sinus afferent nerve fibers can cause sustained reductions in sympathetic nervous system activity and arterial pressure of at least 15 to 20 mm Hg . These observations suggest that most, if not all, the baroreceptor reflex resetting that occurs when increases in arterial pressure are sustained, as in chronic hypertension, is due to resetting of the carotid sinus nerve mechanoreceptors themselves rather than resetting in central nervous system vasomotor centers.

## Control of Arterial Pressure by the Carotid and Aortic

Chemoreceptors-Effect of Low Oxygen on Arterial Pressure. Closely associated with the baroreceptor pressure control system is a chemoreceptor reflex that operates in much the same way as the baroreceptor reflex except that chemoreceptors, instead of stretch receptors, initiate the response.

The chemoreceptor cells are sensitive to low oxygen or elevated carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels. They are located in several small chemoreceptor organs about 2 millimeters in size (two carotid bodies, one of which lies in the bifurcation of each common carotid artery, and usually one to three aortic bodies adjacent to the aorta). The chemoreceptors excite nerve fibers that along with the baroreceptor fibers, pass through Hering's nerves and the vagus nerves into the vasomotor center of the brain stem.

Each carotid or aortic body is supplied with an abundant blood flow through a small nutrient artery, so the chemoreceptors are always in close contact with arterial blood. Whenever the arterial pressure falls below a critical level, the chemoreceptors become stimulated because diminished blood flow causes decreased oxygen, as well as excess buildup of carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions that are not removed by the slowly flowing blood.

The signals transmitted from the chemoreceptors excite the vasomotor center, and this response elevates the arterial pressure back toward normal. However, this chemoreceptor reflex is not a powerful arterial pressure controller until the arterial pressure falls below 80 mm Hg . Therefore, it is at the lower pressures that this reflex becomes important to help prevent further decreases in arterial pressure.

The chemoreceptors are discussed in much more detail in Chapter 42 in relation to respiratory control, in which they normally play a far more important role than in blood pressure control. However, activation of the chemoreceptors may also contribute to increases in arterial pressure
in conditions such as severe obesity and obstructive sleep apnea, a serious sleep disorder associated with repetitive episodes of nocturnal breathing cessation and hypoxia.

Atrial and Pulmonary Artery Reflexes Regulate Arterial Pressure. The atria and pulmonary arteries have stretch receptors in their walls called low-pressure receptors. Lowpressure receptors are similar to the baroreceptor stretch receptors of the large systemic arteries. These low-pressure receptors play an important role, especially in minimizing arterial pressure changes in response to changes in blood volume. For example, if 300 milliliters of blood suddenly are infused into a dog with all receptors intact, the arterial pressure rises only about 15 mm Hg . With the arterial baroreceptors denervated, the pressure rises about 40 mm Hg . If the low-pressure receptors also are denervated, the arterial pressure rises about 100 mm Hg .

Thus, one can see that even though the low-pressure receptors in the pulmonary artery and in the atria cannot detect the systemic arterial pressure, they do detect simultaneous increases in pressure in the low-pressure areas of the circulation caused by increase in volume. Also, they elicit reflexes parallel to the baroreceptor reflexes to make the total reflex system more potent for control of arterial pressure.

Atrial Reflexes That Activate the Kidneys-The Volume Reflex. Stretch of the atria and activation of low-pressure atrial receptors also causes reflex reductions in renal sympathetic nerve activity, decreased tubular reabsorption, and dilation of afferent arterioles in the kidneys (Figure 18-10). Signals are also transmitted simultaneously from the atria to the hypothalamus to decrease secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The decreased afferent arteriolar resistance in the kidneys causes the glomerular capillary pressure to rise, with a resultant increase in filtration of fluid into the kidney tubules. The decrease in ADH level diminishes the reabsorption of water from the tubules. The combination of these effects-an increase in glomerular filtration and a decrease in reabsorption of the fluid-increases fluid loss by the kidneys and attenuates the increased blood volume. Atrial stretch caused by increased blood volume also elicits release of atrial natriuretic peptide, a hormone that adds further to the excretion of sodium and water in the urine and return of blood volume toward normal (see Figure 18-10).

All these mechanisms that tend to return blood volume back toward normal after a volume overload act indirectly as pressure controllers, as well as blood volume controllers, because excess volume drives the heart to greater cardiac output and higher arterial pressure. This volume reflex mechanism is discussed again in Chapter 30, along with other mechanisms of blood volume control.

Increased Atrial Pressure Raises Heart Rate—Bainbridge Reflex. Increases in atrial pressure sometimes increase the heart rate as much as $75 \%$, particularly when the prevailing

![gu54687650e1](gu54687650e1.jpg)

Figure 18-10. Reflex responses to increased blood volume which increase arterial pressure and atrial stretch.
heart rate is slow. When the heart rate is rapid, atrial stretch cause by infusion of fluids may reduce the heart rate due to activation of arterial baroreceptors. Thus, the net effect of increased blood volume and atrial stretch on heart rate depends on the relative contributions of the baroreceptor reflexes (which tends to slow the heart rate) and the Bainbridge reflex which tends to accelerate the heart rate, as shown in Figure 18-10. When blood volume is increased above normal, the Bainbridge reflex often increases heart rate despite the inhibitory actions of the baroreflexes.

A small part of the increased heart rate associated with increased blood volume and atrial stretch is caused by a direct effect of the increased atrial volume to stretch the sinus node; it was noted in Chapter 10 that such direct stretch can increase the heart rate as much as $15 \%$. An additional $40 \%$ to $60 \%$ increase in heart rate is caused by the Bainbridge reflex. The stretch receptors of the atria that elicit the Bainbridge reflex transmit their afferent signals through the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain. Then efferent signals are transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increase the heart rate and strength of heart contraction. Thus, this reflex helps prevent damming of blood in the veins, atria, and pulmonary circulation.

## DECREASED BLOOD FLOW TO BRAIN VASOMOTOR CENTER ELICITS INCREASED BLOOD PRESSURE-CNS ISCHEMIC RESPONSE

Most nervous control of blood pressure is achieved by reflexes that originate in the baroreceptors, chemoreceptors,
and low-pressure receptors, all of which are located in the peripheral circulation outside the brain. However, when blood flow to the vasomotor center in the lower brain stem becomes decreased severely enough to cause nutritional deficiency-that is, to cause cerebral ischemia-the vasoconstrictor and cardioaccelerator neurons in the vasomotor center respond directly to the ischemia and become strongly excited. When this excitation occurs, the systemic arterial pressure often rises to a level as high as the heart can possibly pump. This effect is believed to be caused by failure of the slowly flowing blood to carry carbon dioxide away from the brain stem vasomotor center. At low levels of blood flow to the vasomotor center, the local concentration of carbon dioxide increases greatly and has an extremely potent effect in stimulating the sympathetic vasomotor nervous control areas in the brain's medulla.

It is possible that other factors, such as buildup of lactic acid and other acidic substances in the vasomotor center, also contribute to the marked stimulation and elevation in arterial pressure. This arterial pressure elevation in response to cerebral ischemia is known as the CNS ischemic response.

The ischemic effect on vasomotor activity can elevate the mean arterial pressure dramatically, sometimes to as high as 250 mm Hg for as long as 10 minutes. The degree of sympathetic vasoconstriction caused by intense cerebral ischemia is often so great that some of the peripheral vessels become totally or almost totally occluded. The kidneys, for example, often cease their production of urine entirely because of renal arteriolar constriction in response to the sympathetic discharge. Therefore, the CNS ischemic

response is one of the most powerful of all the activators of the sympathetic vasoconstrictor system.

Importance of CNS Ischemic Response as a Regulator of Arterial Pressure. Despite the powerful nature of the CNS ischemic response, it does not become significant until the arterial pressure falls far below normal, down to 60 mm Hg and below, reaching its greatest degree of stimulation at a pressure of 15 to 20 mm Hg . Therefore, the CNS ischemic response is not one of the normal mechanisms for regulating arterial pressure. Instead, it operates principally as an emergency pressure control system that acts rapidly and powerfully to prevent further decrease in arterial pressure whenever blood flow to the brain decreases dangerously close to the lethal level. It is sometimes called the last-ditch stand pressure control mechanism.

Cushing Reaction to Increased Pressure Around the Brain. The Cushing reaction is a special type of CNS ischemic response that results from increased pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid around the brain in the cranial vault. For example, when the cerebrospinal fluid pressure rises to equal the arterial pressure, it compresses the whole brain, as well as the arteries in the brain, and cuts off the blood supply to the brain. This action initiates a CNS ischemic response that causes the arterial pressure to rise. When the arterial pressure has risen to a level higher than the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, blood will flow once again into the vessels of the brain to relieve the brain ischemia. Ordinarily, the blood pressure reaches a new equilibrium level slightly higher than the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, thus allowing blood to begin to flow through the brain again. The Cushing reaction helps protect vital centers of the brain from loss of nutrition if the cerebrospinal fluid pressure ever rises high enough to compress the cerebral arteries.

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF NERVOUS CONTROL OF ARTERIAL PRESSURE

## ROLE OF THE SKELETAL NERVES AND SKELETAL MUSCLES IN INCREASING CARDIAC OUTPUT AND ARTERIAL PRESSURE

Although most rapidly acting nervous control of the circulation is affected through the autonomic nervous system, at least two conditions exist in which the skeletal nerves and muscles also play major roles in circulatory responses.

Abdominal Compression Reflex Increases Cardiac Output and Arterial Pressure. When a baroreceptor or chemoreceptor reflex is elicited, nerve signals are transmitted simultaneously through skeletal nerves to skeletal muscles of the body, particularly to the abdominal muscles. Muscle contraction then compresses all the
venous reservoirs of the abdomen, helping translocate blood out of the abdominal vascular reservoirs toward the heart. As a result, increased quantities of blood are made available for the heart to pump. This overall response is called the abdominal compression reflex. The resulting effect on the circulation is the same as that caused by sympathetic vasoconstrictor impulses when they constrict the veins-an increase in both cardiac output and arterial pressure. The abdominal compression reflex is probably much more important than was realized in the past because it is well known that people whose skeletal muscles have been paralyzed are considerably more prone to hypotensive episodes than people with normal skeletal muscles.

Skeletal Muscle Contraction Increases Cardiac Output and Arterial Pressure During Exercise. When the skeletal muscles contract during exercise, they compress blood vessels throughout the body. Even anticipation of exercise tightens the muscles, thereby compressing the vessels in the muscles and in the abdomen. This compression translocates blood from the peripheral vessels into the heart and lungs and, therefore, increases cardiac output. This effect is essential in helping cause the fivefold to sevenfold increase in cardiac output that sometimes occurs during heavy exercise. The rise in cardiac output, in turn, is an essential ingredient in increasing the arterial pressure during exercise, from a normal mean of 100 mm Hg up to 130 to 160 mm Hg .

## RESPIRATORY WAVES IN THE ARTERIAL PRESSURE

With each cycle of respiration, the arterial pressure usually rises and falls 4 to 6 mm Hg in a wavelike manner, causing respiratory waves in the arterial pressure. The waves result from several different effects, some of which are reflex in nature, as follows:

1. Many of the breathing signals that arise in the respiratory center of the medulla spill over into the vasomotor center with each respiratory cycle.
2. Every time a person inspires, the pressure in the thoracic cavity becomes more negative than usual, causing the blood vessels in the chest to expand. This reduces the quantity of blood returning to the left side of the heart and thereby momentarily decreases the cardiac output and arterial pressure.
3. The pressure changes caused in the thoracic vessels by respiration can excite vascular and atrial stretch receptors.
Although it is difficult to analyze the exact relations of all these factors in causing the respiratory pressure waves, the net result during normal respiration is usually an increase in arterial pressure during the early part of expiration and a decrease in pressure during the remainder of the respiratory cycle. During deep respiration, the blood

pressure can rise and fall as much as 20 mm Hg with each respiratory cycle.

## Arterial Pressure Vasomotor WavesOscillation of Pressure Reflex Control Systems

Often while recording arterial pressure, in addition to the small pressure waves caused by respiration, some much larger waves are also noted-as high as 10 to 40 mm Hg at times-that rise and fall more slowly than the respiratory waves. The duration of each cycle varies from 26 seconds in the anesthetized dog to 7 to 10 seconds in the unanesthetized human. These waves are called vasomotor waves or Mayer waves. Such records are illustrated in Figure 18-11, showing the cyclical rise and fall in arterial pressure.

The cause of vasomotor waves is reflex oscillation of one or more nervous pressure control mechanisms, some of which are the following.

Oscillation of Baroreceptor and Chemoreceptor Reflexes. The vasomotor waves of Figure 18-11B are often seen in experimental pressure recordings, although they are usually much less intense than shown in the figure. They are caused mainly by oscillation of the baroreceptor reflex. That is, a high pressure excites the baroreceptors, which then inhibits the sympathetic nervous system and lowers the pressure a few seconds later. The decreased pressure, in turn, reduces the baroreceptor stimulation and allows the vasomotor center to become active once again, elevating the pressure to a high value. The response is not instantaneous, and it is delayed until a few seconds later. This high pressure then initiates another cycle, and the oscillation continues.

The chemoreceptor reflex can also oscillate to give the same type of waves. This reflex usually oscillates simultaneously with the baroreceptor reflex. It probably plays the major role in causing vasomotor waves when the arterial pressure is in the range of 40 to 80 mm Hg because, in this low range, chemoreceptor control of the circulation becomes powerful, whereas baroreceptor control becomes weaker.

Oscillation of CNS Ischemic Response. The record in Figure 18-11A resulted from oscillation of the CNS ischemic pressure control mechanism. In this experiment, the cerebrospinal fluid pressure increased to 160 mm Hg , which compressed the cerebral vessels and initiated a CNS ischemic pressure response up to 200 mm Hg . When the arterial pressure rose to such a high value, the brain ischemia was relieved, and the sympathetic nervous system became inactive. As a result, the arterial pressure fell rapidly back to a much lower value, causing brain ischemia once again. The ischemia then initiated another rise in pressure. Again, the ischemia was relieved, and again the pressure fell. This response repeated itself cycli-

Figure 18-11. A, Vasomotor waves caused by oscillation of the CNS ischemic response. B, Vasomotor waves caused by baroreceptor reflex oscillation.
cally as long as the cerebrospinal fluid pressure remained elevated.

Thus, any reflex pressure control mechanism can oscillate if the intensity of feedback is strong enough, and if there is a delay between excitation of the pressure receptor and the subsequent pressure response. The vasomotor waves illustrate that the nervous reflexes that control arterial pressure obey the same principles as those applicable to mechanical and electrical control systems. For example, if the feedback gain is too great in the guiding mechanism of an automatic pilot for an airplane, and there is also delay in the response time of the guiding mechanism, the plane will oscillate from side to side instead of following a straight course.

# Role of the Kidneys in Long-Term Control of Arterial Pressure and in Hypertension: The Integrated System for Arterial Pressure Regulation 

In addition to the rapidly acting mechanisms for regulation of arterial pressure discussed in Chapter 18, the body also has powerful mechanisms for regulating arterial pressure week after week and month after month. This long-term control of arterial pressure is closely intertwined with homeostasis of body fluid volume, which is determined by the balance between fluid intake and output. For long-term survival, fluid intake and output must be precisely balanced, a task that is performed by multiple nervous and hormonal controls and by local control systems in the kidneys that regulate their excretion of salt and water. In this chapter, we discuss these renal-body fluid systems that play a major role in long-term blood pressure regulation.

## RENAL-BODY FLUID SYSTEM FOR ARTERIAL PRESSURE CONTROL

The renal-body fluid system for arterial pressure control acts slowly but powerfully, as follows. If blood volume increases and vascular capacitance is not altered, arterial pressure will also increase. The rising pressure, in turn, causes the kidneys to excrete the excess volume, thus returning the pressure back toward normal.

In the phylogenetic history of animal development, this renal-body fluid system for pressure control is a primitive one. It is fully operative in one of the lowest of vertebrates, the hagfish. This animal has a low arterial pressure, only 8 to 14 mm Hg , and this pressure increases almost directly in proportion to its blood volume. The hagfish continually drinks sea water, which is absorbed into its blood, increasing the blood volume and blood pressure. However, when the pressure rises too high, the kidney excretes the excess volume into the urine and relieves the pressure. At low pressure, the kidney excretes less fluid than is ingested. Therefore, because the hagfish continues to drink, extracellular fluid volume, blood volume, and pressure all build up again to the higher levels.

This primitive mechanism of pressure control has survived throughout the ages, but with the addition of multiple nervous system, hormones, and local control systems that also contribute to the regulation of salt and water excretion. In humans, kidney output of water and salt is
just as sensitive-if not more so-to pressure changes as in the hagfish. Indeed, an increase in arterial pressure in the human of only a few millimeters of Hg can double the renal output of water, a phenomenon called pressure diuresis, as well as double the output of salt, called pressure natriuresis.

In humans, just as in the hagfish, the renal-body fluid system for arterial pressure control is a fundamental mechanism for long-term arterial pressure control. However, through the stages of evolution, multiple refinements have been added to make this system much more precise in its control. An especially important refinement, as discussed later, has been the addition of the reninangiotensin mechanism.

## QUANTITATION OF PRESSURE DIURESIS AS A BASIS FOR ARTERIAL PRESSURE CONTROL

Figure 19-1 shows the approximate average effect of different arterial pressure levels on the renal output of salt and water by an isolated kidney, demonstrating markedly increased urine output as the pressure rises. This increased urinary output is the phenomenon of pressure diuresis. The curve in this figure is called a renal urinary output curve or a renal function curve. In humans, at an arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg , the urine output is essentially zero. At 100 mm Hg , it is normal and, at 200 mm Hg , it is 4 to 6 times normal. Furthermore, not only does increasing the arterial pressure increase urine volume output, but it also causes an approximately equal increase in sodium output, which is the phenomenon of pressure natriuresis.

Experiment Demonstrating the Renal-Body Fluid System for Arterial Pressure Control. Figure 19-2 shows the results of an experiment in dogs in which all the nervous reflex mechanisms for blood pressure control were first blocked. Then, the arterial pressure was suddenly elevated by infusing about 400 ml of blood intravenously. Note the rapid increase in cardiac output to about double normal and the increase in mean arterial pressure to 205 mm Hg, 115 mm Hg above its

![gu56687650e1](gu56687650e1.jpg)

Figure 19-1. A typical arterial pressure-renal urinary output curve measured in a perfused isolated kidney, showing pressure diuresis when the arterial pressure rises above normal (point A) to approximately 150 mm Hg (point B). The equilibrium point A describes the level to which the arterial pressure will be regulated if intake is not altered. (Note that the small portion of the salt and water intake that is lost from the body through nonrenal routes is ignored in this and similar figures in this chapter.)
resting level. Shown by the middle curve is the effect of this increased arterial pressure on urine output, which increased 12 -fold. Along with this tremendous loss of fluid in the urine, both the cardiac output and arterial pressure returned to normal during the subsequent hour. Thus, one sees an extreme capability of the kidneys to eliminate excess fluid volume from the body in response to high arterial pressure and, in so doing, to return the arterial pressure back to normal.

## Renal-Body Fluid Mechanism Provides Nearly Infinite Feedback Gain for Long-term Arterial Pressure Control.

Figure 19-1 shows the relationship of the following: (1) the renal output curve for water and salt in response to rising arterial pressure; and (2) the line that represents the net water and salt intake. Over a long period, the water and salt output must equal the intake. Furthermore, the only point on the graph in Figure 19-1 at which output equals intake is where the two curves intersect, called the equilibrium point (point A). Let us see what happens if the arterial pressure increases above or decreases below the equilibrium point.

First, assume that the arterial pressure rises to 150 mm Hg (point B). At this level, the renal output of water and salt is almost three times as great as intake. Therefore, the body loses fluid, the blood volume decreases, and the arterial pressure decreases. Furthermore, this negative balance of fluid will not cease until the pressure falls all the way back exactly to the equilibrium level. Even when the arterial pressure is only a few mm Hg greater than the equilibrium level, there still is slightly more loss of water and salt than intake, so the pressure continues to fall that last few mm Hg until the pressure eventually returns to the equilibrium point.

If the arterial pressure falls below the equilibrium point, the intake of water and salt is greater than the

output. Therefore, body fluid volume increases, blood volume increases, and the arterial pressure rises until once again it returns to the equilibrium point. This return of the arterial pressure always back to the equilibrium point is known as the near-infinite feedback gain principle for control of arterial pressure by the renal-body fluid mechanism.

## Two Key Determinants of Long-Term Arterial Pressure.

In Figure 19-1, one can also see that two basic long-term factors determine the long-term arterial pressure level. As long as the two curves representing the renal output of salt and water and the intake of salt and water remain exactly as they are shown in Figure 19-1, the mean arterial pressure level will eventually readjust to 100 mm Hg , which is the pressure level depicted by the equilibrium point of this figure. Furthermore, there are only two ways in which the pressure of this equilibrium point can be changed from the 100 mm Hg level. One is by shifting the pressure level of the renal output curve for salt and water, and the other is by changing the level of the water and salt intake line. Therefore, expressed simply, the two primary determinants of the long-term arterial pressure level are as follows:

1. The degree of pressure shift of the renal output curve for water and salt
2. The level of the water and salt intake

Operation of these two determinants in the control of arterial pressure is demonstrated in Figure 19-3. In Figure 19-3A, some abnormality of the kidneys has caused

![gu58687650e1](gu58687650e1.jpg)

Figure 19-3. Two ways in which the arterial pressure can be increased. A, By shifting the renal output curve in the right-hand direction toward a higher pressure level or by increasing the intake level of salt and water (B).
the renal output curve to shift 50 mm Hg in the highpressure direction (to the right). Note that the equilibrium point has also shifted to 50 mm Hg higher than normal. Therefore, one can state that if the renal output curve shifts to a new pressure level, the arterial pressure will follow to this new pressure level within a few days.

Figure 19-3B shows how a change in the level of salt and water intake also can change the arterial pressure. In this case, the intake level has increased fourfold, and the equilibrium point has shifted to a pressure level of 160 $\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}, 60 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ above the normal level. Conversely, a decrease in the intake level would reduce the arterial pressure.

Thus, it is impossible to change the long-term mean arterial pressure level to a new value without changing one or both of the two basic determinants of long-term arterial pressure, either (1) the level of salt and water intake or (2) the degree of shift of the renal function curve along the pressure axis. However, if either of these is changed, one finds the arterial pressure thereafter to be regulated at a new pressure level, the arterial pressure at which the two new curves intersect.

In most people, however, the renal function curve is much steeper than that shown in Figure 19-3, and changes in salt intake have only a modest effect on arterial pressure, as discussed in the next section.

## Chronic Renal Output Curve Much Steeper Than the

Acute Curve. An important characteristic of pressure natriuresis (and pressure diuresis) is that chronic changes in arterial pressure, lasting for days or months, have a
![gu59687650e1](gu59687650e1.jpg)

Figure 19-4. Acute and chronic renal output curves. Under steadystate conditions, the renal output of salt and water is equal to intake of salt and water. Points $A$ and $B$ represent the equilibrium points for long-term regulation of arterial pressure when salt intake is normal or six times normal, respectively. Because of the steepness of the chronic renal output curve, increased salt intake normally causes only small changes in arterial pressure. In persons with impaired kidney function, the steepness of the renal output curve may be reduced, similar to the acute curve, resulting in increased sensitivity of arterial pressure to changes in salt intake.
much greater effect on the renal output of salt and water than that observed during acute changes in pressure (Figure 19-4). Thus, when the kidneys are functioning normally, the chronic renal output curve is much steeper than the acute curve.

The powerful effects of chronic increases in arterial pressure on urine output occur because increased pressure not only has direct hemodynamic effects on the kidney to increase excretion, but also has indirect effects mediated by nervous and hormonal changes that occur when blood pressure is increased. For example, increased arterial pressure decreases activity of the sympathetic nervous system, partly through the baroreceptor reflex mechanisms discussed in Chapter 18, and by reducing formation of various hormones such as angiotensin II and aldosterone that tend to reduce salt and water excretion by the kidneys. Reduced activity of these antinatriuretic systems therefore amplifies the effectiveness of pressure natriuresis and diuresis in raising salt and water excretion during chronic increases in arterial pressure (see Chapters 28 and 30 for further discussion).

Conversely, when blood pressure is reduced, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, and formation of antinatriuretic hormones is increased, adding to the direct effects of reduced pressure to decrease renal output of salt and water. This combination of direct effects of pressure on the kidneys and indirect effects of pressure on the sympathetic nervous system and various hormone systems make pressure natriuresis and diuresis extremely powerful factors for long-term control of arterial pressure and body fluid volumes.

The importance of neural and hormonal influences on pressure natriuresis is especially evident during chronic changes in sodium intake. If the kidneys and nervous and hormonal mechanisms are functioning

normally, chronic increases in intakes of salt and water to as high as six times normal are usually associated with little effect on arterial pressure. Note that the blood pressure equilibrium point B on the curve is nearly the same as point A , the equilibrium point at normal salt intake. Conversely, decreases in salt and water intake to as low as one-sixth normal typically have little effect on arterial pressure. Thus, many persons are said to be salt-insensitive because large variations in salt intake do not change blood pressure more than a few mm Hg .

Persons with kidney injury or excessive secretion of antinatriuretic hormones such as angiotensin II or aldosterone, however, may be salt-sensitive, with an attenuated renal output curve similar to the acute curve shown in Figure 19-4. In these cases, even moderate increases in salt intake may cause significant increases in arterial pressure.

Some of the factors that cause blood pressure to be salt-sensitive include loss of functional nephrons due to kidney injury and excessive formation of antinatriuretic hormones such as angiotensin II or aldosterone. For example, surgical reduction of kidney mass or injury to the kidney due to hypertension, diabetes, or various kidney diseases all cause blood pressure to be more sensitive to changes in salt intake. In these cases, greater than normal increases in arterial pressure are required to raise renal output sufficiently to maintain a balance between the intake and output of salt and water.

There is evidence that long-term high salt intake, lasting for several years, may actually damage the kidneys and eventually makes blood pressure more salt-sensitive. We will discuss salt sensitivity of blood pressure in patients with hypertension later in this chapter.

## Failure of Increased Total Peripheral Resistance to Elevate Long-Term Level of Arterial Pressure if Fluid Intake and Renal Function Do Not Change

Recalling the basic equation for arterial pressure-arterial pressure equals cardiac output times total peripheral resistance-it is clear that an increase in total peripheral resistance should elevate the arterial pressure. Indeed, when the total peripheral resistance is acutely increased, the arterial pressure does rise immediately. Yet, if the kidneys continue to function normally, the acute rise in arterial pressure usually is not maintained. Instead, the arterial pressure returns all the way to normal within about 1 or 2 days. Why?

The reason for this phenomenon is that increasing vascular resistance everywhere else in the body besides in the kidneys does not change the equilibrium point for blood pressure control as dictated by the kidneys (see Figures 19-1 and 19-3). Instead, the kidneys immediately begin to respond to the high arterial pressure, causing pressure diuresis and pressure natriuresis. Within hours, large

Figure 19-5. Relationships of total peripheral resistance to the longterm levels of arterial pressure and cardiac output in different clinical abnormalities. In these conditions, the kidneys were functioning normally. Note that changing the whole-body total peripheral resistance caused equal and opposite changes in cardiac output but, in all cases, had no effect on arterial pressure. AV, Arteriovenous. (Modified from Guyton AC: Arterial Pressure and Hypertension. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1980.)
amounts of salt and water are lost from the body; this process continues until the arterial pressure returns to the equilibrium pressure level. At this point, blood pressure is normalized, and extracellular fluid volume and blood volume are decreased to levels below normal.

Figure 19-5 shows the approximate cardiac outputs and arterial pressures in different clinical conditions in which the long-term total peripheral resistance is much less than or much greater than normal, but kidney excretion of salt and water is normal. Note in all these different clinical conditions that the arterial pressure is also normal.

A word of caution is necessary at this point in our discussion. Often, when the total peripheral resistance increases, this also increases the intrarenal vascular resistance at the same time, which alters the function of the kidney and can cause hypertension by shifting the renal function curve to a higher pressure level, as shown in Figure 19-3A. We will see an example of this mechanism later in this chapter when we discuss hypertension caused by vasoconstrictor mechanisms. However, it is the increase in renal resistance that is the culprit, not the increased total peripheral resistance-an important distinction.

## Increased Fluid Volume Can Elevate Arterial Pressure by Increasing Cardiac Output or Total Peripheral Resistance

The overall mechanism whereby increased extracellular fluid volume may elevate arterial pressure, if vascular capacity is not simultaneously increased, is shown in Figure 19-6. The

![gu61687650e1](gu61687650e1.jpg)

Figure 19-6. Sequential steps whereby increased extracellular fluid volume increases the arterial pressure. Note especially that increased cardiac output has both a direct effect to increase arterial pressure and an indirect effect by first increasing the total peripheral resistance.
sequential events are as follows: (1) increased extracellular fluid volume, which (2) increases the blood volume, which (3) increases the mean circulatory filling pressure, which (4) increases venous return of blood to the heart, which (5) increases cardiac output, which (6) increases arterial pressure. The increased arterial pressure, in turn, increases the renal excretion of salt and water and may return extracellular fluid volume to nearly normal if kidney function is normal and vascular capacity is unaltered.

Note especially in this case the two ways in which an increase in cardiac output can increase the arterial pressure. One of these is the direct effect of increased cardiac output to increase the pressure, and the other is an indirect effect to raise total peripheral vascular resistance through autoregulation of blood flow. The second effect can be explained as follows.

Referring to Chapter 17, let us recall that whenever an excess amount of blood flows through a tissue, the local tissue vasculature constricts and decreases the blood flow back toward normal. This phenomenon is called autoregulation, which simply means regulation of blood flow by the tissue itself. When increased blood volume raises the cardiac output, blood flow tends to increase in all tissues of the body; if the increased blood flow exceeds the metabolic needs of the tissues, the autoregulation mechanisms constricts blood vessels all over the body, which in turn increases the total peripheral resistance.

Finally, because arterial pressure is equal to cardiac output times total peripheral resistance, the secondary increase in total peripheral resistance that results from the autoregulation mechanism helps increase the arterial pressure. For example, only a $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ increase in cardiac output can increase the arterial pressure from the normal mean arterial pressure of 100 mm Hg up to 150 mm Hg when accompanied by an increase in total peripheral resistance due to tissue blood flow autoregulation or other factors that cause vasoconstriction. The slight increase in cardiac output is often not measurable.

## Importance of Salt ( NaCl ) in the RenalBody Fluid Schema for Arterial Pressure Regulation

Although the discussions thus far have emphasized the importance of volume in regulation of arterial pressure, experimental studies have shown that an increase in salt intake is far more likely to elevate the arterial pressure, especially in people who are salt-sensitive, than is an increase in water intake. The reason for this finding is that pure water is normally excreted by the kidneys almost as rapidly as it is ingested, but salt is not excreted so easily. As salt accumulates in the body, it also indirectly increases the extracellular fluid volume for two basic reasons:

1. Although some additional sodium may be stored in the tissues when salt accumulates in the body, excess salt in the extracellular fluid increases the fluid osmolality. The increased osmolarity stimulates the thirst center in the brain, making the person drink extra amounts of water to return the extracellular salt concentration to normal and increasing the extracellular fluid volume.
2. The increase in osmolality caused by the excess salt in the extracellular fluid also stimulates the hypo-thalamic-posterior pituitary gland secretory mechanism to secrete increased quantities of antidiuretic hormone (discussed in Chapter 29). The antidiuretic hormone then causes the kidneys to reabsorb greatly increased quantities of water from the renal tubular fluid, thereby diminishing the excreted volume of urine but increasing the extracellular fluid volume.
Thus, the amount of salt that accumulates in the body is an important determinant of the extracellular fluid volume. Relatively small increases in extracellular fluid and blood volume can often increase the arterial pressure substantially. This is true, however, only if the excess salt accumulation leads to an increase in blood volume and if vascular capacity is not simultaneously increased. As discussed previously, increasing salt intake in the absence of impaired kidney function or excessive formation of antinatriuretic hormones usually does not increase arterial pressure much because the kidneys rapidly eliminate the excess salt, and blood volume is hardly altered.

## CHRONIC HYPERTENSION (HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE) CAUSED BY IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION

When a person is said to have chronic hypertension (or high blood pressure), this means that his or her mean arterial pressure is greater than the upper range of the accepted normal measure. A mean arterial pressure greater than 110 mm Hg (normal is $\approx 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) is considered to be hypertensive. (This level of mean pressure occurs when the diastolic blood pressure is greater than $\approx 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ and the systolic pressure is greater than $\approx 135$ mm Hg .) In persons with severe hypertension, the mean arterial pressure can rise to 150 to 170 mm Hg , with diastolic pressure as high as 130 mm Hg and systolic pressure occasionally as high as 250 mm Hg .

Even moderate elevation of arterial pressure leads to shortened life expectancy. At severely high pressuresthat is, mean arterial pressures $50 \%$ or more above nor-mal-a person can expect to live no more than a few more years unless appropriately treated. The lethal effects of hypertension are caused mainly in three ways:

1. Excess workload on the heart leads to early heart failure and coronary heart disease, often causing death as a result of a heart attack.
2. The high pressure frequently damages a major blood vessel in the brain, followed by death of major portions of the brain; this occurrence is a cerebral infarct. Clinically, it is called a stroke. Depending on which part of the brain is involved, a stroke can be fatal or cause paralysis, dementia, blindness, or multiple other serious brain disorders.
3. High pressure almost always causes injury in the kidneys, producing many areas of renal destruction and, eventually, kidney failure, uremia, and death.
Lessons learned from the type of hypertension called volume-loading hypertension have been crucial in
understanding the role of the renal-body fluid volume mechanism for arterial pressure regulation. Volumeloading hypertension means hypertension caused by excess accumulation of extracellular fluid in the body, some examples of which follow.

Experimental Volume-Loading Hypertension Caused by Reduced Kidney Mass and Increased Salt Intake. Figure 19-7 shows a typical experiment demonstrating volume-loading hypertension in a group of dogs with $70 \%$ of their kidney mass removed. At the first circled point on the curve, the two poles of one of the kidneys were removed, and at the second circled point, the entire opposite kidney was removed, leaving the animals with only $30 \%$ of their normal renal mass. Note that removal of this amount of kidney mass increased the arterial pressure by an average of only 6 mm Hg . Then, the dogs were given salt solution to drink instead of water. Because salt solution fails to quench the thirst, the dogs drank two to four times the normal amounts of volume, and within a few days, their average arterial pressure rose to about 40 mm Hg above normal. After 2 weeks, the dogs were given tap water again instead of salt solution; the pressure returned to normal within 2 days. Finally, at the end of the experiment, the dogs were given salt solution again, and this time the pressure rose much more rapidly to a high level, again demonstrating volume-loading hypertension.

If one considers again the basic determinants of longterm arterial pressure regulation, it is apparent why hypertension occurred in the volume-loading experiment illustrated in Figure 19-7. First, reduction of the kidney mass to $30 \%$ of normal greatly reduced the ability of the kidneys to excrete salt and water. Therefore, salt and water accumulated in the body and, in a few days, raised the arterial pressure high enough to excrete the excess salt and water intake.

![gu62687650e1](gu62687650e1.jpg)

Sequential Changes in Circulatory Function During Development of Volume-Loading Hypertension. It is especially instructive to study the sequential changes in circulatory function during progressive development of volume-loading hypertension (Figure 19-8). A week or so before the point labeled " 0 " days, the kidney mass had already been decreased to only $30 \%$ of normal. Then, at this point, the intake of salt and water was increased to about six times normal and kept at this high intake thereafter. The acute effect was to increase extracellular fluid volume, blood volume, and cardiac output to $20 \%$ to $40 \%$ above normal. Simultaneously, the arterial pressure began to rise but not nearly so much at first as the fluid volumes and cardiac output. The reason for this slower rise in pressure can be discerned by studying the total peripheral resistance curve, which shows an initial decrease in total peripheral resistance. This decrease was caused by the baroreceptor mechanism discussed in Chapter 18, which transiently attenuated the rise in pressure. However, after 2 to 4 days, the baroreceptors adapted (reset) and were no longer able to prevent the rise in pressure. At this time, the arterial pressure had risen almost to its full height because of the increase in cardiac output, even though the total peripheral resistance was still almost at the normal level.
![gu63687650e1](gu63687650e1.jpg)

Figure 19-8. Progressive changes in important circulatory system variables during the first few weeks of volume-loading hypertension. Note especially the initial increase in cardiac output as the basic cause of the hypertension. Subsequently, the autoregulation mechanism returns the cardiac output almost to normal while simultaneously causing a secondary increase in total peripheral resistance. (Modified from Guyton AC: Arterial Pressure and Hypertension. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1980.)

After these early acute changes in the circulatory variables had occurred, more prolonged secondary changes occurred during the next few weeks. Especially important was a progressive increase in total peripheral resistance, while at the same time the cardiac output decreased back toward normal, at least partly as a result of the long-term blood flow autoregulation mechanism discussed in Chapter 17 and earlier in this chapter. That is, after the cardiac output had risen to a high level and had initiated the hypertension, the excess blood flow through the tissues then caused progressive constriction of the local arterioles, thus returning the local blood flow in the body tissues and also the cardiac output toward normal while simultaneously causing a secondary increase in total peripheral resistance.

Note that the extracellular fluid volume and blood volume also returned toward normal along with the decrease in cardiac output. This outcome resulted from two factors. First, the increase in arteriolar resistance decreased the capillary pressure, which allowed the fluid in the tissue spaces to be absorbed back into the blood. Second, the elevated arterial pressure now caused the kidneys to excrete the excess volume of fluid that had initially accumulated in the body.

Several weeks after the initial onset of volume loading, the following effects were found:

1. Hypertension
2. Marked increase in total peripheral resistance
3. Almost complete return of the extracellular fluid volume, blood volume, and cardiac output back to normal
Therefore, we can divide volume-loading hypertension into two sequential stages. The first stage results from increased fluid volume causing increased cardiac output. This increase in cardiac output mediates the hypertension. The second stage in volume-loading hypertension is characterized by high blood pressure and high total peripheral resistance but return of the cardiac output so close to normal that the usual measuring techniques frequently cannot detect an abnormally elevated cardiac output.

Thus, the increased total peripheral resistance in volume-loading hypertension occurs after the hypertension has developed and, therefore, is secondary to the hypertension rather than being the cause of the hypertension.

## Volume-Loading Hypertension in Patients Who Have No Kidneys but Are Being Maintained With an Artificial Kidney

When a patient is maintained with an artificial kidney, it is especially important to keep the patient's body fluid volume at a normal level by removing the appropriate amount of water and salt each time the patient undergoes dialysis. If this step is not performed, and extracellular fluid volume is allowed to increase, hypertension almost invariably develops in exactly the same way as shown

in Figure 19-8. That is, the cardiac output increases at first and causes hypertension. Then, the autoregulation mechanism returns the cardiac output back toward normal while causing a secondary increase in total peripheral resistance. Therefore, in the end, the hypertension appears to be a high peripheral resistance type of hypertension, although the initial cause is excess volume accumulation.

## Hypertension Caused by Excess Aldosterone

Another type of volume-loading hypertension is caused by excess aldosterone in the body or, occasionally, by excesses of other types of steroids. A small tumor in one of the adrenal glands occasionally secretes large quantities of aldosterone, which is the condition called primary aldosteronism. As discussed in Chapters 28 and 30, aldosterone increases the rate of salt and water reabsorption by the tubules of the kidneys, thereby increasing blood volume, extracellular fluid volume, and arterial pressure. If salt intake is increased at the same time, the hypertension becomes even greater. Furthermore, if the condition persists for months or years, the excess arterial pressure often causes pathological changes in the kidneys that make the kidneys retain even more salt and water in addition to that caused directly by the aldosterone. Therefore, the hypertension often finally becomes severe to the point of being lethal.

Here again, in the early stages of this type of hypertension, cardiac output is often increased but, in later stages, the cardiac output generally returns almost to normal while total peripheral resistance becomes secondarily elevated, as explained earlier in the chapter for primary volume-loading hypertension.

## ROLE OF THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM IN ARTERIAL PRESSURE CONTROL

Aside from the capability of the kidneys to control arterial pressure through changes in extracellular fluid volume, the kidneys also have another powerful mechanism for controlling pressure, the renin-angiotensin system.

Renin is a protein enzyme released by the kidneys when the arterial pressure falls too low. In turn, it raises the arterial pressure in several ways, thus helping correct the initial fall in pressure.

## COMPONENTS OF THE RENINANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM

Figure 19-9 shows the main functional steps whereby the renin-angiotensin system helps regulate arterial pressure. Renin is synthesized and stored in the juxtaglomerular cells (JG cells) of the kidneys. The JG cells are modified smooth muscle cells located mainly in the walls of the afferent arterioles immediately proximal to the glomeruli. Multiple factors control renin secretion, including the
sympathetic nervous system, various hormones, and local autacoids such as prostaglandins, nitric oxide, and endothelin. When the arterial pressure falls, the JG cells release renin by at least three major mechanisms:

1. Pressure-sensitive baroreceptors in the JG cells respond to decreased arterial pressure with increased release of renin.
2. Decreased sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa cells in the early distal tubule stimulates renin release (discussed further in Chapter 27)
3. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity stimulates renin release by activating beta-adrenergic receptors in the JG cells. Sympathetic stimulation also activates alpha-adrenergic receptors, which can increase renal sodium chloride reabsorption and reduce the glomerular filtration rate in cases of strong sympathetic activation. Increased renal sympathetic activity also enhances the sensitivity of renal baroreceptor and macula densa mechanisms for renin release.
Most of the renin enters the renal blood and then passes out of the kidneys to circulate throughout the entire body. However, small amounts of the renin do remain in the local fluids of the kidney and initiate several intrarenal functions.

Renin itself is an enzyme, not a vasoactive substance. As shown in Figure 19-9, renin acts enzymatically on another plasma protein, a globulin called renin substrate (or angiotensinogen), to release a 10 -amino acid peptide, angiotensin I. Angiotensin I has mild vasoconstrictor
![gu64687650e1](gu64687650e1.jpg)

Figure 19-9. The renin-angiotensin vasoconstrictor mechanism for arterial pressure control.

properties but not enough to cause significant changes in circulatory function. The renin persists in the blood for 30 to 60 minutes and continues to cause formation of still more angiotensin I during this entire time.

Within a few seconds to minutes after the formation of angiotensin I, two additional amino acids are split from the angiotensin I to form the 8 -amino acid peptide angiotensin II. This conversion occurs to a great extent in the lungs while the blood flows through the small vessels of the lungs, catalyzed by an enzyme called angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) that is present in the endothelium of the lung vessels. Other tissues such as the kidneys and blood vessels also contain ACE and therefore form angiotensin II locally.

Angiotensin II is an extremely powerful vasoconstrictor, and it affects circulatory function in other ways as well. However, it persists in the blood only for 1 or 2 minutes because it is rapidly inactivated by multiple blood and tissue enzymes collectively called angiotensinases.

Angiotensin II has two principal effects that can elevate arterial pressure. The first of these, vasoconstriction in many areas of the body, occurs rapidly. Vasoconstriction occurs intensely in the arterioles and less so in the veins. Constriction of the arterioles increases the total peripheral resistance, thereby raising the arterial pressure, as demonstrated at the bottom of Figure 19-9. Also, the mild constriction of the veins promotes increased venous return of blood to the heart, thereby helping the heart pump against the increasing pressure.

The second principal means whereby angiotensin II increases the arterial pressure is decreased excretion of salt and water by the kidneys due to stimulation of aldosterone secretion, as well as direct effects on the kidneys. The salt and water retention by the kidneys slowly increases the extracellular fluid volume, which then increases the arterial pressure during subsequent hours and days. This long-term effect, through the direct and indirect actions of angiotensin II on the kidneys, is even more powerful than the acute vasoconstrictor mechanism in eventually raising the arterial pressure.

## Rapidity and Intensity of the Vasoconstrictor Pressure Response to the Renin-Angiotensin System

Figure 19-10 shows an experiment demonstrating the effect of hemorrhage on the arterial pressure under two separate conditions: (1) with the renin-angiotensin system functioning; and (2) after blocking the system with a renin-blocking antibody. Note that after hemorrhageenough to cause acute decrease of the arterial pressure to 50 mm Hg -the arterial pressure rose back to 83 mm Hg when the renin-angiotensin system was functional. Conversely, it rose to only 60 mm Hg when the reninangiotensin system was blocked. This phenomenon shows that the renin-angiotensin system is powerful enough to return the arterial pressure at least halfway back to normal within a few minutes after severe hemorrhage. Therefore,

Figure 19-10. The pressure-compensating effect of the reninangiotensin vasoconstrictor system after severe hemorrhage. (Drawn from experiments by Dr. Royce Brough.)
this system can be of lifesaving service to the body, especially in circulatory shock.

Note also that the renin-angiotensin vasoconstrictor system requires about 20 minutes to become fully active. Therefore, it is somewhat slower for blood pressure control than the nervous reflexes and sympathetic norepinephrine-epinephrine system.

## Angiotensin II Causes Renal Retention of Salt and Water—An Important Means for Long-Term Control of Arterial Pressure

Angiotensin II causes the kidneys to retain both salt and water in two major ways:

1. Angiotensin II acts directly on the kidneys to cause salt and water retention.
2. Angiotensin II stimulates the adrenal glands to secrete aldosterone, and the aldosterone in turn increases salt and water reabsorption by the kidney tubules.
Thus, whenever excess amounts of angiotensin II circulate in the blood, the entire long-term renal-body fluid mechanism for arterial pressure control automatically becomes set to a higher arterial pressure level than normal.

Mechanisms of the Direct Renal Effects of Angiotensin II to Cause Renal Retention of Salt and Water. Angiotensin has several direct renal effects that make the kidneys retain salt and water. One major effect is to constrict the renal arterioles, especially the glomerular efferent arterioles, thereby diminishing blood flow through the kidneys. The slow flow of blood reduces the pressure in the peritubular capillaries, which increases reabsorption of fluid from the tubules. Angiotensin II also has important direct actions on the tubular cells to increase tubular reabsorption of sodium and water, as discussed in Chapter 28. The combined effects of angiotensin II can sometimes decrease urine output to less than one-fifth normal.
Angiotensin II Increases Kidney Salt and Water Retention by Stimulating Aldosterone. Angiotensin II is also one of the most powerful stimulators of aldosterone secretion by the adrenal glands, as we shall discuss in relation to body fluid regulation in Chapter 30

and in relation to adrenal gland function in Chapter 78. Therefore, when the renin-angiotensin system becomes activated, the rate of aldosterone secretion usually also increases; an important subsequent function of aldosterone is to cause marked increase in sodium reabsorption by the kidney tubules, thus increasing the total body extracellular fluid sodium and, as already explained, extracellular fluid volume. Thus, both the direct effect of angiotensin II on the kidneys and its effect acting through aldosterone are important in long-term arterial pressure control.

Quantitative Analysis of Arterial Pressure Changes Caused by Angiotensin II. Figure 19-11 shows a quantitative analysis of the effect of angiotensin in arterial pressure control. This figure shows two renal function curves, as well as a line depicting a normal level of sodium intake. The left-hand renal function curve is that measured in dogs whose renin-angiotensin system had been blocked by an ACE inhibitor drug that blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The right-hand curve was measured in dogs infused continuously with angiotensin II at a level about 2.5 times the normal rate of angiotensin formation in the blood. Note the shift of the renal output curve toward higher pressure levels under the influence of angiotensin II. This shift is caused by the direct effects of angiotensin II on the kidney and the indirect effect acting through aldosterone secretion, as explained earlier.

Finally, note the two equilibrium points, one for zero angiotensin showing an arterial pressure level of 75 mm Hg , and one for elevated angiotensin showing a pressure level of 115 mm Hg . Therefore, the effect of angiotensin to cause renal retention of salt and water can have a powerful effect in promoting chronic elevation of the arterial pressure.

Figure 19-11. The effect of two angiotensin II levels in the blood on the renal output curve showing regulation of the arterial pressure at an equilibrium point of 75 mm Hg , when the angiotensin II level is low, and at 115 mm Hg , when the angiotensin II level is high.

## Role of the Renin-Angiotensin System in Maintaining a Normal Arterial Pressure Despite Large Variations in Salt Intake

One of the most important functions of the reninangiotensin system is to allow a person to ingest very small or very large amounts of salt without causing major changes in extracellular fluid volume or arterial pressure. This function is explained by Figure 19-12, which shows that the initial effect of increased salt intake is to elevate the extracellular fluid volume, which tends to elevate the arterial pressure. Multiple effects of increased salt intake, including small increases in arterial pressure and pressureindependent effects, reduce the rate of renin secretion and angiotensin II formation, which then helps eliminate the additional salt with minimal increases in extracellular fluid volume or arterial pressure. Thus, the renin-angiotensin system is an automatic feedback mechanism that helps maintain the arterial pressure at or near the normal level, even when salt intake is increased. When salt intake is decreased below normal, exactly opposite effects take place.

To emphasize the efficacy of the renin-angiotensin system in controlling arterial pressure, when the system functions normally, the pressure usually rises no more than 4 to 6 mm Hg in response to as much as a 100 -fold increase in salt intake (Figure 19-13). Conversely, when the usual suppression of angiotensin formation is prevented due to continuous infusion of small amounts of angiotensin II so that blood levels cannot decrease, the same increase in salt intake may cause the pressure to rise by 40 mm Hg or more (see Figure 19-13). When salt intake is reduced to as low as one-tenth normal, arterial pressure barely changes as long as the renin-angiotensin system functions normally. However, when angiotensin II

Changes in mean arterial pressure during chronic changes in sodium intake in normal control dogs and in dogs treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to block angiotensin II (Ang II) formation or infused with Ang II to prevent Ang II from being suppressed. Sodium intake was raised in steps from a low level of $5 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day to 80,240 , and $500 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day for 8 days at each level. (Modified from Hall JE, Guyton AC, Smith MJ Jr, et al: Blood pressure and renal function during chronic changes in sodium intake: role of angiotensin. Am J Physiol 239:F271, 1980.)
formation is blocked with an ACE inhibitor, blood pressure decreases markedly as salt intake is reduced (see Figure 19-13). Thus, the renin-angiotensin system is perhaps the body's most powerful system for accommodating wide variations in salt intake with minimal changes in arterial pressure.

## HYPERTENSION CAUSED BY RENINSECRETING TUMOR OR RENAL ISCHEMIA

Occasionally, a tumor of the renin-secreting JG cells occurs and secretes large quantities of renin, causing formation of large amounts of angiotensin II. In all patients in whom this phenomenon has occurred, severe hypertension has developed. Also, when large amounts of angiotensin II are infused continuously for days or weeks into animals, similar severe long-term hypertension develops.

We have already noted that angiotensin II can increase the arterial pressure in two ways:

1. By constricting the arterioles throughout the entire body, thereby increasing the total peripheral resistance and arterial pressure; this effect occurs within seconds after one begins to infuse large amounts of angiotensin II.
2. By causing the kidneys to retain salt and water; over a period of days, even moderate amounts of angiotensin II can cause causes hypertension through its renal actions, the principal cause of the long-term elevation of arterial pressure.

Figure 19-14. Effect of placing a constricting clamp on the renal artery of one kidney after the other kidney has been removed. Note the changes in systemic arterial pressure, renal artery pressure distal to the clamp, and rate of renin secretion. The resulting hypertension is called one-kidney Goldblatt hypertension.

One-Kidney Goldblatt Hypertension. When one kidney is removed, and a constrictor is placed on the renal artery of the remaining kidney, as shown in Figure 1914, the immediate effect is greatly reduced pressure in the renal artery beyond the constrictor, as demonstrated by the dashed curve in the figure Then, within seconds or minutes, the systemic arterial pressure begins to rise and continues to rise for several days. The pressure usually rises rapidly for the first hour or so, and this effect is followed by a slower additional rise during the next several days. When the systemic arterial pressure reaches its new stable pressure level, the renal arterial pressure distal to the constriction (the dashed curve in the figure) will have returned almost all the way back to normal. The hypertension produced in this way is called one-kidney Goldblatt hypertension in honor of Harry Goldblatt, who first studied the important quantitative features of hypertension caused by renal artery constriction.

The early rise in arterial pressure in Goldblatt hypertension is caused by the renin-angiotensin vasoconstrictor

mechanism. That is, because of poor blood flow through the kidney after acute constriction of the renal artery, large quantities of renin are secreted by the kidney, as demonstrated by the lowermost curve in Figure 19-14, and this action increases angiotensin II and aldosterone levels in the blood. The angiotensin II, in turn, raises the arterial pressure acutely. The secretion of renin rises to a peak in about 1 or 2 hours but returns nearly to normal in 5 to 7 days because the renal arterial pressure by that time has also risen back to normal, so the kidney is no longer ischemic.

The second rise in arterial pressure is caused by retention of salt and water by the constricted kidney, which is also stimulated by angiotensin II and aldosterone. In 5 to 7 days, the body fluid volume increases enough to raise the arterial pressure to its new sustained level. The quantitative value of this sustained pressure level is determined by the degree of constriction of the renal artery. That is, the aortic pressure must rise enough so that renal arterial pressure distal to the constrictor is high enough to cause normal urine output.

A similar scenario occurs in patients with stenosis of the renal artery of a single remaining kidney, as sometimes occurs after a person receives a kidney transplant. Also, functional or pathological increases in resistance of the renal arterioles, due to atherosclerosis or excessive levels of vasoconstrictors, can cause hypertension through the same mechanisms as constriction of the main renal artery.

Two-Kidney Goldblatt Hypertension. Hypertension also can result when the artery to only one kidney is constricted while the artery to the other kidney is normal. The constricted kidney secretes renin and also retains salt and water because of decreased renal arterial pressure in this kidney. Then, the "normal" opposite kidney retains salt and water because of the renin produced by the ischemic kidney. This renin causes increased formation of angiotensin II and aldosterone, both of which circulate to the opposite kidney and cause it also to retain salt and water. Thus, both kidneys-but for different reasons-become salt and water retainers. Consequently, hypertension develops.

The clinical counterpart of two-kidney Goldblatt hypertension occurs when there is stenosis of a single renal artery-for example, caused by atherosclerosis-in a person who has two kidneys.

Hypertension Caused by Diseased Kidneys That Secrete Renin Chronically. Often, patchy areas of one or both kidneys are diseased and become ischemic because of local vascular constrictions or infarctions, whereas other areas of the kidneys are normal. When this situation occurs, almost identical effects occur as in the twokidney type of Goldblatt hypertension. That is, the patchy ischemic kidney tissue secretes renin, which, in turn-by acting through the formation of angiotensin II-causes
the remaining kidney mass also to retain salt and water. One of the most common causes of renal hypertension, especially in older persons, is this patchy ischemic kidney disease.

## Other Types of Hypertension Caused by Combinations of Volume Loading and Vasoconstriction

Hypertension in the Upper Part of the Body Caused by Coarctation of the Aorta. One out of every few thousand babies is born with pathological constriction or blockage of the aorta at a point beyond the aortic arterial branches to the head and arms but proximal to the renal arteries, a condition called coarctation of the aorta. When this occurs, blood flow to the lower body is carried by multiple small collateral arteries in the body wall, with much vascular resistance between the upper aorta and lower aorta. As a consequence, the arterial pressure in the upper part of the body may be $40 \%$ to $50 \%$ higher than that in the lower body.

The mechanism of this upper body hypertension is almost identical to that of one-kidney Goldblatt hypertension. That is, when a constrictor is placed on the aorta above the renal arteries, the blood pressure in both kidneys falls at first, renin is secreted, angiotensin and aldosterone are formed, and hypertension occurs in the upper body. The arterial pressure in the lower body at the level of the kidneys rises approximately to normal, but high pressure persists in the upper body. The kidneys are no longer ischemic, and thus secretion of renin and formation of angiotensin and aldosterone return to nearly normal. Likewise, in coarctation of the aorta, the arterial pressure in the lower body is usually almost normal, whereas the pressure in the upper body is far higher than normal.

Role of Autoregulation in Hypertension Caused by Aortic Coarctation. A significant feature of hypertension caused by aortic coarctation is that blood flow in the arms, where the pressure may be $40 \%$ to $60 \%$ above normal, is almost exactly normal. Also, blood flow in the legs, where the pressure is not elevated, is almost exactly normal. How could this be, with the pressure in the upper body $40 \%$ to $60 \%$ greater than in the lower body? There are no differences in vasoconstrictor substances in the blood of the upper and lower body because the same blood flows to both areas. Likewise, the nervous system innervates both areas of the circulation similarly, so there is no reason to believe that there is a difference in nervous control of the blood vessels. The main reason is that long-term autoregulation develops so nearly completely that the local blood flow control mechanisms have compensated almost $100 \%$ for the differences in pressure. The result is that in both the highpressure area and low-pressure area, the local blood flow is controlled by local autoregulatory mechanisms almost exactly in accord with the needs of the tissue and not in accord with the level of the pressure.

Hypertension in Preeclampsia (Toxemia of Pregnancy). A syndrome called preeclampsia (also called toxemia of pregnancy) develops in approximately $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of expectant mothers. One of the manifestations of preeclampsia is hypertension that usually subsides after delivery of the baby. Although the precise causes of preeclampsia are not completely understood, ischemia of the placenta and subsequent release by the placenta of toxic factors are believed

to play a role in causing many of the manifestations of this disorder, including hypertension in the mother. Substances released by the ischemic placenta, in turn, cause dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells throughout the body, including the blood vessels of the kidneys. This endothelial dysfunction decreases release of nitric oxide and other vasodilator substances, causing vasoconstriction, decreased rate of fluid filtration from the glomeruli into the renal tubules, impaired renal pressure natriuresis, and the development of hypertension.

Another pathological abnormality that may contribute to hypertension in preeclampsia is thickening of the kidney glomerular membranes (perhaps caused by an autoimmune process), which also reduces the glomerular fluid filtration rate. For obvious reasons, the arterial pressure level required to cause normal formation of urine becomes elevated, and the long-term level of arterial pressure becomes correspondingly elevated. These patients are especially prone to extra degrees of hypertension when they have excess salt intake.

Neurogenic Hypertension. Acute neurogenic hypertension can be caused by strong stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. For example, when a person becomes excited for any reason or during states of anxiety, the sympathetic system becomes excessively stimulated, peripheral vasoconstriction occurs everywhere in the body, and acute hypertension ensues.

Another type of acute neurogenic hypertension occurs when the nerves leading from the baroreceptors are cut or when the tractus solitarius is destroyed in each side of the medulla oblongata. These are the areas where the nerves from the carotid and aortic baroreceptors connect in the brain stem. The sudden cessation of normal nerve signals from the baroreceptors has the same effect on the nervous pressure control mechanisms as a sudden reduction of the arterial pressure in the aorta and carotid arteries. That is, loss of the normal inhibitory effect on the vasomotor center caused by normal baroreceptor nervous signals allows the vasomotor center suddenly to become extremely active and the mean arterial pressure to increase from 100 mm Hg to as high as 160 mm Hg . The pressure returns to nearly normal within about 2 days because the response of the vasomotor center to the absent baroreceptor signal fades away, which is called central resetting of the baroreceptor pressure control mechanism. Therefore, the neurogenic hypertension caused by sectioning the baroreceptor nerves is mainly an acute type of hypertension, not a chronic type.

The sympathetic nervous system also plays an important role in some forms of chronic hypertension, in large part by activation of the renal sympathetic nerves. For example, excess weight gain and obesity often lead to activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn stimulates the renal sympathetic nerves, impairs renal pressure natriuresis, and causes chronic hypertension. These abnormalities appear to play a major role in a large percentage of patients with primary (essential) hypertension, as discussed later.

Genetic Causes of Hypertension. Spontaneous hereditary hypertension has been observed in several strains of animals, including different strains of rats and rabbits and at least one strain of dogs. In the strain of rats that has been studied to the greatest extent, the Okamoto spontaneously hypertensive rat, there is evidence that in early develop-
ment of the hypertension, the sympathetic nervous system is considerably more active than in normal rats. In the later stages of this type of hypertension, structural changes have been observed in the nephrons of the kidneys: (1) increased preglomerular renal arterial resistance; and (2) decreased permeability of the glomerular membranes. These structural changes could also contribute to the long-term continuance of the hypertension. In other strains of hypertensive rats, impaired renal function also has been observed.

In humans, several different gene mutations have been identified that can cause hypertension. These forms of hypertension are called monogenic hypertension because they are caused by mutation of a single gene. An interesting feature of these genetic disorders is that they all cause impaired kidney function, either by increased resistance of the renal arterioles or by excessive salt and water reabsorption by the renal tubules. In some cases, the increased reabsorption is due to gene mutations that directly increase the transport of sodium or chloride in the renal tubular epithelial cells. In other cases, the gene mutations cause increased synthesis or activity of hormones that stimulate renal tubular salt and water reabsorption. Thus, in all monogenic hypertensive disorders discovered thus far, the final common pathway to hypertension appears to be impaired kidney function. Monogenic hypertension, however, is rare, and all the known forms together account for less than $1 \%$ of cases of human hypertension.

## PRIMARY (ESSENTIAL) HYPERTENSION

About $90 \%$ to $95 \%$ of all people who have hypertension are said to have primary hypertension, also referred to as essential hypertension by many clinicians. These terms simply mean that the hypertension is of unknown origin, in contrast to the forms of hypertension that are secondary to known causes, such as renal artery stenosis or monogenic forms of hypertension.

In most patients, excess weight gain and a sedentary lifestyle appear to play a major role in causing primary hypertension. Most patients with hypertension are overweight, and studies of different populations have suggested that excess adiposity may account for as much as $65 \%$ to $75 \%$ of the risk for developing primary hypertension. Clinical studies have clearly shown the value of weight loss for reducing blood pressure in most patients with hypertension, and clinical guidelines for treating hypertension recommend increased physical activity and weight loss as a first step in treating most patients with hypertension.

The following characteristics of primary hypertension, among others, are caused by excess weight gain and obesity:

1. Cardiac output is increased in part because of the additional blood flow required for the extra adipose tissue. However, blood flow in the heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and skeletal muscle also increases with weight gain because of increased metabolic rate and growth of the organs and tissues in response to their increased metabolic demands. As the hypertension is sustained for many months and

years, total peripheral vascular resistance may be increased.
2. Sympathetic nerve activity, especially in the kidneys, is increased in overweight patients. The causes of increased sympathetic activity in obese persons are not fully understood, but studies have suggested that hormones such as leptin that are released from fat cells may directly stimulate multiple regions of the hypothalamus, which in turn have an excitatory influence on the vasomotor centers of the brain medulla. There is also evidence for reduced sensitivity of arterial baroreceptors in buffering increases in arterial pressure, as well as activation of chemoreceptors in obese persons, especially in those who also have obstructive sleep apnea.
3. Angiotensin II and aldosterone levels are increased in many obese patients. This increase may be caused partly by increased sympathetic nerve stimulation, which increases renin release by the kidneys and therefore formation of angiotensin II, which in turn stimulates the adrenal gland to secrete aldosterone.
4. The renal-pressure natriuresis mechanism is impaired, and the kidneys will not excrete adequate amounts of salt and water unless the arterial pressure is high or kidney function is somehow improved. If mean arterial pressure in the essential hypertensive person is 150 mm Hg , acute reduction of mean arterial pressure to the normal value of 100 mm Hg (but without otherwise altering renal function except for the decreased pressure) will cause almost total anuria. The person will then retain salt and water until the pressure rises back to the elevated value of 150 mm Hg . Chronic reductions in arterial pressure with effective antihypertensive therapies, however, usually do not cause marked salt and water retention by the kidneys because these therapies also improve renal pressure natriuresis, as discussed later.
Experimental studies in obese animals and obese patients have suggested that impaired renal pressure natriuresis in obesity hypertension is caused mainly by increased renal tubular reabsorption of salt and water due to increased sympathetic nerve activity and increased levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone. However, if hypertension is not effectively treated, there may also be vascular damage in the kidneys that can reduce glomerular filtration rate and increase the severity of hypertension. Eventually, uncontrolled hypertension associated with obesity and associated metabolic disorders can lead to severe vascular injury and complete loss of kidney function.

Graphic Analysis of Arterial Pressure Control in Essential Hypertension. Figure 19-15 is a graphic analysis of essential hypertension. The curves of this figure are called

Figure 19-15. Analysis of arterial pressure regulation in (1) saltinsensitive essential hypertension and (2) salt-sensitive essential hypertension. (Modified from Guyton AC, Coleman TG, Young DB, et al: Salt balance and long-term blood pressure control. Annu Rev Med 31:15, 1980.)
sodium-loading renal function curves because the arterial pressure in each case is increased very slowly, over many days or weeks, by gradually increasing the level of sodium intake. The sodium-loading type of curve can be determined by increasing the level of sodium intake to a new level every few days and then waiting for the renal output of sodium to come into balance with the intake and, at the same time, recording the changes in arterial pressure.

When this procedure is used in patients with essential hypertension, two types of curves, shown at the right in Figure 19-15, can be recorded; one is called (1) saltinsensitive hypertension and the other (2) salt-sensitive hypertension. Note in both cases that the curves are shifted to the right, to a higher pressure level than for people with normal arterial pressure. In the case of the person with salt-insensitive essential hypertension, the arterial pressure does not increase significantly when changing from a normal salt intake to a high salt intake. However, in patients who have salt-sensitive essential hypertension, the high salt intake significantly exacerbates the hypertension.

Two additional points should be emphasized. First, salt sensitivity of blood pressure is not an all-or-none finding-it is quantitative, with some individuals being more salt-sensitive than others. Second, salt sensitivity of blood pressure is not a fixed characteristic; instead, blood pressure usually becomes more salt sensitive as a person ages, especially after 50 or 60 years of age, when the number of functions units (nephrons) in the kidneys begins to decrease gradually.

The reason for the difference between salt-insensitive essential hypertension and salt-sensitive hypertension is presumably related to structural or functional differences in the kidneys of these two types of hypertensive patients. For example, salt-sensitive hypertension may occur with different types of chronic renal disease because of the

gradual loss of nephrons or because of normal aging, as discussed in Chapter 32. Abnormal function of the renin-angiotensin system can also cause arterial pressure to become salt-sensitive, as discussed previously in this chapter.

Treatment of Essential Hypertension. As a first step, current guidelines for treating hypertension recommend lifestyle modifications aimed at increasing physical activity and weight loss in most patients. Unfortunately, many patients are unable to lose weight, and pharmacological treatment with antihypertensive drugs must be initiated. Two general classes of drugs are used to treat hypertension: (1) vasodilator drugs, which increase renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate; and (2) natriuretic or diuretic drugs, which decrease tubular reabsorption of salt and water.

Vasodilator drugs usually cause vasodilation in many other tissues of the body, as well as in the kidneys. Different vasodilators act in one of the following ways: (1) by inhibiting sympathetic nervous signals to the kidneys or by blocking the action of the sympathetic transmitter substance on the renal vasculature and renal tubules; (2) by directly relaxing the smooth muscle of the renal vasculature; or (3) by blocking the action of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on the renal vasculature or renal tubules.

Drugs that reduce the reabsorption of salt and water by the renal tubules include, in particular, drugs that block active transport of sodium through the tubular wall; this blockage in turn also prevents the reabsorption of water, as explained earlier in the chapter. These natriuretic or diuretic drugs are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 32.

## SUMMARY OF INTEGRATED MULTIFACETED SYSTEMS FOR ARTERIAL PRESSURE REGULATION

It is clear that arterial pressure is regulated not by a single pressure controlling system but instead by several interrelated systems, each of which performs a specific function. For example, when a person bleeds so severely that the pressure falls suddenly, two problems confront the pressure control system. The first is survival; the arterial pressure must be rapidly returned to a high enough level that the person can live through the acute episode. The second is to return the blood volume and arterial pressure eventually to their normal levels so that the circulatory system can reestablish full normality, not merely back to the levels required for survival.

In Chapter 18, we saw that the first line of defense against acute changes in arterial pressure is the nervous control system. In this chapter, we have emphasized a second line of defense achieved mainly by kidney mechanisms for the long-term control of arterial pressure. However, there are other pieces to the puzzle. Figure 19-16 helps put these pieces together.
![gu71687650e1](gu71687650e1.jpg)

Figure 19-16. Approximate potency of various arterial pressure control mechanisms at different time intervals after the onset of a disturbance to the arterial pressure. Note especially the near-infinite gain $(\rightarrow)$ of the renal body fluid pressure control mechanism that occurs after a few weeks' time. CNS, Central nervous system. (Modified from Guyton AC: Arterial Pressure and Hypertension. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1980.)

Figure 19-16 shows the approximate immediate (seconds and minutes) and long-term (hours and days) control responses, expressed as feedback gain, of eight arterial pressure control mechanisms. These mechanisms can be divided into three groups: (1) those that react rapidly, within seconds or minutes; (2) those that respond over an intermediate time period-that is, minutes or hours; and (3) those that provide long-term arterial pressure regulation for days, months, and years.

Arterial Pressure Control Mechanisms That Act Within Seconds or Minutes. The rapidly acting pressure control mechanisms are almost entirely acute nervous reflexes or other autonomic nervous system responses. Note in Figure 19-16 the three mechanisms that show responses within seconds: (1) the baroreceptor feedback mechanism; (2) the central nervous system ischemic mechanism; and (3) the chemoreceptor mechanism. Not only do these mechanisms begin to react within seconds, but they are also powerful. After any acute fall in pressure, as might be caused by severe hemorrhage, the nervous mechanisms combine to cause the following: (1) constriction of the veins and transfer of blood into the heart; (2) increased heart rate and contractility of the heart to provide greater pumping capability by the heart; and (3) constriction of most peripheral arterioles. All these effects occur almost instantly to raise the arterial pressure back into a survival range.

When the pressure suddenly rises too high, as might occur in response to a rapid transfusion of excess blood, the same control mechanisms operate in the reverse direction, again returning the pressure back toward normal.

## Arterial Pressure Control Mechanisms That Act After

Many Minutes. Several pressure control mechanisms exhibit significant responses only after a few minutes following an acute arterial pressure change. Three of these mechanisms, shown in Figure 19-16, are as follows: (1) the renin-angiotensin vasoconstrictor mechanism; (2) stress relaxation of the vasculature; and (3) shift of fluid through the tissue capillary walls in and out of the circulation to readjust the blood volume as needed.

We have already described at length the role of the renin-angiotensin vasoconstrictor system to provide a semiacute means for increasing the arterial pressure when necessary. The stress relaxation mechanism is demonstrated by the following example. When the pressure in the blood vessels becomes too high, they become stretched more and more for minutes or hours; as a result, the pressure in the vessels falls toward normal. This continuing stretch of the vessels, called stress relaxation, can serve as an intermediate-term pressure "buffer."

The capillary fluid shift mechanism means simply that whenever capillary pressure falls too low, fluid is absorbed from the tissues through the capillary membranes and into the circulation, thus building up the blood volume and increasing the pressure in the circulation. Conversely, when the capillary pressure rises too high, fluid is lost out of the circulation into the tissues, thus reducing the blood volume, as well as virtually all the pressures throughout the circulation.

These three intermediate mechanisms mostly become activated within 30 minutes to several hours. During this time, the nervous mechanisms usually become less and less effective, illustrating the importance of these nonnervous, intermediate-term pressure control measures.

Long-Term Mechanisms for Arterial Pressure Regulation. The goal of this chapter has been to explain the role of the kidneys in long-term control of arterial pressure. To the far right in Figure 19-16 is shown the renal-blood volume pressure control mechanism, which is the same as the renal-body fluid pressure control mechanism, demonstrating that it takes a few hours to begin showing significant response. Yet, it eventually develops a feedback gain for control of arterial pressure that is nearly equal to infinity. This means that this mechanism can eventually return the arterial pressure nearly all the way back, not merely partway back, to the pressure level that provides normal output of salt and water by the kidneys.

Many factors can affect the pressure-regulating level of the renal-body fluid mechanism. One of these, shown in Figure 19-16, is aldosterone. A decrease in arterial pressure leads within minutes to an increase in aldosterone secretion and, over the next hour or days, this effect plays an important role in modifying the pressure control characteristics of the renal-body fluid mechanism.

Especially important is the interaction of the reninangiotensin system with the aldosterone and renal fluid mechanisms. For example, a person's salt intake varies tremendously from one day to another. We have seen in this chapter that salt intake can decrease to as little as onetenth normal or can increase to 10 to 15 times normal and yet the regulated level of the mean arterial pressure will change only a few mm Hg if the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system is fully operative. However, without a functional renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, blood pressure becomes very sensitive to changes in salt intake.

Thus, arterial pressure control begins with the lifesaving measures of the nervous pressure controls, then continues with the sustaining characteristics of the intermediate pressure controls and, finally, is stabilized at the long-term pressure level by the renal-body fluid mechanism. This long-term mechanism, in turn, has multiple interactions with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the nervous system, and several other factors that provide special blood pressure control capabilities for special purposes.

# Cardiac Output, Venous Return, and Their Regulation 

Cardiac output is the quantity of blood pumped into the aorta each minute by the heart. This is also the quantity of blood that flows through the circulation. Because cardiac output is the sum of the blood flow to all the tissues of the body, it is one of the most important factors to consider in relation to function of the cardiovascular system.

Venous return is equally important because it is the quantity of blood flowing from the veins into the right atrium each minute. The venous return and the cardiac output must equal each other except for a few heartbeats when blood is temporarily stored in or removed from the heart and lungs.

## NORMAL VALUES FOR CARDIAC OUTPUT AT REST AND DURING ACTIVITY

Cardiac output varies widely with the level of activity of the body. The following factors, among others, directly affect cardiac output: (1) the basic level of body metabolism; (2) whether the person is exercising; (3) the person's age; and (4) the size of the body.

For young healthy men, resting cardiac output averages about $5.6 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. For women, this value is about $4.9 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. When one considers the factor of age as well-because with increasing age, body activity and mass of some tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle) diminish-the average cardiac output for the resting adult, in round numbers, is often stated to be about $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. However, cardiac output varies considerably among healthy men and women depending on muscle mass, adiposity, physical activity, and other factors that influence metabolic rate and nutritional needs of the tissues.

## Cardiac Index

Experiments have shown that the cardiac output increases approximately in proportion to the surface area of the body. Therefore, cardiac output is frequently stated in terms of the cardiac index, which is the cardiac output per square meter of body surface area. The average person who weighs 70 kilograms has a body surface area of about 1.7 square meters, which means that the normal average cardiac index for adults is about $3 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ of body surface area.

Effect of Age on Cardiac Output. Figure 20-1 shows the cardiac output, expressed as cardiac index, at different ages. The cardiac index rises rapidly to a level greater than $4 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ at age 10 years and declines to about 2.4 $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ at age 80 years. We explain later in this chapter that the cardiac output is regulated throughout life almost directly in proportion to overall metabolic activity. Therefore, the declining cardiac index is indicative of declining activity and/or declining muscle mass with age.

## CONTROL OF CARDIAC OUTPUT BY VENOUS RETURN-FRANK-STARLING MECHANISM OF THE HEART

Although heart function is obviously crucial in determining cardiac output, the various factors of the peripheral circulation that affect flow of blood into the heart from the veins, called venous return, are normally the primary controllers of cardiac output.

The main reason why peripheral factors are usually so important in controlling cardiac output is that the heart has a built-in mechanism that normally allows it to pump automatically the amount of blood that flows from the veins into the right atrium. This mechanism, called the Frank-Starling law of the heart, was discussed in Chapter 9. Basically, this law states that when increased quantities of blood flow into the heart, the increased volume of blood stretches the walls of the heart chambers. As a result of the stretch, the cardiac muscle contracts with increased force, and this action ejects the extra blood that has entered from the systemic circulation. Therefore, the blood that flows into the heart is automatically pumped without delay into the aorta and flows again through the circulation.

Another important factor, discussed in Chapters 10 and 18, is that stretching the heart causes an increased heart rate. Stretch of the sinus node in the wall of the right atrium has a direct effect on the rhythmicity of the node to increase the heart rate as much as $10 \%$ to $15 \%$. In addition, the stretched right atrium initiates a nervous reflex called the Bainbridge reflex, passing first to the vasomotor center of the brain and then back to the heart by way of the sympathetic nerves and vagi, which also increases the heart rate.

Under most normal unstressed conditions, the cardiac output is controlled mainly by peripheral factors that determine venous return. However, as we discuss later in the chapter, if the returning blood does become more than the heart can pump, then the heart becomes the limiting factor that determines cardiac output.

## Cardiac Output Is the Sum of All Tissue Blood Flows-Tissue Metabolism Regulates Most Local Blood Flow

The venous return to the heart is the sum of all the local blood flow through all the individual tissue segments of the peripheral circulation (Figure 20-2). Therefore, it follows that cardiac output regulation is normally the sum of all the local blood flow regulations.

The mechanisms of local blood flow regulation were discussed in Chapter 17. In most tissues, blood flow increases mainly in proportion to each tissue's metabolism. For example, local blood flow almost always increases when tissue oxygen consumption increases; this effect is demonstrated in Figure 20-3 for different levels of exercise. Note that at each increasing level of work output during exercise, oxygen consumption and cardiac output increase in parallel to each other.

To summarize, cardiac output is usually determined by the sum of all the various factors throughout the body that control local blood flow. All the local blood flows summate to form the venous return, and the heart automatically pumps this returning blood back into the arteries to flow around the system again.

## Cardiac Output Varies Inversely With Total Peripheral Resistance When Arterial Pressure Is Unchanged. Figure 20-3 is the same as Figure 19-5. It is repeated here to illustrate an extremely important principle in cardiac

![gu73687650e1](gu73687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-2. Cardiac output is equal to venous return and is the sum of tissue and organ blood flows. Except when the heart is severely weakened and unable to pump the venous return adequately, cardiac output (total tissue blood flow) is determined mainly by the metabolic needs of the tissues and organs of the body.

![gu74687650e1](gu74687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-3. Effect of increasing levels of exercise to increase cardiac output (red solid line) and oxygen consumption (blue dashed line). (Modified from Guyton AC, Jones CE, Coleman TG: Circulatory Physiology: Cardiac Output and Its Regulation, 2nd ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1973.)
output control: Under many conditions, the long-term cardiac output level varies reciprocally with changes in total peripheral vascular resistance as long as the arterial pressure is unchanged. Note in Figure 20-4 that when the total peripheral resistance is exactly normal (at the $100 \%$ mark in the figure), the cardiac output is also normal. Then, when the total peripheral resistance increases above normal, the cardiac output falls; conversely, when the total peripheral resistance decreases, the cardiac output increases. One can easily understand this phenomenon by reconsidering one of the forms of Ohm's law, as expressed in Chapter 14:

![gu75687650e1](gu75687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-4. Chronic effect of different levels of total peripheral resistance on cardiac output, showing a reciprocal relationship between total peripheral resistance and cardiac output. AV, Atrioventricular. (Modified from Guyton AC: Arterial Pressure and Hypertension. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1980.)

$$
\text { Cardiac output }=\frac{\text { Arterial pressure }}{\text { Total peripheral resistance }}
$$

Thus, any time the long-term level of total peripheral resistance changes (but no other functions of the circulation change), the cardiac output changes quantitatively in exactly the opposite direction.

## Limits for the Cardiac Output

There are definite limits to the amount of blood that the heart can pump, which can be expressed quantitatively in the form of cardiac output curves.

Figure 20-5 demonstrates the normal cardiac output curve, showing the cardiac output per minute at each level of right atrial pressure. This is one type of cardiac function curve, which was discussed in Chapter 9. Note that the plateau level of this normal cardiac output curve is about $13 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, 2.5 times the normal cardiac output of about $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. This means that the normal human heart, functioning without any special stimulation, can pump a venous return up to about 2.5 times the normal venous return before the heart becomes a limiting factor in the control of cardiac output.

Shown in Figure 20-5 are several other cardiac output curves for hearts that are not pumping normally. The uppermost curves are for hypereffective hearts that are pumping better than normal. The lowermost curves are for hypoeffective hearts that are pumping at levels below normal.

## Factors That Cause a Hypereffective Heart

Two general types of factors that can make the heart a stronger pump than normal are nervous stimulation and hypertrophy of the heart muscle.
![gu76687650e1](gu76687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-5. Cardiac output curves for the normal heart and for hypoeffective and hypereffective hearts. (Modified from Guyton AC, Jones CE, Coleman TG: Circulatory Physiology: Cardiac Output and Its Regulation, 2nd ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1973.)

Nervous Excitation Can Increase Heart Pumping. In Chapter 9, we saw that a combination of sympathetic stimulation and parasympathetic inhibition does two things to increase the pumping effectiveness of the heart: (1) it greatly increases the heart rate-sometimes, in young people, from the normal level of 72 beats/min up to 180 to 200 beats/min-and (2) it increases the strength of heart contraction (called increased contractility) to twice its normal strength. Combining these two effects, maximal nervous excitation of the heart can raise the plateau level of the cardiac output curve to almost twice the plateau of the normal curve, as shown by the $25-\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min}$ level of the uppermost curve in Figure 20-5.

## Heart Hypertrophy Can Increase Pumping Effectiveness.

A long-term increased workload, but not so much excess load that it damages the heart, causes the heart muscle to increase in mass and contractile strength in the same way that heavy exercise causes skeletal muscles to hypertrophy. For example, the hearts of marathon runners may be increased in mass by $50 \%$ to $75 \%$. This factor increases the plateau level of the cardiac output curve, sometimes $60 \%$ to $100 \%$, and therefore allows the heart to pump much greater than the usual amounts of cardiac output.

When one combines nervous excitation of the heart and hypertrophy, as occurs in marathon runners, the total effect can allow the heart to pump as much 30 to $40 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, about 2.5 times the level that can be achieved in the average person. This increased level of pumping is one of the most important factors in determining the runner's running time.

## Factors That Cause a Hypoeffective Heart

Any factor that decreases the heart's ability to pump blood causes hypoeffectivity. Some of the factors that

can decrease the heart's ability to pump blood are the following:

- Increased arterial pressure against which the heart must pump, such as in severe hypertension
- Inhibition of nervous excitation of the heart
- Pathological factors that cause abnormal heart rhythm or rate of heartbeat
- Coronary artery blockage, causing a heart attack
- Valvular heart disease
- Congenital heart disease
- Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle
- Cardiac hypoxia


## NERVOUS SYSTEM REGULATION OF CARDIAC OUTPUT

Importance of Nervous System For Maintaining Arterial Pressure When Peripheral Blood Vessels Are Dilated and Venous Return and Cardiac Output Increase. Figure 20-6 shows an important difference in cardiac output control with and without a functioning autonomic nervous system. The solid curves demonstrate the effect in the normal dog of intense dilation of the peripheral blood vessels caused by administering the drug dinitrophenol, which increased the metabolism of virtually all tissues of the body about fourfold. With nervous control mechanisms intact, dilating all the peripheral blood vessels caused almost no change in arterial pressure but increased the cardiac output almost fourfold. However, after autonomic control of the nervous system was blocked, vasodilation of the blood vessels with dinitrophenol (dashed curves) then caused a profound fall in arterial pressure to about one-half normal, and the cardiac output increased only 1.6 -fold instead of fourfold.

Thus, maintenance of a normal arterial pressure by the nervous system reflexes, by mechanisms explained in
![gu77687650e1](gu77687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-6. Experiment in a dog to demonstrate the importance of nervous maintenance of the arterial pressure as a prerequisite for cardiac output control. Note that with pressure control, the metabolic stimulant dinitrophenol increased cardiac output greatly; without pressure control, the arterial pressure fell, and the cardiac output increased very little. (Drawn from experiments by Dr. M. Banet.)

Chapter 18, is essential to achieve high cardiac outputs when the peripheral tissues dilate their blood vessels to increase the venous return.

## Effect of Nervous System to Increase Arterial Pressure

During Exercise. During exercise, intense increases in metabolism in active skeletal muscles cause relaxation of muscle arterioles to allow adequate oxygen and other nutrients needed to sustain muscle contraction. This greatly decreases the total peripheral resistance, which normally would decrease the arterial pressure as well. However, the nervous system immediately compensates. The same brain activity that sends motor signals to the muscles sends simultaneous signals into the autonomic nervous centers of the brain to excite circulatory activity, causing large vein constriction, increased heart rate, and increased contractility of the heart. All these changes acting together increase the arterial pressure above normal, which in turn forces still more blood flow through the active muscles.

In summary, when local tissue blood vessels dilate and increase venous return and cardiac output above normal, the nervous system plays a key role in preventing the arterial pressure from falling to disastrously low levels. During exercise, the nervous system goes even further, providing additional signals to raise the arterial pressure above normal, which serves to increase the cardiac output an extra $30 \%$ to $100 \%$.

## Pathologically High or Low Cardiac Outputs

Multiple clinical abnormalities can cause either high or low cardiac outputs. Some of the more important of these abnormal cardiac outputs are shown in Figure 20-7.

## High Cardiac Output Caused by Reduced Total Peripheral Resistance

The left side of Figure 20-7 identifies conditions that cause abnormally high cardiac outputs. One of the distinguishing features of these conditions is that they all result from chronically reduced total peripheral resistance None of them result from excessive excitation of the heart itself, which we will explain subsequently. Let us consider some of the conditions that can decrease the peripheral resistance and at the same time increase the cardiac output to above normal.

1. Beriberi. This disease is caused by insufficient quantity of the vitamin thiamine (vitamin $B_{1}$ ) in the diet. Lack of this vitamin causes diminished ability of the tissues to use some cellular nutrients, and the local tissue blood flow control mechanisms in turn cause marked compensatory peripheral vasodilation. Sometimes the total peripheral resistance decreases to as little as halfnormal. Consequently, the long-term levels of venous return and cardiac output also may increase to twice the normal value.
2. Arteriovenous (AV) fistula (shunt). Earlier, we pointed out that whenever a fistula (also called an $A V$ shunt) occurs between a major artery and major vein, large amounts

of blood flow directly from the artery into the vein. This also greatly decreases the total peripheral resistance and, likewise, increases the venous return and cardiac output.
3. Hyperthyroidism. In hyperthyroidism, the metabolism of most tissues of the body becomes greatly increased. Oxygen usage increases, and vasodilator products are released from the tissues. Therefore, total peripheral resistance decreases markedly because of local tissue blood flow control reactions throughout the body; consequently, venous return and cardiac output often increase to $40 \%$ to $80 \%$ above normal.
4. Anemia. In anemia, two peripheral effects greatly decrease total peripheral resistance. One of these effects is reduced viscosity of the blood, resulting from the decreased concentration of red blood cells. The other effect is diminished delivery of oxygen to the tissues, which causes local vasodilation. As a consequence, cardiac output increases greatly.
Any other factor that decreases total peripheral resistance chronically also increases cardiac output if arterial pressure does not decrease too much.

## Low Cardiac Output

Figure 20-7 shows at the far right several conditions that cause abnormally low cardiac output. These conditions fall into two categories: (1) abnormalities that decrease pumping effectiveness of the heart; and (2) those that decrease venous return.

Decreased Cardiac Output Caused by Cardiac Factors. Whenever the heart becomes severely damaged, regardless of the cause, its limited level of pumping may fall below that needed for adequate blood flow to the tissues. Some examples of this condition include the following: (1) severe coronary blood vessel blockage and consequent myocardial infarction; (2) severe valvular heart disease; (3) myocarditis;
(4) cardiac tamponade; and (5) cardiac metabolic derangements. The effects of several of these conditions are shown on the right in Figure 20-7, demonstrating the low cardiac outputs that result.

When the cardiac output falls so low that the tissues throughout the body begin to suffer nutritional deficiency, the condition is called cardiac shock. This condition is discussed in Chapter 22 in relationship to cardiac failure.

Decreased Cardiac Output Caused by Noncardiac Peripheral Factors-Decreased Venous Return. Anything that interferes with venous return also can lead to decreased cardiac output. Some of these factors are as follows:

1. Decreased blood volume. The most common noncardiac peripheral factor that leads to decreased cardiac output is decreased blood volume, often from hemorrhage. Loss of blood may decrease the filling of the vascular system to such a low level that there is not enough blood in the peripheral vessels to create peripheral vascular pressures high enough to push the blood back to the heart.
2. Acute venous dilation. Acute venous dilation results most often when the sympathetic nervous system suddenly becomes inactive. For example, fainting often results from sudden loss of sympathetic nervous system activity, which causes the peripheral capacitative vessels, especially the veins, to dilate markedly. This dilation decreases the filling pressure of the vascular system because the blood volume can no longer create adequate pressure in the now flaccid peripheral blood vessels. As a result, the blood pools in the vessels and does not return to the heart as rapidly as normal.
3. Obstruction of the large veins. On rare occasions, the large veins leading into the heart become obstructed, and the blood in the peripheral vessels cannot flow back into the heart. Consequently, the cardiac output falls markedly.
![gu78687650e1](gu78687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-7. Cardiac output in different pathological conditions. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of patients studied in each condition. AV, Atrioventricular. (Modified from Guyton AC, Jones CE, Coleman TG: Circulatory Physiology: Cardiac Output and Its Regulation, 2nd ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1973.)

4. Decreased tissue mass, especially decreased skeletal muscle mass. With normal aging or with prolonged periods of physical inactivity, a reduction in the size of the skeletal muscles usually occurs. This reduction, in turn, decreases the total oxygen consumption and blood flow needs of the muscles, resulting in decreases in skeletal muscle blood flow and cardiac output.
5. Decreased metabolic rate of the tissues. If the tissue metabolic rate is reduced, as occurs in skeletal muscle during prolonged bed rest, the oxygen consumption and nutrition needs of the tissues will also be lower, which decreases blood flow to the tissues, resulting in reduced cardiac output. Other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, may also reduce metabolic rate and therefore tissue blood flow and cardiac output.
Regardless of the cause of low cardiac output, whether it is a peripheral factor or a cardiac factor, if the cardiac output ever falls below the level required for adequate nutrition of the tissues, the person is said to experience circulatory shock. This condition can be lethal within a few minutes to a few hours. Circulatory shock is such an important clinical problem that it is discussed in detail in Chapter 24.

## CARDIAC OUTPUT CURVES USED IN QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF CARDIAC OUTPUT REGULATION

Our discussion of cardiac output regulation thus far is adequate for understanding the factors that control cardiac output in most simple conditions. However, to understand cardiac output regulation in especially stressful situations, such as the extremes of exercise, cardiac failure, and circulatory shock, a more complex quantitative analysis is presented in the following sections.

To perform the more quantitative analysis, it is necessary to distinguish separately the two primary factors concerned with cardiac output regulation: (1) the pumping ability of the heart, as represented by cardiac output curves; and (2) the peripheral factors that affect flow of blood from the veins into the heart, as represented by venous return curves. Then we can put these curves together in a quantitative way to show how they interact with each other to determine cardiac output, venous return, and right atrial pressure at the same time.

Some of the cardiac output curves used to depict quantitative heart pumping effectiveness have already been shown in Figure 20-5. However, an additional set of curves is required to show the effect on cardiac output caused by changing external pressures on the outside of the heart, as explained in the next section.

## Effect of External Pressure Outside the Heart on

Cardiac Output Curves. Figure 20-8 shows the effect of changes in external cardiac pressure on the cardiac output curve. The normal external pressure is equal to the normal intrapleural pressure (the pressure in the chest cavity), which is about -4 mm Hg . Note in the figure that a rise in intrapleural pressure, to -2 mm Hg ,
shifts the entire cardiac output curve to the right by the same amount. This shift occurs because filling the cardiac chambers with blood requires an extra 2 mm Hg of right atrial pressure to overcome the increased pressure on the outside of the heart. Likewise, an increase in intrapleural pressure to +2 mm Hg requires a 6 mm Hg increase in right atrial pressure from the normal -4 mm Hg , which shifts the entire cardiac output curve 6 mm Hg to the right.

Some factors that can alter the external pressure on the heart and thereby shift the cardiac output curve are the following:

1. Cyclical changes of intrapleural pressure during respiration, which are about $\pm 2 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ during normal breathing but can be as much as $\pm 50 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ during strenuous breathing
2. Breathing against a negative pressure, which shifts the curve to a more negative right atrial pressure (to the left).
3. Positive-pressure breathing, which shifts the curve to the right
4. Opening the thoracic cage, which increases the intrapleural pressure to 0 mm Hg and shifts the cardiac output curve to the right by 4 mm Hg
5. Cardiac tamponade, which means accumulation of a large quantity of fluid in the pericardial cavity around the heart with a resultant increase in external cardiac pressure and shifting of the curve to the right
Note in Figure 20-8 that cardiac tamponade shifts the upper parts of the curves farther to the right than the lower parts because the external tamponade pressure rises to higher values as the chambers of the heart fill to increased volumes during high cardiac output.

## Combinations of Different Patterns of Cardiac Output

Curves. Figure 20-9 shows that the final cardiac output curve can change as a result of simultaneous changes in the following: (1) external cardiac pressure; and (2) effectiveness of the heart as a pump. For example, the

![gu80687650e1](gu80687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-9. Combinations of two major patterns of cardiac output curves showing the effect of alterations in both extracardiac pressure and effectiveness of the heart as a pump. (Modified from Guyton AC, Jones CE, Coleman TG: Circulatory Physiology: Cardiac Output and Its Regulation, 2nd ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1973.)
combination of a hypereffective heart and increased intrapleural pressure would lead to an increased maximum level of cardiac output due to the increased pumping capability of the heart, but the cardiac output curve would be shifted to the right (to higher atrial pressures) because of the increased intrapleural pressure. Thus, by knowing what is happening to the external pressure, and to the capability of the heart as a pump, one can express the momentary ability of the heart to pump blood by a single cardiac output curve.

## VENOUS RETURN CURVES

The entire systemic circulation must be considered before complete analysis of cardiac regulation can be achieved. To analyze the function of the systemic circulation experimentally, the heart and lungs were removed from the circulation of an animal and replaced with a pump and artificial oxygenator system. Then, different factors, such as blood volume, vascular resistances, and central venous pressure in the right atrium, were altered to determine how the systemic circulation operates in different circulatory states. From these studies, one finds the following three principal factors that affect venous return to the heart from the systemic circulation:

1. Right atrial pressure, which exerts a backward force on the veins to impede flow of blood from the veins into the right atrium.
2. Degree of filling of the systemic circulation (measured by the mean systemic filling pressure), which forces the systemic blood toward the heart (this is the pressure measured everywhere in the systemic circulation when all flow of blood is stopped, discussed in detail later).
3. Resistance to blood flow between the peripheral vessels and the right atrium.
These factors can all be expressed quantitatively by the venous return curve, as we explain in the next sections.
![gu81687650e1](gu81687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-10. Normal venous return curve. The plateau is caused by collapse of the large veins entering the chest when the right atrial pressure falls below atmospheric pressure. Note also that venous return becomes zero when the right atrial pressure rises to equal the mean systemic filling pressure.

## Normal Venous Return Curve

In the same way that the cardiac output curve relates pumping of blood by the heart to right atrial pressure, the venous return curve relates venous return also to right atrial pressure-that is, the venous flow of blood into the heart from the systemic circulation at different levels of right atrial pressure.

The curve in Figure 20-10 is the normal venous return curve. This curve shows that when heart pumping capability becomes diminished and causes the right atrial pressure to rise, the backward force of the rising atrial pressure on the veins of the systemic circulation decreases venous return of blood to the heart. If all nervous circulatory reflexes are prevented from acting, venous return decreases to zero when the right atrial pressure rises to about +7 mm Hg . Such a slight rise in right atrial pressure causes a drastic decrease in venous return because any increase in back pressure causes blood to dam up in the systemic circulation instead of returning to the heart.

At the same time that the right atrial pressure is rising and causing venous stasis, pumping by the heart also approaches zero because of decreasing venous return. Both the arterial and venous pressures reach equilibrium when all flow in the systemic circulation ceases at a pressure of 7 mm Hg , which, by definition, is the mean systemic filling pressure.

Plateau in Venous Return Curve at Negative Atrial Pressures Caused by Collapse of the Large Veins. When the right atrial pressure falls below zero-that is, below atmospheric pressure-any further increase in venous return almost ceases, and by the time the right atrial pressure has fallen to about -2 mm Hg , the venous return reaches a plateau. It remains at this plateau level, even though the right atrial pressure falls to $-20 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg},-50$ mm Hg or even further. This plateau is caused by collapse of the veins entering the chest. Negative pressure in the right atrium sucks the walls of the veins together where they enter the chest, which prevents any additional flow of blood from the peripheral veins. Consequently, even very negative pressures in the right atrium cannot increase

venous return significantly above that which exists at a normal atrial pressure of 0 mm Hg .

## Mean Circulatory Filling Pressure, Mean Systemic Filling Pressure-Effects on Venous Return

When heart pumping is stopped by shocking the heart with electricity to cause ventricular fibrillation or is stopped in any other way, flow of blood everywhere in the circulation ceases a few seconds later. Without blood flow, the pressures everywhere in the circulation become equal. This equilibrated pressure level is called the mean circulatory filling pressure.

Increased Blood Volume Raises Mean Circulatory Filling Pressure. The greater the volume of blood in the circulation, the greater is the mean circulatory filling pressure because extra blood volume stretches the walls of the vasculature. The red curve in Figure 20-11 shows the approximate normal effect of different levels of blood volume on the mean circulatory filling pressure. Note that at a blood volume of about 4000 ml , the mean circulatory filling pressure is close to zero because this is the unstressed volume of the circulation but, at a volume of 5000 ml , the filling pressure is the normal value of 7 mm Hg . Similarly, at still higher volumes, the mean circulatory filling pressure increases almost linearly.

Sympathetic Nervous Stimulation Increases Mean Circulatory Filling Pressure. The green curve and blue curve in Figure 20-11 show the effects, respectively, of high and low levels of sympathetic nervous activity on the mean circulatory filling pressure. Strong sympathetic stimulation constricts all the systemic blood vessels, as well as the larger pulmonary blood vessels and even the
![gu82687650e1](gu82687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-11. Effect of changes in total blood volume on the mean circulatory filling pressure (volume-pressure curve for the entire circulatory system). These curves also show the effects of strong sympathetic stimulation and complete sympathetic inhibition.
chambers of the heart. Therefore, the capacity of the system decreases so that at each level of blood volume, the mean circulatory filling pressure is increased. At normal blood volume, maximal sympathetic stimulation increases the mean circulatory filling pressure from 7 mm Hg to about twice that value or about 14 mm Hg .

Conversely, complete inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system relaxes both the blood vessels and heart, decreasing the mean circulatory filling pressure from the normal value of 7 mm Hg down to about 4 mm Hg . Note in Figure 20-11 how steep the curves are, which means that even slight changes in blood volume or capacity of the system caused by various levels of sympathetic activity can have large effects on the mean circulatory filling pressure.

## Mean Systemic Filling Pressure and Relationship to

Mean Circulatory Filling Pressure. The mean systemic filling pressure (Psf) is slightly different from the mean circulatory filling pressure. It is the pressure measured everywhere in the systemic circulation after blood flow has been stopped by clamping the large blood vessels at the heart, so the pressures in the systemic circulation can be measured independently from those in the pulmonary circulation. The mean systemic filling pressure, although almost impossible to measure in a live animal, is almost always nearly equal to the mean circulatory filling pressure, because the pulmonary circulation has less than one-eighth as much capacitance as the systemic circulation and only about one-tenth as much blood volume.

Effect on Venous Return Curve of Changes in Mean Systemic Filling Pressure. Figure 20-12 shows the effects on the venous return curve caused by increasing or decreasing Psf. Note that the normal Psf is about 7 mm Hg . Then, for the uppermost curve in the figure, Psf has been increased to 14 mm Hg and, for the lowermost curve, it has decreased to 3.5 mm Hg . These curves demonstrate that the higher the Psf (which also means the greater the "tightness" with which the circulatory system is filled with blood), the more the venous return curve shifts upward and to the right. Conversely, the lower the Psf, the more the curve shifts downward and to the left.
![gu83687650e1](gu83687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-12. Venous return curves showing the normal curve when the mean systemic filling pressure (Psf) is 7 mm Hg and the effect of altering the Psf to $3.5,7$, or 14 mm Hg. (Modified from Guyton AC, Jones CE, Coleman TG: Circulatory Physiology: Cardiac Output and its Regulation, 2nd ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1973.)

Expressing this another way, the greater the degree to which the system is filled, the easier it is for blood to flow into the heart. The lesser the degree to which the system is filled, the more difficult it is for blood to flow into the heart.

When Pressure Gradient for Venous Return Is Zero There Is No Venous Return. When the right atrial pressure rises to equal the Psf, there is no longer any pressure difference between the peripheral vessels and right atrium. Consequently, there can no longer be any blood flow from peripheral vessels back to the right atrium. However, when the right atrial pressure falls progressively lower than the Psf, blood flow to the heart increases proportionately, as can be seen by studying any of the venous return curves in Figure 20-12. That is, the greater the difference between the Psf and right atrial pressure, the greater becomes the venous return. Therefore, the difference between these two pressures is called the pressure gradient for venous return.

## Resistance to Venous Return

In the same way that Psf represents a pressure pushing venous blood from the periphery toward the heart, there is also resistance to this venous flow of blood. This is called the resistance to venous return. Most of the resistance to venous return occurs in the veins, although some occurs in the arterioles and small arteries as well.

Why is venous resistance so important in determining the resistance to venous return? The answer is that when the resistance in the veins increases, blood begins to be dammed up, mainly in the veins themselves. However, the venous pressure rises very little because the veins are highly distensible. Therefore, this rise in venous pressure is not very effective in overcoming the resistance, and blood flow into the right atrium decreases drastically. Conversely, when arteriolar and small artery resistances increase, blood accumulates in the arteries, which have a capacitance only one thirtieth as great as that of the veins. Therefore, even slight accumulation of blood in the arteries raises the pressure greatly- 30 times as much as in the veins-and this high pressure overcomes much of the increased resistance. Mathematically, it turns out that about two-thirds of the so-called resistance to venous return is determined by venous resistance, and about one-third is determined by the arteriolar and small artery resistance.

Venous return can be calculated by the following formula:

$$
V R=\frac{P s f-P R A}{R V R}
$$

in which VR is venous return, Psf is mean systemic filling pressure, PRA is right atrial pressure, and RVR is resistance to venous return. In the healthy adult, the approximate values for these are as follows: venous return $=5$ $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min}, \mathrm{Psf}=7 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, right atrial pressure $=0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, and resistance to venous return $=1.4 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min}$ of blood flow.

## Effect of Resistance to Venous Return on the Venous

Return Curve. Figure 20-13 demonstrates the effect of different levels of resistance to venous return on the venous return curve, showing that a decrease in this resistance to half-normal allows twice as much flow of blood and, therefore, rotates the curve upward to twice as great a slope. Conversely, an increase in resistance to twice normal rotates the curve downward to half as great a slope.

Note also that when the right atrial pressure rises to equal the Psf, venous return becomes zero at all levels of resistance to venous return because there is no pressure gradient to cause flow of blood. Therefore, the highest level to which the right atrial pressure can rise, regardless of how much the heart might fail, is equal to the Psf.

Combinations of Venous Return Curve Patterns. Figure 20-14 shows the effects on the venous return curve caused by simultaneous changes in Psf and resistance to venous return, demonstrating that both these factors can operate simultaneously.

## ANALYSIS OF CARDIAC OUTPUT AND RIGHT ATRIAL PRESSURE BY SIMULTANEOUS CARDIAC OUTPUT AND VENOUS RETURN CURVES

In the complete circulation, the heart and the systemic circulation must operate together. This requirement means that (1) the venous return from the systemic circulation must equal the cardiac output from the heart and (2) the right atrial pressure is the same for the heart and systemic circulation.

Therefore, one can predict the cardiac output and right atrial pressure in the following way:

![gu85687650e1](gu85687650e1.jpg)

![gu86687650e1](gu86687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-15. The two solid curves demonstrate an analysis of cardiac output and right atrial pressure when the cardiac output (red line) and venous return (blue line) curves are normal. Transfusion of blood equal to $20 \%$ of the blood volume causes the venous return curve to become the dashed curve. As a result, the cardiac output and right atrial pressure shift from point A to point B. Psf, Mean systemic filling pressure.

1. Determine the momentary pumping ability of the heart, and depict this ability in the form of a cardiac output curve.
2. Determine the momentary state of flow from the systemic circulation into the heart, and depict this state of flow in the form of a venous return curve.
3. Equate these curves against each other, as shown in Figure 20-15.
Two curves in the figure depict the normal cardiac output curve (red line) and the normal venous return curve (blue line). There is only one point on the graph, point A, at which the venous return equals the cardiac output and at which the right atrial pressure is the same for both the
heart and systemic circulation. Therefore, in the normal circulation, the right atrial pressure, cardiac output, and venous return are all depicted by point A, called the equilibrium point, giving a normal value for cardiac output of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and a right atrial pressure of 0 mm Hg .

## Effect of Increased Blood Volume on Cardiac Output.

A sudden increase in blood volume of about $20 \%$ increases the cardiac output to about 2.5 to 3 times normal. An analysis of this effect is shown in Figure 20-15. Immediately on infusing the large quantity of extra blood, the increased filling of the system causes the Psf to increase to 16 mm Hg , which shifts the venous return curve to the right. At the same time, the increased blood volume distends the blood vessels, reducing their resistance and thereby reducing the resistance to venous return, which rotates the curve upward. As a result of these two effects, the venous return curve of Figure 20-15 is shifted to the right. This new curve equates with the cardiac output curve at point $B$, showing that the cardiac output and venous return increase 2.5 to 3 times and that the right atrial pressure rises to about +8 mm Hg .

Compensatory Effects Initiated in Response to Increased Blood Volume. The greatly increased cardiac output caused by increased blood volume lasts for only a few minutes because several compensatory effects immediately begin to occur:

1. The increased cardiac output increases the capillary pressure so that fluid begins to transude out of the capillaries into the tissues, thereby returning the blood volume toward normal.
2. The increased pressure in the veins causes the veins to continue distending gradually by the mechanism called stress-relaxation, especially causing the venous blood reservoirs, such as the liver and spleen, to distend, thus reducing the Psf.
3. The excess blood flow through the peripheral tissues causes an autoregulatory increase in the peripheral vascular resistance, thus increasing the resistance to venous return.
These factors cause the Psf to return toward normal and the resistance vessels of the systemic circulation to constrict. Therefore, gradually, over a period of 10 to 40 minutes, the cardiac output returns almost to normal.

## Effect of Sympathetic Stimulation on Cardiac Output.

Sympathetic stimulation affects the heart and systemic circulation: (1) it makes the heart a stronger pump; and (2) in the systemic circulation, it increases the Psf because of contraction of the peripheral vessels, especially the veins, and it increases the resistance to venous return.

In Figure 20-16, the normal cardiac output and venous return curves are depicted; these equate with each other at point A , which represents a normal venous return, cardiac output of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, and right atrial pressure of 0 mm Hg . Note in the figure that maximal sympathetic

Figure 20-16. Analysis of the effect on cardiac output of (1) moderate sympathetic stimulation (from point A to point C), (2) maximal sympathetic stimulation (point D), and (3) sympathetic inhibition caused by total spinal anesthesia (point B). (Modified from Guyton AC, Jones CE, Coleman TG: Circulatory Physiology: Cardiac Output and Its Regulation, 2nd ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1973.)
stimulation (green curves) increases the Psf to 17 mm Hg (depicted by the point at which the venous return curve reaches the zero venous return level). Sympathetic stimulation also increases pumping effectiveness of the heart by nearly $100 \%$. As a result, the cardiac output rises from the normal value at equilibrium point A to about double normal at equilibrium point D , and yet the right atrial pressure hardly changes. Thus, different degrees of sympathetic stimulation can increase the cardiac output progressively to about twice normal for short periods, until other compensatory effects occur within seconds or minutes to return cardiac output to nearly normal.

## Effect of Sympathetic Inhibition on Cardiac Output.

The sympathetic nervous system can be blocked by inducing total spinal anesthesia or by using a drug, such as hexamethonium, that blocks transmission of nerve signals through the autonomic ganglia. The lowermost curves in Figure 20-16 show the effect of sympathetic inhibition caused by total spinal anesthesia, demonstrating the following: (1) the Psf falls to about 4 mm Hg ; and (2) the effectiveness of the heart as a pump decreases to about 80\% of normal. The cardiac output falls from point A to point $B$, which is a decrease to about $60 \%$ of normal.

## Effect of Opening a Large Arteriovenous Fistula. Figure

20-17 shows various stages of circulatory changes that occur after opening a large AV fistula-that is, after making an opening directly between a large artery and a large vein.

1. The two red curves crossing at point A show the normal condition.
2. The curves crossing at point $B$ show the circulatory condition immediately after opening the large fistula.
![gu88687650e1](gu88687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-17. Analysis of successive changes in cardiac output and right atrial pressure in a human after a large arteriovenous (AV) fistula is suddenly opened. The stages of the analysis, as shown by the equilibrium points, are as follows: A, normal conditions; B, immediately after opening the AV fistula; C, 1 minute or so after the sympathetic reflexes have become active; and D, several weeks after the blood volume has increased and the heart has begun to hypertrophy. (Modified from Guyton AC, Jones CE, Coleman TG: Circulatory Physiology: Cardiac Output and Its Regulation, 2nd ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1973.)

The principal effects are as follows: (a) a sudden and precipitous rotation of the venous return curve upward caused by the large decrease in resistance to venous return when blood is allowed to flow with almost no impediment directly from the large arteries into the venous system, bypassing most of the resistance elements of the peripheral circulation; and (b) a slight increase in the level of the cardiac output curve because opening the fistula decreases the peripheral resistance and allows an acute fall in arterial pressure against which the heart can pump more easily. The net result, depicted by point B, is an increase in cardiac output from $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ up to $13 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and an increase in right atrial pressure to about +3 mm Hg .
3. Point $C$ represents the effects about 1 minute later, after the sympathetic nerve reflexes have restored the arterial pressure almost to normal and caused two other effects: (a) an increase in the Psf (because of constriction of all veins and arteries) from 7 to 9 mm Hg , thus shifting the venous return curve 2 mm Hg to the right; and (b) further elevation of the cardiac output curve because of sympathetic nervous excitation of the heart. The cardiac output now rises to almost $16 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, and the right atrial pressure rises to about 4 mm Hg .
4. Point $D$ shows the effect after several more weeks. By this time, the blood volume has increased because the slight reduction in arterial pressure and the sympathetic stimulation have both transiently

reduced the kidney output of urine, causing salt and water retention. The Psf has now risen to +12 mm Hg , shifting the venous return curve another 3 mm Hg to the right. Also, the prolonged increased workload on the heart has caused the heart muscle to hypertrophy slightly, raising the level of the cardiac output curve still further. Therefore, point D shows a cardiac output that is now almost $20 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and a right atrial pressure of about 6 mm Hg .

Other Analyses of Cardiac Output Regulation. In Chapter 21, analysis of cardiac output regulation during exercise is presented. In Chapter 22, analyses of cardiac output regulation at various stages of congestive heart failure are discussed.

## METHODS FOR MEASURING CARDIAC OUTPUT

Accurate assessment of cardiac output is vitally important in modern medical practice, especially in critically ill patients or in high-risk patients undergoing surgery. In animal experiments, one can measure the cardiac output using an electromagnetic or ultrasonic flowmeter placed on the aorta or pulmonary artery to measure cardiac output. In humans, however, cardiac output is usually measured by indirect methods that do not require surgery.

## Pulsatile Output of the Heart Measured by Electromagnetic or Ultrasonic Flowmeter

Figure 20-18 shows a recording in a dog of blood flow in the root of the aorta; this recording was made using an electromagnetic flowmeter. It demonstrates that the blood flow rises rapidly to a peak during systole and then, at the end of systole, it reverses for a fraction of a second. This reverse flow causes the aortic valve to close and the flow to return to zero.

## Measurement of Cardiac Output Using the Oxygen Fick Principle

The Fick principle is explained by Figure 20-19. This figure shows that 200 ml of oxygen are being absorbed from the lungs into the pulmonary blood each minute. It also shows that the blood entering the right heart has an
![gu89687650e1](gu89687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-18. Pulsatile blood flow in the root of the aorta recorded using an electromagnetic flowmeter.
oxygen concentration of $160 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{L}$ of blood, whereas that leaving the left heart has an oxygen concentration of 200 $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{L}$ of blood. From these data, one can calculate that each liter of blood passing through the lungs absorbs 40 ml of oxygen.

Because the total quantity of oxygen absorbed into the blood from the lungs each minute is 200 ml , dividing 200 by 40 calculates to a total of 5 liters of blood that must pass through the pulmonary circulation each minute to absorb this amount of oxygen. Therefore, the quantity of blood flowing through the lungs each minute is 5 liters, which is also a measure of the cardiac output. Thus, the cardiac output can be calculated by the following formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Cardiac output }(\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min}) \\
& =\frac{\mathrm{O}_{2} \text { absorbed per minute by the lungs }(\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min})}{\text { Arteriovenous } \mathrm{O}_{2} \text { difference }(\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{L} \text { of blood })}
\end{aligned}
$$

In applying this Fick procedure for measuring cardiac output in humans, mixed venous blood is usually obtained through a catheter inserted up the brachial vein of the forearm, through the subclavian vein, down to the right atrium and, finally, into the right ventricle or pulmonary artery. Systemic arterial blood can then be obtained from any systemic artery in the body. The rate of oxygen absorption by the lungs is measured by the rate of disappearance of oxygen from the respired air, using any type of oxygen meter.

## Indicator Dilution Method

To measure cardiac output by the indicator dilution method, a small amount of indicator, such as a dye, is injected into a large systemic vein or, preferably, into the right atrium. This indicator passes rapidly through the right side of the heart, then through the blood vessels of the lungs, through the left side of the heart, and finally into the systemic arterial system. The concentration of the dye is recorded as the dye passes through one of the peripheral arteries, giving a curve as shown in Figure 20-20. In each of these cases, 5 milligrams of Cardiogreen dye were injected at zero time. In the top recording, none of the dye passed into the arterial tree until about 3 seconds after the injection, but then the arterial concentration of the dye
![gu90687650e1](gu90687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-19. Fick principle for determining cardiac output.

![gu91687650e1](gu91687650e1.jpg)

Figure 20-20. Extrapolated dye concentration curves used to calculate two separate cardiac outputs by the dilution method. The rectangular areas are the calculated average concentrations of dye in the arterial blood for the durations of the respective extrapolated curves.
rose rapidly to a maximum in about 6 to 7 seconds. After that, the concentration fell rapidly, but before the concentration reached zero, some of the dye had already circulated all the way through some of the peripheral systemic vessels and returned through the heart for a second time. Consequently, the dye concentration in the artery began to rise again. For the purpose of calculation, it is necessary to extrapolate the early downslope of the curve to the zero point, as shown by the dashed portion of each curve. In this way, the extrapolated time-concentration curve of the dye in the systemic artery without recirculation can be measured in its first portion and estimated reasonably accurately in its latter portion.

Once the extrapolated time-concentration curve has been determined, the mean concentration of dye in the arterial blood for the duration of the curve can then be calculated. For example, in the top example of Figure 20-20, this calculation was done by measuring the area under the entire initial and extrapolated curve and then averaging the concentration of dye for the duration of the curve. One can see from the shaded rectangle straddling the curve in the upper figure that the average concentration of dye was $0.25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ of blood and that the duration of this average value was 12 seconds. A total of 5 milligrams of dye had been injected at the beginning of the experiment. For blood carrying only 0.25 milligram of dye in each 100 milliliters to carry the entire 5 milligrams of dye through the heart and lungs in 12 seconds, a total of 20 portions, each with 100 milliliters of blood, would have passed through the heart during the 12 seconds, which would be the same as a cardiac output of $2 \mathrm{~L} / 12 \mathrm{sec}$, or $10 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. We leave it to the reader to calculate the cardiac output from the bottom extrapolated curve of Figure 20-20. To summarize, the cardiac output can be determined using the following formula:

## Cardiac output $(\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min})=$ <br> Milligrams of dye injected $\times 60$ <br> Average concentration of dye in each milliliter of blood for the duration of the curve <br> Duration of the curve in seconds

## Echocardiography

Cardiac output can also be estimated by echocardiography, a method that uses ultrasound waves from a transducer placed on the chest wall or passed into the patient's esophagus to measure the size of the heart's chambers and the velocity of blood flowing from the left ventricle into the aorta. Stroke volume is calculated from the velocity of blood flowing into the aorta, and the aorta cross-sectional area is determined from the aorta diameter measured by ultrasound imaging. Cardiac output is then calculated from the product of the stroke volume and heart rate.

## Thoracic Electrical Bioimpedance Method

Impedance cardiography, also known as thoracic electrical bioimpedance, is a noninvasive technology used to measure changes in total electrical conductivity of the thorax as an indirect assessment of hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output. This method detects the impedance changes caused by a high-frequency, lowmagnitude current flowing through the thorax between additional two pairs of electrodes located outside the measured segment. Electrical impedance is the opposition that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied. With each heartbeat, blood volume and velocity in the aorta change, and the corresponding change in impedance and its timing are measured and used to estimate cardiac output.

Although some studies have suggested that impedance cardiography may provide reasonable assessments of cardiac output under some conditions, this method is also subject to several potential sources of error, including electrical interferences, motion artifacts, fluid accumulation around the heart and in the lungs, and arrhythmias. Some studies have suggested that the average error with this method may be as high as $20 \%$ to $40 \%$.

Accurate assessment of cardiac output provides insight into heart function and tissue perfusion because cardiac output represents the sum of blood flows to all the organs and tissues of the body. Thus, noninvasive methods for more accurate measurements of cardiac output are continuously being developed for managing patients with circulatory distress.

# Muscle Blood Flow and Cardiac Output During Exercise; the Coronary Circulation and Ischemic Heart Disease 

In this chapter we consider the following: (1) blood flow to the skeletal muscles; and (2) coronary artery blood flow to the heart. Regulation of each of these types of blood flow is achieved mainly by local control of vascular resistance in response to muscle tissue metabolic needs.

We also discuss the physiology of related subjects, including the following: (1) cardiac output control during exercise; (2) characteristics of heart attacks; and (3) the pain of angina pectoris.

## BLOOD FLOW REGULATION IN SKELETAL MUSCLE AT REST AND DURING EXERCISE

Strenuous exercise is one of the most stressful conditions that the normal circulatory system faces because there is such a large mass of skeletal muscle in the body, all of it requiring large amounts of blood flow. Also, the cardiac output often must increase to four to five times normal in the nonathlete or to six to seven times normal in the well-trained athlete to satisfy the metabolic needs of the exercising muscles.

## SKELETAL MUSCLE BLOOD FLOW RATE

During rest, skeletal muscle blood flow averages 3 to $4 \mathrm{ml} /$ $\mathrm{min} / 100 \mathrm{~g}$ of muscle. During extreme exercise in the wellconditioned athlete, this blood flow can increase 25 - to 50 -fold, rising to 100 to $200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} / 100 \mathrm{~g}$ of muscle. Peak blood flows as high as $400 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} / 100 \mathrm{~g}$ of muscle have been reported for thigh muscles of endurance-trained athletes.

Blood Flow During Muscle Contractions. Figure 21-1 shows a record of blood flow changes in a calf muscle of a leg during strong rhythmic muscular exercise. Note that the flow increases and decreases with each muscle contraction. At the end of the contractions, the blood flow remains high for a few seconds but then returns to normal during the next few minutes.

The cause of the lower flow during the muscle contraction phase of exercise is compression of the blood vessels by the contracted muscle. During strong tetanic contraction, which causes sustained compression of the blood
vessels, the blood flow can be almost stopped, but this also causes rapid weakening of the contraction.

Increased Blood Flow in Muscle Capillaries During Exercise. During rest, some muscle capillaries have little or no flowing blood, but during strenuous exercise, all the capillaries open. This opening of dormant capillaries diminishes the distance that oxygen and other nutrients must diffuse from the capillaries to the contracting muscle fibers; it sometimes contributes a twofold to threefold increased capillary surface area through which oxygen and nutrients can diffuse from the blood to the tissues.

## CONTROL OF SKELETAL MUSCLE BLOOD FLOW

Decreased Oxygen in Muscle Greatly Enhances Flow. The large increase in muscle blood flow that occurs during skeletal muscle activity is caused mainly by chemicals released locally that act directly on the muscle arterioles to cause dilation. One of the most important chemical effects is reduction of the oxygen level in the muscle tissues. When muscles are active, they use oxygen rapidly, thereby decreasing the oxygen concentration in the tissue fluids. This in turn causes local arteriolar vasodilation because
![gu92687650e1](gu92687650e1.jpg)

Figure 21-1. Effects of muscle exercise on blood flow in the calf of a leg during strong rhythmic contraction. The blood flow was much less during contractions than between contractions. (Modified from Barcroft H, Dornhorst AC: The blood flow through the human calf during rhythmic exercise. J Physiol 109:402, 1949.)

low oxygen levels cause the blood vessels to relax and because oxygen deficiency causes release of vasodilator substances. Adenosine may be an important vasodilator substance, but experiments have shown that even large amounts of adenosine infused directly into a muscle artery cannot increase blood flow to the same extent as during intense exercise, and it cannot sustain vasodilation in skeletal muscle for more than about 2 hours.

Fortunately, even after the muscle blood vessels have become insensitive to the vasodilator effects of adenosine, other vasodilator factors continue to maintain increased capillary blood flow as long as the exercise continues. These factors include the following: (1) potassium ions; (2) adenosine triphosphate (ATP); (3) lactic acid; and (4) carbon dioxide. We still do not know quantitatively how much of a role each of these factors plays in increasing muscle blood flow during muscle activity; this subject was discussed in additional detail in Chapter 17.

Nervous Control of Muscle Blood Flow. In addition to local tissue vasodilator mechanisms, skeletal muscles are provided with sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves and, in some species of animals, sympathetic vasodilator nerves as well.

The sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve fibers secrete norepinephrine at their nerve endings. When maximally activated, this mechanism can decrease blood flow through resting muscles to as little as one-half to one-third normal. This vasoconstriction is of physiologic importance in attenuating decreases of arterial pressure in circulatory shock and during other periods of stress, when it may even be necessary to increase blood pressure.

In addition to the norepinephrine secreted at the sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve endings, the medullae of the two adrenal glands also secrete increased amounts of norepinephrine plus even more epinephrine into the circulating blood during strenuous exercise. The circulating norepinephrine acts on the muscle vessels to cause a vasoconstrictor effect similar to that caused by direct sympathetic nerve stimulation. The epinephrine, however, often has a slight vasodilator effect because epinephrine excites more of the beta-adrenergic receptors of the vessels, which are vasodilator receptors, in contrast to the alpha vasoconstrictor receptors excited especially by norepinephrine. These receptors are discussed in Chapter 61.

## CIRCULATORY READJUSTMENTS DURING EXERCISE

Three major effects occur during exercise that are essential for the circulatory system to supply the tremendous blood flow required by the muscles: (1) sympathetic nervous system activation in many tissues with consequent stimulatory effects on the circulation; (2) increase in arterial pressure; and (3) increase in cardiac output.

## Effects of Sympathetic Activation

At the onset of exercise, signals are transmitted not only from the brain to the muscles to cause muscle contraction but also into the vasomotor center to initiate sympathetic discharge in many other tissues. Simultaneously, the parasympathetic signals to the heart are attenuated. Therefore, three major circulatory effects result:

1. The heart is stimulated to a greatly increased heart rate and increased pumping strength as a result of the sympathetic drive to the heart plus release of the heart from normal parasympathetic inhibition.
2. Many of the arterioles of the peripheral circulation are strongly contracted, except for the arterioles in the active muscles, which are strongly vasodilated by the local vasodilator effects in the muscles, as noted earlier. Thus, the heart is stimulated to supply the increased blood flow required by the muscles, while at the same time blood flow through most nonmuscular areas of the body is temporarily reduced, thereby "lending" blood supply to the muscles. This process accounts for as much as $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ of extra blood flow to the muscles, which is exceedingly important when considering a person running for his or her life, when even a fractional increase in running speed may make the difference between life and death. Two of the peripheral circulatory systems, the coronary and cerebral systems, are spared this vasoconstrictor effect because both these circulatory areas have poor vasoconstrictor innervation-fortunately so, because both the heart and brain are as essential to exercise as the skeletal muscles.
3. The muscle walls of the veins and other capacitative areas of the circulation are contracted powerfully, which greatly increases the mean systemic filling pressure. As we learned in Chapter 20, this effect is one of the most important factors in promoting the increase in venous return of blood to the heart and, therefore, in increasing the cardiac output.

## Sympathetic Stimulation May Increase Arterial Pressure During Exercise

An important effect of increased sympathetic stimulation in exercise is to increase the arterial pressure. This increased arterial pressure results from multiple stimulatory effects, including the following: (1) vasoconstriction of the arterioles and small arteries in most tissues of the body except the brain and active muscles, including the heart; (2) increased pumping activity by the heart; and (3) a great increase in mean systemic filling pressure caused mainly by venous contraction. These effects, working together, almost always increase the arterial pressure during exercise. This increase can be as little as 20 mm Hg or as much as 80 mm Hg , depending on the conditions

under which the exercise is performed. When a person performs exercise under tense conditions but uses only a few muscles, the sympathetic nervous response still occurs. In the few active muscles, vasodilation occurs, but elsewhere in the body the effect is mainly vasoconstriction, often increasing the mean arterial pressure to as high as 170 mm Hg . Such a condition might occur in a person standing on a ladder and nailing with a hammer on the ceiling above. The tenseness of the situation is obvious.

Conversely, when a person performs massive whole-body exercise, such as running or swimming, the increase in arterial pressure is often only 20 to 40 mm Hg . This lack of a large increase in pressure results from the extreme vasodilation that occurs simultaneously in large masses of active muscle.

## Why Is Increased Arterial Pressure During Exercise

Important? When muscles are stimulated maximally in a laboratory experiment, but without allowing the arterial pressure to rise, muscle blood flow seldom rises more than about eightfold. Yet, we know from studies of marathon runners that muscle blood flow can increase from as little as $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ for the whole body during rest to more than $20 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ during maximal activity. Therefore, it is clear that muscle blood flow can increase much more than that which occurs in this simple laboratory experiment. What is the difference? Mainly, the arterial pressure rises during normal exercise. Let us assume, for example, that the arterial pressure rises by $30 \%$ during heavy exercise. This $30 \%$ increase causes $30 \%$ more force to push blood through the muscle tissue vessels. However, this is not the only important effect-the extra pressure also stretches the walls of the vessels, and this effect, along with the locally released vasodilators and higher blood pressure, may increase muscle total flow to more than 20 times normal.

## Importance of Increased Cardiac Output During Exercise

Many different physiologic effects occur at the same time during exercise to increase cardiac output approximately in proportion to the degree of exercise. In fact, the ability of the circulatory system to provide increased cardiac output for delivery of oxygen and other nutrients to the muscles during exercise is equally as important as the strength of the muscles themselves in setting the limit for continued muscle work. For example, marathon runners who can increase their cardiac outputs the most are generally the ones who have record-breaking running times.

Graphic Analysis of Changes in Cardiac Output During Heavy Exercise. Figure 21-2 shows a graphic analysis of the large increase in cardiac output that occurs during heavy exercise. The cardiac output and venous return curves crossing at point A represent the normal circulation, and the curves crossing at point B represent heavy exercise. Note that the great increase in cardiac output requires significant changes in both the cardiac output curve and the venous return curve, as follows.
![gu93687650e1](gu93687650e1.jpg)

Figure 21-2. Graphic analysis of change in cardiac output, venous return, and right atrial pressure with the onset of strenuous exercise. Black curves, Normal circulation. Red curves, heavy exercise.

The increased level of the cardiac output curve is easy to understand. It results almost entirely from sympathetic stimulation of the heart, which causes the following: (1) increased heart rate, up to as high as 170 to 190 beats/ min ; and (2) increased strength of contraction of the heart to as much as twice normal. Without this increased level of cardiac function, the increase in cardiac output would be limited to the plateau level of the normal heart, which would be a maximum increase of cardiac output of only about 2.5 -fold rather than the 4 -fold increase that can commonly be achieved by the untrained runner and the 7 -fold increase that can be achieved in some marathon runners.

Now study the venous return curves. If no change occurred from the normal venous return curve, the cardiac output could hardly rise at all in exercise because the upper plateau level of the normal venous return curve is only $6 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. Yet, two important changes do occur:

1. The mean systemic filling pressure rises at the onset of heavy exercise. This effect results partly from the sympathetic stimulation that contracts the veins and other capacitative parts of the circulation. In addition, tensing of the abdominal and other skeletal muscles of the body compresses many of the internal vessels, thus providing more compression of the entire capacitative vascular system and causing a still greater increase in the mean systemic filling pressure. During maximal exercise, these two effects together can increase the mean systemic filling pressure from a normal level of 7 mm Hg to as high as 30 mm Hg .
2. The slope of the venous return curve rotates upward. This upward rotation is caused by decreased resistance in virtually all the blood vessels in active muscle tissue, which also causes resistance to venous return to decrease, thus increasing the upward slope of the venous return curve.
Therefore, the combination of increased mean systemic filling pressure and decreased resistance to venous return raises the entire level of the venous return curve.

![gu94687650e1](gu94687650e1.jpg)

Figure 21-3. Coronary arteries.

In response to the changes in both the venous return curve and cardiac output curve, the new equilibrium point in Figure 21-2 for cardiac output and right atrial pressure is now point B, in contrast to the normal level at point A. Note especially that the right atrial pressure has hardly changed, having risen only 1.5 mm Hg. In fact, in a person with a strong heart, the right atrial pressure often falls below normal during very heavy exercise because of the greatly increased sympathetic stimulation of the heart. In contrast, even a moderate level of exercise may cause marked increases in right atrial pressure in patients with weakened hearts.

## CORONARY CIRCULATION

About one-third of all deaths in industrialized countries of the Western world result from coronary artery disease, and most older adults have at least some impairment of the coronary artery circulation. For this reason, understanding normal and pathological physiology of the coronary circulation is one of the most important subjects in medicine.

## PHYSIOLOGIC ANATOMY OF THE CORONARY BLOOD SUPPLY

Figure 21-3 shows the heart and its coronary blood supply. Note that the main coronary arteries lie on the surface of the heart, and smaller arteries then penetrate from the surface into the cardiac muscle mass. It is almost entirely through these arteries that the heart receives its nutritive blood supply. Only the inner one-tenth millimeter of the endocardial surface can obtain significant nutrition directly from the blood inside the cardiac chambers, so this source of muscle nutrition is minuscule.

The left coronary artery supplies mainly the anterior and left lateral portions of the left ventricle, whereas the right coronary artery supplies most of the right ventricle, as well as the posterior part of the left ventricle in $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of people.
![gu95687650e1](gu95687650e1.jpg)

Figure 21-4. Phasic flow of blood through the coronary capillaries of the human left ventricle during cardiac systole and diastole (as extrapolated from measured flows in dogs).

Most of the coronary venous blood flow from the left ventricular muscle returns to the right atrium of the heart by way of the coronary sinus, which is about $75 \%$ of the total coronary blood flow. On the other hand, most of the coronary venous blood from the right ventricular muscle returns through small anterior cardiac veins that flow directly into the right atrium, not by way of the coronary sinus. A very small amount of coronary venous blood also flows back into the heart through very minute thebesian veins, which empty directly into all chambers of the heart.

## NORMAL CORONARY BLOOD FLOW AVERAGES 5\% OF CARDIAC OUTPUT

The normal coronary blood flow in the resting person averages $70 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} / 100 \mathrm{~g}$ of heart weight, or about $225 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, which is about $4 \%$ to $5 \%$ of the total cardiac output.

During strenuous exercise, the heart in the young adult increases its cardiac output fourfold to sevenfold, and it pumps this blood against a higher than normal arterial pressure. Consequently, the work output of the heart under severe conditions may increase 6 -fold to 9 -fold. At the same time, the coronary blood flow increases 3 -fold to 4 -fold to supply the extra nutrients needed by the heart. This increase is not as much as the increase in workload, which means that the ratio of energy expenditure by the heart to coronary blood flow increases. Thus, the efficiency of cardiac utilization of energy increases to make up for the relative deficiency of coronary blood supply.

## Cardiac Muscle Compression Causes Phasic Changes in Coronary Blood Flow During Systole and Diastole.

Figure 21-4 shows the changes in blood flow through the nutrient capillaries of the left ventricular coronary system in $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ in the heart during systole and diastole, as extrapolated from studies in experimental animals. Note from this diagram that the coronary capillary blood flow in the left ventricle muscle falls to a low

value during systole, which is opposite to flow in vascular beds elsewhere in the body. The reason for this phenomenon is strong compression of the intramuscular blood vessels by the left ventricular muscle during systolic contraction.

During diastole, the cardiac muscle relaxes and no longer obstructs blood flow through the left ventricular muscle capillaries, so blood flows rapidly during all of diastole.

Blood flow through the coronary capillaries of the right ventricle also undergoes phasic changes during the cardiac cycle but, because the force of contraction of the right ventricular muscle is far less than that of the left ventricular muscle, the inverse phasic changes are only partial, in contrast to those in the left ventricular muscle.

## Epicardial Versus Subendocardial Coronary Blood Flow-Effect of Intramyocardial Pressure. Figure 21-

5 demonstrates the special arrangement of the coronary vessels at different depths in the heart muscle, showing on the outer surface epicardial coronary arteries which supply most of the muscle. Smaller intramuscular arteries derived from the epicardial arteries penetrate the muscle, supplying the needed nutrients. Lying immediately beneath the endocardium is a plexus of subendocardial arteries. During systole, blood flow through the subendocardial plexus of the left ventricle, where the intramuscular coronary vessels are compressed greatly by ventricular muscle contraction, tends to be reduced. However, the extra vessels of the subendocardial plexus normally compensate for this reduction. Later in the chapter, we explain how this peculiar difference between blood flow in the epicardial and subendocardial arteries plays an important role in certain types of coronary ischemia.

## CONTROL OF CORONARY BLOOD FLOW

## Local Muscle Metabolism Is the Primary Controller of Coronary Flow

Blood flow through the coronary system is regulated mostly by local arteriolar vasodilation in response to the nutritional needs of cardiac muscle. That is, whenever the vigor of cardiac contraction is increased, the rate of coronary blood flow also increases. Conversely, decreased heart activity is accompanied by decreased coronary flow. This local regulation of coronary blood flow is similar to that which occurs in many other tissues of the body, especially in the skeletal muscles.

## Oxygen Demand Is a Major Factor in Local Coronary Blood Flow Regulation. Blood flow in the coronary

arteries usually is regulated almost exactly in proportion to the need of the cardiac musculature for oxygen. Normally, about $70 \%$ of the oxygen in the coronary arterial blood is removed as the blood flows through the heart muscle. Because not much oxygen is left, little additional oxygen can be supplied to the heart musculature unless the coronary blood flow increases. Fortunately, the coronary blood flow increases almost in direct proportion to any additional metabolic consumption of oxygen by the heart.

The exact means whereby increased oxygen consumption causes coronary dilation has not been determined. Many researchers have speculated that a decrease in oxygen concentration in the heart causes vasodilator substances to be released from the muscle cells and that these substances dilate the arterioles. A substance with great vasodilator propensity is adenosine. In the presence of very low concentrations of oxygen in the muscle cells, a large proportion of the cell's ATP degrades to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Small portions of this substance are then further degraded and release adenosine to the tissue fluids of the heart muscle, with a resultant increase in local coronary blood flow. After adenosine causes vasodilation, much of it is reabsorbed into the cardiac cells to be reused for production of ATP.

Adenosine is not the only vasodilator product that has been identified; others include adenosine phosphate compounds, potassium ions, hydrogen ions, carbon dioxide, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide. The mechanisms of coronary vasodilation during increased cardiac activity have not been fully explained by adenosine. Pharmacologic agents that block or partially block the vasodilator effect of adenosine do not completely prevent coronary vasodilation caused by increased heart muscle activity. Studies in skeletal muscle have also shown that the continued infusion of adenosine maintains vascular dilation for only 1 to 3 hours, yet muscle activity still dilates the local blood vessels, even when the adenosine can no longer dilate them. Therefore, the other vasodilator mechanisms listed earlier should be remembered.

## Nervous Control of Coronary Blood Flow

Stimulation of the autonomic nerves to the heart can affect coronary blood flow directly and indirectly. The direct effects result from action of the nervous transmitter substances acetylcholine from the vagus nerves and norepinephrine from the sympathetic nerves on the coronary vessels. The indirect effects result from secondary changes in coronary blood flow caused by increased or decreased activity of the heart.

The indirect effects, which are mostly opposite to the direct effects, play a far more important role in the normal control of coronary blood flow. Thus, sympathetic stimulation, which releases norepinephrine from the sympathetic nerves and epinephrine, as well as norepinephrine from the adrenal medullae, increases both heart rate and

heart contractility and increases the rate of metabolism of the heart. In turn, the increased metabolism of the heart sets off local blood flow regulatory mechanisms for dilating the coronary vessels and blood flow increases approximately in proportion to the metabolic needs of the heart muscle. In contrast, vagal stimulation, with its release of acetylcholine, slows the heart and has a slightly depressive effect on heart contractility. These effects decrease cardiac oxygen consumption and, therefore, indirectly constrict the coronary arteries.

Direct Effects of Nervous Stimuli on Coronary Vasculature. The distribution of parasympathetic (vagal) nerve fibers to the ventricular coronary system is not very great. However, the acetylcholine released by parasympathetic stimulation has a direct effect to dilate the coronary arteries.

Much more extensive sympathetic innervation of the coronary vessels occurs. In Chapter 61, we see that the sympathetic transmitter substances norepinephrine and epinephrine can have vascular constrictor or vascular dilator effects, depending on the presence or absence of constrictor or dilator receptors in the blood vessel walls. The constrictor receptors are called alpha receptors, and the dilator receptors are called beta receptors. Both alpha and beta receptors exist in the coronary vessels. In general, the epicardial coronary vessels have a preponderance of alpha receptors, whereas the intramuscular arteries may have a preponderance of beta receptors. Therefore, sympathetic stimulation can, at least theoretically, cause slight overall coronary constriction or dilation, but usually constriction. In some people, the alpha vasoconstrictor effects seem to be disproportionately severe, and these people can have vasospastic myocardial ischemia during periods of excess sympathetic drive, often with resultant anginal pain.

Metabolic factors, especially myocardial oxygen consumption, are the major controllers of myocardial blood flow. Whenever the direct effects of nervous stimulation reduce coronary blood flow, the metabolic control of coronary flow usually overrides the direct coronary nervous effects within seconds.

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF CARDIAC MUSCLE METABOLISM

The basic principles of cellular metabolism, discussed in Chapters 68 through 73, apply to cardiac muscle the same as for other tissues, but some quantitative differences exist. Most importantly, under resting conditions, cardiac muscle normally consumes more fatty acids than carbohydrates to supply its energy ( $\approx 70 \%$ of the energy is derived from fatty acids). However, as is also true of other tissues, under anaerobic or ischemic conditions, cardiac metabolism must call on anaerobic glycolysis mechanisms for energy. However, glycolysis consumes large quantities of the blood glucose and, at the same time, forms large
amounts of lactic acid in the cardiac tissue. This is probably one of the causes of cardiac pain in cardiac ischemic conditions, as discussed later in this chapter.

As is true in other tissues, more than $95 \%$ of the metabolic energy liberated from foods is used to form ATP in the mitochondria. This ATP in turn acts as the conveyer of energy for cardiac muscular contraction and other cellular functions. In severe coronary ischemia, the ATP degrades first to adenosine diphosphate and then to AMP and adenosine. Because the cardiac muscle cell membrane is slightly permeable to adenosine, much of this agent can diffuse from the muscle cells into the circulating blood.

The released adenosine is believed to be one of the substances that causes dilation of the coronary arterioles during coronary hypoxia, as discussed earlier. However, loss of adenosine also has a serious cellular consequence. Within as little as 30 minutes of severe coronary ischemia, as occurs after a myocardial infarct, about half of the adenine base can be lost from the affected cardiac muscle cells. Furthermore, this loss can be replaced by new synthesis of adenine at a rate of only $2 \% /$ hour. Therefore, once a serious bout of coronary ischemia has persisted for 30 minutes or longer, relief of the ischemia may be too late to prevent injury and death of the cardiac cells. This is almost certainly one of the major causes of cardiac cellular death during myocardial ischemia.

## ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE

The most common cause of death in the Western countries is ischemic heart disease, which results from insufficient coronary blood flow. About $35 \%$ of people in the United States aged 65 years and older die of this cause. Some deaths occur suddenly as a result of acute coronary occlusion or fibrillation of the heart, whereas other deaths occur slowly over a period of weeks to years as a result of progressive weakening of the heart pumping process. In this chapter, we discuss acute coronary ischemia caused by acute coronary occlusion and myocardial infarction. In Chapter 22, we discuss congestive heart failure, which is frequently caused by slowly increasing coronary ischemia and weakening of the cardiac muscle.

Atherosclerosis Is a Major Cause of Ischemic Heart Disease. A frequent cause of diminished coronary blood flow is atherosclerosis. The atherosclerotic process is discussed in connection with lipid metabolism in Chapter 69. Briefly, in people who have a genetic predisposition to atherosclerosis, who are overweight or obese and have a sedentary lifestyle, or who have high blood pressure and damage to the endothelial cells of the coronary blood vessels, large quantities of cholesterol gradually become deposited beneath the endothelium at many points in arteries throughout the body. Gradually, these areas of deposit are invaded by fibrous tissue and frequently become calcified. The net result is the development of atherosclerotic plaques, which actually protrude into the vessel lumens

and block or partially block blood flow. A common site for development of atherosclerotic plaques is the first few centimeters of the major coronary arteries.

## Acute Coronary Artery Occlusion

Acute occlusion of a coronary artery usually occurs in a person who already has underlying atherosclerotic coronary heart disease but almost never occurs in a person with a normal coronary circulation. Acute occlusion can have various causes, two of which are the following:

1. The atherosclerotic plaque can cause a local blood clot called a thrombus that occludes the artery. The thrombus usually occurs where the arteriosclerotic plaque has broken through the endothelium, thus coming into direct contact with the flowing blood. Because the plaque presents an unsmooth surface, blood platelets adhere to it, fibrin is deposited, and red blood cells become trapped to form a blood clot that grows until it occludes the vessel. Occasionally, the clot breaks away from its attachment on the atherosclerotic plaque and flows to a more peripheral branch of the coronary arterial tree, where it blocks the artery at that point. A thrombus that flows along the artery in this way and occludes the vessel more distally is called a coronary embolus.
2. Many clinicians believe that local muscular spasm of a coronary artery also can occur. The spasm might result from direct irritation of the smooth muscle of the arterial wall by the edges of an arteriosclerotic plaque, or it might result from local nervous reflexes that cause excess coronary vascular wall contraction. The spasm may then lead to secondary thrombosis of the vessel.

Lifesaving Value of Collateral Circulation in the Heart. The degree of damage to the heart muscle caused by slowly developing atherosclerotic constriction of the coronary arteries or by sudden coronary occlusion is determined to a great extent by the degree of collateral circulation that has already developed or that can open within minutes after the occlusion. In a normal heart, almost no large communications exist among the larger coronary arteries. However, many anastomoses do exist among the smaller arteries of 20 to 250 micrometers in diameter, as shown in Figure 21-6.

When a sudden occlusion occurs in one of the larger coronary arteries, the small anastomoses begin to dilate within seconds. However, the blood flow through these minute collaterals is usually less than half of that needed to keep most of the cardiac muscle alive that they now supply. The diameters of the collateral vessels do not enlarge much more for the next 8 to 24 hours. Then, however, collateral flow begins to increase, doubling by the second or third day and often reaching normal or almost normal coronary flow within about 1 month. Because of these developing collateral channels, many patients recover almost completely from various degrees
![gu97687650e1](gu97687650e1.jpg)

Figure 21-6. Minute anastomoses in the normal coronary arterial system.
of coronary occlusion when the area of muscle involved is not too large.

When atherosclerosis constricts the coronary arteries slowly over a period of many years, rather than suddenly, collateral vessels can develop at the same time, while the atherosclerosis becomes more and more severe. Therefore, the person may never experience an acute episode of cardiac dysfunction. Eventually, however, the sclerotic process develops beyond the limits of even the collateral blood supply to provide the needed blood flow, and sometimes, the collateral blood vessels themselves develop atherosclerosis. When this occurs, the heart muscle becomes severely limited in its work output, and the heart cannot pump even normally required amounts of blood flow. This is one of the most common causes of cardiac failure in older people.

## Myocardial Infarction

Immediately after an acute coronary occlusion, blood flow ceases in the coronary vessels beyond the occlusion, except for small amounts of collateral flow from surrounding vessels. The area of muscle that has zero flow or so little flow that it cannot sustain cardiac muscle function is said to be infarcted. The overall process is called a myocardial infarction.

Soon after the onset of the infarction, small amounts of collateral blood begin to infiltrate the infarcted area, which, combined with progressive dilation of local blood vessels, causes the area to become overfilled with stagnant blood. Simultaneously the muscle fibers use the last bits of the oxygen in the blood, causing the hemoglobin to become totally deoxygenated. Therefore, the infarcted area takes on a bluish-brown hue, and the blood vessels of the area appear to be engorged, despite lack of blood flow. In later stages, the vessel walls become highly permeable

and leak fluid, the local muscle tissue becomes edematous, and the cardiac muscle cells begin to swell because of diminished cellular metabolism. Within a few hours of almost no blood supply, the cardiac muscle cells die.

Cardiac muscle requires about 1.3 ml of oxygen $/ 100 \mathrm{~g}$ of muscle tissue/min just to remain alive. In comparison, about 8 ml oxygen $/ 100 \mathrm{~g}$ are delivered to the normal resting left ventricle each minute. Therefore, if there is even $15 \%$ to $30 \%$ of normal resting coronary blood flow, the muscle will not die. In the central portion of a large infarct, however, where there is almost no collateral blood flow, the muscle does die.

Subendocardial Infarction. The subendocardial muscle frequently becomes infarcted, even when there is no evidence of infarction in the outer surface portions of the heart. This occurs because the subendocardial muscle has a higher oxygen consumption and extra difficulty obtaining adequate blood flow because the blood vessels in the subendocardium are intensely compressed by systolic contraction of the heart, as explained earlier. Therefore, any condition that compromises blood flow to any area of the heart usually causes damage first in the subendocardial regions, and the damage then spreads outward toward the epicardium.

## CAUSES OF DEATH AFTER ACUTE CORONARY OCCLUSION

The most common causes of death after acute myocardial infarction are the following: (1) decreased cardiac output; (2) damming of blood in the pulmonary blood vessels and then death resulting from pulmonary edema; (3) fibrillation of the heart; and, occasionally (4) rupture of the heart.

Decreased Cardiac Output—Systolic Stretch and Cardiac Shock. When some of the cardiac muscle fibers are not functioning and others are too weak to contract with great force, the overall pumping ability of the affected ventricle is proportionately depressed. The overall pumping strength of the infarcted heart is often decreased more than one might expect because of a phenomenon called systolic stretch, shown in Figure 21-7. That is, when the normal portions of the ventricular muscle contract, the ischemic portion of the muscle, whether it is dead or simply nonfunctional, instead of contracting is forced outward by the pressure that develops inside the ventricle. Therefore, much of the pumping force of the ventricle is dissipated by bulging of the area of nonfunctional cardiac muscle.

When the heart becomes incapable of contracting with sufficient force to pump enough blood into the peripheral arterial tree, cardiac failure and death of peripheral tissues ensue as a result of peripheral ischemia. This condition, called coronary shock, cardiogenic shock, cardiac shock, or low cardiac output failure, is discussed more fully in the next chapter. Cardiac shock almost always occurs when
![gu98687650e1](gu98687650e1.jpg)

Figure 21-7. Systolic stretch in an area of ischemic cardiac muscle.
more than $40 \%$ of the left ventricle is infarcted, and death occurs in more than $70 \%$ of patients once cardiac shock develops.

Damming of Blood in the Body's Venous System. When the heart is not pumping blood forward, it must be damming blood in the atria and in the blood vessels of the lungs or in the systemic circulation. This leads to increased capillary pressures, particularly in the lungs.

Damming of blood in the veins often causes little difficulty during the first few hours after a myocardial infarction. Instead, symptoms develop a few days later because the acutely diminished cardiac output leads to diminished blood flow to the kidneys. Then, for reasons discussed in Chapter 22, the kidneys fail to excrete enough urine. This adds progressively to the total blood volume and, therefore, leads to congestive symptoms. Consequently, many patients who seemingly are getting along well during the first few days after the onset of heart failure will suddenly experience acute pulmonary edema and often will die within a few hours after the appearance of the initial pulmonary symptoms.

Fibrillation of the Ventricles After Myocardial Infarction. In many people who die of coronary occlusion, death occurs because of sudden ventricular fibrillation. The tendency for fibrillation to develop is especially great after a large infarction, but fibrillation can sometimes occur after small occlusions as well. Some patients with chronic coronary insufficiency die suddenly of fibrillation without having any acute infarction.

Fibrillation is most likely to occur during two especially dangerous periods after coronary infarction. The first period is during the first 10 minutes after the infarction occurs. Then, there is a short period of relative safety, followed by a second period of cardiac irritability beginning 1 hour or so later and lasting for another few hours. Fibrillation can also occur many days after the infarct but is less likely to occur then.

At least four factors are involved in the tendency for the heart to fibrillate, as follows:

1. Acute loss of blood supply to the cardiac muscle causes rapid depletion of potassium from the ischemic musculature. This also increases the potassium concentration in the extracellular fluids surrounding the cardiac muscle fibers. Experiments in which potassium has been injected into the coronary system have demonstrated that an elevated extracellular potassium concentration increases the irritability of the cardiac musculature and, therefore, its likelihood of fibrillating.
2. Ischemia of the muscle causes an injury current, described in Chapter 12 in relation to electrocardiograms in patients with acute myocardial infarction. That is, the ischemic musculature often cannot completely repolarize its membranes after a heartbeat, and thus the external surface of this muscle remains negative with respect to normal cardiac muscle membrane potential elsewhere in the heart. Therefore, electric current flows from this ischemic area of the heart to the normal area and can elicit abnormal impulses, which can cause fibrillation.
3. Powerful sympathetic reflexes often develop after massive infarction, principally because the heart does not pump an adequate volume of blood into the arterial tree, which leads to reduced blood pressure. The sympathetic stimulation also increases irritability of the cardiac muscle and thereby predisposes to fibrillation.
4. Cardiac muscle weakness caused by the myocardial infarction often causes the ventricle to dilate excessively. This excessive dilation increases the pathway length for impulse conduction in the heart and frequently causes abnormal conduction pathways all the way around the infarcted area of the cardiac muscle. Both of these effects predispose to the development of circus movements because, as discussed in Chapter 13, excess prolongation of conduction pathways in the ventricles allows impulses to re-enter muscle that is already recovering from refractoriness, thereby initiating a circus movement cycle of new excitation and resulting in continuation of the process.

Rupture of Infarcted Area. During the first day or so after an acute infarct, there is little danger of rupture of the ischemic portion of the heart, but a few days later, the dead muscle fibers begin to degenerate, and the heart
![gu99687650e1](gu99687650e1.jpg)

Figure 21-8. Top, Small and large areas of coronary ischemia. Bottom, Stages of recovery from myocardial infarction.
wall becomes stretched very thin. When this happens, the dead muscle bulges outward to a severe degree with each heart contraction, and this systolic stretch becomes greater and greater until finally the heart ruptures. One of the methods used to assess the progress of severe myocardial infarction is to record by cardiac imaging, with echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT), whether the degree of systolic stretch is worsening.

When a ventricle does rupture, loss of blood into the pericardial space causes rapid development of cardiac tamponade-that is, compression of the heart from the outside by blood collecting in the pericardial cavity. Because of this compression of the heart, blood cannot flow into the right atrium, and the patient dies of suddenly decreased cardiac output.

## STAGES OF RECOVERY FROM ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

The upper left part of Figure 21-8 shows the effects of acute coronary occlusion in a patient with a small area of muscle ischemia; to the right is shown a heart with a large area of ischemia. When the area of ischemia is small, little or no death of the muscle cells may occur, but part of the muscle often does become temporarily nonfunctional because of inadequate nutrition to support muscle contraction.

When the area of ischemia is large, some of the muscle fibers in the center of the area die rapidly, within 1 to 3 hours, where there is total cessation of coronary blood supply. Immediately around the dead area is a nonfunctional area, with failure of contraction and usually failure of impulse conduction. Then, extending circumferentially around the nonfunctional area, is an area that is still contracting but only weakly because of mild ischemia.

Replacement of Dead Muscle by Scar Tissue. In the lower part of Figure 21-8, the various stages of recovery after a large myocardial infarction are shown. Shortly af-

ter the occlusion, the muscle fibers in the center of the ischemic area die. Then, during the ensuing days, this area of dead fibers enlarges because many of the marginal fibers finally succumb to the prolonged ischemia. At the same time, because of the enlargement of collateral arterial channels supplying the outer rim of the infarcted area, much of the nonfunctional muscle recovers. After a few days to 3 weeks, most of the nonfunctional muscle becomes functional again or dies. In the meantime, fibrous tissue begins developing among the dead fibers because ischemia can stimulate growth of fibroblasts and promote development of greater than normal quantities of fibrous tissue. Therefore, the dead muscle tissue is gradually replaced by fibrous tissue. Then, because it is a general property of fibrous tissue to undergo progressive contraction and dissolution, the fibrous scar may grow smaller over a period of several months to a year.

Finally, the normal areas of the heart gradually hypertrophy to compensate, at least partially, for the lost dead cardiac musculature. By these means, the heart recovers partially or almost completely within a few months, depending on the severity of the infarction and cardiac tissue death.

Value of Rest in Treating Myocardial Infarction. The degree of cardiac cellular death is determined by the degree of ischemia and workload on the heart muscle. When the workload is greatly increased, such as during exercise, in severe emotional strain, or as a result of fatigue, the heart needs increased oxygen and other nutrients for sustaining its life. Furthermore, anastomotic blood vessels that supply blood to ischemic areas of the heart must also still supply the areas of the heart that they normally supply. When the heart becomes excessively active, the vessels of the normal musculature become greatly dilated. This dilation allows most of the blood flowing into the coronary vessels to flow through the normal muscle tissue, thus leaving little blood to flow through the small anastomotic channels into the ischemic area. As a result, the ischemic condition worsens, a condition called the coronary steal syndrome. Consequently, an important factor in the treatment of a patient with myocardial infarction is observance of absolute body rest during the recovery process.

## HEART FUNCTION AFTER RECOVERY FROM MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

Occasionally, a heart that has recovered from a large myocardial infarction returns almost to full functional capability, but more frequently, its pumping capability is permanently decreased below that of a healthy heart. This does not mean that the person is necessarily a cardiac invalid or that the resting cardiac output is depressed below normal because the normal heart is capable of pumping $300 \%$ to $400 \%$ more blood per minute than the body requires during rest-that is, a normal person has a
cardiac reserve of $300 \%$ to $400 \%$. Even when the cardiac reserve is reduced to as little as $100 \%$, the person can still perform most normal daily activities but not strenuous exercise, which would overload the heart.

## PAIN IN CORONARY HEART DISEASE

Normally, a person cannot "feel" the heart, but ischemic cardiac muscle often does cause a pain sensation that is sometimes severe. Exactly what causes this pain is not known, but it is believed that ischemia causes the muscle to release acidic substances such as lactic acid or other pain-promoting products, such as histamine, kinins, or cellular proteolytic enzymes, which are not removed rapidly enough by the slowly moving coronary blood flow. The high concentrations of these abnormal products then stimulate pain nerve endings in the cardiac muscle, sending pain impulses through sensory afferent nerve fibers into the central nervous system.

Angina Pectoris (Cardiac Pain). In most people who sustain progressive constriction of their coronary arteries, cardiac pain, called angina pectoris, begins to appear whenever the load on the heart becomes too great in relation to the available coronary blood flow. This pain is usually felt beneath the upper sternum over the heart. In addition, the pain is often referred to distant surface areas of the body, usually to the left arm and left shoulder but also frequently to the neck and even to the side of the face. The reason for this distribution of pain is that during embryonic life, the heart originates in the neck, as do the arms. Therefore, both the heart and these surface areas of the body receive pain nerve fibers from the same spinal cord segments.

Most people who have chronic angina pectoris feel pain when they exercise or when they experience emotions that increase metabolism of the heart or temporarily constrict the coronary vessels because of sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve signals. Anginal pain is also exacerbated by cold temperatures or by having a full stomach, both of which increase the workload of the heart. The pain usually lasts for only a few minutes. However, some patients have such severe and lasting ischemia that the pain is present all the time. The pain is frequently described as hot, pressing, and constricting and is of such quality that it usually makes the patient stop all unnecessary body activity.

Drug Treatment. Several vasodilator drugs, when administered during an acute anginal attack, can often provide immediate relief from the pain. Commonly used short-acting vasodilators are nitroglycerin and other nitrate drugs. Other drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ranolazine, may be beneficial in treating chronic stable angina pectoris.

Another class of drugs used for the prolonged treatment of angina pectoris is the beta blockers, such as propranolol. These drugs block sympathetic beta-adrenergic receptors, which prevents sympathetic enhancement of heart rate and cardiac metabolism during exercise or emotional episodes. Therefore, therapy with a beta blocker decreases the need of the heart for extra metabolic oxygen during stressful conditions. For obvious reasons, this therapy can also reduce the number of anginal attacks, as well as their severity.

## SURGICAL TREATMENT OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE

Aortic-Coronary Bypass Surgery. In many patients with coronary ischemia, the constricted areas of the coronary arteries are located at only a few discrete points blocked by atherosclerotic disease, and the coronary vessels elsewhere are normal or almost normal. In the 1960s, a surgical procedure called aortic-coronary bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was developed, in which a section of a subcutaneous vein is removed from an arm or leg and then grafted from the root of the aorta to the side of a peripheral coronary artery beyond the atherosclerotic blockage point. One to five such grafts are usually performed, each of which supplies a peripheral coronary artery beyond a block.

Anginal pain is relieved in most patients after coronary bypass surgery. Also, in patients whose hearts have not become too severely damaged before the operation, the coronary bypass procedure may provide the patient with normal life expectancy. If the heart has already been severely damaged, however, the bypass procedure may be of little value.

Coronary Angioplasty. Since the 1980s, a procedure has been used to open partially blocked coronary vessels before they become totally occluded. This procedure, called coronary artery angioplasty, is performed as follows. A small balloon-tipped catheter, about 1 millimeter in diameter, is passed under radiographic guidance into the coronary system and pushed through the partially occluded artery until the balloon portion of the catheter straddles the partially occluded point. The balloon is then inflated with high pressure, which stretches the diseased artery markedly. After this procedure is performed, the blood flow through the vessel often increases 3 -fold to 4 -fold, and more than $75 \%$ of patients who undergo the procedure are relieved of the coronary ischemic symptoms for at least several years, although many of the patients still eventually require coronary bypass surgery.

Small stainless steel mesh tubes called stents are sometimes placed inside a coronary artery dilated by angioplasty to hold the artery open, thus preventing its restenosis. Within a few weeks after the stent is placed in the coronary artery, the endothelium usually grows over the metal surface of the stent, allowing blood to flow smoothly through the stent. However, reclosure
(restenosis) of the blocked coronary artery occurs in about $25 \%$ to $40 \%$ of patients treated with angioplasty, often within 6 months of the initial procedure. Restenosis is usually due to the excessive formation of scar tissue that develops underneath the healthy new endothelium that has grown over the stent. Stents that slowly release drugs (drug-eluting stents) may help prevent the excessive growth of scar tissue.

Newer procedures for opening atherosclerotic coronary arteries are constantly in experimental development. One of these procedures uses a laser beam from the tip of a coronary artery catheter aimed at the atherosclerotic lesion. The laser literally dissolves the lesion without substantially damaging the remainder of the arterial wall.

# Cardiac Failure 

One of the most important ailments treated by the physician is cardiac failure (heart failure). This ailment can result from any heart condition that reduces the ability of the heart to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The cause is often decreased contractility of the myocardium resulting from diminished coronary blood flow. However, cardiac failure can also be caused by damaged heart valves, external pressure around the heart, vitamin B deficiency, primary cardiac muscle disease, or any other abnormality that makes the heart a hypoeffective pump.

In this chapter, we mainly discuss cardiac failure caused by ischemic heart disease resulting from partial blockage of the coronary blood vessels, which is the most common cause of heart failure. In Chapter 23, we discuss valvular and congenital heart disease.

## CIRCULATORY DYNAMICS IN CARDIAC FAILURE

## ACUTE EFFECTS OF MODERATE CARDIAC FAILURE

If a heart suddenly becomes severely damaged, such as by myocardial infarction, the pumping ability of the heart is immediately depressed. As a result, two main effects occur: (1) reduced cardiac output; and (2) damming of blood in the veins, resulting in increased venous pressure.

The progressive changes in heart pumping effectiveness at different times after an acute myocardial infarction are shown graphically in Figure 22-1. The top curve of this figure shows a normal cardiac output curve. Point A on this curve is the normal operating point, showing a normal cardiac output under resting conditions of $5 \mathrm{~L} /$ min and a right atrial pressure of 0 mm Hg .

Immediately after the heart becomes damaged, the cardiac output curve becomes greatly depressed, falling to the lowest curve at the bottom of the graph. Within a few seconds, a new circulatory state is established at point B , illustrating that the cardiac output has fallen to $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, about two-fifths normal, whereas the right atrial pressure has risen to +4 mm Hg because venous blood returning to
the heart from the body is dammed up in the right atrium. This low cardiac output is still sufficient to sustain life for perhaps a few hours, but it is likely to be associated with fainting. Fortunately, this acute stage usually lasts for only a few seconds because sympathetic nervous reflexes occur almost immediately and compensate, to a great extent, for the damaged heart, as follows.

Compensation for Acute Cardiac Failure by Sympathetic Nervous Reflexes. When the cardiac output falls precariously low, many of the circulatory reflexes discussed in Chapter 18 are rapidly activated. The best known of these is the baroreceptor reflex, which is activated by diminished arterial pressure. The chemoreceptor reflex, the central nervous system ischemic response, and even reflexes that originate in the damaged heart also likely contribute to activation of the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetics therefore become strongly stimulated within a few seconds, and the parasympathetic nervous signals to the heart become inhibited at the same time.

Strong sympathetic stimulation has major effects on the heart and peripheral vasculature. If all the ventricular musculature is diffusely damaged but is still functional, sympathetic stimulation strengthens this damaged musculature. If part of the muscle is nonfunctional, and part of it is still normal, the normal muscle is strongly stimulated by sympathetic stimulation, in this way partially compensating for the nonfunctional muscle. Thus, the heart becomes a stronger pump as a result of sympathetic stimulation. This effect is illustrated in Figure 22-1, which shows about a twofold elevation of the very low cardiac output curve after sympathetic compensation.

Sympathetic stimulation also increases venous return because it increases the tone of most of the blood vessels of the circulation, especially the veins, raising the mean systemic filling pressure to 12 to 14 mm Hg , almost $100 \%$ above normal. As discussed in Chapter 20, this increased filling pressure greatly increases the tendency for blood to flow from the veins back into the heart. Therefore, the damaged heart becomes primed with more inflowing blood than usual, and the right atrial pressure rises still further, which helps the heart pump still larger quantities

of blood. Thus, in Figure 22-1, the new circulatory state is depicted by point C, showing a cardiac output of $4.2 \mathrm{~L} /$ min and a right atrial pressure of 5 mm Hg .

The sympathetic reflexes become maximally developed in about 30 seconds. Therefore, a person who has a sudden, moderate heart attack might experience nothing more than cardiac pain and a few seconds of fainting. Shortly thereafter, with the aid of the sympathetic reflex compensations, the cardiac output may return to a level adequate to sustain the person if he or she remains quiet, although the pain might persist.

## CHRONIC STAGE OF FAILURE—FLUID RETENTION AND COMPENSATED CARDIAC OUTPUT

After the first few minutes of an acute heart attack, a prolonged semichronic state begins, characterized mainly by two events: (1) retention of fluid by the kidneys; and (2) varying degrees of recovery of the heart over a period of weeks to months, as illustrated by the light green curve in Figure 22-1. This topic was also discussed in Chapter 21.

## Renal Retention of Fluid and Increase in Blood Volume Occur for Hours to Days

A low cardiac output has a profound effect on renal function, sometimes causing anuria when the cardiac output falls to $50 \%$ to $60 \%$ of normal. In general, the urine output remains below normal as long as the cardiac output and arterial pressure remain significantly less than normal; urine output usually does not return all the way to normal after an acute heart attack until the cardiac output and arterial pressure rise almost to normal levels.

Moderate Fluid Retention in Cardiac Failure Can Be Beneficial. Many cardiologists have considered fluid retention always to have a detrimental effect in cardiac failure. However, a moderate increase in body fluid and blood volume is an important factor in helping to compensate for the diminished pumping ability of the heart by increasing the venous return. The increased blood volume increases venous return in two ways. First, it increases the mean systemic filling pressure, which increases the pressure gradient for causing venous flow of blood toward the heart. Second, it distends the veins, which reduces the venous resistance and allows even more ease of flow of blood to the heart.

If the heart is not damaged too much, this increased venous return can almost fully compensate for the heart's diminished pumping ability-enough so that even when the heart's pumping ability is reduced to as low as $40 \%$ to $50 \%$ of normal, the increased venous return can often cause nearly normal cardiac output as long as the person remains in a quiet resting state.

When the heart's pumping capability is reduced further, blood flow to the kidneys finally becomes too low for the kidneys to excrete enough salt and water to equal salt and water intake. Therefore, fluid retention begins and continues indefinitely unless major therapeutic procedures are used to prevent this outcome. Furthermore, because the heart is already pumping at its maximum capacity, this excess fluid no longer has a beneficial effect on the circulation. Instead, the fluid retention increases the workload on the already damaged heart, and severe edema develops throughout the body, which can be very detrimental and can lead to death.

Detrimental Effects of Excess Fluid Retention in Severe Cardiac Failure. In contrast to the beneficial effects of moderate fluid retention in cardiac failure, in severe cardiac failure, extreme excesses of fluid can have serious physiologic consequences. These include the following: (1) increasing the workload on the damaged heart; (2) overstretching of the heart, which further weakens the heart; (3) filtration of fluid into the lungs, causing pulmonary edema and consequent deoxygenation of the blood; and (4) development of extensive edema in most parts of the body. These detrimental effects of excessive fluid are discussed in later sections of this chapter.

## Recovery of the Heart After Myocardial Infarction

After a heart becomes suddenly damaged as a result of myocardial infarction, the natural reparative processes of the body begin to help restore normal cardiac function. For example, a new collateral blood supply begins to penetrate the peripheral portions of the infarcted area of the heart, often causing some of the heart muscle in the fringe areas to become functional again. Also, the undamaged portion of the heart musculature hypertrophies, offsetting some of the cardiac damage.

The degree of recovery, which depends on the type and severity of cardiac damage, varies from no recovery to almost complete recovery. After an acute myocardial infarction, the heart ordinarily recovers rapidly during the first few days and weeks and achieves most of its final state of recovery within 5 to 7 weeks, although mild degrees of additional recovery can continue for months.

## Cardiac Output Curve After Partial Recovery. Figure

22-1 shows function of the partially recovered heart a week or so after an acute myocardial infarction. By this time, considerable fluid has been retained in the body, and the tendency for venous return has increased markedly as well; therefore, the right atrial pressure has risen even more. As a result, the state of the circulation is now changed from point C to point D , which shows a normal cardiac output of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ but right atrial pressure increased to 6 mm Hg .

Because the cardiac output has returned to normal, renal output of fluid also returns to normal, and no further fluid retention occurs, except that the retention of fluid that has already occurred continues to maintain moderate excesses of fluid. Therefore, except for the high right atrial pressure represented by point D in this figure, the person now has essentially normal cardiovascular dynamics as long as he or she remains at rest.

If the heart recovers to a significant extent, and if adequate fluid volume has been retained, the cardiac output increases toward normal and sympathetic stimulation gradually abates toward normal. As the heart recovers, the fast pulse rate, cold skin, and pallor resulting from sympathetic stimulation in the acute stage of cardiac failure gradually disappear.

## SUMMARY OF CHANGES AFTER ACUTE CARDIAC FAILURE-COMPENSATED HEART FAILURE

To summarize the events discussed in the past few sections describing the dynamics of circulatory changes after an acute, moderate heart attack, we can divide the stages into the following: (1) the instantaneous effect of the cardiac damage; (2) compensation by the sympathetic nervous system, which occurs mainly within the first 30 to 60 seconds; and (3) chronic compensations resulting from partial heart recovery and renal retention of fluid. All these changes are shown graphically by the black line in Figure 22-1. The progression of this line shows the normal state of the circulation (point A), the state a few seconds after the heart attack but before sympathetic reflexes have occurred (point B), the rise in cardiac output toward normal caused by sympathetic stimulation (point C), and final return of the cardiac output to almost normal after several days to several weeks of partial cardiac recovery and fluid retention (point D). This final state is called compensated heart failure.
![gu101687650e1](gu101687650e1.jpg)

Figure 22-2 Greatly depressed cardiac output that indicates decompensated heart disease. Progressive fluid retention raises the right atrial pressure over a period of days, and the cardiac output progresses from point $A$ to point $F$ until death occurs.

Compensated Heart Failure. Note especially in Figure 22-1 that the maximum pumping ability of the partly recovered heart, as depicted by the plateau level of the light green curve, is still depressed to less than half-normal. This demonstrates that an increase in right atrial pressure can maintain the cardiac output at a normal level, despite continued weakness of the heart. Thus, many people, especially older adults, have normal resting cardiac outputs but mildly to moderately elevated right atrial pressures because of various degrees of compensated heart failure. They may not know that they have cardiac damage because the damage often has occurred a little at a time, and the compensation has occurred concurrently with the progressive stages of damage.

When a person is in a state of compensated heart failure, any attempt to perform heavy exercise usually causes immediate return of the symptoms of acute heart failure because the heart is not able to increase its pumping capacity to the levels required for the exercise. Therefore, it is said that the cardiac reserve is reduced in compensated heart failure. This concept of cardiac reserve is discussed later in the chapter.

## DYNAMICS OF SEVERE CARDIAC FAILURE-DECOMPENSATED HEART FAILURE

If the heart becomes severely damaged, no amount of compensation by sympathetic nervous reflexes or fluid retention can make the excessively weakened heart pump a normal cardiac output. As a consequence, the cardiac output cannot rise high enough to make the kidneys excrete normal quantities of fluid. Therefore, fluid continues to be retained, the person develops more and more edema, and this state of events eventually leads to death. This condition is called decompensated heart failure. Thus, a major cause of decompensated heart failure is failure of the heart to pump sufficient blood to make the kidneys excrete the necessary amounts of fluid every day.

Graphic Analysis of Decompensated Heart Failure. Figure 22-2 shows greatly depressed cardiac output at

different times (points A to F ) after the heart has become severely weakened. Point A on this curve represents the approximate state of the circulation before any compensation has occurred, and point B represents the state a few minutes later, after sympathetic stimulation has compensated as much as it can but before fluid retention has begun. At this time, the cardiac output has risen to $4 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and the right atrial pressure has risen to 5 mm Hg . The person appears to be in reasonably good condition, but this state will not remain stable because the cardiac output has not risen high enough to cause adequate kidney excretion of fluid; therefore, fluid retention continues and can eventually be the cause of death. These events can be explained quantitatively in the following way.

Note the straight line in Figure 22-2, at a cardiac output level of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. This level is approximately the critical cardiac output level that is required in the average adult person to make the kidneys reestablish normal fluid balance-that is, for the output of salt and water to be as high as the intake of these substances. At cardiac outputs below this level, the fluid-retaining mechanisms discussed in the earlier section remain in play, and the body fluid volume increases progressively. Because of this progressive increase in fluid volume, the mean systemic filling pressure of the circulation continues to rise, which forces progressively increasing quantities of blood from the person's peripheral veins into the right atrium, thus increasing the right atrial pressure. After 1 day or so, the state of the circulation changes in Figure 22-2 from point B to point C , with the right atrial pressure rising to 7 mm Hg and the cardiac output rising to $4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. Note again that the cardiac output is still not high enough to cause normal renal output of fluid; therefore, fluid continues to be retained. After another day or so, the right atrial pressure rises to 9 mm Hg , and the circulatory state becomes that depicted by point D. Still, the cardiac output is not enough to establish normal fluid balance.

After another few days of fluid retention, the right atrial pressure has risen further but, by now, cardiac function is beginning to decline toward a lower level. This decline is caused by overstretch of the heart, edema of the heart muscle, and other factors that diminish the heart's pumping performance. It is now clear that further retention of fluid will be more detrimental than beneficial to the circulation. Yet, the cardiac output still is not high enough to bring about normal renal function, so fluid retention not only continues but accelerates because of the falling cardiac output (and the falling arterial pressure that also occurs). Consequently, within a few days, the state of the circulation has reached point $F$ on the curve, with the cardiac output now less than $2.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and the right atrial pressure 16 mm Hg . This state has approached or reached incompatibility with life, and the patient will die unless this chain of events can be reversed. This state of heart failure in which the failure continues to worsen is called decompensated heart failure.

Thus, one can see from this analysis that failure of the cardiac output (and arterial pressure) to rise to the critical level required for normal renal function results in the following: (1) progressive retention of more and more fluid; (2) progressive elevation of the mean systemic filling pressure; and (3) progressive elevation of the right atrial pressure until, finally, the heart is so overstretched or so edematous that it cannot pump even moderate quantities of blood and, therefore, fails completely. Clinically, one detects this serious condition of decompensation principally by the progressing edema, especially edema of the lungs, which leads to bubbling rales (a crackling sound) in the lungs and to dyspnea (air hunger). Lack of appropriate therapy at this stage rapidly leads to death.

Treatment of Decompensation. The decompensation process can often be stopped by the following: (1) strengthening the heart in any one of several ways, especially by administering a cardiotonic drug, such as digitalis, so that the heart becomes strong enough to pump adequate quantities of blood required to make the kidneys function normally again; or (2) administering diuretic drugs to increase kidney excretion while at the same time reducing water and salt intake, which results in a balance between fluid intake and output, despite low cardiac output.

Both methods stop the decompensation process by reestablishing normal fluid balance so that at least as much fluid leaves the body as enters it.

Mechanism of Action of Cardiotonic Drugs. Cardiotonic drugs, such as digitalis, when administered to a person with a healthy heart, have little effect on increasing the contractile strength of the cardiac muscle. However, when administered to someone with a chronically failing heart, the same drugs can sometimes increase the strength of the failing myocardium by as much as $50 \%$ to $100 \%$. Therefore, they are one of the mainstays of therapy in persons with chronic heart failure.

Digitalis and other cardiotonic glycosides are believed to strengthen heart contractions by increasing the quantity of calcium ions in muscle fibers. This effect is likely due to inhibition of sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase in cardiac cell membranes. Inhibition of the sodium-potassium pump increases the intracellular sodium concentration and slows the sodium-calcium exchange pump, which extrudes calcium from the cell in exchange for sodium. Because the sodium-calcium exchange pump relies on a high sodium gradient across the cell membrane, accumulation of sodium inside the cell reduces its activity.

In the failing heart muscle, the sarcoplasmic reticulum fails to accumulate normal quantities of calcium and, therefore, cannot release enough calcium ions into the free fluid compartment of the muscle fibers to cause full contraction of the muscle. The effect of digitalis to depress the sodium-calcium exchange pump and raise calcium

ion concentration in cardiac muscle provides the extra calcium needed to increase the muscle contractile force. Therefore, it is usually beneficial to depress the calcium pumping mechanism by a moderate amount using digitalis, allowing the muscle fiber intracellular calcium level to rise slightly.

## UNILATERAL LEFT HEART FAILURE

Thus far we have considered failure of the heart as a whole. Yet, in a large number of patients, especially those with early acute heart failure, left-sided failure predominates over right-sided failure and, in rare cases, the right side fails without significant failure of the left side.

When the left side of the heart fails without concomitant failure of the right side, blood continues to be pumped into the lungs with usual right heart vigor, whereas it is not pumped adequately out of the lungs by the left heart into the systemic circulation. As a result, the mean pulmonary filling pressure rises because of the shift of large volumes of blood from the systemic circulation into the pulmonary circulation.

As the volume of blood in the lungs increases, the pulmonary capillary pressure increases and, if this pressure rises above a value approximately equal to the colloid osmotic pressure of the plasma-about 28 mm Hg -fluid begins to filter out of the capillaries into the lung interstitial spaces and alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema.

Thus, the most important problems of left heart failure include pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema. In severe, acute, left heart failure, pulmonary edema occasionally occurs so rapidly that it can cause death by suffocation in 20 to 30 minutes, discussed later in this chapter.

## LOW-OUTPUT CARDIAC FAILURECARDIOGENIC SHOCK

In many cases after acute heart attacks, and often after prolonged periods of slow progressive cardiac deterioration, the heart becomes incapable of pumping even the minimal amount of blood flow required to keep the body alive. Consequently, the body tissues begin to suffer and even to deteriorate, often leading to death within a few hours to a few days. The picture, then, is one of circulatory shock, as explained in Chapter 24. Even the cardiovascular system suffers from lack of nutrition and deteriorates, along with the remainder of the body, thus hastening death. This circulatory shock syndrome caused by inadequate cardiac pumping is called cardiogenic shock or simply cardiac shock. Once cardiogenic shock develops, the survival rate is often less than $30 \%$, even with appropriate medical care.

Vicious Cycle of Cardiac Deterioration in Cardiogenic Shock. The discussion of circulatory shock in Chapter 24 emphasizes the tendency for the heart to become progres-
sively more damaged when its coronary blood supply is reduced during the course of the shock. That is, the low arterial pressure that occurs during shock reduces the coronary blood supply even more. This reduction further weakens the heart, which makes the arterial pressure fall further, which makes the shock progressively worse; the process eventually becomes a vicious cycle of cardiac deterioration. In cardiogenic shock caused by myocardial infarction, this problem is greatly compounded by already existing coronary vessel blockage. For example, in a healthy heart, the arterial pressure usually must be reduced below about 45 mm Hg before cardiac deterioration sets in. However, in a heart that already has a blocked major coronary vessel, deterioration begins when the coronary arterial pressure falls below 80 to 90 mm Hg . In other words, even a small decrease in arterial pressure can now set off a vicious cycle of cardiac deterioration. For this reason, in treating myocardial infarction, it is extremely important to prevent even short periods of hypotension.

Physiology of Cardiogenic Shock Treatment. Often, a patient dies of cardiogenic shock before the various compensatory processes can return the cardiac output (and arterial pressure) to a life-sustaining level. Therefore, treatment of this condition is one of the most important challenges in the management of acute heart attacks.

Digitalis is often administered immediately to strengthen the heart if the ventricular muscle shows signs of deterioration. Also, infusion of whole blood, plasma, or a blood pres-sure-raising drug is used to sustain the arterial pressure. If the arterial pressure can be elevated to a high enough level, the coronary blood flow often will increase enough to prevent the vicious cycle of deterioration. This process allows enough time for appropriate compensatory mechanisms in the circulatory system to correct the shock.

Some success has also been achieved in saving the lives of patients in cardiogenic shock by using one of the following procedures: (1) surgically removing the clot in the coronary artery, often in combination with a coronary bypass graft; or (2) catheterizing the blocked coronary artery and infusing streptokinase or tissue-type plasminogen activator enzymes that causes dissolution of the clot. The results are occasionally astounding when one of these procedures is instituted within the first hour of cardiogenic shock but are of little, if any, benefit after 3 hours.

## EDEMA IN PATIENTS WITH CARDIAC FAILURE

Acute Cardiac Failure Does Not Cause Immediate Peripheral Edema. Acute left heart failure can cause rapid congestion of the lungs, with the development of pulmonary edema and even death within minutes to hours. However, left or right heart failure is slow to cause peripheral edema. This situation can best be explained by referring to Figure 22-3. When a previously healthy

![gu102687650e1](gu102687650e1.jpg)

Figure 22-3 Progressive changes in mean aortic pressure, peripheral tissue capillary pressure, and right atrial pressure as the cardiac output falls from normal to zero.
heart acutely fails as a pump, the aortic pressure falls, and the right atrial pressure rises. As the cardiac output approaches zero, these two pressures approach each other at an equilibrium value of about 13 mm Hg . Capillary pressure also falls from its normal value of 17 mm Hg to the new equilibrium pressure of 13 mm Hg . Thus, severe acute cardiac failure often causes a fall rather than a rise in peripheral capillary pressure. Therefore, animal experiments, as well as experience in humans, have shown that acute cardiac failure almost never causes immediate development of peripheral edema.

## LONG-TERM FLUID RETENTION BY THE KIDNEYS CAUSES PERIPHERAL EDEMA IN PERSISTING HEART FAILURE

After the first day or so of overall heart failure or right ventricular heart failure, peripheral edema begins to occur, principally because of fluid retention by the kidneys. The retention of fluid increases the mean systemic filling pressure, resulting in an increased tendency for blood to return to the heart. This further elevates the right atrial pressure and returns the arterial pressure back toward normal. Therefore, the capillary pressure now also rises markedly, thus causing loss of fluid into the tissues and the development of severe edema.

Reduced renal output of urine during cardiac failure has several known causes.

1. Decreased glomerular filtration rate. A decrease in cardiac output has a tendency to reduce the glomerular pressure in the kidneys because of the following: (a) reduced arterial pressure; and (b) intense sympathetic constriction of the afferent arterioles of the kidney. As a consequence, except in the mildest degrees of heart failure, the glomerular filtration rate is reduced. It is clear from the discussion of kidney function in Chapters 27 through 30 that a decrease in glomerular filtration often markedly decreases
urine output. A fall in the cardiac output to about half-normal can result in almost complete anuria.
2. Activation of renin-angiotensin system and increased reabsorption of water and salt by renal tubules. The reduced blood flow to the kidneys causes a marked increase in renin secretion by the kidneys, which in turn increases the formation of angiotensin II, as described in Chapter 19. Angiotensin II, in turn, has a direct effect on the arterioles of the kidneys to decrease blood flow through the kidneys further, which reduces the pressure in the peritubular capillaries surrounding the renal tubules, promoting greatly increased reabsorption of water and salt from the tubules. Angiotensin II also acts directly on the renal tubular epithelial cells to stimulate reabsorption of salt and water. Therefore, loss of water and salt into the urine decreases greatly, and large quantities of salt and water accumulate in the blood and interstitial fluids throughout the body.
3. Increased aldosterone secretion. In the chronic stage of heart failure, large quantities of aldosterone are secreted by the adrenal cortex. This secretion results mainly from the effect of angiotensin II to stimulate aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. However, some of the increase in aldosterone secretion often results from increased plasma potassium concentration. Excess potassium is one of the most powerful stimuli known for aldosterone secretion, and the potassium concentration rises in response to reduced renal function in those with cardiac failure. The elevated aldosterone level further increases reabsorption of sodium from the renal tubules, which in turn leads to a secondary increase in water reabsorption, as discussed in Chapter 28.
4. Increased antidiuretic hormone secretion. In advanced heart failure, increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone $(\mathrm{ADH})$ may contribute to excessive water reabsorption by the renal tubules. As discussed in Chapters 28 and 29, ADH is secreted by the hy-pothalamic-posterior pituitary gland system in response to increased extracellular fluid osmolarity, as well as nonosmotic stimuli from low-pressure (e.g., left atrial) and high-pressure (e.g., carotid sinus) baroreceptors. In severe heart failure, the nonosmotic effects of reductions in cardiac output and arterial pressure may predominate to stimulate secretion of ADH , which in turn causes excess water retention and hyponatremia (low plasma sodium concentration). Inappropriately high levels of ADH and hyponatremia are predictors for worsening outcomes in patients with heart failure.
5. Activation of sympathetic nervous system. As discussed previously, heart failure causes marked activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn has several effects that lead to salt

and water retention by the kidneys: (a) constriction of renal afferent arterioles, which reduces the glomerular filtration rate; (b) stimulation of renal tubular reabsorption of salt and water by activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors on tubular epithelial cells; (c) stimulation of renin release and angiotensin II formation, which increases renal tubular reabsorption; and (d) stimulation of ADH release from the posterior pituitary, which then increases water reabsorption by the renal tubules. These effects of sympathetic stimulation are discussed in Chapters 27 and 28.

Role of Natriuretic Peptides in Delaying Onset of Cardiac Decompensation. Natriuretic peptides are hormones released by the heart when it becomes stretched. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is released by the atrial walls, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is released by the ventricular walls. Because heart failure almost always increases the atrial and ventricular pressures that stretch the walls of these chambers, circulating levels of ANP and BNP in the blood may increase severalfold in severe heart failure. These natriuretic peptides, in turn, have a direct effect on the kidneys to increase their excretion of salt and water greatly. Therefore, the natriuretic peptides play a natural role to help prevent extreme congestive symptoms during cardiac failure. Because the half-life of BNP is significantly longer than that of ANP and can be easily measured in the bloodstream, it is often used to diagnose heart failure or to monitor volume status in patients with established heart failure. The renal effects of ANP are discussed in Chapters 28 and 30.

## Acute Pulmonary Edema in Late-Stage Heart Failure—Another Lethal Vicious Cycle

A frequent cause of death is acute pulmonary edema in patients who have already had heart failure for a long time. When acute pulmonary edema occurs in a person without new cardiac damage, it usually is set off by some temporary overload of the heart, such as that which might result from a bout of heavy exercise, an emotional experience, or even a severe cold. The acute pulmonary edema is believed to result from the following vicious cycle:

1. A temporarily increased load on the already weak left ventricle initiates the vicious cycle. Because of limited pumping capacity of the left heart, blood begins to dam up in the lungs.
2. The increased blood in the lungs elevates the pulmonary capillary pressure, and a small amount of fluid begins to transude into the lung tissues and alveoli.
3. The increased fluid in the lungs diminishes the degree of oxygenation of the blood.
4. The decreased oxygen in the blood further weakens the heart and also causes peripheral vasodilation.
5. The peripheral vasodilation further increases venous return of blood from the peripheral circulation.
6. The increased venous return further increases damming of the blood in the lungs, leading to, for example, still more transudation of fluid, more arterial oxygen desaturation, and more venous return. Thus, a vicious cycle has been established.
Once this vicious cycle has proceeded beyond a certain critical point, it will continue until the patient dies, unless successful therapeutic measures are initiated within minutes. The types of measures that can reverse the process and save the patient's life include the following:
7. Putting tourniquets on both arms and legs to sequester much of the blood in the veins and, therefore, decrease the workload on the left side of the heart
8. Administering a rapidly acting diuretic, such as furosemide, to cause rapid loss of fluid from the body
9. Giving the patient pure oxygen to breathe to reverse the blood oxygen desaturation, heart deterioration, and peripheral vasodilation
10. Administering a rapidly acting cardiotonic drug, such as digitalis, to strengthen the heart
This vicious cycle of acute pulmonary edema can proceed so rapidly that death can occur in 20 to 60 minutes. Therefore, any procedure that is to be successful must be instituted immediately.

## CARDIAC RESERVE

The maximum percentage that the cardiac output can increase above normal is called the cardiac reserve. Thus, in the healthy young adult, the cardiac reserve is $300 \%$ to $400 \%$. In athletically trained persons, it is $500 \%$ to $600 \%$ or more. However, in persons with severe heart failure, there is no cardiac reserve. As an example of normal reserve, the cardiac output of a healthy young adult during vigorous exercise can rise to about five times normal, which is an increase above normal of $400 \%$-that is, a cardiac reserve of $400 \%$.

Any factor that prevents the heart from pumping blood satisfactorily will decrease the cardiac reserve. A decrease in cardiac reserve can result from disorders such as ischemic heart disease, primary myocardial disease, vitamin deficiency that affects cardiac muscle, physical damage to the myocardium, valvular heart disease, and other factors, some of which are shown in Figure 22-4.

## Diagnosis of Low Cardiac Reserve-Exercise Test.

As long as persons with low cardiac reserve remain in a state of rest, they usually will not experience major symptoms of heart disease. However, a diagnosis of low cardiac reserve usually can be made by requiring the person to exercise on a treadmill or by walking up and

![gu103687650e1](gu103687650e1.jpg)

Figure 22-4 Cardiac reserve in different conditions, showing less than zero reserve for two of the conditions.
down steps, either of which requires greatly increased cardiac output. The increased load on the heart rapidly uses up the small amount of reserve that is available, and the cardiac output soon fails to rise high enough to sustain the body's new level of activity. The acute effects are as follows:

1. Immediate and sometimes extreme shortness of breath (dyspnea) resulting from failure of the heart to pump sufficient blood to the tissues, thereby causing tissue ischemia and creating a sensation of air hunger
2. Extreme muscle fatigue resulting from muscle ischemia, thus limiting the person's ability to continue with the exercise
3. Excessive increase in heart rate because the nervous reflexes to the heart overreact in an attempt to overcome the inadequate cardiac output
Exercise tests are part of the armamentarium of the cardiologist. These tests take the place of cardiac output measurements that cannot easily be made in most clinical settings.

## QUANTITATIVE GRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF CARDIAC FAILURE

Although it is possible to understand most general principles of cardiac failure using mainly qualitative logic, as we have done thus far in this chapter, one can grasp the importance of the different factors in cardiac failure in greater depth by using more quantitative approaches. One such approach is the graphic method for analysis of cardiac output regulation introduced in Chapter 20. In the rest of this chapter, we will use this graphic technique to analyze several aspects of cardiac failure.

## Graphic Analysis of Acute Heart Failure and Chronic Compensation

Figure 22-5 shows cardiac output and venous return curves for different states of the heart and peripheral circulation. The two curves passing through point A are (1) the normal cardiac output curve and (2) the normal venous return curve. As indicated in Chapter 20, there is only one point on each of these two curves at which the circulatory system can operate-point A, where the two
![gu104687650e1](gu104687650e1.jpg)

Figure 22-5 Progressive changes in cardiac output, venous return, and right atrial pressure during different stages of cardiac failure.
curves cross. Therefore, the normal state of the circulation is a cardiac output and venous return of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and a right atrial pressure of 0 mm Hg .

Acute Heart Attack Reduces Cardiac Output Curve. During the first few seconds after a moderately severe heart attack, the cardiac output curve falls to the lowermost blue curve. During these few seconds, the venous return curve still has not changed because the peripheral circulatory system is still operating normally. Therefore, the new state of the circulation is depicted by point B, where the new cardiac output curve crosses the normal venous return curve. Thus, the right atrial pressure rises immediately to 4 mm Hg , whereas the cardiac output falls to $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$.

Sympathetic Reflexes Raise Cardiac Output and Venous Return Curves. Within the next 30 seconds, the sympathetic reflexes are activated. They raise the cardiac output and venous return curves (brown dashed curves). Sympathetic stimulation can increase the plateau level of the cardiac output curve by as much as $30 \%$ to $100 \%$. It can also increase the mean systemic filling pressure (depicted by the point where the venous return curve crosses the zero venous return axis) by several millimeters of mer-cury-in this figure, from a normal value of 7 mm Hg up to 10 mm Hg . This increase in mean systemic filling pressure shifts the entire venous return curve to the right and upward. The new cardiac output and venous return curves now equilibrate at point C -that is, at a right atrial pressure of +5 mm Hg and a cardiac output of $4 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$.

Compensation During the Next Few Days Further Increases Cardiac Output and Venous Return Curves. During the ensuing week, the cardiac output and venous return curves rise further (green dashed curves) because of the following: (1) some recovery of the heart; and (2) renal retention of salt and water, which raises the mean systemic filling pressure still further-this time up to +12 mm Hg . The two new curves now equilibrate at point D. Thus, the cardiac output has now returned to normal. The right atrial pressure, however, has risen still further, to +6 mm Hg . Because the cardiac output is now normal, renal output is also normal, so a new state of equilibrated fluid balance has been achieved. The circulatory system will continue to function

at point D and remain stable, with a normal cardiac output and an elevated right atrial pressure, until some additional extrinsic factor changes the cardiac output curve or venous return curve.

Using this technique for analysis, one can especially see the importance of moderate fluid retention and how it eventually leads to a new stable state of the circulation in mild to moderate heart failure. The interrelationship between mean systemic filling pressure and cardiac pumping at various degrees of heart failure can also be seen.

Note that the events described in Figure 22-5 are the same as those presented in Figure 22-1, although in a more quantitative manner.

## Graphic Analysis of Decompensated Cardiac Failure

The black cardiac output curve in Figure 22-6 is the same as the curve shown in Figure 22-2-a greatly depressed curve that has already reached a degree of recovery as much as this heart can achieve. In this figure, we have added venous return curves that occur during successive days after the acute fall of the cardiac output curve to this low level. At point A, the curve at time zero equates with the normal venous return curve to give a cardiac output of about $3 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. However, stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, caused by this low cardiac output, increases the mean systemic filling pressure within 30 seconds from 7 to 10.5 mm Hg . This effect shifts the venous return curve upward and to the right to produce the curve labeled "autonomic compensation." Thus, the new venous return curve equates with the cardiac output curve at point B. The cardiac output has been improved to a level of $4 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ but at the expense of an additional rise in right atrial pressure to 5 mm Hg .

The cardiac output of $4 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ is still too low for the kidneys to function normally. Therefore, fluid continues to be retained and the mean systemic filling pressure rises from 10.5 to almost 13 mm Hg . Now the venous return curve is labeled "2nd day" and equilibrates with the cardiac output
![gu106687650e1](gu106687650e1.jpg)

curve at point C . The cardiac output rises to $4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, and the right atrial pressure rises to 7 mm Hg .

During the succeeding days, the cardiac output never rises high enough to re-establish normal renal function. Fluid continues to be retained, the mean systemic filling pressure continues to rise, the venous return curve continues to shift to the right, and the equilibrium point between the venous return curve and cardiac output curve also shifts progressively to point D, point E, and finally point F. The equilibration process is now on the downslope of the cardiac output curve, and thus further fluid retention causes even more severe cardiac edema and a detrimental effect on cardiac output. The condition accelerates downhill until death occurs.

Thus, decompensation results from the fact that the cardiac output curve never rises to the critical level of 5 $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min}$ needed to re-establish the normal renal excretion of fluid required to result in a balance between fluid input and output.

Treatment of Decompensated Heart Disease With Digitalis. Assume that the stage of decompensation has already reached point E in Figure 22-6, and then proceed to the same point E in Figure 22-7. At this time, digitalis is given to strengthen the heart. This intervention raises the cardiac output curve to the level shown in Figure 22-7, but there is no immediate change in the venous return curve. Therefore, the new cardiac output curve equates with the venous return curve at point G. The cardiac output is now $5.7 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, a value higher than the critical level of 5 liters required to make the kidneys excrete normal amounts of urine. The increased cardiac output, along with the wellknown diuretic effect of digitalis, permits the kidneys to eliminate some of the excess fluid.

The progressive loss of fluid over a period of several days reduces mean systemic filling pressure down to 11.5 mm Hg , and the new venous return curve becomes the curve labeled "Several days later." This curve equates with the cardiac output curve of the digitalized heart at point H , at an output of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and a right atrial pressure of 4.6 mm Hg . This cardiac output is precisely that required for normal fluid balance. Therefore, no additional fluid will be lost, and none will be gained.

Consequently, the circulatory system has now stabilized or, in other words, the decompensation of the heart failure has been compensated. To state this another way, the final steady-state condition of the circulation is defined by the crossing point of three curves-the cardiac output curve, venous return curve, and the critical level for normal fluid balance. The compensatory mechanisms automatically stabilize the circulation when all three curves cross at the same point.

## HEART FAILURE WITH DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION AND NORMAL EJECTION FRACTION

Our discussion thus far has focused mainly on cardiac failure due to decreased contractility of the myocardium following a myocardial infarction or impaired coronary blood flow. However, as discussed earlier in the chapter, heart failure can occur from any condition that decreases the heart's ability to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Heart failure associated with impaired cardiac contractility is often referred to as systolic heart failure or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). As discussed in Chapter 9, the ejection fraction (EF), often assessed by echocardiography, is the fraction of the end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle that is ejected with each contraction. An EF of 0.6 means that $60 \%$ of the end-diastolic volume ventricle is pumped with each heartbeat. Normal values for EF are considered to be from $50 \%$ to $70 \%$. When the heart muscle is weakened, as a result of a myocardial infarction or impaired coronary blood flow, the EF is usually reduced, with values below $40 \%$ considered to be indicative of HFrEF.

Heart failure can also be associated with normal EF if the heart muscle becomes thickened and stiff (concentric hypertrophy), so that filling of the ventricles is impaired, and the ventricles hold a smaller than usual volume of blood. Under these conditions, the total amount of blood pumped by the heart may not be enough to meet the body's needs, even though it is pumping with a normal or even increased EF. This condition is often referred to as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

During the last 30 to 40 years, a growing proportion of heart failure patients have presented with HFpEF. Currently, over $50 \%$ of patients with heart failure patients have a normal EF. HFpEF occurs more commonly in women and older adults and especially in those who have obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, a constellation of disorders often called the cardiometabolic syndrome. In these individuals, diastolic dysfunction is characterized by impairment in the rate of ventricular filling, slowed relaxation of cardiomyocytes, increased thickness of the ventricular wall, proliferation of extracellular matrix, and fibrosis, which contribute to a stiffer left ventricle.

Although clinicians often classify patients into the categories of HFpEF or HFrEF using the EF threshold of $50 \%$, most patients with advanced heart failure exhibit
![gu107687650e1](gu107687650e1.jpg)

abnormalities of ventricular filling as well as impaired contractility and impaired systolic function. Most of the neurohumoral changes in heart failure that have been discussed, including activation of the sympathetic and reninangiotensin system, as well as excessive fluid retention by the kidneys, occur regardless of whether there is normal or reduced EF. Heart failure is a heterogeneous syndrome, rather than a specific disease, and occurs whenever the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body.

Thus, measurements of EF, although useful, do not always provide an accurate assessment of cardiac function. A small thick heart with impaired diastolic filling may be unable to pump the appropriate stroke volume and cardiac output to meet the body's needs but could have a normal or elevated EF. This example illustrates the limitations of left ventricular EF as a marker of left ventricular function and as a means of categorizing patients with heart failure of different causes.

## HIGH-OUTPUT CARDIAC FAILURE

Figure 22-8 provides an analysis of two types of highoutput cardiac failure. One is caused by an arteriovenous fistula that overloads the heart because of excessive venous return, even though the pumping capability of the heart is not depressed. The other type is caused by beriberi, in which the venous return is greatly increased because of diminished systemic vascular resistance but, at the same time, the pumping capability of the heart is depressed.

Arteriovenous Fistula Increases Venous Return. The normal black curves of Figure 22-8 depict the normal cardiac output and normal venous return curves. These curves equate with each other at point A , which depicts a normal cardiac output of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and a normal right atrial pressure of 0 mm Hg .

Now let us assume that the systemic vascular resistance (the total peripheral vascular resistance) becomes greatly decreased because of the opening of a large arteriovenous

fistula (a direct opening between a large artery and large vein). The venous return curve rotates upward to produce the curve labeled "AV fistula." This venous return curve equates with the normal cardiac output curve at point B, with a cardiac output of $12.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and a right atrial pressure of 3 mm Hg . Thus, the cardiac output has become greatly elevated, the right atrial pressure is slightly elevated, and there are mild signs of peripheral congestion. If the person attempts to exercise, he or she will have little cardiac reserve because the heart is already at nearmaximum capacity to pump the extra blood through the arteriovenous fistula. This condition resembles a failure condition and is called high-output failure, but in reality the heart is overloaded by excess venous return.

## Beriberi Weakens the Heart, Causes Fluid Retention by the Kidneys, and Increases Venous Return. Fig-

ure 22-8 shows the approximate changes in the cardiac output and venous return curves caused by beriberi. The decreased level of the cardiac output curve is caused by weakening of the heart because of the avitaminosis (mainly lack of thiamine) that causes the beriberi syndrome. The weakening of the heart has decreased the blood flow to the kidneys. Therefore, the kidneys have retained a large amount of fluid, which in turn has increased the mean systemic filling pressure (represented by the point where the venous return curve now intersects the zero cardiac output level) from the normal value of 7 mm Hg up to 11 mm Hg . This has shifted the venous return curve to the right. Finally, the venous return curve has rotated upward from the normal curve because the avitaminosis has dilated the peripheral blood vessels, as explained in Chapter 17.

The two blue curves (cardiac output curve and venous return curve) intersect with each other at point C , which describes the circulatory condition in beriberi, with a right atrial pressure in this case of 9 mm Hg and a cardiac output about $65 \%$ above normal. This high cardiac output occurs despite the weak heart, as demonstrated by the depressed plateau level of the cardiac output curve.

# Heart Valves and Heart Sounds; Valvular and Congenital Heart Defects 

Function of the heart valves was discussed in Chapter 9, where we pointed out that closing of the valves causes audible sounds. Ordinarily, no audible sounds occur when the valves open. In this chapter, we first discuss the factors that cause the sounds in the heart under normal and abnormal conditions. Then we discuss the overall circulatory changes that occur when valvular or congenital heart defects are present.

## HEART SOUNDS

## NORMAL HEART SOUNDS

When listening to a normal heart with a stethoscope, one hears a sound usually described as "lub, dub, lub, dub." The "lub" is associated with closure of the atrioventricular (A-V) valves at the beginning of systole, and the "dub" is associated with closure of the semilunar (aortic and pulmonary) valves at the end of systole. The "lub" sound is called the first heart sound, and the "dub" is called the second heart sound, because the normal pumping cycle of the heart is considered to start when the A-V valves close at the onset of ventricular systole (Audio 23-1).

The First Heart Sound Is Associated With Closure of A-V. The main cause of the first heart sound is vibration of the taut valves immediately after closure, along with vibration of the adjacent walls of the heart and major vessels around the heart. That is, in generating the first heart sound, contraction of the ventricles first causes sudden backflow of blood against the A-V valves (tricuspid and mitral valves), causing them to close and bulge toward the atria until the chordae tendineae abruptly stop the back bulging. The elastic tautness of the chordae tendineae and valves then causes the back-surging blood to bounce forward again into each respective ventricle. This mechanism causes the blood and the ventricular walls, as well as the taut valves, to vibrate and causes vibrating turbulence in the blood. The vibrations travel through the adjacent tissues to the chest wall, where they can be heard as sound by using the stethoscope.

The Second Heart Sound Is Associated With Closure of the Aortic and Pulmonary Valves. The second heart sound results from sudden closure of the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary valves) at the end of systole. When the semilunar valves close, they bulge backward toward the ventricles, and their elastic stretch recoils the blood back into the arteries, which causes a short period of reverberation of blood back and forth between the walls of the arteries and the semilunar valves, as well as between these valves and the ventricular walls. The vibrations occurring in the arterial walls are then transmitted mainly along the arteries. When the vibrations of the vessels or ventricles come into contact with a sounding board, such as the chest wall, they create sound that can be heard using a stethoscope.

Duration and Pitch of First and Second Heart Sounds. The duration of each of the heart sounds is slightly more than 0.10 second, with the first sound about 0.14 second and the second about 0.11 second. The reason for the shorter second sound is that the semilunar valves are tauter than the A-V valves, so they vibrate for a shorter time than do the A-V valves.

The audible range of frequency (pitch) in the first and second heart sounds, as shown in Figure 23-1, begins at the lowest frequency the ear can detect, about 40 cycles/ sec , and goes up above 500 cycles/sec. When a special electronic apparatus is used to record these sounds, a larger proportion of the recorded sound is at frequencies and sound levels below the audible range, going down to 3 to 4 cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$ and peaking at about 20 cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$, as illustrated by the lower shaded area in Figure 23-1. For this reason, major portions of the heart sounds can be recorded electronically by phonocardiography, even though they cannot be heard with a stethoscope.

The second heart sound normally has a higher frequency than the first heart sound for two reasons: (1) the tautness of the semilunar valves in comparison with the much less taut A-V valves; and (2) the greater elastic coefficient of the taut arterial walls, which provides the principal vibrating chambers for the second sound, in comparison with the much looser, less elastic ventricular

![gu108687650e1](gu108687650e1.jpg)

chambers, which provides the vibrating system for the first heart sound. The clinician uses these differences to distinguish special characteristics of the two respective sounds.

The Third Heart Sound Occurs at the Beginning of the Middle Third of Diastole. Occasionally, a weak, rumbling third heart sound is heard at the beginning of the middle third of diastole. A logical but unproved explanation of this sound is oscillation of blood back and forth between the walls of the ventricles initiated by inrushing blood from the atria. This is analogous to running water from a faucet into a paper sack, with the inrushing water reverberating back and forth between the walls of the sack to cause vibrations in its walls. The reason the third heart sound does not occur until the middle third of diastole is believed to be that in the early part of diastole, the ventricles are not filled sufficiently to create even the small amount of elastic tension necessary for reverberation. The frequency of this sound is usually so low that the ear cannot hear it, yet it can often be recorded in the phonocardiogram. The third heart sound may be normally present in children, adolescents, and young adults but generally indicates systolic heart failure in older adults.

Atrial Contraction-Fourth Heart Sound. An atrial heart sound can sometimes be recorded in the phonocardiogram, but it can almost never be heard with a stethoscope because of its weakness and very low frequencyusually 20 cycles/sec or less. This sound occurs when the atria contract, and presumably, it is caused by the inrush of blood into the ventricles, which initiates vibrations similar to those of the third heart sound. A fourth heart sound is common in persons who derive benefit from atrial contraction for ventricular filling as a result of decreased ventricular wall compliance and increased resistance to ventricular filling. For example, a fourth heart sound is often heard in older patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.
![gu109687650e1](gu109687650e1.jpg)

Figure 23-2 Chest areas from which sounds from each valve are heard best.

Chest Surface Areas for Auscultation of Normal Heart Sounds. Listening to the sounds of the body, usually with the aid of a stethoscope, is called auscultation. Figure 23-2 shows the areas of the chest wall from which the different heart valvular sounds can best be distinguished. Although the sounds from all the valves can be heard from all these areas, the cardiologist distinguishes the sounds from the different valves by a process of elimination. That is, he or she moves the stethoscope from one area to another, noting the loudness of the sounds in different areas and gradually picking out the sound components from each valve.

The areas for listening to the different heart sounds are not directly over the valves themselves. The aortic area is upward along the aorta because of sound transmission up the aorta, and the pulmonic area is upward along the pulmonary artery. The tricuspid area is over the right ventricle, and the mitral area is over the apex of the left ventricle, which is the portion of the heart nearest the surface of the chest; the heart is rotated so that the remainder of the left ventricle lies more posteriorly.

Phonocardiogram. If a microphone specially designed to detect low-frequency sound is placed on the chest, the heart sounds can be amplified and recorded by a high-speed recording apparatus. The recording is called a phonocardiogram, and the heart sounds appear as waves, as shown schematically in Figure 233. Recording A is an example of normal heart sounds, showing the vibrations of the first, second, and third heart sounds and even the very weak atrial sound. Note specifically that the third and atrial heart sounds are each a very low rumble. The third heart sound can be recorded in only one-third to one-half of people, and the atrial heart sound can be recorded in perhaps one-fourth of people.

## VALVULAR LESIONS

## Rheumatic Valvular Lesions

Rheumatic fever is an autoimmune disease in which the heart valves are likely to be damaged or destroyed. The disease is usually initiated by a streptococcal toxin.

The sequence of events almost always begins with a preliminary streptococcal infection caused specifically by group A hemolytic streptococci. These bacteria initially cause a sore throat, scarlet fever, or middle ear infection. However, the streptococci also release several different proteins against which the person's reticuloendothelial system produces antibodies. The antibodies react not only with the streptococcal protein but also with other protein tissues of the body, often causing severe immunologic damage. These reactions continue to take place as long as the antibodies persist in the blood-1 year or more.

Rheumatic fever particularly causes damage in certain susceptible areas, such as the heart valves. The degree of heart valve damage is directly correlated with the concentration and persistence of the antibodies. The principles of immunity that relate to this type of reaction are discussed in Chapter 35, and it is noted in Chapter 32 that acute glomerular nephritis of the kidneys has a similar immunologic basis.

In persons with rheumatic fever, large hemorrhagic, fibrinous, bulbous lesions grow along the inflamed edges of the heart valves. Because the mitral valve undergoes more trauma during valvular action than any of the other valves, it is the one most often seriously damaged, and the aortic valve is the second most frequently damaged. The right heart valves-that is, the tricuspid and pulmonary valves-are usually affected much less severely, probably because the low-pressure stresses that act on these valves are slight compared with the high-pressure stresses that act on the left heart valves.

The lesions of acute rheumatic fever frequently occur on adjacent valve leaflets simultaneously, so the edges of the leaflets become stuck together. Then, weeks, months, or years later, the lesions become scar tissue, permanently fusing portions of adjacent valve leaflets. Also, the free edges of the leaflets, which are normally filmy and freeflapping, often become solid scarred masses.

A valve in which the leaflets adhere to one another so extensively that blood cannot flow through it normally is said to be stenosed. Conversely, when the valve edges are so destroyed by scar tissue that they cannot close as the ventricles contract, regurgitation (backflow) of blood occurs when the valve should be closed. Stenosis usually does not occur without the coexistence of at least some degree of regurgitation, and vice versa.

## Aging and Aortic Valve Stenosis

With aging, the aortic valve often thickens, becomes calcified and stiffer, and may partially obstruct outflow from the left ventricle. With increased life expectancy and aging of the population, aortic valve stenosis has become the most common heart valve disease.

Stenosis of a previously normal aortic valve, often called senile calcific aortic valve stenosis, is characterized by valve calcium deposition and ossification, which lead to narrowing of the aortic valve orifice. As a compensatory response to the increased workload imposed on the heart by the stenotic aortic valve, the left ventricle undergoes concentric hypertrophy. This type of hypertrophy is associated with increased left ventricular wall thickness, which permits the heart to pump with greater vigor against the partially obstructed outflow. An increasing pressure gradient then develops across the calcified valve, reaching 75 to 100 mm Hg in severe cases of aortic valve stenosis.

The hypertrophied left ventricle also becomes more fibrotic and tends to be ischemic because of impaired microcirculatory perfusion, although some patients may also have atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries. The ejection fraction may be normal, and the patient may be able to maintain adequate cardiac output under resting conditions, but with even moderate exercise, symptoms of heart failure may appear. As the stenosis progressively worsens, there are reductions in systolic heart function and inability of the left ventricle to develop enough pressure to pump effectively against the load imposed by the partially obstructed aortic valve. Consequently, symptoms of congestive heart failure appear, with reductions in stroke volume and cardiac output.

Calcific aortic valve stenosis usually does not become severe enough to draw clinical attention until after age 70. Important symptoms of aortic valve stenosis are exertion-related angina, reduced exercise tolerance, and congestive heart failure. Shortness of breath (dyspnea) is due to increased left ventricular filling pressure or inability to increase cardiac output adequately with exercise. Early recognition and management of aortic stenosis are

important because untreated symptomatic aortic valve stenosis is progressive and will ultimately be fatal.

The development of transcatheter aortic valve replacement technologies has provided new therapeutic opportunities, especially for older patients, in whom traditional surgical procedures cannot be performed or are associated with high risk.

## Heart Murmurs Caused by Valvular Lesions

As shown by the phonocardiograms in Figure 23-3, many abnormal heart sounds, known as heart murmurs, occur when abnormalities of the valves are present, as discussed here.

Systolic Murmur of Aortic Stenosis. In persons with aortic stenosis, blood is ejected from the left ventricle through only a small fibrous opening of the aortic valve. Because of the resistance to ejection, the blood pressure in the left ventricle sometimes rises as high as 300 mm Hg ; the pressure in the aorta is still normal. Thus, a nozzle effect is created during systole, with blood jetting at tremendous velocity through the small opening of the valve. This phenomenon causes severe turbulence of the blood in the root of the aorta. The turbulent blood impinging against the aortic walls causes intense vibration, and a loud murmur occurs during systole (see recording B, Figure 23-3; Audio 23-2) and is transmitted throughout the superior thoracic aorta and even into the large arteries of the neck. This sound is harsh, and in persons with severe stenosis it may be so loud that it can be heard several feet away from the patient. Also, the sound vibrations can often be felt with the hand on the upper chest and lower neck, a phenomenon known as a thrill.

Diastolic Murmur of Aortic Regurgitation. In aortic regurgitation, no abnormal sound is heard during systole, but during diastole, blood flows backward from the highpressure aorta into the left ventricle, causing a "blowing" murmur of relatively high pitch, with a swishing quality heard maximally over the left ventricle (see recording D, Figure 23-3; Audio 23-3). This murmur results from the turbulence of blood jetting backward into the blood already in the low-pressure diastolic left ventricle.

Systolic Murmur of Mitral Regurgitation. In persons with mitral regurgitation, blood flows backward through the mitral valve into the left atrium during systole. This backward flow also causes a high-frequency blowing, swishing sound (see recording C, Figure 23-3; Audio 23-4) similar to that of aortic regurgitation but occurring during systole rather than diastole. It is transmitted most strongly into the left atrium. However, the left atrium is so deep within the chest that it is difficult to hear this sound directly over the atrium. As a result, the sound of mitral regurgitation is transmitted to the chest wall mainly through the left ventricle to the apex of the heart.

Diastolic Murmur of Mitral Stenosis. In persons with mitral stenosis, blood passes with difficulty through the stenosed mitral valve from the left atrium into the left ventricle, and because the pressure in the left atrium seldom rises above 30 mm Hg , a large pressure differential forcing blood from the left atrium into the left ventricle does not develop. Consequently, the abnormal sounds heard in mitral stenosis (see recording E, Figure 23-3; Audio 23-5) are usually weak and of very low frequency, so most of the sound spectrum is below the low-frequency end of human hearing.

During the early part of diastole, a left ventricle with a stenotic mitral valve has so little blood in it, and its walls are so flabby, that blood does not reverberate back and forth between the walls of the ventricle. For this reason, even in persons with severe mitral stenosis, no murmur may be heard during the first third of diastole. Then, after partial filling, the ventricle has stretched enough for blood to reverberate, and a low rumbling murmur begins.

Phonocardiograms of Valvular Murmurs. Phonocardiograms B, C, D, and E of Figure 23-3 show, respectively, idealized records obtained from patients with aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, and mitral stenosis. It is obvious from these phonocardiograms that the aortic stenotic lesion causes the loudest murmur, and the mitral stenotic lesion causes the weakest murmur. The phonocardiograms show how the intensity of the murmurs varies during different portions of systole and diastole, and the relative timing of each murmur is also evident. Note especially that the murmurs of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation occur only during systole, whereas the murmurs of aortic regurgitation and mitral stenosis occur only during diastole.

## ABNORMAL CIRCULATORY DYNAMICS IN VALVULAR HEART DISEASE

## CIRCULATORY DYNAMICS IN AORTIC STENOSIS AND AORTIC REGURGITATION

In aortic stenosis, the contracting left ventricle fails to empty adequately, whereas in aortic regurgitation, blood flows backward into the ventricle from the aorta after the ventricle has just pumped the blood into the aorta. Therefore, in both cases, the net stroke volume output of the heart is reduced.

Several important compensations take place that can ameliorate the severity of the circulatory defects. Some of these compensations are described in the following sections.

Hypertrophy of Left Ventricle. In both aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation, the left ventricular musculature hypertrophies because of the increased ventricular workload. In regurgitation, the left ventricular chamber also enlarges to hold all the regurgitant blood from the aorta. This type of hypertrophy, with enlargement of the

Figure 23-4 Comparison of the left ventricle in a normal heart, a heart with eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and a heart with concentric LVH. Left ventricular mass increases in eccentric and concentric LVH but there is an increase in left ventricular cavity size in eccentric LVH, whereas wall thickness increases in concentric LVH.
ventricular chamber, is often referred to as eccentric hypertrophy (Figure 23-4). Sometimes, the left ventricular muscle mass increases fourfold to fivefold, creating a tremendously large left side of the heart.

When the aortic valve is seriously stenosed, the hypertrophied muscle may allow the left ventricle to develop as much as 400 mm Hg of intraventricular pressure at systolic peak. This type of concentric hypertrophy is associated with thickened ventricular walls and a smaller ventricular chamber (see Figure 23-4) and also occurs in other circumstances where afterload of the heart is increased, such as in chronic hypertension.

In persons with severe aortic regurgitation, sometimes the enlarged left ventricle can pump a stroke volume output as great as 250 milliliters, although as much as $75 \%$ of this blood returns to the ventricle during diastole, and only $25 \%$ flows through the aorta to the body.

Increase in Blood Volume. Another effect that helps compensate for the diminished net pumping by the left ventricle is increased blood volume. This increased volume results from the following: (1) an initial slight decrease in arterial pressure; (2) nervous reflexes and hormonal changes induced by the decrease in pressure. These mechanisms together diminish renal output of urine, causing blood volume to increase and the mean arterial pressure to return to normal. Also, red blood cell mass eventually increases because of a slight degree of tissue hypoxia.

The increase in blood volume tends to increase venous return to the heart, which, in turn, causes the left ventricle to pump with the extra power required to overcome the abnormal pumping dynamics.

Aortic Valvular Lesions May Be Associated With Inadequate Coronary Blood Flow. When a person has stenosis of the aortic valve, the ventricular muscle must develop a high tension to create the high intraventricular pressure needed to force blood through the stenosed valve. This
action increases the workload and oxygen consumption of the ventricle, necessitating increased coronary blood flow to deliver this oxygen. The high wall tension of the ventricle, however, causes marked decreases in coronary flow during systole, particularly in the subendocardial vessels. Intraventricular diastolic pressure is also increased when there is aortic valve stenosis, and this increased pressure may cause compression of the inner layers of the heart muscle and reduced coronary blood flow. Thus, severe aortic valve stenosis often causes ischemia of the heart muscle.

With aortic regurgitation, the intraventricular diastolic pressure also increases, compressing the inner layer of the heart muscle and decreasing coronary blood flow. Aortic diastolic pressure decreases during aortic regurgitation, which can also decrease coronary blood flow and cause ischemia of the heart muscle.

## Eventual Failure of Left Ventricle and Development

of Pulmonary Edema. In the early stages of aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation, the intrinsic ability of the left ventricle to adapt to increasing loads prevents significant abnormalities in circulatory function in the person during rest, other than the increased work output required of the left ventricle. Therefore, considerable degrees of aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation often occur before the person knows that he or she has serious heart disease (e.g., a resting left ventricular systolic pressure as high as 200 mm Hg in persons with aortic stenosis or a left ventricular stroke volume output as high as twice normal in persons with aortic regurgitation).

Beyond a critical stage in these aortic valve lesions, the left ventricle finally cannot keep up with the work demand. As a consequence, the left ventricle dilates and cardiac output begins to fall; blood simultaneously dams up in the left atrium and in the lungs behind the failing left ventricle. The left atrial pressure rises progressively, and at mean left atrial pressures above 25 to 40 mm Hg , serious edema appears in the lungs, as discussed in detail in Chapter 39.

## DYNAMICS OF MITRAL STENOSIS AND MITRAL REGURGITATION

In persons with mitral stenosis, blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle is impeded and, in persons with mitral regurgitation, much of the blood that has flowed into the left ventricle during diastole leaks back into the left atrium during systole rather than being pumped into the aorta. Therefore, either of these conditions reduces net movement of blood from the left atrium into the left ventricle.

Pulmonary Edema in Mitral Valvular Disease. The buildup of blood in the left atrium causes a progressive increase in left atrial pressure, eventually resulting in the development of serious pulmonary edema. Ordinarily, lethal edema does not occur until the mean left atrial pressure rises above 25 mm Hg , and sometimes as high as 40 mm Hg , because the lung lymphatic vessels enlarge many times and can carry fluid rapidly away from the lung tissues.

Enlarged Left Atrium and Atrial Fibrillation. The high left atrial pressure in mitral valvular disease also causes progressive enlargement of the left atrium, which increases the distance that the cardiac electrical excitatory impulse must travel in the atrial wall. This pathway may eventually become so long that it predisposes to the development of excitatory signal circus movements, as discussed in Chapter 13. Therefore, in late stages of mitral valvular disease, especially in mitral stenosis, atrial fibrillation often occurs. This development further reduces the pumping effectiveness of the heart and causes further cardiac debility.

Compensation in Early Mitral Valvular Disease. As also occurs in aortic valvular disease and in many types of congenital heart disease, the blood volume increases in mitral valvular disease principally because of diminished excretion of water and salt by the kidneys. This increased blood volume increases venous return to the heart, thereby helping overcome the effect of the cardiac debility. Therefore, after compensation, cardiac output may fall only minimally until the late stages of mitral valvular disease, even though the left atrial pressure is rising.

As the left atrial pressure rises, blood begins to dam up in the lungs, eventually all the way back to the pulmonary artery. In addition, incipient edema of the lungs causes pulmonary arteriolar constriction. These two effects together increase systolic pulmonary arterial pressure and also right ventricular pressure, sometimes to as high as 60 mm Hg , which is more than double normal. This increased pressure, in turn, causes hypertrophy of the right side of the heart, which partially compensates for its increased workload.

## CIRCULATORY DYNAMICS DURING EXERCISE IN PATIENTS WITH VALVULAR LESIONS

During exercise, increased blood flow is required to provide additional oxygen and nutrients to the exercising muscles and remove waste products of increased metabolism. Consequently, increased quantities of venous blood are returned to the heart from the peripheral circulation. Therefore, all the dynamic abnormalities that occur in the different types of valvular heart disease become exacerbated. Even in persons with mild valvular heart disease, in which the symptoms may be unrecognizable at rest, severe symptoms often develop during heavy exercise. For example, in patients with aortic valvular lesions, exercise can cause acute left ventricular failure followed by acute pulmonary edema. Also, in patients with mitral disease, exercise can cause so much damming of blood in the lungs that serious or even lethal pulmonary edema may ensue in as little as 10 minutes.

Even in mild to moderate cases of valvular disease, the patient's cardiac reserve diminishes in proportion to the severity of the valvular dysfunction. That is, the cardiac output does not increase as much as it should during exercise. Therefore, the muscles of the body fatigue rapidly because of too little increase in muscle blood flow.

## ABNORMAL CIRCULATORY DYNAMICS IN CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS

Occasionally, the heart or its associated blood vessels are malformed during fetal life; the defect is called a congenital anomaly. There are three major types of congenital anomalies of the heart and its associated vessels: (1) stenosis of the channel of blood flow at some point in the heart or in a closely allied major blood vessel; (2) an anomaly that allows blood to flow backward from the left side of the heart or aorta to the right side of the heart or pulmonary artery, thus failing to flow through the systemic circulation, called a left-to-right shunt; and (3) an anomaly that allows blood to flow directly from the right side of the heart into the left side of the heart, thus failing to flow through the lungs, called a right-to-left shunt.

The effects of the different stenotic lesions are easily understood. For instance, congenital aortic valve stenosis results in the same dynamic effects as aortic valve stenosis caused by other valvular lesions, namely, cardiac hypertrophy, heart muscle ischemia, reduced cardiac output, and a tendency to develop serious pulmonary edema.

Another type of congenital stenosis is coarctation of the aorta, often occurring above the level of the diaphragm. This stenosis causes the arterial pressure in the upper part of the body (above the level of the coarctation) to be much greater than the pressure in the lower body because of the great resistance to blood flow through the coarctation to the lower body; part of the blood must go around the coarctation through small collateral arteries, as discussed in Chapter 19.

## PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS—A LEFT-TO-RIGHT SHUNT

During fetal life, the lungs are collapsed, and the elastic compression of the lungs that keeps the alveoli collapsed keeps most of the lung blood vessels collapsed as well. Therefore, resistance to blood flow through the lungs is so great that the pulmonary arterial pressure is high in the fetus. Also, because of low resistance to blood flow from the aorta through the large vessels of the placenta, the pressure in the aorta of the fetus is lower than normal-in fact, lower than in the pulmonary artery. This phenomenon causes almost all the pulmonary arterial blood to flow through a special artery present in the fetus that connects the pulmonary artery with the aorta (Figure 23-5), the ductus arteriosus, thus bypassing the lungs. This mechanism allows immediate recirculation of the blood through the systemic arteries of the fetus without the blood going through the lungs. This lack of blood flow through the lungs is not detrimental to the fetus because the blood is oxygenated by the placenta.

Closure of Ductus Arteriosus After Birth. As soon as a baby is born and begins to breathe, the lungs inflate. Not only do the alveoli fill with air, but also the resistance to blood flow through the pulmonary vascular tree decreases tremendously, allowing the pulmonary arterial pressure to fall. Simultaneously, the aortic pressure rises because of sudden cessation of blood flow from the aorta through the placenta. Thus, the pressure in the pulmonary artery falls, while that in the aorta rises. As a result, forward blood flow
through the ductus arteriosus ceases suddenly at birth and, in fact, blood begins to flow backward through the ductus, from the aorta into the pulmonary artery. This new state of backward blood flow causes the ductus arteriosus to become occluded within a few hours to a few days in most babies, so blood flow through the ductus does not persist. The ductus is believed to close because the oxygen concentration of the aortic blood now flowing through it is about twice as high as that of the blood flowing from the pulmonary artery into the ductus during fetal life. The oxygen presumably constricts the muscle in the ductus wall. This phenomenon is discussed further in Chapter 84.

Unfortunately, in about 1 of every 5500 babies, the ductus does not close, causing the condition known as patent ductus arteriosus, which is shown in Figure 23-5.

## Dynamics of the Circulation With a Persistent Patent Ductus

During the early months of an infant's life, a patent ductus usually does not cause severely abnormal function. However, as the child grows older, the differential between the high pressure in the aorta and the lower pressure in the pulmonary artery progressively increases, with a corresponding increase in the backward flow of blood from the aorta into the pulmonary artery. Also, the high aortic blood pressure usually causes the diameter of the partially open ductus to increase with time, making the condition even worse.

Recirculation Through the Lungs. In an older child with a patent ductus, one-half to two-thirds of the aortic blood flows backward through the ductus into the pulmonary artery, then through the lungs, and finally back into the left ventricle and aorta, passing through the lungs and left side of the heart two or more times for every one time that it passes through the systemic circulation. People with this condition do not show cyanosis until later in life, when the heart fails or the lungs become congested. Indeed, early in life, the arterial blood is often better oxygenated than normal because of the extra times that it passes through the lungs.

Diminished Cardiac and Respiratory Reserve. The major effects of patent ductus arteriosus on the patient are decreased cardiac and respiratory reserve. The left ventricle is pumping about two or more times the normal cardiac output, and the maximum that it can pump after hypertrophy of the heart has occurred is about four to seven times normal. Therefore, during exercise, the net blood flow through the remainder of the body can never increase to the levels required for strenuous activity. With even moderately strenuous exercise, the person is likely to become weak and may even faint from momentary heart failure.

The high pressures in the pulmonary vessels caused by excess flow through the lungs may also lead to pulmonary congestion and pulmonary edema. As a result of the excessive load on the heart, and especially because the

pulmonary congestion becomes progressively more severe with age, most patients with uncorrected patent ductus die from heart disease between the ages of 20 and 40 years.

## Heart Sounds: Machinery Murmur

In a newborn infant with patent ductus arteriosus, occasionally no abnormal heart sounds are heard because the quantity of reverse blood flow through the ductus may be insufficient to cause a heart murmur. However, as the baby grows older, to 1 to 3 years of age, a harsh blowing murmur begins to be heard in the pulmonary artery area of the chest, as shown in recording F, Figure 23-3. This sound is much more intense during systole when the aortic pressure is high and much less intense during diastole when the aortic pressure falls low, so that the murmur waxes and wanes with each beat of the heart, creating the so-called machinery murmur.

## Surgical Treatment

Surgical treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is simple; one need only ligate the patent ductus or divide it and then close the two ends. This procedure was one of the first successful heart surgeries ever performed. Catheter-based devices often are used to close PDAs in infants or children who are large enough to have the procedure. A small metal coil or other occlusion device is passed up through the catheter and placed in the PDA to block blood flow through the vessel.

## TETRALOGY OF FALLOT—A RIGHT-TOLEFT SHUNT

Tetralogy of Fallot is shown in Figure 23-6; it is the most common cause of blue baby. Most of the blood bypasses the lungs, so the aortic blood is mainly unoxygenated venous blood. In this condition, four abnormalities of the heart occur simultaneously:

1. The aorta originates from the right ventricle rather than the left, or it overrides a hole in the septum, as shown in Figure 23-6, receiving blood from both ventricles.
2. Because the pulmonary artery is stenosed, much lower than normal amounts of blood pass from the right ventricle into the lungs; instead, most of the blood passes directly into the aorta, thus bypassing the lungs.
3. Blood from the left ventricle flows through a ventricular septal hole into the right ventricle and then into the aorta or directly into the aorta that overrides this hole.
4. Because the right side of the heart must pump large quantities of blood against the high pressure in the aorta, its musculature is highly developed, causing an enlarged right ventricle.

Abnormal Circulatory Dynamics. It is readily apparent that the major physiological difficulty caused by tetralogy
![gu113687650e1](gu113687650e1.jpg)

Figure 23-6 Tetralogy of Fallot, showing by the blue color that most of the venous blood is shunted from the right ventricle into the aorta without passing through the lungs.
of Fallot is the shunting of blood past the lungs without its becoming oxygenated. As much as $75 \%$ of the venous blood returning to the heart passes directly from the right ventricle into the aorta without becoming oxygenated. This can lead to cyanosis (blue coloration) of the baby's skin. Other signs include high right ventricular pressures, right ventricular enlargement, and a left-to-right shunt through the interventricular septum, which can be visualized by echocardiography.

Surgical Treatment. Tetralogy of Fallot can often be treated successfully with surgery. The usual procedure is to open the pulmonary stenosis, close the septal defect, and reconstruct the flow pathway into the aorta. When surgery is successful, the average life expectancy increases from only 3 to 4 years to 50 or more years.

## CAUSES OF CONGENITAL ANOMALIES

Congenital heart disease is not uncommon, occurring in about 8 of every 1000 live births. One of the most common causes of congenital heart defects is a viral infection in the mother during the first trimester of pregnancy when the fetal heart is being formed. Defects are particularly prone to develop when the expectant mother contracts German measles (rubella) during the first trimester of pregnancy. Taking certain medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and acne medications (e.g., isotretinoin), and alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy also increases the risk for heart defects in the developing fetus.

Some congenital defects of the heart are hereditary because the same defect has been known to occur in

identical twins, as well as in succeeding generations. Children of patients surgically treated for congenital heart disease have about a 10 times greater chance of having congenital heart disease than other children. Congenital defects of the heart are also frequently associated with other congenital defects of the baby's body.

## USE OF EXTRACORPOREAL CIRCULATION DURING CARDIAC SURGERY

It is almost impossible to repair intracardiac defects surgically while the heart is still pumping. Therefore, many types of artificial heart-lung machines have been developed to take the place of the heart and lungs during the course of an operation. Such a system is called extracorporeal circulation. The system consists principally of a pump and an oxygenating device. Almost any type of pump that does not cause hemolysis of the blood seems to be suitable.

Methods used for oxygenating blood include the following: (1) bubbling oxygen through the blood and removing the bubbles from the blood before passing it back into the patient; (2) dripping the blood downward over the surfaces of plastic sheets in the presence of oxygen; (3) passing the blood over surfaces of rotating discs; and (4) passing the blood between thin membranes or through thin tubes that are permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide.

## HYPERTROPHY OF THE HEART IN VALVULAR AND CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

Hypertrophy of cardiac muscle is one of the most important mechanisms whereby the heart adapts to increased workloads whether these loads are caused by increased pressure against which the heart muscle must contract or by increased cardiac output that must be pumped. One can calculate approximately how much hypertrophy will occur in each chamber of the heart by multiplying the ventricular output by the pressure against which the ventricle must work, with an emphasis on pressure. Thus, hypertrophy occurs in most types of valvular and congenital disease, sometimes causing the heart to weigh as much as 800 grams instead of the normal 300 grams.

## Detrimental Effects of Late Stages of Cardiac Hyper-

trophy. Although the most common cause of cardiac hypertrophy is hypertension, almost all forms of cardiac diseases, including valvular and congenital disease, can stimulate enlargement of the heart.

So-called physiological cardiac hypertrophy is generally considered to be a compensatory response of the heart to increased workload and is usually beneficial for maintaining cardiac output in the presence of abnormalities that impair the heart's effectiveness as a pump. However, extreme degrees of hypertrophy can lead to heart failure. One reason
for this is that the coronary vasculature typically does not increase to the same extent as the mass of cardiac muscle increases. The second reason is that fibrosis often develops in the muscle, especially in the subendocardial muscle where the coronary blood flow is poor, with fibrous tissue replacing degenerating muscle fibers. Because of the disproportionate increase in muscle mass relative to coronary blood flow, relative ischemia may develop as the cardiac muscle hypertrophies, and coronary blood flow insufficiency may ensue. Anginal pain is therefore a frequent accompaniment of cardiac hypertrophy associated with valvular and congenital heart disease. Enlargement of the heart is also associated with a greater risk for developing arrhythmias, which in turn can lead to further impairment of cardiac function and sudden death because of fibrillation.

# Circulatory Shock and Its Treatment 

Circulatory shock means generalized inadequate blood flow through the body to the extent that the body tissues are damaged, especially because too little oxygen and other nutrients are delivered to the tissue cells. Even the cardiovascular system itself-the heart musculature, walls of the blood vessels, vasomotor system, and other circulatory parts-begins to deteriorate, so the shock, once begun, is prone to become progressively worse.

## PHYSIOLOGICAL CAUSES OF SHOCK

## CIRCULATORY SHOCK CAUSED BY DECREASED CARDIAC OUTPUT

Shock usually results from inadequate cardiac output. Therefore, any condition that reduces the cardiac output far below normal may lead to circulatory shock. Two types of factors can severely reduce cardiac output:

1. Cardiac abnormalities that decrease the ability of the heart to pump blood. These abnormalities include in particular myocardial infarction but also toxic states of the heart, severe heart valve dysfunction, heart arrhythmias, and other conditions. The circulatory shock that results from diminished cardiac pumping ability is called cardiogenic shock. This condition is discussed in Chapter 22, where it is noted that as many as $70 \%$ of people who experience cardiogenic shock do not survive.
2. Factors that decrease venous return also decrease cardiac output because the heart cannot pump blood that does not flow into it. The most common cause of decreased venous return is diminished blood volume, but venous return can also be reduced as a result of decreased vascular tone, especially of the venous blood reservoirs, or obstruction to blood flow at some point in the circulation, especially in the venous return pathway to the heart.

## CIRCULATORY SHOCK WITHOUT DIMINISHED CARDIAC OUTPUT

Occasionally, cardiac output is normal or even more than normal, yet the person is in a state of circulatory shock.

This situation can result from the following: (1) excessive metabolic rate, so even a normal cardiac output is inadequate; or (2) abnormal tissue perfusion patterns, so most of the cardiac output is passing through blood vessels besides those that supply the local tissues with nutrition.

The specific causes of shock are discussed later in this chapter. For the present, it is important to note that all of them lead to inadequate delivery of nutrients to critical tissues and critical organs, as well as inadequate removal of cellular waste products from the tissues.

## WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ARTERIAL PRESSURE IN CIRCULATORY SHOCK?

In the minds of many physicians, the arterial pressure level is the principal measure of adequacy of circulatory function. However, the arterial pressure can often be seriously misleading. At times, a person may be in severe shock and still have an almost normal arterial pressure because of powerful nervous reflexes that keep the pressure from falling. At other times, the arterial pressure can fall to half of normal, but the person still has normal tissue perfusion and is not in shock.

In most types of shock, especially shock caused by severe blood loss, the arterial blood pressure decreases at the same time the cardiac output decreases, although usually not as much.

## TISSUE DETERIORATION IS THE END RESULT OF CIRCULATORY SHOCK

Once circulatory shock reaches a critical state of severity, regardless of its initiating cause, the shock itself leads to more shock. That is, the inadequate blood flow causes the body tissues to begin deteriorating, including the heart and circulatory system. This deterioration causes even greater decreases in cardiac output, and a vicious cycle ensues, with progressively increasing circulatory shock, less adequate tissue perfusion, and more shock until death occurs. It is with this late stage of circulatory shock that we are especially concerned because appropriate physiological treatment can often reverse the rapid slide to death.

## STAGES OF SHOCK

Because the characteristics of circulatory shock change with different degrees of severity, shock is often divided into the following three major stages:

1. A nonprogressive stage (sometimes called the compensated stage), in which the normal circulatory compensatory mechanisms eventually cause full recovery without help from outside therapy.
2. A progressive stage, in which, without therapy, the shock becomes steadily worse until death occurs.
3. An irreversible stage, in which the shock has progressed to such an extent that all forms of known therapy are inadequate to save the person's life even though, for the moment, the person is still alive.
We will now discuss the stages of circulatory shock caused by decreased blood volume, which illustrate the basic principles. Then we will consider special characteristics of shock initiated by other causes.

## SHOCK CAUSED BY HYPOVOLEMIAHEMORRHAGIC SHOCK

Hypovolemia means diminished blood volume. Hemorrhage is the most common cause of hypovolemic shock. Hemorrhage decreases the filling pressure of the circulation and, as a consequence, decreases venous return. As a result, the cardiac output falls below normal, and shock may ensue.

## Relationship of Bleeding Volume to Cardiac Output and Arterial Pressure

Figure 24-1 shows the approximate effects on cardiac output and arterial pressure of removing blood from the circulatory system over a period of about 30 minutes. About $10 \%$ of the total blood volume can be removed with almost no effect on arterial pressure or cardiac output, but greater blood loss usually diminishes the cardiac output first and later the arterial pressure, both of which
![gu114687650e1](gu114687650e1.jpg)

Figure 24-1 Effect of hemorrhage on cardiac output and arterial pressure.
fall to zero when about $40 \%$ to $45 \%$ of the total blood volume has been removed.

Sympathetic Reflex Compensations in Shock—Their Special Value to Maintain Arterial Pressure. The decrease in arterial pressure after hemorrhage, as well as decreases in pressures in the pulmonary arteries and veins in the thorax, cause powerful sympathetic reflexes (initiated mainly by the arterial baroreceptors and other vascular stretch receptors, as explained in Chapter 18). These reflexes stimulate the sympathetic vasoconstrictor system in most tissues of the body, resulting in three important effects:

1. The arterioles constrict in most parts of the systemic circulation, thereby increasing the total peripheral resistance.
2. The veins and venous reservoirs constrict, thereby helping maintain adequate venous return, despite diminished blood volume.
3. Heart activity increases markedly, sometimes increasing the heart rate from the normal value of 72 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ to as high as 160 to 180 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$.
In the absence of the sympathetic reflexes, only $15 \%$ to $20 \%$ of the blood volume can be removed over a period of 30 minutes before a person dies; in contrast, a person can sustain a $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ loss of blood volume when the reflexes are intact. Therefore, these reflexes extend the amount of blood loss that can occur without causing death to about twice that which is possible in their absence.

## Greater Effect of Sympathetic Nervous Reflexes in Maintaining Arterial Pressure Than in Maintaining

Cardiac Output. Referring again to Figure 24-1, note that the arterial pressure is maintained at or near normal levels in the hemorrhaging person longer than is the cardiac output. The reason for this difference is that the sympathetic reflexes are geared more for maintaining arterial pressure than for maintaining cardiac output. They increase the arterial pressure mainly by increasing the total peripheral resistance, which has no beneficial effect on cardiac output. However, the sympathetic constriction of the veins is important to keep venous return and cardiac output from falling too much, in addition to their role in maintaining arterial pressure.

Especially interesting is the second plateau occurring at about 50 mm Hg in the arterial pressure curve of Figure 24-1. This second plateau results from activation of the central nervous system ischemic response, which causes extreme stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system when the brain begins to experience lack of oxygen or excess buildup of carbon dioxide, as discussed in Chapter 18. This effect of the central nervous system ischemic response can be called the "last-ditch stand" of the sympathetic reflexes in their attempt to keep the arterial pressure from falling too low.

Protection of Coronary and Cerebral Blood Flow by the Reflexes. A special value of the maintenance of normal arterial pressure, even in the presence of decreasing cardiac output, is protection of blood flow through the coronary and cerebral circulations. The sympathetic stimulation does not cause significant constriction of the cerebral or cardiac vessels. In addition, in both vascular beds, local blood flow autoregulation is excellent, which prevents moderate decreases in arterial pressure from significantly decreasing their blood flows. Therefore, blood flow through the heart and brain is maintained essentially at normal levels as long as the mean arterial pressure does not fall below about 70 mm Hg , despite the fact that blood flow in some other areas of the body might be decreased to as little as one-third to one-quarter normal by this time because of vasoconstriction.

## PROGRESSIVE AND NONPROGRESSIVE HEMORRHAGIC SHOCK

Figure 24-2 shows an experiment that demonstrates the effects of different degrees of sudden acute hemorrhage on the subsequent course of arterial pressure. The animals in this experiment were anesthetized and bled rapidly until their arterial pressures fell to different levels. The animals whose pressures fell immediately to no lower than 45 mm Hg (groups I, II, and III) all eventually recovered; the recovery occurred rapidly if the pressure fell only slightly (group I) but occurred slowly if it fell almost to the $45-\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ level (group III). When the arterial pressure fell below 45 mm Hg (groups IV, V, and VI), all the animals died, although many of them hovered between life and death for hours before the circulatory system deteriorated to the stage of death.

This experiment demonstrates that the circulatory system can recover as long as the degree of hemorrhage is no greater than a certain critical amount. Crossing this critical threshold by even a few milliliters of blood loss makes the eventual difference between life and death. Thus, hemorrhage beyond a certain critical level causes shock to become progressive. That is, the shock itself causes still
![gu115687650e1](gu115687650e1.jpg)

Figure 24-2 Time course of arterial pressure in dogs after different degrees of acute hemorrhage. Each curve represents average results from six dogs (curves I-VI).
more shock, and the condition becomes a vicious cycle that eventually leads to deterioration of the circulation and to death.

## Nonprogressive Shock-Compensated Shock

If shock is not severe enough to cause its own progression, the person eventually recovers. Therefore, shock of this lesser degree is called nonprogressive shock or compensated shock, meaning that the sympathetic reflexes and other factors compensate enough to prevent further deterioration of the circulation.

The factors that cause a person to recover from moderate degrees of shock are the negative feedback control mechanisms of the circulation that attempt to return cardiac output and arterial pressure back to normal levels. They include the following:

1. Baroreceptor reflexes, which elicit powerful sympathetic stimulation of the circulation
2. Central nervous system ischemic response, which elicits even more powerful sympathetic stimulation throughout the body but is not activated significantly until the arterial pressure falls below 50 mm Hg
3. Reverse stress-relaxation of the circulatory system, which causes the blood vessels to contract around the diminished blood volume so that the blood volume that is available more adequately fills the circulation
4. Increased secretion of renin by the kidneys and formation of angiotensin II, which constricts the peripheral arterioles and also causes decreased output of water and salt by the kidneys, both of which help prevent progression of shock
5. Increased secretion by the posterior pituitary gland of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), which constricts the peripheral arterioles and veins and greatly increases water retention by the kidneys
6. Increased secretion by the adrenal medullae of epinephrine and norepinephrine, which constricts the peripheral arterioles and veins and increases the heart rate
7. Compensatory mechanisms that return the blood volume back toward normal, including absorption of large quantities of fluid from the intestinal tract, absorption of fluid into the blood capillaries from the interstitial spaces of the body, conservation of water and salt by the kidneys, and increased thirst and increased appetite for salt, which make the person drink water and eat salty foods if they are able to do so
The sympathetic reflexes and increased secretion of catecholamines by the adrenal medullae provide rapid help toward bringing about recovery because they become maximally activated within 30 seconds to a few minutes after hemorrhage.

Figure 24-3 Different types of positive feedback that can lead to the progression of shock.
![gu116687650e1](gu116687650e1.jpg)

The angiotensin and vasopressin mechanisms, as well as the reverse stress-relaxation that causes contraction of the blood vessels and venous reservoirs, all require 10 to 60 minutes to respond completely, but they aid greatly in increasing the arterial pressure or increasing the circulatory filling pressure, thereby increasing the return of blood to the heart.

Finally, readjustment of blood volume by absorption of fluid from the interstitial spaces and intestinal tract, as well as oral ingestion and absorption of additional quantities of water and salt, may require from 1 to 48 hours, but recovery eventually takes place, provided the shock does not become severe enough to enter the progressive stage.

## Progressive Shock—Caused by Vicious Cycle of Cardiovascular Deterioration

Figure 24-3 shows some of the positive feedbacks that further depress cardiac output in shock, thus causing the shock to become progressive. Some of the more important feedbacks are described in the following sections.

Cardiac Depression. When the arterial pressure falls low enough, coronary blood flow decreases below that required for adequate nutrition of the myocardium, weakening the heart muscle and decreasing the cardiac output more. Thus, a positive feedback cycle has developed, whereby the shock becomes more and more severe.

Figure 24-4 shows cardiac output curves extrapolated to the human heart from studies in experimental
![gu117687650e1](gu117687650e1.jpg)

animals, demonstrating progressive deterioration of the heart at different times after the onset of shock. An anesthetized animal was bled until the arterial pressure fell to 30 mm Hg , and the pressure was held at this level by further bleeding or retransfusion of blood, as required. Note from the second curve in the figure that there was little deterioration of the heart during the first 2 hours, but by 4 hours, the heart had deteriorated about $40 \%$. Then, rapidly, during the last hour of the experiment (after 4 hours of low coronary blood pressure), the heart deteriorated completely.

Thus, one of the important features of progressive shock, whether it is hemorrhagic in origin or has another cause, is eventual progressive deterioration of the heart. In the early stages of shock, this deterioration plays very little role in the condition of the person, partly because deterioration of the heart is not severe during the first hour or so of shock, but mainly because the heart has reserve capability that normally allows it to pump $300 \%$ to $400 \%$ more blood than is required by the body for adequate tissue nutrition. In the latest stages of shock, however, deterioration of the heart is probably the most important factor in the final lethal progression of the shock.

Vasomotor Failure. In the early stages of shock, various circulatory reflexes cause intense activity of the sympathetic nervous system. This activity helps delay depression of cardiac output and especially helps prevent decreased arterial pressure. However, there comes a point when diminished blood flow to the brain's vasomotor center depresses the center so much that it, too, becomes progressively less active and, finally, totally inactive. For example, during the first 4 to 8 minutes, complete circulatory arrest to the brain causes the most intense of all sympathetic discharges, but by the end of 10 to 15 min utes, the vasomotor center becomes so depressed that no further evidence of sympathetic discharge can be demonstrated. Fortunately, the vasomotor center usually does not fail in the early stages of shock if the arterial pressure remains above 30 mm Hg .

Blockage of Very Small Vessels by Sludged Blood. In time, blockage occurs in many of the very small blood vessels in the circulatory system, and this blockage also causes the shock to progress. The initiating cause of this blockage is sluggish blood flow in the microvessels. Because tissue metabolism continues despite the low flow, large amounts of acid, both carbonic acid and lactic acid, continue to empty into the local blood vessels and greatly increase the local acidity of the blood. This acidic effect, plus other deterioration products from the ischemic tissues, causes local blood agglutination, resulting in minute blood clots and leading to very small plugs in the small vessels. Even if the vessels do not become plugged, an increased tendency for the blood cells to stick to one another makes it more difficult for blood to flow through the microvasculature, giving rise to the term sludged blood.

Increased Capillary Permeability. After many hours of capillary hypoxia and lack of other nutrients, the permeability of the capillaries gradually increases, and large quantities of fluid begin to transude into the tissues. This phenomenon decreases the blood volume even more, with a resultant further decrease in cardiac output, making the shock still more severe. Capillary hypoxia does not cause increased capillary permeability until the late stages of prolonged shock.

Release of Toxins by Ischemic Tissue. Shock has been suggested to cause tissues to release toxic substances, such as histamine, serotonin, and tissue enzymes, that cause further deterioration of the circulatory system. Experimental studies have proved the significance of at least one toxin, endotoxin, in some types of shock.

Cardiac Depression Caused by Endotoxin. Endotoxin is released from the bodies of dead gram-negative bacteria in the intestines. Diminished blood flow to the intestines often causes enhanced formation and absorption of this toxic substance. The circulating toxin then causes increased cellular metabolism, despite inadequate nutrition of the cells, which has a specific effect on the heart muscle, causing cardiac depression. Endotoxin can play a major role in some types of shock, especially septic shock, discussed later in this chapter.

Generalized Cellular Deterioration. As shock becomes severe, many signs of generalized cellular deterioration occur throughout the body. One organ especially affected is the liver, as illustrated in Figure 24-5. The liver is especially affected mainly because of the lack of enough nutrients to support the normally high rate of metabolism in liver cells, but also partly because of the exposure of the liver cells to any vascular toxin or other abnormal metabolic factor occurring in shock.

Among the damaging cellular effects that are known to occur in most body tissues are the following:

1. Active transport of sodium and potassium through the cell membrane is greatly diminished. As a result, sodium and chloride accumulate in the cells, and potassium is lost from the cells. In addition, the cells begin to swell.
![gu118687650e1](gu118687650e1.jpg)

Figure 24-5 Necrosis of the central portion of a liver lobule during severe circulatory shock. (Courtesy Dr. J.W. Crowell.)

2. Mitochondrial activity in the liver cells, as well as in many other tissues of the body, becomes severely depressed.
3. Lysosomes in the cells in widespread tissue areas begin to break open, with intracellular release of hydrolases, which cause further intracellular deterioration.
4. Cellular metabolism of nutrients, such as glucose, eventually becomes greatly depressed in the last stages of shock. The actions of some hormones are depressed as well, including almost $100 \%$ depression of the actions of insulin.
All these effects contribute to further deterioration of many organs of the body, including especially the following: (1) the liver, with depression of its many metabolic and detoxification functions; (2) the lungs, with eventual development of pulmonary edema and poor ability to oxygenate the blood; and (3) the heart, thereby further depressing its contractility.

Patchy Areas of Tissue Necrosis Caused by Patchy Blood Flows in Different Organs. Not all cells of the body are equally damaged by shock because some tissues have better blood supplies than others. For example, the cells adjacent to the arterial ends of capillaries receive better nutrition than cells adjacent to the venous ends of the same capillaries. Therefore, more nutritive deficiency occurs around the venous ends of capillaries than elsewhere. Figure 24-5 shows necrosis in the center of a liver lobule, the portion of the lobule that is the last to be exposed to the blood as it passes through the liver sinusoids.

Similar punctate lesions occur in heart muscle, although here a definite repetitive pattern, such as occurs in the liver, cannot be demonstrated. Nevertheless, the cardiac lesions play an important role in leading to the final irreversible stage of shock. Deteriorative lesions also occur in the kidneys, especially in the epithelium of the kidney tubules, leading to kidney failure and occasionally uremic death several days later. Deterioration of the lungs also often leads to respiratory distress and death several days later, called the shock lung syndrome.

Acidosis in Shock. Metabolic derangements that occur in shocked tissue can lead to acidosis throughout the body. This results from poor delivery of oxygen to the tissues, which greatly diminishes oxidative metabolism of the foodstuffs. When this occurs, the cells obtain most of their energy by the anaerobic process of glycolysis, which leads to excess lactic acid in the blood. In addition, poor blood flow through tissues prevents normal removal of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide reacts locally in the cells with water to form high concentrations of intracellular carbonic acid, which, in turn, reacts with various tissue chemicals to form additional intracellular acidic substances. Thus, another deteriorative effect of shock is generalized and local tissue acidosis, leading to further progression of the shock.

Positive Feedback Deterioration of Tissues in Shock and Vicious Cycle of Progressive Shock. All the factors just discussed that can lead to further progression of shock are types of positive feedback-that is, each increase in the degree of shock causes a further increase in the shock. However, positive feedback does not necessarily lead to a vicious cycle. Development of a vicious cycle depends on the intensity of the positive feedback. In mild degrees of shock, the negative feedback mechanisms of the circulation, including sympathetic reflexes, reverse stress-relaxation mechanism of the blood reservoirs, and absorption of fluid into the blood from the interstitial spaces, can easily overcome the positive feedback influences and, therefore, cause recovery. In severe shock, however, the deteriorative feedback mechanisms become more and more powerful, leading to such rapid deterioration of the circulation that all the normal negative feedback systems of circulatory control acting together cannot return the cardiac output to normal.

Considering once again the principles of positive feedback and vicious cycles discussed in Chapter 1, one can readily understand why there is a critical cardiac output level above which a person in shock recovers and below which a person enters a vicious cycle of circulatory deterioration that proceeds until death.

## IRREVERSIBLE SHOCK

After shock has progressed to a certain stage, transfusion or any other type of therapy becomes incapable of saving the person's life. The person is then said to be in the irreversible stage of shock. Ironically, even in this irreversible stage, therapy can, on rare occasions, return the arterial pressure and even the cardiac output to normal or near normal for short periods, but the circulatory system nevertheless continues to deteriorate, and death ensues in another few minutes to few hours.

Figure 24-6 shows that transfusion during the irreversible stage can sometimes cause cardiac output (as well as the arterial pressure) to return to nearly normal. However, the cardiac output soon begins to fall again, and subsequent transfusions have less and less effect. By this time, multiple deteriorative changes have occurred in the heart
![gu119687650e1](gu119687650e1.jpg)

Figure 24-6 Failure of transfusion to prevent death in irreversible shock.

muscle cells that may not necessarily affect the heart's immediate ability to pump blood but, over a long period, depress heart pumping enough to cause death. Beyond a certain point, so much tissue damage has occurred, so many destructive enzymes have been released into the body fluids, so much acidosis has developed, and so many other destructive factors are now in progress that even a normal cardiac output for a few minutes cannot reverse the continuing deterioration. Therefore, in severe shock, a stage is eventually reached at which the person will die, even though vigorous therapy might still return the cardiac output to normal for short periods.

Depletion of Cellular High-Energy Phosphate Reserves in Irreversible Shock. The high-energy phosphate reserves in the tissues of the body, especially in the liver and heart, are greatly diminished in severe shock. Essentially all the creatine phosphate has been degraded, and almost all the adenosine triphosphate has downgraded to adenosine diphosphate, adenosine monophosphate and, eventually, adenosine. Much of this adenosine then diffuses out of the cells into the circulating blood and is converted into uric acid, a substance that cannot re-enter the cells to reconstitute the adenosine phosphate system. New adenosine can be synthesized at a rate of only about $2 \%$ of the normal cellular amount an hour, meaning that once the high-energy phosphate stores of the cells are depleted, they are difficult to replenish.

Thus, one of the most devastating end results in shock, and the one that is perhaps most significant for development of the final state of irreversibility, is cellular depletion of these high-energy compounds.

## HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK CAUSED BY PLASMA LOSS

Loss of plasma from the circulatory system, even without loss of red blood cells, can sometimes be severe enough to reduce the total blood volume markedly, causing typical hypovolemic shock similar in almost all details to that caused by hemorrhage. Severe plasma loss occurs in the following conditions:

1. Intestinal obstruction may cause severely reduced plasma volume. Distention of the intestine in intestinal obstruction partly blocks venous blood flow in the intestinal walls, which increases intestinal capillary pressure, causing fluid to leak from the capillaries into the intestinal walls and intestinal lumen. Because the lost fluid has high protein content, the result is reduced total blood plasma protein, as well as reduced plasma volume.
2. Severe burns or other denuding conditions of the skin cause loss of plasma through the denuded skin areas so that the plasma volume becomes markedly reduced.
The hypovolemic shock that results from plasma loss has almost the same characteristics as the shock caused
by hemorrhage, except for one additional complicating factor: the blood viscosity increases greatly as a result of increased red blood cell concentration in the remaining blood, and this increase in viscosity exacerbates the sluggishness of blood flow.

Loss of fluid from all fluid compartments of the body is called dehydration; this condition can also reduce the blood volume and cause hypovolemic shock similar to that resulting from hemorrhage. Some of the causes of this type of shock are the following: (1) excessive sweating; (2) fluid loss in severe diarrhea or vomiting; (3) excess loss of fluid by the kidneys; (4) inadequate intake of fluid and electrolytes; or (5) destruction of the adrenal cortices, with loss of aldosterone secretion and consequent failure of the kidneys to reabsorb sodium, chloride, and water, which occurs in the absence of the adrenocortical hormone aldosterone.

## HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK CAUSED BY TRAUMA

One of the most common causes of circulatory shock is trauma to the body. Often, the shock results simply from hemorrhage caused by the trauma, but it can also occur even without hemorrhage because extensive contusion of the body can damage the capillaries sufficiently to allow excessive loss of plasma into the tissues. This phenomenon results in greatly reduced plasma volume, with resultant hypovolemic shock.

Various attempts have been made to implicate toxic factors released by the traumatized tissues as one of the causes of shock after trauma. However, cross-transfusion experiments with normal animals have failed to show significant toxic elements. Traumatic shock, therefore, seems to result mainly from hypovolemia, although there might also be a moderate degree of concomitant neurogenic shock caused by loss of vasomotor tone, as discussed next.

## NEUROGENIC SHOCK-INCREASED VASCULAR CAPACITY

Shock occasionally occurs without any loss of blood volume. Instead, the vascular capacity increases so much that even the normal amount of blood is incapable of filling the circulatory system adequately. One of the major causes of this condition is sudden loss of vasomotor tone throughout the body, resulting especially in massive dilation of the veins. The resulting condition is known as neurogenic shock.

The role of vascular capacity in helping regulate circulatory function was discussed in Chapter 15, where it was noted that an increase in vascular capacity or a decrease in blood volume reduces the mean systemic filling pressure, which reduces venous return to the heart. Diminished venous return caused by vascular dilation is called venous pooling of blood.

Causes of Neurogenic Shock. Some neurogenic factors that can cause loss of vasomotor tone include the following:

1. Deep general anesthesia often depresses the vasomotor center enough to cause vasomotor paralysis, with resulting neurogenic shock.
2. Spinal anesthesia, especially when this extends all the way up the spinal cord, blocks the sympathetic nervous outflow from the nervous system and can be a potent cause of neurogenic shock.
3. Brain damage is often a cause of vasomotor paralysis. Many patients who have had a brain concussion or contusion of the basal regions of the brain experience profound neurogenic shock. Also, even though brain ischemia for a few minutes almost always causes extreme vasomotor stimulation and increased blood pressure, prolonged ischemia (lasting $>5-10$ minutes) can cause the opposite effect-total inactivation of the vasomotor neurons in the brain stem, with a consequent decrease in arterial pressure and development of severe neurogenic shock.

## ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK AND HISTAMINE SHOCK

Anaphylaxis is an allergic condition in which cardiac output and arterial pressure often decrease drastically. This condition is discussed in Chapter 35. It results primarily from an antigen-antibody reaction that rapidly occurs after an antigen to which the person is sensitive enters the circulation. One of the principal effects is to cause the basophils in the blood and mast cells in the pericapillary tissues to release histamine or a histamine-like substance. The histamine causes the following: (1) an increase in vascular capacity because of venous dilation, thus causing a marked decrease in venous return; (2) dilation of the arterioles, resulting in greatly reduced arterial pressure; and (3) greatly increased capillary permeability, with rapid loss of fluid and protein into the tissue spaces. The net effect is a great reduction in venous return and, sometimes, such serious shock that the person may die within minutes.

Intravenous injection of large amounts of histamine causes histamine shock, which has characteristics almost identical to those of anaphylactic shock.

## SEPTIC SHOCK

Septic shock refers to a bacterial infection widely disseminated to many areas of the body, with the infection being carried through the blood from one tissue to another and causing extensive damage. There are many varieties of septic shock because of the many types of bacterial infections that can cause it, and because infection in different parts of the body produces different effects. Most cases of septic shock, however, are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, followed by endotoxin-producing Gram-negative bacteria.

Septic shock is extremely important to the clinician because, other than cardiogenic shock, septic shock is currently the most frequent cause of shock-related death in the hospital.

Some of the typical causes of septic shock include the following:

1. Peritonitis caused by spread of infection from the uterus and fallopian tubes, sometimes resulting from an instrumental abortion performed under unsterile conditions
2. Peritonitis resulting from rupture of the gastrointestinal system, sometimes caused by intestinal disease or by wounds
3. Generalized bodily infection resulting from spread of a skin infection such as streptococcal or staphylococcal infection
4. Generalized gangrenous infection resulting specifically from gas gangrene bacilli, spreading first through peripheral tissues and finally via the blood to the internal organs, especially the liver
5. Infection spreading into the blood from the kidney or urinary tract, often caused by colon bacilli.

Special Features of Septic Shock. Because of the multiple types of septic shock, it is difficult to categorize this condition. The following features are often observed:

1. High fever
2. Often marked vasodilation throughout the body, especially in the infected tissues
3. High cardiac output in perhaps half of patients, caused by arteriolar dilation in the infected tissues and by high metabolic rate and vasodilation elsewhere in the body, resulting from bacterial toxin stimulation of cellular metabolism and from a high body temperature
4. Sludging of the blood, caused by red cell agglutination in response to degenerating tissues
5. Development of micro-blood clots in widespread areas of the body, a condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation; also, this causes the blood clotting factors to be used up, so hemorrhaging occurs in many tissues, especially in the gut wall of the intestinal tract
In early stages of septic shock, the patient usually does not have signs of circulatory collapse but only signs of the bacterial infection. As the infection becomes more severe, the circulatory system usually becomes involved because of direct extension of the infection or secondarily as a result of toxins from the bacteria, with resultant loss of plasma into the infected tissues through deteriorating blood capillary walls. There finally comes a point at which deterioration of the circulation becomes progressive in the same way that progression occurs in all other types of shock. The end stages of septic shock are not greatly different from the end stages of hemorrhagic shock, even though the initiating factors are markedly different in the two conditions.

## PHYSIOLOGY OF TREATMENT IN SHOCK REPLACEMENT THERAPY

Blood and Plasma Transfusion. If a person is in shock caused by hemorrhage, the best possible therapy is usually transfusion of whole blood. If the shock is caused by plasma loss, the best therapy is administration of plasma. When dehydration is the cause, administration of an appropriate electrolyte solution can correct the shock.

Whole blood is not always available, such as under battlefield conditions. Plasma can usually substitute adequately for whole blood because it increases the blood volume and restores normal hemodynamics. Plasma cannot restore a normal hematocrit, but the body can usually stand a decrease in hematocrit to about half of normal before serious consequences result if cardiac output is adequate. Therefore, in emergency conditions, it is reasonable to use plasma in place of whole blood for treatment of hemorrhagic or most other types of hypovolemic shock.

Sometimes, plasma is unavailable. In these cases, various plasma substitutes have been developed that perform almost exactly the same hemodynamic functions as plasma. One of these substitutes is dextran solution.

Dextran Solution as a Plasma Substitute. The principal requirement of a truly effective plasma substitute is that it remain in the circulatory system-that is, it does not filter through the capillary pores into the tissue spaces. In addition, the solution must be nontoxic and must contain appropriate electrolytes to prevent derangement of the body's extracellular fluid electrolytes on administration.

To remain in the circulation, the plasma substitute must contain some substance that has a large enough molecular size to exert colloid osmotic pressure. One substance developed for this purpose is dextran, a large polysaccharide polymer of glucose. Dextrans of appropriate molecular size do not pass through the capillary pores and, therefore, can replace plasma proteins as colloid osmotic agents.

Few toxic reactions have been observed when using purified dextran to provide colloid osmotic pressure; therefore, solutions containing this substance have been used as a substitute for plasma in fluid replacement therapy.

## TREATMENT OF NEUROGENIC AND ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK WITH SYMPATHOMIMETIC DRUGS

A sympathomimetic drug is a drug that mimics sympathetic stimulation. These drugs include norepinephrine, epinephrine, and a large number of long-acting drugs that have the same basic effects as epinephrine and norepinephrine.

In two types of shock, sympathomimetic drugs have proven to be especially beneficial. The first of these is neurogenic shock, in which the sympathetic nervous system is severely depressed. Administering a sympathomimetic
drug takes the place of the diminished sympathetic actions and can often restore full circulatory function.

The second type of shock in which sympathomimetic drugs are valuable is anaphylactic shock, in which excess histamine plays a prominent role. The sympathomimetic drugs have a vasoconstrictor effect that opposes the vasodilating effect of histamine. Therefore, epinephrine, norepinephrine, or other sympathomimetic drugs are often lifesaving.

Sympathomimetic drugs have not proved to be very valuable in hemorrhagic shock. The reason is that in this type of shock, the sympathetic nervous system is almost always maximally activated by the circulatory reflexes; so much norepinephrine and epinephrine are already circulating in the blood that sympathomimetic drugs have essentially no additional beneficial effect.

## OTHER THERAPY

Treatment by the Head-Down Position. When the pressure falls too low in most types of shock, especially in hemorrhagic and neurogenic shock, placing the patient with the head at least 12 inches lower than the feet helps in promoting venous return, thereby also increasing cardiac output. This head-down position is the first essential step in the treatment of many types of shock.

Oxygen Therapy. Because a major deleterious effect of most types of shock is too little delivery of oxygen to the tissues, giving the patient oxygen to breathe can be of benefit in some cases. However, this intervention frequently is far less beneficial than one might expect because the problem in most types of shock is not inadequate oxygenation of the blood by the lungs but inadequate transport of the blood after it is oxygenated.

Treatment With Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoidsadrenal cortex hormones that control glucose metabo-lism-are frequently given to patients in severe shock for several reasons: (1) experiments have shown empirically that glucocorticoids frequently increase the strength of the heart in the late stages of shock; (2) glucocorticoids stabilize lysosomes in tissue cells and thereby prevent the release of lysosomal enzymes into the cytoplasm of the cells, thus preventing deterioration from this source; and (3) glucocorticoids might aid in the metabolism of glucose by the severely damaged cells.

## CIRCULATORY ARREST

A condition closely allied to circulatory shock is circulatory arrest, in which all blood flow stops. This condition can occur, for example, as a result of cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation.

Ventricular fibrillation can usually be stopped by strong electroshock of the heart, the basic principles of which are described in Chapter 13.

In the case of complete cardiac arrest, a normal cardiac rhythm can sometimes be restored by immediately applying cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures while at the same time supplying the patient's lungs with adequate quantities of ventilatory oxygen.

## Effect of Circulatory Arrest on the Brain

A special challenge in circulatory arrest is to prevent detrimental effects of the arrest on the brain. In general, more than 5 to 8 minutes of total circulatory arrest can cause at least some degree of permanent brain damage in more than half of patients. Circulatory arrest for as long as 10 to 15 minutes almost always permanently destroys significant amounts of mental capacity.

For many years, it was thought that this detrimental effect on the brain was caused by the acute cerebral hypoxia that occurs during circulatory arrest. However, experiments have shown that if blood clots are prevented from occurring in the blood vessels of the brain, this will also prevent much of the early deterioration of the brain during circulatory arrest. For example, in animal experiments, all the blood was removed from the animal's blood vessels at the beginning of circulatory arrest and then replaced at the end of circulatory arrest so that no intravascular blood clotting could occur. In this experiment, the brain was usually able to withstand up to 30 minutes of circulatory arrest without permanent brain damage. Also, administration of heparin or streptokinase (to prevent blood coagulation) before cardiac arrest was shown to increase the survivability of the brain up to two to four times longer than usual.

# Regulation of Body Fluid Compartments: Extracellular and Intracellular Fluids; Edema 

The maintenance of a relatively constant volume and stable composition of the body fluids is essential for homeostasis. Some of the most common and important problems in clinical medicine arise because of abnormalities in the control systems that maintain this relative constancy of the body fluids. In this chapter and in the following chapters on the kidneys, we discuss overall regulation of body fluid volume, constituents of the extracellular fluid, acid-base balance, and control of fluid exchange between extracellular and intracellular compartments.

## FLUID INTAKE AND OUTPUT ARE BALANCED DURING STEADY-STATE CONDITIONS

The relative constancy of the body fluids is remarkable, because there is continuous exchange of fluid and solutes with the external environment, as well as within the different body compartments. For example, fluid added to the body is highly variable and must be carefully matched by an equal output of water from the body to prevent body fluid volumes from increasing or decreasing.

## DAILY INTAKE OF WATER

Water is added to the body by two major sources: (1) it is ingested in the form of liquids or water in food, which together normally add about $2100 \mathrm{ml} /$ day to the body fluids; and (2) it is synthesized in the body by oxidation of carbohydrates, adding about $200 \mathrm{ml} /$ day. These mechanisms provide a total water intake of about $2300 \mathrm{ml} /$ day (Table 25-1). However, intake of water is highly variable among different people and even within the same person on different days, depending on climate, habits, and level of physical activity.

## DAILY LOSS OF BODY WATER

Insensible Water Loss. Some water losses cannot be precisely regulated. For example, humans experience continuous water loss by evaporation from the respiratory tract and diffusion through the skin, which together account for about $700 \mathrm{ml} /$ day of water loss under normal conditions. This loss is termed insensible water loss because we
are not consciously aware of it, even though it occurs continually in all living people.

Insensible water loss through the skin occurs independently of sweating and is present even in people who are born without sweat glands; the average water loss by diffusion through the skin is about 300 to $400 \mathrm{ml} /$ day. This loss is minimized by the cholesterol-filled, cornified layer of the skin, which provides a barrier against excessive loss by diffusion. When the cornified layer becomes denuded, as occurs with extensive burns, the rate of evaporation can increase as much as 10 -fold, to 3 to $5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. For this reason, persons with burns must be given large amounts of fluid, usually intravenously, to balance fluid loss.

Insensible water loss through the respiratory tract normally averages about 300 to $400 \mathrm{ml} /$ day. As air enters the respiratory tract, it becomes saturated with moisture to a vapor pressure of about 47 mm Hg before it is expelled. Because the vapor pressure of the inspired air is usually less than 47 mm Hg , water is continuously lost through the lungs with respiration. In cold weather, the atmospheric vapor pressure decreases to nearly 0 , causing an even greater loss of water from the lungs as the temperature decreases. This process explains the dry feeling in the respiratory passages in cold weather.

Fluid Loss in Sweat. The amount of water lost by sweating is highly variable, depending on physical activity and environmental temperature. The volume of sweat normally is about $100 \mathrm{ml} /$ day, but in very hot weather or during heavy exercise, fluid loss in sweat occasionally increases to 1 to $2 \mathrm{~L} /$ hour. This fluid loss would rapidly deplete the body fluids if intake were not also increased by activating the thirst mechanism, as discussed in Chapter 29.

Water Loss in Feces. Only a small amount of water ( $100 \mathrm{ml} /$ day) normally is lost in the feces. This loss can increase to several liters a day in people with severe diarrhea. Therefore, severe diarrhea can be life-threatening if not corrected within a few days.

Water Loss by the Kidneys. The remaining water loss from the body occurs in the urine excreted by the kidneys. Multiple mechanisms control the rate of urine excretion.
