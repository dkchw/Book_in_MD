# Spinal Cord Motor Functions; the Cord Reflexes 

Sensory information is integrated at all levels of the nervous system and causes appropriate motor responses that begin in the spinal cord with relatively simple muscle reflexes, extend into the brain stem with more complicated responses, and finally extend to the cerebrum, where the most complicated muscle skills are controlled.

In this chapter, we discuss spinal cord control of muscle function. Without the special neuronal circuits of the cord, even the most complex motor control systems in the brain could not cause any purposeful muscle movement. For example, there is no neuronal circuit anywhere in the brain that causes the specific to-and-fro movements of the legs that are required in walking. Instead, the circuits for these movements are in the cord, and the brain simply sends command signals to the spinal cord to set into motion the walking process.

Let us not belittle the role of the brain. The brain gives directions that control the sequential cord activities-for example, to promote turning movements when they are required, to lean the body forward during acceleration, to change the movements from walking to jumping as needed, and to monitor continuously and control equilibrium. All this is done through "analytical" and "command" signals generated in the brain. However, the many neuronal circuits of the spinal cord that are the objects of the commands are also required. These circuits provide all but a small fraction of the direct control of the muscles.

## ORGANIZATION OF THE SPINAL CORD FOR MOTOR FUNCTIONS

The cord gray matter is the integrative area for the cord reflexes. Figure 55-1 shows the typical organization of the cord gray matter in a single cord segment. Sensory signals enter the cord almost entirely through the sensory roots, also known as the posterior or dorsal roots. After entering the cord, every sensory signal travels to two separate destinations: one branch of the sensory nerve terminates almost immediately in the gray matter of the cord and elicits local segmental cord reflexes and other local effects; another branch transmits signals to higher
levels of the nervous system-that is, to higher levels in the cord, to the brain stem, or even to the cerebral cortex, as described in earlier chapters.

Each segment of the spinal cord (at the level of each spinal nerve) has several million neurons in its gray matter. Aside from the sensory relay neurons discussed in Chapters 48 and 49, the other neurons are of two types: (1) anterior motor neurons and (2) interneurons.

Anterior Motor Neurons. Located in each segment of the anterior horns of the cord gray matter are several thousand neurons that are 50 to $100 \%$ larger than most of the others and are called anterior motor neurons (Figure 55-2). They give rise to the nerve fibers that leave the cord by way of the anterior roots and directly innervate the skeletal muscle fibers. The neurons are of two types, alpha motor neurons and gamma motor neurons.

![gu028617462c](gu028617462c.jpg)

Figure 55-2. Peripheral sensory fibers and anterior motor neurons innervating skeletal muscle.

Alpha Motor Neurons. The alpha motor neurons give rise to large type A alpha $(\mathrm{A} \alpha)$ motor nerve fibers, averaging 14 micrometers in diameter; these fibers branch many times after they enter the muscle and innervate the large skeletal muscle fibers. Stimulation of a single alpha nerve fiber excites from three to several hundred skeletal muscle fibers, which are collectively called the motor unit. Transmission of nerve impulses into skeletal muscles and their stimulation of the muscle motor units are discussed in Chapters 6 and 7.

Gamma Motor Neurons. Along with the alpha motor neurons, which excite contraction of the skeletal muscle fibers, about one-half as many much smaller gamma motor neurons are located in the spinal cord anterior horns. These gamma motor neurons transmit impulses through much smaller type A gamma ( $\mathrm{A} \gamma$ ) motor nerve fibers, averaging 5 micrometers in diameter, which go to small, special skeletal muscle fibers called intrafusal fibers, shown in Figures 55-2 and 55-3. These fibers constitute the middle of the muscle spindle, which helps control basic muscle "tone," as discussed later in this chapter.

Interneurons. Interneurons are present in all areas of the cord gray matter-in the dorsal horns, the anterior horns, and the intermediate areas between them, as shown in Figure 55-1. These cells are about 30 times as numerous as the anterior motor neurons. They are small and highly excitable, often exhibiting spontaneous activity and capable of firing as rapidly as 1500 times per second. They have many interconnections with one another, and many of them also synapse directly with the anterior motor neurons, as shown in Figure 55-1. The interconnections among the interneurons and anterior motor neurons are responsible for most of the integrative functions of the
spinal cord that are discussed in the remainder of this chapter.

Essentially all the different types of neuronal circuits described in Chapter 47 are found in the interneuron pool of cells of the spinal cord, including diverging, converging, repetitive-discharge, and other types of circuits. In this chapter, we examine many applications of these different circuits in the performance of specific reflex actions by the spinal cord.

Only a few incoming sensory signals from the spinal nerves or signals from the brain terminate directly on the anterior motor neurons. Instead, almost all these signals are transmitted first through interneurons, where they are appropriately processed. Thus, in Figure 55-1, the corticospinal tract from the brain is shown to terminate almost entirely on spinal interneurons, where the signals from this tract are combined with signals from other spinal tracts or spinal nerves before finally converging on the anterior motor neurons to control muscle function.

Renshaw Cells Transmit Inhibitory Signals to Surrounding Motor Neurons. Also located in the anterior horns of the spinal cord, in close association with the motor neurons, are a large number of small neurons called Renshaw cells. Almost immediately after the anterior motor neuron axon leaves the body of the neuron, collateral branches from the axon pass to adjacent Renshaw cells. Renshaw cells are inhibitory cells that transmit inhibitory signals to the surrounding motor neurons. Thus, stimulation of each motor neuron tends to inhibit adjacent motor neurons, an effect called lateral inhibition. The motor system uses this lateral inhibition to focus, or sharpen, its signals in the same way that the sensory system uses the same principle to allow unabated transmission of the primary signal in the desired direction while suppressing the tendency for signals to spread laterally.

Multisegmental Connections From One Spinal Cord Level to Other Levels—Propriospinal Fibers. More than half of all the nerve fibers that ascend and descend in the spinal cord are propriospinal fibers. These fibers run from one segment of the cord to another. In addition, as the sensory fibers enter the cord from the posterior cord roots, they bifurcate and branch both up and down the spinal cord; some of the branches transmit signals to only a segment or two, whereas others transmit signals to many segments. These ascending and descending propriospinal fibers of the cord provide pathways for the multisegmental reflexes described later in this chapter, including reflexes that coordinate simultaneous movements in the forelimbs and hindlimbs.

## MUSCLE SENSORY RECEPTORS— MUSCLE SPINDLES AND GOLGI TENDON ORGANS-AND THEIR ROLES IN MUSCLE CONTROL

Proper control of muscle function requires not only excitation of the muscle by spinal cord anterior motor neurons but also continuous feedback of sensory information

![gu038617462c](gu038617462c.jpg)

Figure 55-3. Muscle spindle, showing its relationship to the large extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers. Note also both motor and sensory innervation of the muscle spindle.
from each muscle to the spinal cord, indicating the functional status of each muscle at each instant. That is, what is the length of the muscle, what is its instantaneous tension, and how rapidly is its length or tension changing? To provide this information, the muscles and their tendons are supplied abundantly with two special types of sensory receptors: (1) muscle spindles (see Figure 55-2), which are distributed throughout the belly of the muscle and send information to the nervous system about muscle length or rate of change of length, and (2) Golgi tendon organs (see Figures 55-2 and 55-8), which are located in the muscle tendons and transmit information about tendon tension or rate of change of tension.

The signals from these two receptors are almost entirely for the purpose of intrinsic muscle control. They operate almost completely at a subconscious level. Even so, they transmit tremendous amounts of information not only to the spinal cord but also to the cerebellum and even to the cerebral cortex, helping these portions of the nervous system function to control muscle contraction.

## RECEPTOR FUNCTION OF THE MUSCLE SPINDLE

Structure and Motor Innervation of the Muscle Spindle. The organization of the muscle spindle is shown in Figure 55-3. Each spindle is 3 to 10 millimeters long. It is built around 3 to 12 tiny intrafusal muscle fibers that are pointed at their ends and attached to the glycocalyx of the surrounding large extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers (Video 55-1).

Each intrafusal muscle fiber is a tiny skeletal muscle fiber. However, the central region of each of these fibersthat is, the area midway between its two ends-has few or no actin and myosin filaments. Therefore, this central portion does not contract when the ends do. Instead, it functions as a sensory receptor, as described later. The end portions that do contract are excited by small gamma motor nerve fibers that originate from small type A gamma motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord,
![gu048617462c](gu048617462c.jpg)

Figure 55-4. Details of nerve connections from the nuclear bag and nuclear chain muscle spindle fibers. (Modified from Stein RB: Peripheral control of movement. Physiol Rev 54:225, 1974.)
as described earlier. These gamma motor nerve fibers are also called gamma efferent fibers, in contradistinction to the large alpha efferent fibers (type $A \alpha$ nerve fibers) that innervate the extrafusal skeletal muscle.
Sensory Innervation of the Muscle Spindle. The receptor portion of the muscle spindle is its central portion. As shown in Figure 55-3 and in more detail in Figure 554, sensory fibers originate in this area and are stimulated by stretching of this midportion of the spindle. One can readily see that the muscle spindle receptor can be excited in two ways:

1. Lengthening the whole muscle stretches the midportion of the spindle and, therefore, excites the receptor.
2. Even if the length of the entire muscle does not change, contraction of the end portions of the spindle's intrafusal fibers stretches the midportion of the spindle and therefore excites the receptor.
Two types of sensory endings, the primary afferent and secondary afferent endings, are found in this central receptor area of the muscle spindle.
Primary Ending. In the center of the receptor area, a large sensory nerve fiber encircles the central portion of each intrafusal fiber, forming the primary afferent ending or annulospiral ending. This nerve fiber is a type Ia fiber averaging 17 micrometers in diameter, and it transmits sensory signals to the spinal cord at a velocity of 70 to 120 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}$, as rapidly as any type of nerve fiber in the entire body.
Secondary Ending. Usually one but sometimes two smaller sensory nerve fibers-type II fibers with an average diameter of 8 micrometers-innervate the receptor region on one or both sides of the primary ending, as shown in Figures 55-3 and 55-4. This sensory ending is called the secondary afferent ending; sometimes it encircles the intrafusal fibers in the same way as the type Ia fiber, but often it spreads like branches on a bush.
Division of the Intrafusal Fibers Into Nuclear Bag and Nuclear Chain Fibers-Dynamic and Static Responses of the Muscle Spindle. There are also two types of muscle spindle intrafusal fibers: (1) nuclear bag muscle fibers (one to three in each spindle), in which several muscle

fiber nuclei are congregated in expanded "bags" in the central portion of the receptor area, as shown by the top fiber in Figure 55-4, and (2) nuclear chain fibers (three to nine), which are about half as large in diameter and half as long as the nuclear bag fibers and have nuclei aligned in a chain throughout the receptor area, as shown by the bottom fiber in the figure. The primary sensory nerve ending is excited by both the nuclear bag intrafusal fibers and the nuclear chain fibers. Conversely, the secondary ending is usually excited only by nuclear chain fibers. These relations are shown in Figure 55-4.

## The Primary and the Secondary Endings Both Respond to the Length of the Receptor-"Static" Response.

When the receptor portion of the muscle spindle is stretched slowly, the number of impulses transmitted from both the primary and the secondary endings increases almost directly in proportion to the degree of stretching, and the endings continue to transmit these impulses for several minutes. This effect is called the static response of the spindle receptor, meaning that both the primary and secondary endings continue to transmit their signals for at least several minutes if the muscle spindle remains stretched.

## The Primary Ending (but Not the Secondary Ending) Responds to Rate of Change of Receptor Length-

"Dynamic" Response. When the length of the spindle receptor increases suddenly, the primary ending (but not the secondary ending) is stimulated powerfully. This stimulus of the primary ending is called the dynamic response, which means that the primary ending responds extremely actively to a rapid rate of change in spindle length. Even when the length of a spindle receptor increases only a fraction of a micrometer for only a fraction of a second, the primary receptor transmits tremendous numbers of excess impulses to the large 17-micrometer sensory nerve fiber, but only while the length is actually increasing. As soon as the length stops increasing, this extra rate of impulse discharge returns to the level of the much smaller static response that is still present in the signal.

Conversely, when the spindle receptor shortens, exactly opposite sensory signals occur. Thus, the primary ending sends extremely strong signals, either positive or negative, to the spinal cord to apprise it of any change in length of the spindle receptor.

Control of Intensity of the Static and Dynamic Responses by the Gamma Motor Nerves. The gamma motor nerves to the muscle spindle can be divided into two types: gamma-dynamic (gamma-d) and gammastatic (gamma-s). The first of these gamma motor nerves excites mainly the nuclear bag intrafusal fibers, and the second excites mainly the nuclear chain intrafusal fibers. When the gamma-d fibers excite the nuclear bag fibers, the dynamic response of the muscle spindle becomes tremendously enhanced, whereas the static response is hardly affected. Conversely, stimulation of the gamma-s fibers, which excite the nuclear chain fibers, enhances the static

response while having little influence on the dynamic response. Subsequent paragraphs illustrate that these two types of muscle spindle responses are important in different types of muscle control.

## Continuous Discharge of the Muscle Spindles Under

Normal Conditions. Normally, when there is some degree of gamma nerve excitation, the muscle spindles emit sensory nerve impulses continuously. Stretching the muscle spindles increases the rate of firing, whereas shortening the spindle decreases the rate of firing. Thus, the spindles can send to the spinal cord either positive signals (increased numbers of impulses to indicate stretch of a muscle) or negative signals (reduced numbers of impulses) to indicate that the muscle is unstretched.

## MUSCLE STRETCH REFLEX

The simplest manifestation of muscle spindle function is the muscle stretch reflex. Whenever a muscle is stretched suddenly, excitation of the spindles causes reflex contraction of the large skeletal muscle fibers of the stretched muscle and of closely allied synergistic muscles.

## Neuronal Circuitry of the Stretch Reflex. Figure 55-

5 demonstrates the basic circuit of the muscle spindle stretch reflex, showing a type Ia proprioceptor nerve fiber originating in a muscle spindle and entering a dorsal root of the spinal cord. A branch of this fiber then goes directly to the anterior horn of the cord gray matter and synapses with anterior motor neurons that send motor nerve fibers back to the same muscle from which the muscle spindle fiber originated. Thus, this monosynaptic pathway allows a reflex signal to return with the shortest possible time delay back to the muscle after excitation of the spindle. Most type II fibers from the muscle spindle terminate on multiple interneurons in the cord gray matter, and these transmit delayed signals to the anterior motor neurons or serve other functions.

Dynamic Stretch Reflex and Static Stretch Reflexes. The stretch reflex can be divided into two components: the dynamic stretch reflex and the static stretch reflex. The dynamic stretch reflex is elicited by potent dynamic signals transmitted from the primary sensory endings of the muscle spindles, caused by rapid stretch or unstretch. That is, when a muscle is suddenly stretched or unstretched, a strong signal is transmitted to the spinal cord, which causes an instantaneous strong reflex contraction (or decrease in contraction) of the same muscle from which the signal originated. Thus, the reflex functions to oppose sudden changes in muscle length.

The dynamic stretch reflex is over within a fraction of a second after the muscle has been stretched (or unstretched) to its new length, but then a weaker static stretch reflex continues for a prolonged period thereafter. This reflex is elicited by the continuous static receptor signals transmitted by both primary and secondary endings. The importance of the static stretch reflex is that it causes the degree of muscle contraction to remain reasonably constant, except when the person's nervous system specifically wills otherwise.

## "Damping" Function of the Dynamic and Static Stretch Reflexes in Smoothing Muscle Contraction.

An especially important function of the stretch reflex is its ability to prevent oscillation or jerkiness of body movements, which is a damping, or smoothing, function.

Signals from the spinal cord are often transmitted to a muscle in an unsmooth form, increasing in intensity for a few milliseconds, then decreasing in intensity, then changing to another intensity level, and so forth. When the muscle spindle apparatus is not functioning satisfactorily, the muscle contraction is jerky during the course of such a signal. This effect is demonstrated in Figure 55-6. In part A, the muscle spindle reflex of the excited muscle is intact. Note that the contraction is relatively smooth, even though the motor nerve to the muscle is excited at a slow frequency of only eight signals per second. Part B illustrates the same experiment in an animal whose muscle spindle sensory nerves had been sectioned 3 months earlier. Note the unsmooth muscle contraction. Thus, Figure 55-6A graphically demonstrates the damping mechanism's ability to smooth muscle contractions, even though the primary input signals to the muscle motor system may themselves be jerky. This effect can also be called a signal averaging function of the muscle spindle reflex.

## ROLE OF THE MUSCLE SPINDLE IN VOLUNTARY MOTOR ACTIVITY

To understand the importance of the gamma efferent system, one should recognize that $31 \%$ of all the motor nerve fibers to the muscle are the small type A gamma efferent fibers rather than large type A alpha motor fibers. Whenever signals are transmitted from the motor cortex or from any other area of the brain to the alpha motor neurons, in most instances the gamma motor neurons are
![gu068617462c](gu068617462c.jpg)

Figure 55-6. Muscle contraction caused by a spinal cord signal under two conditions. Depicted are curve $A$, in a normal muscle, and curve B, in a muscle whose muscle spindles were denervated by section of the posterior roots of the cord 82 days previously. Note the smoothing effect of the muscle spindle reflex in curve A. (Modified from Creed RS, Denney-Brown D, Eccles JC, et al: Reflex Activity of the Spinal Cord. New York: Oxford University Press, 1932.)
stimulated simultaneously, an effect called coactivation of the alpha and gamma motor neurons. This effect causes both the extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers and the muscle spindle intrafusal muscle fibers to contract at the same time.

The purpose of contracting the muscle spindle intrafusal fibers at the same time that the large skeletal muscle fibers contract is twofold: First, it keeps the length of the receptor portion of the muscle spindle from changing during the course of the whole muscle contraction. Therefore, coactivation keeps the muscle spindle reflex from opposing the muscle contraction. Second, it maintains the proper damping function of the muscle spindle, regardless of any change in muscle length. For instance, if the muscle spindle did not contract and relax along with the large muscle fibers, the receptor portion of the spindle would sometimes be flail and sometimes be overstretched, in neither instance operating under optimal conditions for spindle function.

## Brain Areas for Control of the Gamma Motor System

The gamma efferent system is excited specifically by signals from the bulboreticular facilitatory region of the brain stem and, secondarily, by impulses transmitted into the bulboreticular area from the following: (1) the cerebellum; (2) the basal ganglia; and (3) the cerebral cortex.

Because the bulboreticular facilitatory area is particularly concerned with antigravity contractions, and because the antigravity muscles have an especially high density of muscle spindles, the gamma efferent mechanism is believed to be important for damping the movements of the different body parts during walking and running.
The Muscle Spindle System Stabilizes Body Position During Tense Action. One of the most important functions of the muscle spindle system is to stabilize body position during tense motor action. To perform this function,

the bulboreticular facilitatory region and its allied areas of the brain stem transmit excitatory signals through the gamma nerve fibers to the intrafusal muscle fibers of the muscle spindles. This action shortens the ends of the spindles and stretches the central receptor regions, thus increasing their signal output. However, if the spindles on both sides of each joint are activated at the same time, reflex excitation of the skeletal muscles on both sides of the joint also increases, producing tight, tense muscles opposing each other at the joint. The net effect is that the position of the joint becomes strongly stabilized, and any force that tends to move the joint from its current position is opposed by highly sensitized stretch reflexes operating on both sides of the joint.

Any time a person must perform a muscle function that requires a high degree of delicate and exact positioning, excitation of the appropriate muscle spindles by signals from the bulboreticular facilitatory region of the brain stem stabilizes the positions of the major joints. This stabilization aids tremendously in performing the additional detailed voluntary movements (of fingers or other body parts) required for intricate motor procedures.

## Clinical Applications of the Stretch Reflex

Almost every time a clinician performs a physical examination on a patient, he or she elicits multiple stretch reflexes. The purpose is to determine how much background excitation, or "tone," the brain is sending to the spinal cord. This reflex is elicited as follows.

Knee Jerk and Other Muscle Jerks Can Be Used to Assess Sensitivity of Stretch Reflexes. Clinically, a method used to determine the sensitivity of the stretch reflexes is to elicit the knee jerk and other muscle jerks. The knee jerk can be elicited by simply striking the patellar tendon lightly with a reflex hammer; this action instantaneously stretches the quadriceps muscle and excites a dynamic stretch reflex that causes the lower leg to "jerk" forward (Video 55-2). The upper part of Figure 55-7 shows a myogram from the quadriceps muscle recorded during a knee jerk.

Similar reflexes can be obtained from almost any muscle of the body either by striking the tendon of the muscle or by striking the belly of the muscle itself. In other words, sudden stretch of muscle spindles is all that is required to elicit a dynamic stretch reflex.

The muscle jerks are used by neurologists to assess the degree of facilitation of spinal cord centers. When large numbers of facilitatory impulses are being transmitted from the upper regions of the central nervous system into the cord, the muscle jerks are greatly exaggerated. Conversely, if the facilitatory impulses are depressed or abrogated, the muscle jerks are considerably weakened or absent. These reflexes are used most frequently in determining the presence or absence of muscle spasticity caused by lesions in the motor areas of the brain or diseases that excite the bulboreticular facilitatory area of the brain stem. Ordinarily, large lesions in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex but not in the lower motor control areas (especially lesions caused by strokes or brain tumors) cause greatly exaggerated muscle jerks in the muscles on the opposite side of the body.
![gu078617462c](gu078617462c.jpg)

Figure 55-7. Myograms recorded from the quadriceps muscle during elicitation of the knee jerk (above) and from the gastrocnemius muscle during ankle clonus (below).

Clonus-Oscillation of Muscle Jerks. Under some conditions, the muscle jerks can oscillate, a phenomenon called clonus (see lower myogram, Figure 55-7). Oscillation can be explained particularly well in relation to ankle clonus, as follows.

If a person standing on the tip ends of the feet suddenly drops his or her body downward and stretches the gastrocnemius muscles, stretch reflex impulses are transmitted from the muscle spindles into the spinal cord. These impulses reflexively excite the stretched muscle, which lifts the body up again. After a fraction of a second, the reflex contraction of the muscle dies out and the body falls again, thus stretching the spindles a second time. Again, a dynamic stretch reflex lifts the body, but this too dies out after a fraction of a second, and the body falls once more to begin a new cycle. In this way, the stretch reflex of the gastrocnemius muscle continues to oscillate, often for long periods, which is clonus.

Clonus ordinarily occurs only when the stretch reflex is highly sensitized by facilitatory impulses from the brain. For instance, in a decerebrate animal in which the stretch reflexes are highly facilitated, clonus develops readily. To determine the degree of facilitation of the spinal cord, neurologists test patients for clonus by suddenly stretching a muscle and applying a steady stretching force to it. If clonus occurs, the degree of facilitation is certain to be high.

## GOLGI TENDON REFLEX

Golgi Tendon Organ Helps Control Muscle Tension. The Golgi tendon organ, shown in Figure 55-8, is an encapsulated sensory receptor through which muscle tendon fibers pass. About 10 to 15 muscle fibers are usually connected to each Golgi tendon organ, and the organ is stimulated when this small bundle of muscle fibers is "tensed" by contracting or stretching the muscle. Thus, the major difference in excitation of the Golgi tendon organ versus the muscle spindle is that the spindle detects muscle length and changes in muscle length, whereas the tendon organ detects muscle tension as reflected by the tension in itself.

The tendon organ, like the primary receptor of the muscle spindle, has both a dynamic response and a static response, reacting intensely when the muscle tension

![gu088617462c](gu088617462c.jpg)

Figure 55-8. Golgi tendon reflex. Excessive tension of the muscle stimulates sensory receptors in the Golgi tendon organ. Signals from the receptors are transmitted through a sensory afferent nerve fiber that excites an inhibitory interneuron in the spinal cord, inhibiting anterior motor neuron activity, causing muscle relaxation, and protecting the muscle against excessive tension.
suddenly increases (the dynamic response) but settling down within a fraction of a second to a lower level of steady-state firing that is almost directly proportional to the muscle tension (the static response). Thus, Golgi tendon organs provide the nervous system with instantaneous information on the degree of tension in each small segment of each muscle.

Transmission of Impulses From the Tendon Organ Into the Central Nervous System. Signals from the tendon organ are transmitted through large, rapidly conducting type Ib nerve fibers that average 16 micrometers in diameter, only slightly smaller than those from the primary endings of the muscle spindle. These fibers, like those from the primary spindle endings, transmit signals into local areas of the cord and, after synapsing in a dorsal horn of the cord, through long fiber pathways such as the spinocerebellar tracts into the cerebellum and through still other tracts to the cerebral cortex. The local cord signal excites a single inhibitory interneuron that inhibits the anterior motor neuron. This local circuit directly inhibits the individual muscle without affecting adjacent muscles. The relation between signals to the brain and function of the cerebellum and other parts of the brain for muscle control is discussed in Chapter 57.

## The Tendon Reflex Prevents Excessive Tension on the

Muscle. When the Golgi tendon organs of a muscle tendon are stimulated by increased tension in the connecting muscle, signals are transmitted to the spinal cord to cause
reflex effects in the respective muscle. This reflex is entirely inhibitory. Thus, this reflex provides a negative feedback mechanism that prevents the development of too much tension on the muscle.

When tension on the muscle-and therefore on the tendon-becomes extreme, the inhibitory effect from the tendon organ can be so great that it leads to a sudden reaction in the spinal cord that causes instantaneous relaxation of the entire muscle. This effect is called the lengthening reaction; it is probably a protective mechanism to prevent tearing of the muscle or avulsion of the tendon from its attachments to the bone.

Possible Role of the Tendon Reflex to Equalize Contractile Force Among the Muscle Fibers. Another likely function of the Golgi tendon reflex is to equalize contractile forces of the separate muscle fibers. That is, the fibers that exert excess tension become inhibited by the reflex, whereas those that exert too little tension become more excited because of the absence of reflex inhibition. This phenomenon spreads the muscle load over all the fibers and prevents damage in isolated areas of a muscle where small numbers of fibers might be overloaded.

## Function of the Muscle Spindles and Golgi Tendon Organs in Motor Control by Higher Levels of the Brain

Although we have emphasized the function of the muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs in spinal cord control of motor function, these two sensory organs also apprise the higher motor control centers of instantaneous changes taking place in the muscles. For instance, the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts carry instantaneous information from the muscle spindles and the Golgi tendon organs directly to the cerebellum at conduction velocities approaching $120 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$, the most rapid conduction anywhere in the brain or spinal cord. Additional pathways transmit similar information into the reticular regions of the brain stem and, to a lesser extent, all the way to the motor areas of the cerebral cortex. As discussed in Chapters 56 and 57, the information from these receptors is crucial for feedback control of motor signals that originate in all these areas.

## FLEXOR REFLEX AND THE WITHDRAWAL REFLEXES

In the spinal or decerebrate animal, almost any type of cutaneous sensory stimulus from a limb is likely to cause the flexor muscles of the limb to contract, thereby withdrawing the limb from the stimulating object. This reflex is called the flexor reflex.

In its classic form, the flexor reflex is elicited most powerfully by stimulation of pain endings, such as by a pinprick, heat, or a wound, for which reason it is also called a nociceptive reflex, or simply a pain reflex. Stimulation of touch receptors can also elicit a weaker and less prolonged flexor reflex.

![gu098617462c](gu098617462c.jpg)

Figure 55-9. Flexor reflex, crossed extensor reflex, and reciprocal inhibition.

If some part of the body other than one of the limbs is painfully stimulated, that part will similarly be withdrawn from the stimulus, but the reflex may not be confined to flexor muscles, even though it is basically the same type of reflex. Therefore, the many patterns of these reflexes in the different areas of the body are called withdrawal reflexes.

Neuronal Mechanism of the Flexor Reflex. The lefthand portion of Figure 55-9 shows the neuronal pathways for the flexor reflex. In this instance, a painful stimulus is applied to the hand; as a result, the flexor muscles of the upper arm become excited and withdraw the hand from the painful stimulus.

The pathways for eliciting the flexor reflex do not pass directly to the anterior motor neurons but instead pass first into the spinal cord interneuron pool of neurons and only secondarily to the motor neurons. The shortest possible circuit is a three- or four-neuron pathway; however, most of the signals of the reflex traverse many more neurons and involve the following basic types of circuits: (1) diverging circuits to spread the reflex to the necessary muscles for withdrawal; (2) circuits to inhibit the antagonist muscles, called reciprocal inhibition circuits; and (3) circuits to cause afterdischarge that lasts many fractions of a second after the stimulus is over.

Figure 55-10 shows a typical myogram from a flexor muscle during a flexor reflex. Within a few milliseconds
![gu108617462c](gu108617462c.jpg)

Figure 55-10. Myogram of the flexor reflex showing rapid onset of the reflex, an interval of fatigue and, finally, afterdischarge after the input stimulus is over.
after a pain sensory nerve begins to be stimulated, the flexor response appears. Then, in the next few seconds, the reflex begins to fatigue, which is characteristic of essentially all complex integrative reflexes of the spinal cord. Finally, after the stimulus is over, the contraction of the muscle returns toward the baseline, but because of afterdischarge, it takes many milliseconds for this contraction to occur. The duration of afterdischarge depends on the intensity of the sensory stimulus that elicited the reflex; a weak tactile stimulus causes almost no afterdischarge, but after a strong pain stimulus, the afterdischarge may last for a second or more.

The afterdischarge that occurs in the flexor reflex almost certainly results from both types of repetitive discharge circuits discussed in Chapter 47. Electrophysiological studies indicate that immediate afterdischarge, lasting for about 6 to 8 milliseconds, results from repetitive firing of the excited interneurons. Also, prolonged afterdischarge occurs after strong pain stimuli, almost certainly resulting from recurrent pathways that initiate oscillation in reverberating interneuron circuits. These, in turn, transmit impulses to the anterior motor neurons, sometimes for several seconds after the incoming sensory signal is over.

Thus, the flexor reflex is appropriately organized to withdraw a pained or otherwise irritated part of the body from a stimulus. Further, because of afterdischarge, the reflex can hold the irritated part away from the stimulus for 0.1 to 3 seconds after the irritation is over. During this time, other reflexes and actions of the central nervous system can move the entire body away from the painful stimulus.

Pattern of Withdrawal During Flexor Reflex. The pattern of withdrawal that results when the flexor reflex is elicited depends on which sensory nerve is stimulated. Thus, a pain stimulus on the inward side of the arm elicits not only contraction of the flexor muscles of the arm but also contraction of abductor muscles to pull the arm outward. In other words, the cord integrative centers cause contraction of the muscles that can most effectively remove the pained part of the body away from the object causing the pain. Although this principle applies to any part of the body, it is especially

![gu118617462c](gu118617462c.jpg)

Figure 55-11. Myogram of a crossed extensor reflex showing slow onset but prolonged afterdischarge.
applicable to the limbs because of their highly developed flexor reflexes.

## CROSSED EXTENSOR REFLEX

About 0.2 to 0.5 second after a stimulus elicits a flexor reflex in one limb, the opposite limb begins to extend. This reflex is called the crossed extensor reflex. Extension of the opposite limb can push the entire body away from the object that is causing the painful stimulus in the withdrawn limb.

## Neuronal Mechanism of the Crossed Extensor Reflex.

The right-hand portion of Figure 55-9 shows the neuronal circuit responsible for the crossed extensor reflex, demonstrating that signals from sensory nerves cross to the opposite side of the cord to excite extensor muscles. Because the crossed extensor reflex usually does not begin until 200 to 500 milliseconds after onset of the initial pain stimulus, it is certain that many interneurons are involved in the circuit between the incoming sensory neuron and the motor neurons of the opposite side of the cord responsible for the crossed extension. After the painful stimulus is removed, the crossed extensor reflex has an even longer period of afterdischarge than does the flexor reflex. Again, it is presumed that this prolonged afterdischarge results from reverberating circuits among the interneuronal cells.

Figure 55-11 shows a typical myogram recorded from a muscle involved in a crossed extensor reflex. This myogram demonstrates the relatively long latency before the reflex begins and the long afterdischarge at the end of the stimulus. The prolonged afterdischarge is of benefit in holding the pained area of the body away from the painful object until other nervous reactions cause the entire body to move away.

## RECIPROCAL INHIBITION AND RECIPROCAL INNERVATION

We previously pointed out that excitation of one group of muscles is often associated with inhibition of another group. For instance, when a stretch reflex excites one muscle, it often simultaneously inhibits the antagonist muscles, which is the phenomenon of reciprocal
![gu128617462c](gu128617462c.jpg)

Figure 55-12. Myogram of a flexor reflex showing reciprocal inhibition caused by an inhibitory stimulus from a stronger flexor reflex on the opposite side of the body.
inhibition, and the neuronal circuit that causes this reciprocal relation is called reciprocal innervation. Likewise, reciprocal relations often exist between the muscles on the two sides of the body, as exemplified by the flexor and extensor muscle reflexes described earlier.

Figure 55-12 shows a typical example of reciprocal inhibition. In this instance, a moderate but prolonged flexor reflex is elicited from one limb of the body; while this reflex is still being elicited, a stronger flexor reflex is elicited in the limb on the opposite side of the body. This stronger reflex sends reciprocal inhibitory signals to the first limb and depresses its degree of flexion. Finally, removal of the stronger reflex allows the original reflex to reassume its previous intensity.

## REFLEXES OF POSTURE AND LOCOMOTION

## POSTURAL AND LOCOMOTIVE REFLEXES OF THE CORD

Positive Supportive Reaction. Pressure on the footpad of a decerebrate animal causes the limb to extend against the pressure applied to the foot. Indeed, this reflex is so strong that if an animal whose spinal cord has been transected for several months-after the reflexes have become exaggerated-is placed on its feet, the reflex often stiffens the limbs sufficiently to support the weight of the body. This reflex is called the positive supportive reaction.

The positive supportive reaction involves a complex circuit in the interneurons similar to the circuits responsible for the flexor and crossed extensor reflexes. The locus of the pressure on the pad of the foot determines the direction in which the limb will extend; pressure on one side causes extension in that direction, an effect called the magnet reaction. This reaction helps keep an animal from falling to that side.
Cord "Righting" Reflexes. When a spinal animal is laid on its side, it will make uncoordinated movements to try to raise itself to the standing position. This reflex is called the cord righting reflex. Such a reflex demonstrates that some relatively complex reflexes associated with posture are integrated in the spinal cord. Indeed, an animal with

a well-healed transected thoracic cord between the levels for forelimb and hindlimb innervation can right itself from the lying position and even walk using its hindlimbs in addition to its forelimbs. In the case of an opossum with a similar transection of the thoracic cord, the walking movements of the hindlimbs are hardly different from those in a normal opossum, except that the hindlimb walking movements are not synchronized with those of the forelimbs.

## STEPPING AND WALKING MOVEMENTS

## Rhythmical Stepping Movements of a Single Limb.

Rhythmical stepping movements are frequently observed in the limbs of spinal animals. Indeed, even when the lumbar portion of the spinal cord is separated from the remainder of the cord and a longitudinal section is made down the center of the cord to block neuronal connections between the two sides of the cord and between the two limbs, each hindlimb can still perform individual stepping functions. Forward flexion of the limb is followed a second or so later by backward extension. Then flexion occurs again, and the cycle is repeated over and over.

This oscillation back and forth between flexor and extensor muscles can occur even after the sensory nerves have been cut, and it seems to result mainly from mutually reciprocal inhibition circuits within the matrix of the cord, oscillating between the neurons controlling agonist and antagonist muscles.

The sensory signals from the footpads and from the position sensors around the joints play a strong role in controlling foot pressure and frequency of stepping when the foot is allowed to walk along a surface. In fact, the cord mechanism for control of stepping can be even more complex. For instance, if the top of the foot encounters an obstruction during forward thrust, the forward thrust will stop temporarily; then, in rapid sequence, the foot will be lifted higher and proceed forward to be placed over the obstruction. This is the stumble reflex. Thus, the cord is an intelligent walking controller.

Reciprocal Stepping of Opposite Limbs. If the lumbar spinal cord is not split down its center, every time stepping occurs in the forward direction in one limb, the opposite limb ordinarily moves backward. This effect results from reciprocal innervation between the two limbs.

Diagonal Stepping of All Four Limbs-"Mark Time" Reflex. If a well-healed spinal animal (with spinal transection in the neck above the forelimb area of the cord) is held up from the floor and its legs are allowed to dangle, the stretch on the limbs occasionally elicits stepping reflexes that involve all four limbs. In general, stepping occurs diagonally between the forelimbs and hindlimbs. This diagonal response is another manifestation of reciprocal innervation, this time occurring the entire dis-
tance up and down the cord between the forelimbs and hindlimbs. Such a walking pattern is called a mark time reflex.

## Scratch Reflex

An especially important cord reflex in some animals is the scratch reflex, which is initiated by an itch or tickle sensation. This reflex involves two functions: (1) a position sense that allows the paw to find the exact point of irritation on the surface of the body; and (2) a to-and-fro scratching movement.

The position sense of the scratch reflex is a highly developed function. If a flea is crawling as far forward as the shoulder of a spinal animal, the hind paw can still find its position, even though 19 muscles in the limb must be contracted simultaneously in a precise pattern to bring the paw to the position of the crawling flea. To make the reflex even more complicated, when the flea crosses the midline, the first paw stops scratching and the opposite paw begins the to-and-fro motion and eventually finds the flea.

The to-and-fro movement, like the stepping movements of locomotion, involves reciprocal innervation circuits that cause oscillation.

## Spinal Cord Reflexes That Cause Muscle Spasm

In human beings, local muscle spasm is often observed. In many if not most instances, localized pain is the cause of the local spasm.

Muscle Spasm Resulting From a Broken Bone. One type of clinically important spasm occurs in muscles that surround a broken bone. The spasm results from pain impulses initiated from the broken edges of the bone, which cause the muscles that surround the area to contract tonically. Pain relief obtained by injecting a local anesthetic at the broken edges of the bone relieves the spasm; a deep general anesthetic of the entire body, such as ether anesthesia, also relieves the spasm.

Abdominal Muscle Spasm in Persons With Peritonitis. Another type of local spasm caused by cord reflexes is abdominal spasm resulting from irritation of the parietal peritoneum by peritonitis. Here again, relief of the pain caused by the peritonitis allows the spastic muscle to relax. The same type of spasm often occurs during surgical operations; for instance, during abdominal operations, pain impulses from the parietal peritoneum often cause the abdominal muscles to contract extensively, sometimes extruding the intestines through the surgical wound. For this reason, deep anesthesia is usually required for intraabdominal operations.

Muscle Cramps. Another type of local spasm is the typical muscle cramp. Any local irritating factor or metabolic abnormality of a muscle, such as severe cold, lack of blood flow, or overexercise, can elicit pain or other sensory signals transmitted from the muscle to the spinal cord, which in turn cause reflex feedback muscle contraction. The contraction is believed to stimulate the same sensory receptors even more, which causes the spinal cord to increase the intensity of contraction. Thus, positive feedback develops, so a small amount of initial irritation causes more and more contraction until a full-blown muscle cramp ensues.

## Autonomic Reflexes in the Spinal Cord

Many types of segmental autonomic reflexes are integrated in the spinal cord, most of which are discussed in other chapters. Briefly, these reflexes include (1) changes in vascular tone resulting from changes in local skin heat (see Chapter 74); (2) sweating, which results from localized heat on the surface of the body (see Chapter 74); (3) intestinointestinal reflexes that control some motor functions of the gut (see Chapter 63); (4) peritoneointestinal reflexes that inhibit gastrointestinal motility in response to peritoneal irritation (see Chapter 67); and (5) evacuation reflexes for emptying the full bladder (see Chapter 26) or the colon (see Chapter 64). In addition, all the segmental reflexes can at times be elicited simultaneously in the form of the so-called mass reflex, described next.

Mass Reflex. In a spinal animal or person, sometimes the spinal cord suddenly becomes excessively active, causing massive discharge in large portions of the cord. The usual stimulus that causes this excess activity is a strong pain stimulus to the skin or excessive filling of a viscus, such as overdistention of the bladder or the gut. Regardless of the type of stimulus, the resulting reflex, called the mass reflex, involves large portions or even all of the cord. The effects are as follows: (1) a major portion of the body's skeletal muscles goes into strong flexor spasm; (2) the colon and bladder are likely to evacuate; (3) the arterial pressure often rises to maximal values, sometimes to a systolic pressure well over 200 mm Hg ; and (4) large areas of the body break out into profuse sweating.

Because the mass reflex can last for minutes, it presumably results from activation of large numbers of reverberating circuits that excite large areas of the cord at once. This mechanism is similar to the mechanism of epileptic seizures, which involve reverberating circuits that occur in the brain instead of in the cord.

## Spinal Cord Transection and Spinal Shock

When the spinal cord is suddenly transected in the upper neck, essentially all cord functions, including the cord reflexes, immediately become depressed to the point of total silence, a reaction called spinal shock. The reason for this reaction is that normal activity of the cord neurons depends to a great extent on continual tonic excitation by the discharge of nerve fibers entering the cord from higher centers, particularly discharge transmitted through the reticulospinal tracts, vestibulospinal tracts, and corticospinal tracts.

After a few hours to a few weeks, the spinal neurons gradually regain their excitability. This phenomenon seems to be a natural characteristic of neurons everywhere in the nervous system; after they lose their source of facilitatory impulses, they increase their own natural degree of excitability to make up at least partially for the loss. In most nonprimates, excitability of the cord centers returns essentially to normal within a few hours to a day or so, but in people, the return is often delayed for several weeks and occasionally is never complete; conversely, sometimes recovery is excessive, with resultant hyperexcitability of some or all cord functions.

Some of the spinal functions specifically affected during or after spinal shock are the following:

1. At onset of spinal shock, the arterial blood pressure falls almost instantly and drastically-sometimes to as low as 40 mm Hg -thus demonstrating that sympathetic
nervous system activity becomes blocked almost to extinction. The pressure ordinarily returns to normal within a few days, even in humans.
2. All skeletal muscle reflexes integrated in the spinal cord are blocked during the initial stages of shock. In lower animals, a few hours to a few days are required for these reflexes to return to normal; in humans, 2 weeks to several months are sometimes required. In both animals and humans, some reflexes may eventually become hyperexcitable, particularly if a few facilitatory pathways remain intact between the brain and the cord while the remainder of the spinal cord is transected. The first reflexes to return are the stretch reflexes, followed in order by the progressively more complex reflexes: flexor reflexes, postural antigravity reflexes, and remnants of stepping reflexes.
3. The sacral reflexes for control of bladder and colon evacuation are suppressed in people for the first few weeks after cord transection, but in most cases they eventually return. These effects are discussed in Chapters 26 and 67.

# Cortical and Brain Stem Control of Motor Function 

Most "voluntary" movements initiated by the cerebral cortex are achieved when the cortex activates "patterns" of function stored in lower brain areas-the cord, brain stem, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. These lower centers, in turn, send specific control signals to the muscles.

For a few types of movements, however, the cortex has almost a direct pathway to the anterior motor neurons of the cord, bypassing some motor centers on the way. This is especially true for control of the fine dexterous movements of the fingers and hands. This chapter and Chapter 57 explain the interplay among the different motor areas of the brain and spinal cord to provide overall synthesis of voluntary motor function.

## MOTOR CORTEX AND CORTICOSPINAL TRACT

Figure 56-1 shows the functional areas of the cerebral cortex. Anterior to the central cortical sulcus, occupying approximately the posterior one third of the frontal lobes, is the motor cortex. Posterior to the central sulcus is the somatosensory cortex (an area discussed in detail in earlier chapters), which feeds the motor cortex many of the signals that initiate motor activities.

The motor cortex is divided into three subareas, each of which has its own topographical representation of muscle groups and specific motor functions: (1) the primary motor cortex; (2) the premotor area; and (3) the supplementary motor area.

## PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX

The primary motor cortex, shown in Figure 56-1, lies in the first convolution of the frontal lobes anterior to the central sulcus. It begins laterally in the sylvian fissure, spreads superiorly to the uppermost portion of the brain, and then dips deep into the longitudinal fissure. (This area is the same as area 4 in Brodmann's classification of the brain cortical areas, shown in Figure 48-5.)

Figure 56-1 lists the approximate topographical representations of the different muscle areas of the body in the primary motor cortex, beginning with the face and mouth region near the sylvian fissure; the arm and hand area, in the midportion of the primary motor cortex; the trunk,
near the apex of the brain; and the leg and foot areas, in the part of the primary motor cortex that dips into the longitudinal fissure. This topographical organization is demonstrated even more graphically in Figure 56-2, which shows the degrees of representation of the different muscle areas as mapped by Penfield and Rasmussen. This mapping was done by electrically stimulating the different areas of the motor cortex in human beings were undergoing neurosurgery. Note that more than half of the entire primary motor cortex is concerned with controlling the muscles of the hands and the muscles of speech. Point stimulation in these hand and speech motor areas on rare occasion causes contraction of a single muscle, but most often, stimulation contracts a group of muscles. To express this in another way, excitation of a single motor cortex neuron usually excites a specific movement rather than one specific muscle. To do this, it excites a "pattern" of separate muscles, each of which contributes its own direction and strength of muscle movement.

## PREMOTOR AREA

The premotor area, also shown in Figure 56-1, lies 1 to 3 centimeters anterior to the primary motor cortex. It extends inferiorly into the sylvian fissure and superiorly into the longitudinal fissure, where it abuts the supplementary motor area, which has functions similar to those of the premotor area. The topographical organization of the premotor cortex is roughly the same as that of the primary motor cortex, with the mouth and face areas located most laterally; as one moves upward, the hand, arm, trunk, and leg areas are encountered.

Nerve signals generated in the premotor area cause much more complex "patterns" of movement than the discrete patterns generated in the primary motor cortex. For example, the pattern may be to position the shoulders and arms so that the hands are properly oriented to perform specific tasks. To achieve these results, the most anterior part of the premotor area first develops a "motor image" of the total muscle movement that is to be performed. Then, in the posterior premotor cortex, this image excites each successive pattern of muscle activity required to achieve the image. This posterior part of the premotor cortex sends its signals either directly to the primary motor cortex to excite specific muscles or, often, by way of the basal ganglia and thalamus back to the primary motor cortex.

A special class of neurons called mirror neurons becomes active when a person performs a specific motor task or when he or she observes the same task performed by others. Thus, the activity of these neurons "mirrors" the behavior of another person as though the observer was performing the specific motor task. Brain imaging

studies indicate that these neurons transform sensory representations of acts that are heard or seen into motor representations of these acts. Many neurophysiologists believe that these mirror neurons may be important for understanding the actions of other people and for learning new skills by imitation. Thus, the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and primary motor cortex constitute a complex overall system for the control of complex patterns of coordinated muscle activity.

## SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA

The supplementary motor area has yet another topographical organization for the control of motor function. It lies mainly in the longitudinal fissure but extends a few centimeters onto the superior frontal cortex. Contractions elicited by stimulating this area are often bilateral rather than unilateral. For example, stimulation frequently leads to bilateral grasping movements of both hands simultaneously; these movements are perhaps rudiments of the hand functions required for climbing. In general, this area functions in concert with the premotor area to provide body-wide attitudinal movements, fixation movements of the different segments of the body, positional movements of the head and eyes, and so forth, as background for the finer motor control of the arms and hands by the premotor area and primary motor cortex.

## SOME SPECIALIZED AREAS OF MOTOR CONTROL FOUND IN THE HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX

A few highly specialized motor regions of the human cerebral cortex (shown in Figure 56-3) control specific motor functions. These regions have been localized either by electrical stimulation or by noting the loss of motor function when destructive lesions occur in specific cortical areas. Some of the more important regions are described in the following sections.

Broca's Area (Motor Speech Area). Figure 56-3 shows a premotor area labeled "word formation" lying immediately anterior to the primary motor cortex and immediately above the sylvian fissure. This region is called Broca's area. Damage to it does not prevent a person from vocalizing but makes it impossible for the person to speak whole words rather than uncoordinated utterances or an occasional simple word such as "no" or "yes." A closely associated cortical area also causes appropriate respiratory function, so respiratory activation of the vocal cords can occur simultaneously with the movements of the mouth and tongue during speech. Thus, the premotor neuronal activities related to speech are highly complex.
"Voluntary" Eye Movement Field. In the premotor area immediately above Broca's area is a locus for controlling voluntary eye movements. Damage to this area prevents a person from voluntarily moving the eyes toward different objects. Instead, the eyes tend to lock involuntarily onto specific objects, an effect controlled by signals from the occipital visual cortex, as explained in Chapter 52. This frontal area also controls eyelid movements such as blinking.

Head Rotation Area. Slightly higher in the motor association area, electrical stimulation elicits head rotation. This area is closely associated with the eye movement field; it directs the head toward different objects.

Area for Hand Skills. In the premotor area immediately anterior to the primary motor cortex for the hands and fingers is a region that is important for "hand skills." That is, when tumors or other lesions cause destruction in this area, hand movements become uncoordinated and nonpurposeful, a condition called motor apraxia.

## TRANSMISSION OF SIGNALS FROM THE MOTOR CORTEX TO THE MUSCLES

Motor signals are transmitted directly from the cortex to the spinal cord through the corticospinal tract and indirectly through multiple accessory pathways that involve the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and various nuclei of the brain stem. In general, the direct pathways are concerned with discrete and detailed movements, especially of the distal segments of the limbs, particularly the hands and fingers.

## Corticospinal (Pyramidal) Tract

The most important output pathway from the motor cortex is the corticospinal tract, also called the pyramidal tract, shown in Figure 56-4. The corticospinal tract originates about $30 \%$ from the primary motor cortex, $30 \%$ from the premotor and supplementary motor areas, and $40 \%$ from the somatosensory areas posterior to the central sulcus.

After leaving the cortex, it passes through the posterior limb of the internal capsule (between the caudate
![gu168617462c](gu168617462c.jpg)

nucleus and the putamen of the basal ganglia) and then downward through the brain stem, forming the pyramids of the medulla. Most of the pyramidal fibers then cross in the lower medulla to the opposite side and descend into the lateral corticospinal tracts of the cord, finally terminating principally on the interneurons in the intermediate regions of the cord gray matter. A few terminate on sensory relay neurons in the dorsal horn, and a very few terminate directly on the anterior motor neurons that cause muscle contraction.

A few of the fibers do not cross to the opposite side in the medulla but pass ipsilaterally down the cord in the ventral corticospinal tracts. Many, if not most, of these fibers eventually cross to the opposite side of the cord either in the neck or in the upper thoracic region. These fibers may be concerned with control of bilateral postural movements by the supplementary motor cortex.

The most impressive fibers in the pyramidal tract are a population of large myelinated fibers with a mean diameter of 16 micrometers. These fibers originate from giant

pyramidal cells, called Betz cells, that are found only in the primary motor cortex. The Betz cells are about 60 micrometers in diameter, and their fibers transmit nerve impulses to the spinal cord at a velocity of about $70 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$, the most rapid rate of transmission of any signals from the brain to the cord. There are about 34,000 of these large Betz cell fibers in each corticospinal tract. The total number of fibers in each corticospinal tract is more than 1 million, so these large fibers represent only $3 \%$ of the total. The other $97 \%$ are mainly fibers smaller than 4 micrometers in diameter that conduct background tonic signals to the motor areas of the cord.

## Other Fiber Pathways From the Motor Cortex

The motor cortex gives rise to large numbers of additional, mainly small fibers that go to deep regions in the cerebrum and brain stem, including the following:

1. The axons from the giant Betz cells send short collaterals back to the cortex. These collaterals are believed to inhibit adjacent regions of the cortex when the Betz cells discharge, thereby "sharpening" the boundaries of the excitatory signal.
2. A large number of fibers pass from the motor cortex into the caudate nucleus and putamen. From there, additional pathways extend into the brain stem and spinal cord, as discussed in the next chapter, mainly to control body postural muscle contractions.
3. A moderate number of motor fibers pass to red nuclei of the midbrain. From these nuclei, additional fibers pass down the cord through the rubrospinal tract.
4. A moderate number of motor fibers deviate into the reticular substance and vestibular nuclei of the brain stem; from there, signals go to the cord via reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tracts, and others go to the cerebellum via reticulocerebellar and vestibulocerebellar tracts.
5. A tremendous number of motor fibers synapse in the pontile nuclei, which give rise to the pontocerebellar fibers, carrying signals into the cerebellar hemispheres.
6. Collaterals also terminate in the inferior olivary nuclei, and from there, secondary olivocerebellar fibers transmit signals to multiple areas of the cerebellum.
Thus, the basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum all receive strong motor signals from the corticospinal system every time a signal is transmitted down the spinal cord to cause a motor activity.

## Incoming Sensory Fiber Pathways to the Motor Cortex

The functions of the motor cortex are controlled mainly by nerve signals from the somatosensory system but also, to some degree, from other sensory systems such as hearing and vision. Once the sensory information is received, the motor cortex operates in association with the basal ganglia and cerebellum to excite appropriate motor actions. The more important incoming fiber pathways to the motor cortex are the following:

1. Subcortical fibers from adjacent regions of the cerebral cortex, especially from (a) the somatosensory areas of the parietal cortex, (b) the adjacent areas of the frontal cortex anterior to the motor cortex, and (c) the visual and auditory cortices.
2. Subcortical fibers that arrive through the corpus callosum from the opposite cerebral hemisphere. These fibers connect corresponding areas of the cortices in the two sides of the brain.
3. Somatosensory fibers that arrive directly from the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus. These fibers relay mainly cutaneous tactile signals and joint and muscle signals from the peripheral body.
4. Tracts from the ventrolateral and ventroanterior nuclei of the thalamus, which in turn receive signals from the cerebellum and basal ganglia. These tracts provide signals that are necessary for coordination among the motor control functions of the motor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.
5. Fibers from the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. These fibers control the general level of excitability of the motor cortex in the same way they control the general level of excitability of most other regions of the cerebral cortex.

## THE RED NUCLEUS SERVES AS AN ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY FOR TRANSMITTING CORTICAL SIGNALS TO THE SPINAL CORD

The red nucleus, located in the mesencephalon, functions in close association with the corticospinal tract. As shown in Figure 56-5, it receives a large number of direct fibers from the primary motor cortex through the corticorubral tract, as well as branching fibers from the corticospinal tract as it passes through the mesencephalon. These fibers synapse in the lower portion of the red nucleus, the magnocellular portion, which contains large neurons similar in size to the Betz cells in the motor cortex. These large neurons then give rise to the rubrospinal tract, which crosses to the opposite side in the lower brain stem and follows a course immediately adjacent and anterior to the corticospinal tract into the lateral columns of the spinal cord.
![gu178617462c](gu178617462c.jpg)

Figure 56-5 The corticorubrospinal pathway for motor control, also showing the relation of this pathway to the cerebellum.

The rubrospinal fibers terminate mostly on the interneurons of the intermediate areas of the cord gray matter, along with the corticospinal fibers, but some of the rubrospinal fibers terminate directly on anterior motor neurons, along with some corticospinal fibers. The red nucleus also has close connections with the cerebellum, similar to the connections between the motor cortex and the cerebellum.

## The Corticorubrospinal System Is an Accessory Path-

way for Transmitting Relatively Discrete Signals From the Motor Cortex to the Spinal Cord. The magnocellular portion of the red nucleus has a somatographic representation of all the muscles of the body, as does the motor cortex. Therefore, stimulation of a single point in this portion of the red nucleus causes contraction of either a single muscle or a small group of muscles. However, the fineness of representation of the different muscles is far less developed than in the motor cortex, especially in human beings, who have relatively small red nuclei.

The corticorubrospinal pathway serves as an accessory route for transmission of relatively discrete signals from the motor cortex to the spinal cord. When the corticospinal fibers are destroyed but the corticorubrospinal pathway is intact, discrete movements can still occur, except that the movements for fine control of the fingers and hands are considerably impaired. Wrist movements are still functional, which is not the case when the corticorubrospinal pathway is also blocked.

Therefore, the pathway through the red nucleus to the spinal cord is associated with the corticospinal system. Furthermore, the rubrospinal tract lies in the lateral columns of the spinal cord, along with the corticospinal tract, and terminates on the interneurons and motor neurons that control the more distal muscles of the limbs. Therefore, the corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts together are called the lateral motor system of the cord, in contradistinction to a vestibuloreticulospinal system, which lies mainly medially in the cord and is called the medial motor system of the cord, as discussed later in this chapter.

## EXCITATION OF THE SPINAL CORD MOTOR CONTROL AREAS BY THE PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX AND RED NUCLEUS

Neurons in the Motor Cortex Are Arranged in Vertical Columns. In Chapters 48 and 52, we pointed out that the cells in the somatosensory cortex and visual cortex are organized in vertical columns of cells. The cells of the motor cortex are also organized in vertical columns a fraction of a millimeter in diameter, with thousands of neurons in each column.

Each column of cells functions as a unit, usually stimulating a group of synergistic muscles, but sometimes stimulating just a single muscle. Also, each column has six distinct layers of cells, as is true throughout nearly all the cerebral cortex. The pyramidal cells that give rise to the corticospinal fibers all lie in the fifth layer of cells
from the cortical surface. The input signals all enter via layers 2 through 4 , and the sixth layer gives rise mainly to fibers that communicate with other regions of the cerebral cortex.

Each Column of Neurons Functions as an Integrative Processing System. The neurons of each column operate as an integrative processing system, using information from multiple input sources to determine the output response from the column. In addition, each column can function as an amplifying system to stimulate large numbers of pyramidal fibers to the same muscle or to synergistic muscles simultaneously. This ability is important because stimulation of a single pyramidal cell seldom excites a muscle. Usually, 50 to 100 pyramidal cells need to be excited simultaneously or in rapid succession to achieve definitive muscle contraction.

Dynamic and Static Signals Are Transmitted by the Pyramidal Neurons. If a strong signal is sent to a muscle to cause initial rapid contraction, then a much weaker continuing signal can maintain the contraction for long periods thereafter. This process is the usual manner in which excitation is provided to cause muscle contractions. To provide this excitation, each column of cells excites two populations of pyramidal cell neurons, one called dynamic neurons and the other static neurons. The dynamic neurons are excited at a high rate for a short period at the beginning of a contraction, causing the initial rapid development of force. The static neurons then fire at a much slower rate, but they continue firing at this slow rate to maintain the force of contraction as long as the contraction is required.

The neurons of the red nucleus have similar dynamic and static characteristics, except that a greater percentage of dynamic neurons is in the red nucleus and a greater percentage of static neurons is in the primary motor cortex. This may be related to the fact that the red nucleus is closely allied with the cerebellum, and the cerebellum plays an important role in rapid initiation of muscle contraction, as explained in the next chapter.

## Somatosensory Feedback to the Motor Cortex Helps Control Precision of Muscle Contraction

When nerve signals from the motor cortex cause a muscle to contract, somatosensory signals return all the way from the activated region of the body to the neurons in the motor cortex that are initiating the action. Most of these somatosensory signals arise in the following: (1) the muscle spindles; (2) the muscle tendon organs; or (3) the tactile receptors of the skin overlying the muscles.

These somatic signals often cause positive feedback enhancement of the muscle contraction in the following ways. In the case of the muscle spindles, if the fusimotor muscle fibers in the spindles contract more than the large skeletal muscle fibers contract, the central portions of the spindles become stretched and, therefore, excited. Signals

from these spindles then return rapidly to the pyramidal cells in the motor cortex signal them that the large muscle fibers have not contracted enough. The pyramidal cells further excite the muscle, helping its contraction to catch up with the contraction of the muscle spindles. In the case of the tactile receptors, if the muscle contraction causes compression of the skin against an object, such as compression of the fingers around an object being grasped, the signals from the skin receptors can, if necessary, cause further excitation of the muscles and, therefore, increase the tightness of the hand grasp.

## Stimulation of the Spinal Motor Neurons

Figure 56-6 shows a cross section of a spinal cord segment demonstrating the following: (1) multiple motor and sensorimotor control tracts entering the cord segment; and (2) a representative anterior motor neuron in the middle of the anterior horn gray matter. The corticospinal tract and the rubrospinal tract lie in the dorsal portions of the lateral white columns. Their fibers terminate mainly on interneurons in the intermediate area of the cord gray matter.

In the cervical enlargement of the cord where the hands and fingers are represented, large numbers of both corticospinal and rubrospinal fibers also terminate directly on the anterior motor neurons, allowing a direct route from the brain to activate muscle contraction. This mechanism is in keeping with the fact that the primary motor cortex has an extremely high degree of representation for fine control of hand, finger, and thumb actions.

## Patterns of Movement Elicited by Spinal Cord Cent-

ers. From Chapter 55, recall that the spinal cord can provide certain specific reflex patterns of movement in response to sensory nerve stimulation. Many of these same patterns are also important when the cord's anterior motor neurons are excited by signals from the brain. For example, the stretch reflex is functional at all times,
![gu188617462c](gu188617462c.jpg)

Figure 56-6. Convergence of different motor control pathways on the anterior motor neurons.
helping to damp any oscillations of the motor movements initiated from the brain. This reflex probably also provides at least part of the motive power required to cause muscle contractions when the intrafusal fibers of the muscle spindles contract more than the large skeletal muscle fibers, thus eliciting reflex "servo-assist" stimulation of the muscle, in addition to the direct stimulation by the corticospinal fibers.

Also, when a brain signal excites a muscle, it is usually unnecessary to transmit an inverse signal to relax the antagonist muscle at the same time; this relaxation is achieved by the reciprocal innervation circuit that is always present in the cord for coordinating the function of antagonistic pairs of muscles.

Finally, other cord reflex mechanisms, such as withdrawal, stepping and walking, scratching, and postural mechanisms, can each be activated by "command" signals from the brain. Thus, simple command signals from the brain can initiate many normal motor activities, particularly for such functions as walking and attaining different postural attitudes of the body.

## Effect of Lesions in the Motor Cortex or in the Corticospinal Pathway

Reduced Brain Blood Supply Caused by a Stroke. The motor control system can be damaged by the common abnormality called a "stroke." A stroke is caused by either a ruptured blood vessel that hemorrhages into the brain or by thrombosis of one of the major arteries supplying blood to the brain. In either case, the result is loss of blood supply to the cortex or to the corticospinal tract where it passes through the internal capsule between the caudate nucleus and the putamen.

Removal of the Primary Motor Cortex (Area Pyramidalis). Surgical removal of a portion of the primary motor cortex-the area that contains the giant Betz pyramidal cells-causes varying degrees of paralysis of the represented muscles. If the sublying caudate nucleus and adjacent premotor and supplementary motor areas are not damaged, gross postural and limb "fixation" movements can still occur, but there is loss of voluntary control of discrete movements of the distal segments of the limbs, especially of the hands and fingers. This does not mean that the hand and finger muscles cannot contract; rather, the ability to control the fine movements is gone. From these observations, one can conclude that the area pyramidalis is essential for voluntary initiation of finely controlled movements, especially of the hands and fingers.

Muscle Spasticity Caused by Lesions That Damage Large Areas Adjacent to the Motor Cortex. The primary motor cortex normally exerts a continual tonic stimulatory effect on the motor neurons of the spinal cord; when this stimulatory effect is removed, hypotonia results. Most lesions of the motor cortex, especially those caused by a stroke, involve not only the primary motor cortex but also adjacent parts of the brain, such as the basal ganglia. In these cases, muscle spasm almost invariably occurs in the afflicted muscle areas on the opposite side of the body (because the motor pathways cross to the opposite side). This spasm results mainly

from damage to accessory pathways from the nonpyramidal portions of the motor cortex. These pathways normally inhibit the vestibular and reticular brain stem motor nuclei. When these nuclei cease their state of inhibition (i.e., are "disinhibited"), they become spontaneously active and cause excessive spastic tone in the involved muscles, as we discuss more fully later in this chapter. This spasticity is that which normally accompanies a "stroke" in a human being.

## CONTROL OF MOTOR FUNCTIONS BY THE BRAIN STEM

The brain stem consists of the medulla, pons, and mesencephalon (or midbrain). In one sense, it is an extension of the spinal cord upward into the cranial cavity because it contains motor and sensory nuclei that perform motor and sensory functions for the face and head regions in the same way that the spinal cord performs these functions from the neck down. In another sense, however, the brain stem is its own master because it provides many special control functions, such as the following:

1. Control of respiration
2. Control of the cardiovascular system
3. Partial control of gastrointestinal function
4. Control of many stereotyped movements of the body
5. Control of equilibrium
6. Control of eye movements

Finally, the brain stem serves as a way station for "command signals" from higher neural centers. Many of these functions are discussed in other chapters in this text. In the following sections, we discuss the role of the brain stem in controlling whole-body movement and equilibrium. Especially important for these purposes are the brain stem's reticular nuclei and vestibular nuclei.

## SUPPORT OF THE BODY AGAINST GRAVITY—ROLES OF THE RETICULAR AND VESTIBULAR NUCLEI

Figure 56-7 shows the locations of the reticular and vestibular nuclei in the brain stem.

## Excitatory-Inhibitory Antagonism Between Pontine and Medullary Reticular Nuclei

The reticular nuclei are divided into two major groups: (1) pontine reticular nuclei, located slightly posteriorly and laterally in the pons and extending into the mesencephalon; and (2) medullary reticular nuclei, which extend through the entire medulla, lying ventrally and medially near the midline. These two sets of nuclei function mainly antagonistically to each other, with the pontine exciting the antigravity muscles and the medullary relaxing these same muscles.

Pontine Reticular System Transmits Excitatory Signals. The pontine reticular nuclei transmit excitatory signals downward into the cord through the pontine reticu-
![gu198617462c](gu198617462c.jpg)

Figure 56-7. Locations of the reticular and vestibular nuclei in the brain stem.
lospinal tract in the anterior column of the cord, as shown in Figure 56-8. The fibers of this pathway terminate on the medial anterior motor neurons that excite the axial muscles of the body, which support the body against grav-ity-that is, the muscles of the vertebral column and the extensor muscles of the limbs.

The pontine reticular nuclei have a high degree of natural excitability. In addition, they receive strong excitatory signals from the vestibular nuclei, as well as from deep nuclei of the cerebellum. Therefore, when the pontine reticular excitatory system is unopposed by the medullary reticular system, it causes powerful excitation of antigravity muscles throughout the body, so much so that four-legged animals can be placed in a standing position, supporting the body against gravity without any signals from higher levels of the brain.

Medullary Reticular System Transmit Inhibitory Signals. The medullary reticular nuclei transmit inhibitory signals to the same antigravity anterior motor neurons via a different tract, the medullary reticulospinal tract, located in the lateral column of the cord, as also shown in Figure 56-8. The medullary reticular nuclei receive strong input collaterals from the following: (1) the corticospinal tract; (2) the rubrospinal tract; and (3) other motor pathways. These tracts and pathways normally activate the medullary reticular inhibitory system to counterbalance the excitatory signals from the pontine reticular system, so under normal conditions the body muscles are not abnormally tense.

Yet, some signals from higher areas of the brain can "disinhibit" the medullary system when the brain wishes to excite the pontine system to cause standing. At other times, excitation of the medullary reticular system can

inhibit antigravity muscles in certain portions of the body to allow those portions to perform special motor activities. The excitatory and inhibitory reticular nuclei constitute a controllable system that is manipulated by motor signals from the cerebral cortex and elsewhere to provide necessary background muscle contractions for standing against gravity and to inhibit appropriate groups of muscles as needed so that other functions can be performed.

## Role of the Vestibular Nuclei to Excite the Antigravity Muscles

All the vestibular nuclei, shown in Figure 56-7, function in association with the pontine reticular nuclei to control the antigravity muscles. The vestibular nuclei transmit strong excitatory signals to the antigravity muscles via the lateral and medial vestibulospinal tracts in the anterior columns of the spinal cord, as shown in Figure 56-8. Without this support of the vestibular nuclei, the pontine reticular system would lose much of its excitation of the axial antigravity muscles.

The specific role of the vestibular nuclei, however, is to selectively control the excitatory signals to the different antigravity muscles to maintain equilibrium in response to signals from the vestibular apparatus. We discuss this concept more fully later in this chapter.

The Decerebrate Animal Develops Spastic Rigidity. When the brain stem of an animal is sectioned below the midlevel of the mesencephalon but the pontine and medullary reticular systems, as well as the vestibular system, are left intact, a condition called decerebrate rigidity develops. This rigidity does not occur in all the muscles of the body, but it does occur in the antigravity musclesthe muscles of the neck and trunk and the extensors of the legs.

The cause of decerebrate rigidity is blockage of normally strong input to the medullary reticular nuclei from the cerebral cortex, the red nuclei, and the basal ganglia.
![gu208617462c](gu208617462c.jpg)

Figure 56-8. Vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts descending in the spinal cord to excite (solid lines) or inhibit (dashed lines) the anterior motor neurons that control the body's axial musculature.

Lacking this input, the medullary reticular inhibitor system becomes nonfunctional, full overactivity of the pontine excitatory system occurs, and rigidity develops. We shall see later that other causes of rigidity occur in other neuromotor diseases, especially lesions of the basal ganglia.

## VESTIBULAR SENSATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF EQUILIBRIUM

## VESTIBULAR APPARATUS

The vestibular apparatus, shown in Figure 56-9, is the sensory organ for detecting sensations of equilibrium. It is encased in a system of bony tubes and chambers located in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, called the bony labyrinth. Within this system are membranous tubes and chambers called the membranous labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth is the functional part of the vestibular apparatus.

The top of Figure 56-9 shows the membranous labyrinth. It is composed mainly of the cochlea (ductus
![gu218617462c](gu218617462c.jpg)

Figure 56-9. Membranous labyrinth and organization of the crista ampullaris and the macula.

cochlearis), three semicircular canals, and two large chambers, the utricle and saccule. The cochlea is the major sensory organ for hearing (see Chapter 53) and has little to do with equilibrium. However, the semicircular canals, the utricle, and the saccule are all integral parts of the equilibrium mechanism.

## "Maculae"-Sensory Organs of the Utricle and Saccule for Detecting Orientation of the Head With Respect to Gravity. Located on the inside surface of each utricle and saccule, shown in the top diagram of Figure 56-9, is a small sensory area slightly greater than 2 millimeters in diameter called a macula. The macula of the utricle lies mainly in the horizontal plane on the inferior surface of the utricle and plays an important role in determining orientation of the head when the head is upright. Conversely, the macula of the saccule is located mainly in a vertical plane and signals head orientation when the person is lying down.

Each macula is covered by a gelatinous layer in which many small calcium carbonate crystals called statoconia are embedded. Also in the macula are thousands of hair cells, one of which is shown in Figure 56-10; these hair cells project cilia up into the gelatinous layer. The bases and sides of the hair cells synapse with sensory endings of the vestibular nerve.

The calcified statoconia have a specific gravity two to three times the specific gravity of the surrounding fluid and tissues. The weight of the statoconia bends the cilia in the direction of gravitational pull.

## Directional Sensitivity of the Hair Cells-Kinocilium.

Each hair cell has about 100 small cilia called stereocilia, plus one large cilium, the kinocilium, as shown in Figure 56-10. The kinocilium is always located to one side, and the stereocilia become progressively shorter toward the other side of the cell. Minute filamentous attachments, almost invisible even to the electron microscope, connect the tip of each stereocilium to the next longer stereocilium and, finally, to the kinocilium.

Because of these attachments, when the stereocilia bend in the direction of the kinocilium, the filamentous attachments tug in sequence on the stereocilia, pulling them outward from the cell body. This movement opens several hundred cation channels in the neuronal cell membrane around the bases of the stereocilia, and these channels are capable of conducting large numbers of positive ions. Therefore, positive ions pour into the cell from the surrounding endolymphatic fluid, causing receptor membrane depolarization. Conversely, bending the pile of stereocilia in the opposite direction (backward, away from the kinocilium) reduces the tension on the attachments; this movement closes the ion channels, thus causing receptor hyperpolarization.

Under normal resting conditions, the nerve fibers leading from the hair cells transmit continuous nerve impulses at a rate of about 100 per second. When the stereocilia are
![gu228617462c](gu228617462c.jpg)

Figure 56-10. A hair cell of the equilibrium apparatus and its synapses with the vestibular nerve.
bent toward the kinocilium, the impulse traffic increases, often to several hundred per second; conversely, bending the cilia away from the kinocilium decreases the impulse traffic, often turning it off completely. Therefore, as the orientation of the head in space changes and the weight of the statoconia bends the cilia, appropriate signals are transmitted to the brain to control equilibrium.

In each macula, each of the hair cells is oriented in a different direction so that some of the hair cells are stimulated when the head bends forward, some are stimulated when it bends backward, others are stimulated when it bends to one side, and so forth. Therefore, a different pattern of excitation occurs in the macular nerve fibers for each orientation of the head in the gravitational field. It is this "pattern" that apprises the brain of the head's orientation in space.

Semicircular Ducts. The three semicircular ducts in each vestibular apparatus, known as the anterior, posterior, and lateral (horizontal) semicircular ducts, are arranged at right angles to one another so that they represent all three planes in space. When the head is bent forward about 30

degrees, the lateral semicircular ducts are approximately horizontal with respect to the surface of the Earth; the anterior ducts are in vertical planes that project forward and 45 degrees outward, whereas the posterior ducts are in vertical planes that project backward and 45 degrees outward.

Each semicircular duct has an enlargement at one of its ends called the ampulla, and the ducts and ampulla are filled with a fluid called endolymph. Flow of this fluid through one of the ducts and through its ampulla excites the sensory organ of the ampulla in the following manner: Figure 56-11 shows a small crest in each ampulla called a crista ampullaris. On top of this crista is a loose gelatinous tissue mass, the cupula. When a person's head begins to rotate in any direction, the inertia of the fluid in one or more of the semicircular ducts causes the fluid to remain stationary while the semicircular duct rotates with the head. This process causes fluid to flow from the duct and through the ampulla, bending the cupula to one side, as demonstrated by the position of the colored cupula in Figure 56-11. Rotation of the head in the opposite direction causes the cupula to bend to the opposite side.

Hundreds of cilia from hair cells located on the ampullary crest are projected into the cupula. The kinocilia of these hair cells are all oriented in the same direction in the cupula, and bending the cupula in that direction causes depolarization of the hair cells, whereas bending it in the opposite direction hyperpolarizes the cells. Then, from the hair cells, appropriate signals are sent via the vestibular nerve to apprise the central nervous system of a change in rotation of the head and the rate of change in each of the three planes of space.
![gu238617462c](gu238617462c.jpg)

Figure 56-11. Movement of the cupula and its embedded hairs at the onset of rotation.

## FUNCTION OF THE UTRICLE AND SACCULE IN THE MAINTENANCE OF STATIC EQUILIBRIUM

It is especially important that the hair cells are all oriented in different directions in the maculae of the utricles and saccules so that with different positions of the head, different hair cells become stimulated. The "patterns" of stimulation of the different hair cells apprise the brain of the position of the head with respect to the pull of gravity. In turn, the vestibular, cerebellar, and reticular motor nerve systems of the brain excite appropriate postural muscles to maintain proper equilibrium.

This utricle and saccule system functions extremely effectively for maintaining equilibrium when the head is in the near-vertical position. Indeed, a person can determine as little as half a degree of disequilibrium when the body leans from the precise upright position.

Detection of Linear Acceleration by the Utricle and Saccule Maculae. When the body is suddenly thrust forwardthat is, when the body accelerates-the statoconia, which have greater mass inertia than the surrounding fluid, fall backward on the hair cell cilia, and information of disequilibrium is sent into the nervous centers, causing the person to feel as though he or she were falling backward. This sensation automatically causes the person to lean forward until the resulting anterior shift of the statoconia exactly equals the tendency for the statoconia to fall backward because of the acceleration. At this point, the nervous system senses a state of proper equilibrium and leans the body forward no farther. Thus, the maculae operate to maintain equilibrium during linear acceleration in exactly the same manner as they operate during static equilibrium.

The maculae do not operate for the detection of linear velocity. When runners first begin to run, they must lean far forward to keep from falling backward because of initial acceleration, but once they have achieved running speed, if they were running in a vacuum, they would not have to lean forward. When running in air, they lean forward to maintain equilibrium only because of air resistance against their bodies; in this case, it is not the maculae that make them lean but air pressure acting on pressure end-organs in the skin, which initiate appropriate equilibrium adjustments to prevent falling.

## DETECTION OF HEAD ROTATION BY THE SEMICIRCULAR DUCTS

When the head suddenly begins to rotate in any direction (called angular acceleration), the endolymph in the semicircular ducts, because of its inertia, tends to remain stationary while the semicircular ducts turn. This mechanism causes relative fluid flow in the ducts in the direction opposite to head rotation.

Figure 56-12 shows a typical discharge signal from a single hair cell in the crista ampullaris when an animal is rotated for 40 seconds, demonstrating the following: (1) even when the cupula is in its resting position, the hair cell emits a tonic

discharge of about 100 impulses per second; (2) when the animal begins to rotate, the hairs bend to one side, and the rate of discharge increases greatly; and (3) with continued rotation, the excess discharge of the hair cell gradually subsides back to the resting level during the next few seconds.

The reason for this adaptation of the receptor is that within the first few seconds of rotation, back resistance to the flow of fluid in the semicircular duct and past the bent cupula causes the endolymph to begin rotating as rapidly as the semicircular canal itself. Then, in another 5 to 20 seconds, the cupula slowly returns to its resting position in the middle of the ampulla because of its own elastic recoil.

When the rotation suddenly stops, exactly opposite effects take place: The endolymph continues to rotate while the semicircular duct stops. This time, the cupula bends in the opposite direction, causing the hair cell to stop discharging entirely. After another few seconds, the endolymph stops moving and the cupula gradually returns to its resting position, thus allowing hair cell discharge to return to its normal tonic level, as shown at the right in Figure 56-12. Thus, the semicircular duct transmits a signal of one polarity when the head begins to rotate and of opposite polarity when it stops rotating.
"Predictive" Function of the Semicircular Duct System in the Maintenance of Equilibrium. Because the semicircular ducts do not detect that the body is off balance in the forward direction, in the side direction, or in the backward direction, one might ask, "What is the function of the semicircular ducts in the maintenance of equilibrium?" All they detect is that the person's head is beginning or stopping to rotate in one direction or another. Therefore, the function of the semicircular ducts is not to maintain static equilibrium or to maintain equilibrium during steady directional or rotational movements. Yet, loss of function of the semicircular ducts does cause a person to have poor equilibrium when attempting to perform rapid, intricate changing body movements.
![gu248617462c](gu248617462c.jpg)

Figure 56-12. Response of a hair cell when a semicircular canal is stimulated first by the onset of head rotation and then by stopping rotation.

The function of the semicircular ducts can be explained by the following illustration: if a person is running forward rapidly and then suddenly begins to turn to one side, he or she will fall off balance a fraction of a second later unless appropriate corrections are made ahead of time. However, the maculae of the utricle and saccule cannot detect that the person is off balance until after the loss of balance has occurred. The semicircular ducts, however, will have already detected that the person is turning, and this information can easily apprise the central nervous system of the fact that the person will fall off balance within the next fraction of a second or so unless some anticipatory correction is made.

In other words, the semicircular duct mechanism predicts that disequilibrium is going to occur and thereby causes the equilibrium centers to make appropriate anticipatory preventive adjustments, which helps the person maintain balance before the situation can be corrected.

Removal of the flocculonodular lobes of the cerebellum prevents normal detection of semicircular duct signals but has less effect on detecting macular signals. It is especially interesting that the cerebellum serves as a "predictive" organ for most rapid movements of the body, as well as for those involving equilibrium. These other functions of the cerebellum are discussed in Chapter 57.

## Vestibular Mechanisms for Stabilizing the Eyes

When a person changes direction of movement rapidly or even leans the head sideways, forward, or backward, it would be impossible to maintain a stable image on the retinas unless the person had some automatic control mechanism to stabilize the direction of the eyes' gaze. In addition, the eyes would be of little use in detecting an image unless they remained fixed on each object long enough to gain a clear image. Fortunately, each time the head is suddenly rotated, signals from the semicircular ducts cause the eyes to rotate in a direction equal and opposite to the rotation of the head. This movement results from reflexes transmitted through the vestibular nuclei and the medial longitudinal fasciculus to the oculomotor nuclei. These reflexes are described in Chapter 52.

## Other Factors Concerned With Equilibrium

Neck Proprioceptors. The vestibular apparatus detects the orientation and movement only of the head. Therefore, it is essential that the nervous centers also receive appropriate information about the orientation of the head with respect to the body. This information is transmitted from the proprioceptors of the neck and body directly to the vestibular and reticular nuclei in the brain stem and indirectly by way of the cerebellum.

Among the most important proprioceptive information needed for the maintenance of equilibrium is that transmitted by joint receptors of the neck. When the head is leaned in one direction by bending the neck, impulses from the neck proprioceptors keep the signals originating in the ves-

tibular apparatus from giving the person a sense of disequilibrium. They perform this function by transmitting signals that exactly oppose the signals transmitted from the vestibular apparatus. However, when the entire body leans in one direction, the impulses from the vestibular apparatus are not opposed by signals from the neck proprioceptors; therefore, in this case, the person does perceive a change in equilibrium status of the entire body.

Proprioceptive and Exteroceptive Information From Other Parts of the Body. Proprioceptive information from parts of the body other than the neck is also important in the maintenance of equilibrium. For example, pressure sensations from the footpads tell one (1) whether weight is distributed equally between the two feet and (2) whether weight on the feet is more forward or backward.

Exteroceptive information is especially necessary for the maintenance of equilibrium when a person is running. The air pressure against the front of the body signals that a force is opposing the body in a direction different from that caused by gravitational pull; as a result, the person leans forward to oppose this force.

Importance of Visual Information for Maintaining Equilibrium. After destruction of the vestibular apparatus, and even after loss of most proprioceptive information from the body, a person can still use the visual mechanisms reasonably effectively for maintaining equilibrium. Even a slight linear or rotational movement of the body instantaneously shifts the visual images on the retina, and this information is relayed to the equilibrium centers. Some people with bilateral destruction of the vestibular apparatus have almost normal equilibrium as long as their eyes are open, and all motions are performed slowly. However, when moving rapidly or when the eyes are closed, equilibrium is immediately lost.

## Neuronal Connections of the Vestibular Apparatus With the Central Nervous System

Figure 53-13 shows the connections in the hindbrain of the vestibular nerve. Most of the vestibular nerve fibers terminate in the brain stem in the vestibular nuclei, which are located approximately at the junction of the medulla and the pons. Some fibers pass directly to the brain stem reticular nuclei without synapsing and also to the cerebellar fastigial, uvular, and flocculonodular lobe nuclei. The fibers that end in the brain stem vestibular nuclei synapse with second-order neurons that also send fibers into the cerebellum, the vestibulospinal tracts, the medial longitudinal fasciculus, and other areas of the brain stem, particularly the reticular nuclei.

The primary pathway for the equilibrium reflexes begins in the vestibular nerves, where the nerves are excited by the vestibular apparatus. The pathway then passes to the vestibular nuclei and cerebellum. Next, signals are sent into the reticular nuclei of the brain stem, as well as down the spinal cord via the vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts. The signals to the cord control the interplay between facilitation and inhibition of the many antigravity muscles, thus automatically controlling equilibrium.

The flocculonodular lobes of the cerebellum are especially concerned with dynamic equilibrium signals from
the semicircular ducts. In fact, destruction of these lobes results in almost exactly the same clinical symptoms as destruction of the semicircular ducts. That is, severe injury to either the lobes or the ducts causes loss of dynamic equilibrium during rapid changes in direction of motion but does not seriously disturb equilibrium under static conditions. It is believed that the uvula of the cerebellum plays a similar important role in static equilibrium.

Signals transmitted upward in the brain stem from both the vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum via the medial longitudinal fasciculus cause corrective movements of the eyes every time the head rotates, so the eyes remain fixed on a specific visual object. Signals also pass upward (either through this same tract or through reticular tracts) to the cerebral cortex, terminating in a primary cortical center for equilibrium located in the parietal lobe deep in the sylvian fissure on the opposite side of the fissure from the auditory area of the superior temporal gyrus. These signals apprise the psyche of the equilibrium status of the body.

## Functions of Brain Stem Nuclei in Controlling Subconscious, Stereotyped Movements

Rarely, a baby is born without brain structures above the mesencephalic region, a condition called anencephaly. Some of these babies have been kept alive for many months. They are able to perform some stereotyped movements for feeding, such as suckling, extrusion of unpleasant food from the mouth, and moving the hands to the mouth to suck the fingers. In addition, they can yawn and stretch. They can cry and can follow objects with movements of the eyes and head. Also, placing pressure on the upper anterior parts of their legs causes them to pull to the sitting position. It is clear that many of the stereotyped motor functions of the human being are integrated in the brain stem.

In addition to areas in the cerebral cortex that stimulate muscle contraction, two other brain structures are essential for normal motor function-the cerebellum and the basal ganglia. Neither of these structures can control muscle function by itself. Instead, these structures always function in association with other systems of motor control.

The cerebellum plays major roles in timing of motor activities and in rapid, smooth progression from one muscle movement to the next. It also helps control the intensity of muscle contraction when the muscle load changes and controls the necessary instantaneous interplay between agonist and antagonist muscle groups.

The basal ganglia help plan and control complex patterns of muscle movement. They control relative intensities of the separate movements, directions of movements, and sequencing of multiple successive and parallel movements to achieve specific complicated motor goals. This chapter explains the basic functions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia and discusses the overall brain mechanisms for achieving intricate coordination of total motor activity.

## THE CEREBELLUM AND ITS MOTOR FUNCTIONS

The cerebellum, illustrated in Figures 57-1 and 57-2, has long been called a silent area of the brain, principally because electrical excitation of the cerebellum does not cause any conscious sensation and rarely causes any motor movement. Removal of the cerebellum, however, causes body movements to become highly abnormal. The cerebellum is especially vital during rapid muscular activities such as running, typing, playing the piano, and even talking. Loss of this area of the brain can cause almost total lack of coordination of these activities, even though its loss does not cause paralysis of any muscles.

How can the cerebellum be so important when it has no direct ability to cause muscle contraction? The answer is that it helps sequence and monitor motor activities and makes corrective adjustments while activities are being executed so that they will conform to the motor signals directed by the cerebral motor cortex and other parts of the brain.

The cerebellum receives continuously updated information about the desired sequence of muscle contractions from the brain motor control areas; it also receives continuous sensory information from the peripheral parts of the body, giving sequential changes in the status of each part of the body-its position, rate of movement, forces acting on it, and so forth. The cerebellum then compares the actual movements as depicted by the peripheral sensory feedback information with the movements intended by the motor system. If the two do not compare favorably, then instantaneous subconscious corrective signals are transmitted back into the motor system to increase or decrease the levels of activation of specific muscles.

The cerebellum also aids the cerebral cortex in planning the next sequential movement a fraction of a second in advance while the current movement is still being executed, thus helping the person to progress smoothly from one movement to the next. Also, it learns by its mistakes. If a movement does not occur exactly as intended, the cerebellar circuit learns to make a stronger or weaker movement the next time. To make this adjustment, changes occur in the excitability of appropriate cerebellar neurons, thus bringing subsequent muscle contractions into better correspondence with the intended movements.

## Anatomical and Functional Areas of the Cerebellum

Anatomically, the cerebellum is divided into three lobes by two deep fissures, as shown in Figures 57-1 and 57-2: (1) the anterior lobe, (2) the posterior lobe, and (3) the flocculonodular lobe. The flocculonodular lobe is the oldest portion of the cerebellum; it developed along with (and functions with) the vestibular system in controlling body equilibrium, as discussed in Chapter 56.

Longitudinal Functional Divisions of the Anterior and Posterior Lobes. From a functional point of view, the anterior and posterior lobes are organized not by lobes but along the longitudinal axis, as demonstrated in Figure 572, which shows a posterior view of the human cerebellum after the lower end of the posterior cerebellum has been rolled downward from its normally hidden position. Note, down the center of the cerebellum, a narrow band called

the vermis, which is separated from the remainder of the cerebellum by shallow grooves. Most cerebellar control functions for muscle movements of the axial body, neck, shoulders, and hips are located in this area.

To each side of the vermis is a large, laterally protruding cerebellar hemisphere; each of these hemispheres is divided into an intermediate zone and a lateral zone. The intermediate zone of the hemisphere is concerned with controlling muscle contractions in the distal portions of the upper and lower limbs, especially the hands, fingers, feet, and toes. The lateral zone of the hemisphere operates at a much more remote level because this area joins with the cerebral cortex in the overall planning of sequential motor movements. Without this lateral zone, most discrete motor activities of the body lose their appropriate timing and sequencing and therefore become uncoordinated, as we discuss more fully later in this chapter.
![gu288617462c](gu288617462c.jpg)

Figure 57-3 Somatosensory projection areas in the cerebellar cortex.

Topographical Representation of the Body in the Vermis and Intermediate Zones. In the same manner that the cerebral sensory cortex, motor cortex, basal ganglia, red nuclei, and reticular formation all have topographical representations of the different parts of the body, so does the vermis and intermediate zones of the cerebellum. Figure $57-3$ shows two such representations. Note that the axial portions of the body lie in the vermis part of the cerebellum, whereas the limbs and facial regions lie in the intermediate zones. These topographical representations receive afferent nerve signals from all the respective parts of the body, as well as from corresponding topographical motor areas in the cerebral cortex and brain stem. In turn, they send motor signals back to the same respective topographical areas of the cerebral motor cortex, as well as to topographical areas of the red nucleus and reticular formation in the brain stem.

Note that the large lateral portions of the cerebellar hemispheres do not have topographical representations of the body. These areas of the cerebellum receive input signals almost exclusively from the cerebral cortex, especially the premotor areas of the frontal cortex, and from the somatosensory and other sensory association areas of the parietal cortex. This connectivity with the cerebral cortex allows the lateral portions of the cerebellar hemispheres to play important roles in planning and coordinating the body's rapid sequential muscular activities that occur one after another within fractions of a second.

## Neuronal Circuit of the Cerebellum

The human cerebellar cortex is actually a large folded sheet, about 17 centimeters wide by 120 centimeters long, with the folds lying crosswise, as shown in Figures 57-2 and 57-3. Each fold is called a folium. Lying deep beneath the folded mass of cerebellar cortex are deep cerebellar nuclei. Input Pathways to the Cerebellum

Afferent Pathways From Other Parts of the Brain. The basic input pathways to the cerebellum are shown in Figure 57-4. An extensive and important afferent pathway is the corticopontocerebellar pathway, which originates in the

![gu298617462c](gu298617462c.jpg)

Figure 57-4 Principal afferent tracts to the cerebellum.
cerebral motor and premotor cortices and also in the cerebral somatosensory cortex. It passes by way of the pontile nuclei and pontocerebellar tracts mainly to the lateral divisions of the cerebellar hemispheres on the opposite side of the brain from the cerebral areas.

In addition, important afferent tracts originate in each side of the brain stem. These tracts include the following: (1) an extensive olivocerebellar tract, which passes from the inferior olive to all parts of the cerebellum and is excited in the olive by fibers from the cerebral motor cortex, basal ganglia, widespread areas of the reticular formation, and spinal cord; (2) vestibulocerebellar fibers, some of which originate in the vestibular apparatus itself and others from the brain stem vestibular nuclei, with almost all of these fibers terminating in the flocculonodular lobe and fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum; and (3) reticulocerebellar fibers, which originate in different portions of the brain stem reticular formation and terminate in the midline cerebellar areas (mainly in the vermis).

Afferent Pathways From the Periphery. The cerebellum also receives important sensory signals directly from the peripheral parts of the body, mainly through four tracts on each side, two of which are located dorsally in the cord and two ventrally. The two most important of these tracts are shown in Figure 57-5, the dorsal spinocerebellar tract and the ventral spinocerebellar tract. The dorsal tract enters the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and terminates in the vermis and intermediate zones of the cerebellum on the same side as its origin. The ventral tract enters the cerebellum through the superior cerebellar peduncle, but it terminates in both sides of the cerebellum.

The signals transmitted in the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts come mainly from the muscle spindles and to a lesser extent from other somatic receptors throughout the body, such as Golgi tendon organs, large tactile receptors of the skin, and joint receptors. All these signals apprise the cerebellum of the momentary status of (1) muscle contraction, (2) degree of tension on the muscle
![gu308617462c](gu308617462c.jpg)

Figure 57-5 Spinocerebellar tracts.
tendons, (3) positions and rates of movement of the parts of the body, and (4) forces acting on the surfaces of the body.

The ventral spinocerebellar tracts receive much less information from the peripheral receptors. Instead, they are excited mainly by motor signals arriving in the anterior horns of the spinal cord from (1) the brain through the corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts and (2) the internal motor pattern generators in the cord itself. Thus, this ventral fiber pathway tells the cerebellum which motor signals have arrived at the anterior horns; this feedback is called the efference copy of the anterior horn motor drive.

The spinocerebellar pathways can transmit impulses at velocities up to $120 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$, which is the most rapid conduction in any pathway in the central nervous system. This speed is important for instantaneous appraisal of the cerebellum of changes in peripheral muscle actions.

In addition to signals from the spinocerebellar tracts, signals are transmitted into the cerebellum from the body periphery through the spinal dorsal columns to the dorsal column nuclei of the medulla and are then relayed to the cerebellum. Likewise, signals are transmitted up the spinal cord through the spinoreticular pathway to the reticular formation of the brain stem and also through the spinoolivary pathway to the inferior olivary nucleus. Signals are then relayed from both of these areas to the cerebellum. Thus, the cerebellum continually collects information about the movements and positions of all parts of the body even though it is operating at a subconscious level.

Figure 57-6 Principal efferent tracts from the cerebellum.

## Output Signals From the Cerebellum

Deep Cerebellar Nuclei and the Efferent Pathways. Located deep in the cerebellar mass on each side are three deep cerebellar nuclei-the dentate, interposed, and fastigial. (The vestibular nuclei in the medulla also function in some respects as if they were deep cerebellar nuclei because of their direct connections with the cortex of the flocculonodular lobe.) All the deep cerebellar nuclei receive signals from two sources: (1) the cerebellar cortex and (2) the deep sensory afferent tracts to the cerebellum.

Each time an input signal arrives in the cerebellum, it divides and goes in two directions: (1) directly to one of the cerebellar deep nuclei and (2) to a corresponding area of the cerebellar cortex overlying the deep nucleus. Then, a fraction of a second later, the cerebellar cortex relays an inhibitory output signal to the deep nucleus. Thus, all input signals that enter the cerebellum eventually end in the deep nuclei in the form of initial excitatory signals followed a fraction of a second later by inhibitory signals. From the deep nuclei, output signals leave the cerebellum and are distributed to other parts of the brain.

The general plan of the major efferent pathways leading out of the cerebellum is shown in Figure 57-6 and consists of the following pathways:

1. A pathway that originates in the midline structures of the cerebellum (the vermis) and then passes through the fastigial nuclei into the medullary and pontile regions of the brain stem. This circuit functions in close association with the equilibrium apparatus and brain stem vestibular nuclei to control equilibrium, as well as in association with the reticular formation of the brain stem to control the postural attitudes of the body. It was discussed in detail in Chapter 56 in relation to equilibrium.
2. A pathway that originates in (1) the intermediate zone of the cerebellar hemisphere and then passes through (2) the interposed nucleus to (3) the ventrolateral and ventroanterior nuclei of the thalamus and then to (4) the cerebral cortex to (5) several midline structures of the thalamus and then to (6) the basal ganglia and (7) the red nucleus and reticular formation of the upper

portion of the brain stem. This complex circuit mainly helps coordinate the reciprocal contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles in the peripheral portions of the limbs, especially in the hands, fingers, and thumbs.
3. A pathway that begins in the cerebellar cortex of the lateral zone of the cerebellar hemisphere and then passes to the dentate nucleus, next to the ventrolateral and ventroanterior nuclei of the thalamus, and, finally, to the cerebral cortex. This pathway plays an important role in helping coordinate sequential motor activities initiated by the cerebral cortex.

## FUNCTIONAL UNIT OF THE CEREBELLAR CORTEX-THE PURKINJE AND DEEP NUCLEAR CELLS

The cerebellum has about 30 million nearly identical functional units, one of which is shown to the left in Figure 57-7. This functional unit centers on a single, very large Purkinje cell and on a corresponding deep nuclear cell.

To the top and right in Figure 57-7, the three major layers of the cerebellar cortex are shown: the molecular layer, Purkinje cell layer, and granule cell layer. Beneath these cortical layers, in the center of the cerebellar mass, are the deep cerebellar nuclei that send output signals to other parts of the nervous system.

Neuronal Circuit of the Functional Unit. Also shown in the left half of Figure 57-7 is the neuronal circuit of the functional unit, which is repeated with little variation 30 million times in the cerebellum. The output from the functional unit is from a deep nuclear cell. This cell is continually under both excitatory and inhibitory influences. The excitatory influences arise from direct connections with afferent fibers that enter the cerebellum from

the brain or the periphery. The inhibitory influence arises entirely from the Purkinje cell in the cortex of the cerebellum.

The afferent inputs to the cerebellum are mainly of two types, one called the climbing fiber type and the other called the mossy fiber type.

The climbing fibers all originate from the inferior olives of the medulla. There is one climbing fiber for about 5 to 10 Purkinje cells. After sending branches to several deep nuclear cells, the climbing fiber continues all the way to the outer layers of the cerebellar cortex, where it makes about 300 synapses with the soma and dendrites of each Purkinje cell. This climbing fiber is distinguished by the fact that a single impulse in it will always cause a single, prolonged (up to 1 second), peculiar type of action potential in each Purkinje cell with which it connects, beginning with a strong spike and followed by a trail of weakening secondary spikes. This action potential is called the complex spike.

The mossy fibers are all the other fibers that enter the cerebellum from multiple sources-the higher brain, brain stem, and spinal cord. These fibers also send collaterals to excite the deep nuclear cells. They then proceed to the granule cell layer of the cortex, where they also synapse with hundreds to thousands of granule cells. In turn, the granule cells send extremely small axons, less than 1 micrometer in diameter, up to the molecular layer on the outer surface of the cerebellar cortex. Here the axons divide into two branches that extend 1 to 2 millimeters in each direction parallel to the folia. Many millions of these parallel nerve fibers exist because there are some 500 to 1000 granule cells for every 1 Purkinje cell. It is into this molecular layer that the dendrites of the Purkinje cells project and 80,000 to 200,000 of the parallel fibers synapse with each Purkinje cell.

The mossy fiber input to the Purkinje cell is quite different from the climbing fiber input because the synaptic connections are weak, so large numbers of mossy fibers must be stimulated simultaneously to excite the Purkinje cell. Furthermore, activation usually takes the form of a much weaker, short-duration Purkinje cell action potential called a simple spike, rather than the prolonged complex action potential caused by climbing fiber input.

Purkinje Cells and Deep Nuclear Cells Fire Continuously Under Normal Resting Conditions. One characteristic of both Purkinje cells and deep nuclear cells is that normally both of them fire continuously; the Purkinje cell fires at about 50 to 100 action potentials per second, and the deep nuclear cells fire at much higher rates. Furthermore, the output activity of both these cells can be modulated upward or downward.

Balance Between Excitation and Inhibition at the Deep Cerebellar Nuclei. Referring again to the circuit of Figure 57-7, note that direct stimulation of the deep nu-
clear cells by both the climbing and the mossy fibers excites them. By contrast, signals arriving from the Purkinje cells inhibit them. Normally, the balance between these two effects is slightly in favor of excitation so that under quiet conditions, output from the deep nuclear cell remains relatively constant at a moderate level of continuous stimulation.

In execution of a rapid motor movement, the initiating signal from the cerebral motor cortex or brain stem at first greatly increases deep nuclear cell excitation. Then, another few milliseconds later, feedback inhibitory signals from the Purkinje cell circuit arrive. In this way, there is first a rapid excitatory signal sent by the deep nuclear cells into the motor output pathway to enhance the motor movement, followed within another small fraction of a second by an inhibitory signal. This inhibitory signal resembles a "delay line" negative feedback signal of the type that is effective in providing damping. That is, when the motor system is excited, a negative feedback signal occurs after a short delay to stop the muscle movement from overshooting its mark. Otherwise, oscillation of the movement would occur.

Basket Cells and Stellate Cells Cause Lateral Inhibition of Purkinje Cells in the Cerebellum. In addition to the deep nuclear cells, granule cells, and Purkinje cells, two other types of neurons are located in the cerebel-lum-basket cells and stellate cells, which are inhibitory cells with short axons. Both the basket cells and the stellate cells are located in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex, lying among and stimulated by the small parallel fibers. These cells in turn send their axons at right angles across the parallel fibers and cause lateral inhibition of adjacent Purkinje cells, thus sharpening the signal in the same manner that lateral inhibition sharpens contrast of signals in many other neuronal circuits of the nervous system.

## Turn-On/Turn-Off and Turn-Off/Turn-On Output Signals From the Cerebellum

The typical function of the cerebellum is to help provide rapid turn-on signals for the agonist muscles and simultaneous reciprocal turn-off signals for the antagonist muscles at the onset of a movement. Then, on approaching termination of the movement, the cerebellum is mainly responsible for timing and executing the turn-off signals to the agonists and the turn-on signals to the antagonists. Although the exact details are not fully known, one can speculate from the basic cerebellar circuit of Figure 57-7 how this process might work, as follows.

Let us suppose that the turn-on/turn-off pattern of agonist/antagonist contraction at the onset of movement begins with signals from the cerebral cortex. These signals pass through noncerebellar brain stem and cord pathways directly to the agonist muscle to begin the initial contraction.

At the same time, parallel signals are sent by way of the pontile mossy fibers into the cerebellum. One branch of each mossy fiber goes directly to deep nuclear cells in the dentate or other deep cerebellar nuclei, which instantly sends an excitatory signal back into the cerebral corticospinal motor system, either by way of return signals through the thalamus to the cerebral cortex or by way of neuronal circuitry in the brain stem, to support the muscle contraction signal that had already been begun by the cerebral cortex. As a consequence, the turn-on signal, after a few milliseconds, becomes even more powerful than it was at the start because it becomes the sum of both the cortical and the cerebellar signals. This effect is the normal effect when the cerebellum is intact, but in the absence of the cerebellum, the secondary extra supportive signal is missing. This cerebellar support makes the turn-on muscle contraction much stronger than it would be if the cerebellum did not exist.

Now, what causes the turn-off signal for the agonist muscles at the termination of the movement? Remember that all mossy fibers have a second branch that transmits signals by way of the granule cells to the cerebellar cortex and, eventually, by way of "parallel" fibers, to the Purkinje cells. The Purkinje cells in turn inhibit the deep nuclear cells. This pathway passes through some of the smallest, slowest-conducting nerve fibers in the nervous system-that is, the parallel fibers of the cerebellar cortical molecular layer, which have diameters of only a fraction of a millimeter. Also, the signals from these fibers are weak, so they require a finite period to build up enough excitation in the dendrites of the Purkinje cell to excite it. However, once the Purkinje cell is excited, it sends a strong inhibitory signal to the same deep nuclear cell that had originally turned on the movement. Therefore, this signal helps turn off the movement after a short time.

Thus, one can see how the complete cerebellar circuit could cause a rapid turn-on agonist muscle contraction at the beginning of a movement and yet also cause a precisely timed turn-off of the same agonist contraction after a given period.

Now, let us speculate on the circuit for the antagonist muscles. Most important, remember that there are reciprocal agonist-antagonist circuits throughout the spinal cord for virtually every movement that the cord can initiate. Therefore, these circuits are part of the basis for antagonist turn-off at the onset of movement and then turn-on at termination of movement, mirroring whatever occurs in the agonist muscles. But also remember that the cerebellum contains several other types of inhibitory cells besides Purkinje cells. The functions of some of these cells are still to be determined; they, too, could play roles in the initial inhibition of the antagonist muscles at onset of a movement and subsequent excitation at the end of a movement.

These mechanisms are still partly speculation. They are presented here to illustrate ways by which the cerebellum could cause exaggerated turn-on and turn-off signals, thus controlling the agonist and antagonist muscles, as well as the timing.

## The Purkinje Cells "Learn" to Correct Motor Errors—Role of the Climbing Fibers

The degree to which the cerebellum supports onset and offset of muscle contractions, as well as timing of contractions, must be learned by the cerebellum. Typically, when a person first performs a new motor act, the degree of motor enhancement by the cerebellum at the onset of contraction, the degree of inhibition at the end of contraction, and the timing of these are almost always incorrect for precise movements. However, after the act has been performed many times, the individual events become progressively more precise, sometimes requiring only a few movements before the desired result is achieved, but at other times requiring hundreds of movements.

How do these adjustments come about? The exact answer is not known, although it is known that sensitivity levels of cerebellar circuits progressively adapt during the training process, especially the sensitivity of the Purkinje cells to respond to the granule cell excitation. Furthermore, this sensitivity change is brought about by signals from the climbing fibers entering the cerebellum from the inferior olivary complex.

Under resting conditions, the climbing fibers fire about once per second, but they cause extreme depolarization of the entire dendritic tree of the Purkinje cell, lasting for up to 1 second, each time they fire. During this time, the Purkinje cell fires with one initial strong output spike, followed by a series of diminishing spikes. When a person performs a new movement for the first time, feedback signals from the muscle and joint proprioceptors will usually denote to the cerebellum how much the actual movement fails to match the intended movement, and the climbing fiber signals alter the long-term sensitivity of the Purkinje cells in some way. Over a period, this change in sensitivity, along with other possible "learning" functions of the cerebellum, is believed to make the timing and other aspects of cerebellar control of movements approach perfection. When this state has been achieved, the climbing fibers no longer need to send "error" signals to the cerebellum to cause further change.

## FUNCTION OF THE CEREBELLUM IN OVERALL MOTOR CONTROL

The nervous system uses the cerebellum to coordinate motor control functions at three levels:

1. The vestibulocerebellum. This level consists principally of the small flocculonodular cerebellar lobes that lie under the posterior cerebellum and adjacent portions of the vermis. It provides neural circuits for most of the body's equilibrium movements.

2. The spinocerebellum. This level consists of most of the vermis of the posterior and anterior cerebellum plus the adjacent intermediate zones on both sides of the vermis. It provides the circuitry for coordinating mainly movements of the distal portions of the limbs, especially the hands and fingers.
3. The cerebrocerebellum. This level consists of the large lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres, lateral to the intermediate zones. It receives virtually all its input from the cerebral motor cortex and adjacent premotor and somatosensory cortices of the cerebrum. It transmits its output information in the upward direction back to the brain, functioning in a feedback manner with the cerebral cortical sensorimotor system to plan sequential voluntary body and limb movements. These movements are planned as much as tenths of a second in advance of the actual movements. This process is called development of "motor imagery" of movements to be performed.

## The Vestibulocerebellum Functions in Association With the Brain Stem and Spinal Cord to Control Equilibrium and Postural Movements

The vestibulocerebellum originated phylogenetically at about the same time that the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear developed. Furthermore, as discussed in Chapter 56, loss of the flocculonodular lobes and adjacent portions of the vermis of the cerebellum, which constitute the vestibulocerebellum, causes extreme disturbance of equilibrium and postural movements.

In people with vestibulocerebellar dysfunction, equilibrium is far more disturbed during performance of rapid motions than during inactivity, especially when these movements involve changes in direction of movement and stimulate the semicircular ducts. This phenomenon suggests that the vestibulocerebellum is important in controlling balance between agonist and antagonist muscle contractions of the spine, hips, and shoulders during rapid changes in body positions as required by the vestibular apparatus.

One of the major problems in controlling balance is the amount of time required to transmit position signals and velocity of movement signals from the different parts of the body to the brain. Even when the most rapidly conducting sensory pathways are used, up to 120 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}$ in the spinocerebellar afferent tracts, the delay for transmission from the feet to the brain is still 15 to 20 milliseconds. The feet of a person running rapidly can move as much as 10 inches during that time. Therefore, it is never possible for return signals from the peripheral parts of the body to reach the brain at the same time that the movements actually occur. How, then, is it possible for the brain to know when to stop a movement and to perform the next sequential act when the movements are
![gu338617462c](gu338617462c.jpg)

Figure 57-8 Cerebral and cerebellar control of voluntary movements, involving especially the intermediate zone of the cerebellum.
performed rapidly? The answer is that the signals from the periphery tell the brain how rapidly and in which directions the body parts are moving. It is then the function of the vestibulocerebellum to calculate in advance from these rates and directions where the different parts will be during the next few milliseconds. The results of these calculations are the key to the brain's progression to the next sequential movement.

Thus, during control of equilibrium, it is presumed that information from both the body periphery and the vestibular apparatus is used in a typical feedback control circuit to provide anticipatory correction of postural motor signals necessary for maintaining equilibrium even during extremely rapid motion, including rapidly changing directions of motion.

## Spinocerebellum—Feedback Control of Distal Limb Movements via the Intermediate Cerebellar Cortex and the Interposed Nucleus

As shown in Figure 57-8, the intermediate zone of each cerebellar hemisphere receives two types of information when a movement is performed: (1) information from the cerebral motor cortex and from the midbrain red nucleus, telling the cerebellum the intended sequential plan of movement for the next few fractions of a second; and (2) feedback information from the peripheral parts of the body, especially from the distal proprioceptors of the limbs, telling the cerebellum what actual movements result.

After the intermediate zone of the cerebellum has compared the intended movements with the actual movements, the deep nuclear cells of the interposed nucleus send corrective output signals (1) back to the cerebral motor cortex through relay nuclei in the thalamus and (2) to the magnocellular portion (the lower portion) of the red nucleus that gives rise to the rubrospinal tract. The rubrospinal tract in turn joins the corticospinal tract in innervating the lateralmost motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord gray matter, the neurons that control the distal parts of the limbs, particularly the hands and fingers.

This part of the cerebellar motor control system provides smooth, coordinated movements of the agonist and antagonist muscles of the distal limbs for performing acute purposeful patterned movements. The cerebellum seems to compare the "intentions" of the higher levels of the motor control system, as transmitted to the intermediate cerebellar zone through the corticopontocerebellar tract, with the "performance" by the respective parts of the body, as transmitted back to the cerebellum from the periphery. In fact, the ventral spinocerebellar tract even transmits back to the cerebellum an "efference" copy of the actual motor control signals that reach the anterior motor neurons, and this information is also integrated with the signals arriving from the muscle spindles and other proprioceptor sensory organs, transmitted principally in the dorsal spinocerebellar tract. Similar comparator signals also go to the inferior olivary complex; if the signals do not compare favorably, the olivary-Purkinje cell system, along with possibly other cerebellar learning mechanisms, eventually corrects the motions until they perform the desired function.

## Function of the Cerebellum to Prevent Overshoot and

to "Damp" Movements. Almost all movements of the body are "pendular." For example, when an arm is moved, momentum develops, and the momentum must be overcome before the movement can be stopped. Because of momentum, all pendular movements have a tendency to overshoot. If overshooting occurs in a person whose cerebellum has been destroyed, the conscious centers of the cerebrum eventually recognize this error and initiate a movement in the reverse direction to attempt to bring the arm to its intended position. However, the arm, by virtue of its momentum, overshoots once more in the opposite direction, and appropriate corrective signals must again be instituted. Thus, the arm oscillates back and forth past its intended point for several cycles before it finally fixes on its mark. This effect is called an action tremor or intention tremor.

If the cerebellum is intact, appropriate learned, subconscious signals stop the movement precisely at the intended point, thereby preventing the overshoot and the tremor. This activity is the basic characteristic of a damping system. All control systems regulating pendular elements that have inertia must have damping circuits built
into the mechanisms. For motor control by the nervous system, the cerebellum provides most of this damping function.

Cerebellar Control of Ballistic Movements. Most rapid movements of the body, such as the movements of the fingers in typing, occur so rapidly that it is not possible to receive feedback information either from the periphery to the cerebellum or from the cerebellum back to the motor cortex before the movements are over. These movements are called ballistic movements, meaning that the entire movement is preplanned and set into motion to go a specific distance and then to stop. Another important example is the saccadic movements of the eyes, in which the eyes jump from one position to the next when reading or when looking at successive points along a road as a person is moving in a car.

Three major changes occur in these ballistic movements when the cerebellum is removed: (1) the movements are slow to develop and do not have the extra onset surge that the cerebellum usually provides; (2) the force developed is weak; and (3) the movements are slow to turn off, usually allowing the movement to go well beyond the intended mark. Therefore, in the absence of the cerebellar circuit, the motor cortex has to think extra hard to turn ballistic movements on and off. Thus, the automatism of ballistic movements is lost.

Considering once again the circuitry of the cerebellum, one sees that it is beautifully organized to perform this biphasic, first excitatory and then delayed inhibitory function that is required for preplanned rapid ballistic movements. Also, the built-in timing circuits of the cerebellar cortex are fundamental to this particular ability of the cerebellum.

## Cerebrocerebellum-Function of the Large Lateral Zone of the Cerebellar Hemisphere to Plan, Sequence, and Time Complex Movements

In humans the lateral zones of the two cerebellar hemispheres are highly developed and greatly enlarged. This characteristic goes along with human abilities to plan and perform intricate sequential patterns of movement, especially with the hands and fingers, and to speak. Yet, the large lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres have no direct input of information from the peripheral parts of the body. In addition, almost all communication between these lateral cerebellar areas and the cerebral cortex is not with the primary cerebral motor cortex but instead with the premotor area and primary and association somatosensory areas.

Even so, destruction of the lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres, along with their deep nuclei, the dentate nuclei, can lead to extreme incoordination of complex purposeful movements of the hands, fingers, and feet and of the speech apparatus. This condition has been difficult to understand because there is no direct communication

between this part of the cerebellum and the primary motor cortex. However, experimental studies suggest that these portions of the cerebellum are concerned with two other important but indirect aspects of motor control: (1) planning of sequential movements and (2) "timing" of the sequential movements.

Planning of Sequential Movements. The planning of sequential movements requires that the lateral zones of the hemispheres communicate with both the premotor and sensory portions of the cerebral cortex, and it requires two-way communication between these cerebral cortex areas with corresponding areas of the basal ganglia. It seems that the "plan" of sequential movements actually begins in the sensory and premotor areas of the cerebral cortex, and from there the plan is transmitted to the lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres. Then, amid much two-way traffic between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex, appropriate motor signals provide transition from one sequence of movements to the next.

An interesting observation that supports this view is that many neurons in the cerebellar dentate nuclei display the activity pattern for the sequential movement that is yet to come while the present movement is still occurring. Thus, the lateral cerebellar zones appear to be involved not with what movement is happening at a given moment but with what will be happening during the next sequential movement a fraction of a second or perhaps even seconds later.

To summarize, one of the most important features of normal motor function is one's ability to progress smoothly from one movement to the next in orderly succession. In the absence of the large lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres, this capability is seriously disturbed for rapid movements.

Timing Function for Sequential Movements. Another important function of the lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres is to provide appropriate timing for each succeeding movement. In the absence of these cerebellar zones, one loses the subconscious ability to predict how far the different parts of the body will move in a given time. Without this timing capability, the person becomes unable to determine when the next sequential movement needs to begin. As a result, the succeeding movement may begin too early or, more likely, too late. Therefore, lesions in the lateral zones of the cerebellum cause complex movements (e.g., those required for writing, running, or even talking) to become incoordinate and lacking ability to progress in orderly sequence from one movement to the next. Such cerebellar lesions are said to cause failure of smooth progression of movements.

## Extramotor Predictive Functions of the Cerebrocerebellum. The cerebrocerebellum (the large lateral lobes) also helps to "time" events other than movements of the body. For example, the rates of progression of both auditory and visual phenomena can be predicted by the brain,

but both of these require cerebellar participation. As an example, a person can predict from the changing visual scene how rapidly he or she is approaching an object. A striking experiment that demonstrates the importance of the cerebellum in this ability is the effects of removing the large lateral portions of the cerebellum in monkeys. Such a monkey occasionally charges into the wall of a corridor because it is unable to predict when it will reach the wall.

It is quite possible that the cerebellum provides a "time base," perhaps using time-delay circuits, against which signals from other parts of the central nervous system can be compared. It is often stated that the cerebellum is particularly helpful in interpreting rapidly changing spatiotemporal relations in sensory information.

## Clinical Abnormalities of the Cerebellum

Destruction of small portions of the lateral cerebellar cortex seldom causes detectable abnormalities in motor function. In fact, several months after as much as one-half of the lateral cerebellar cortex on one side of the brain has been removed, if the deep cerebellar nuclei are not removed along with the cortex, the motor functions of the animal appear to be almost normal as long as the animal performs all movements slowly. Thus, the remaining portions of the motor control system are capable of compensating to a great extent for loss of parts of the cerebellum.

To cause serious and continuing dysfunction of the cerebellum, the cerebellar lesion usually must involve one or more of the deep cerebellar nuclei-the dentate, interposed, or fastigial nuclei.

## Dysmetria and Ataxia

Two of the most important symptoms of cerebellar disease are dysmetria and ataxia. In the absence of the cerebellum, the subconscious motor control system cannot predict how far movements will go. Therefore, the movements ordinarily overshoot their intended mark; then, the conscious portion of the brain overcompensates in the opposite direction for the succeeding compensatory movement. This effect is called dysmetria, and it results in uncoordinated movements that are called ataxia. Dysmetria and ataxia can also result from lesions in the spinocerebellar tracts because feedback information from the moving parts of the body to the cerebellum is essential for cerebellar timing of movement termination.

## Past Pointing

Past pointing means that in the absence of the cerebellum, a person ordinarily moves the hand or some other moving part of the body considerably beyond the point of intention. This movement results from the fact that normally the cerebellum initiates most of the motor signal that turns off a movement after it is begun; if the cerebellum is not available to initiate this motor signal, the movement ordinarily goes beyond the intended mark. Therefore, past pointing is actually a manifestation of dysmetria.

## Failure of Progression

Dysdiadochokinesia-Inability to Perform Rapid Alternating Movements. When the motor control system fails to predict where the different parts of the body will be at a given time, it "loses" perception of the parts during rapid motor

movements. As a result, the succeeding movement may begin much too early or much too late, so no orderly "progression of movement" can occur. One can demonstrate this effect readily by having a patient with cerebellar damage turn one hand upward and downward at a rapid rate. The patient rapidly "loses" all perception of the instantaneous position of the hand during any portion of the movement. As a result, a series of stalled attempted but jumbled movements occurs instead of the normal coordinate upward and downward motions. This condition is called dyodiadochokinesia.

Dysarthria-Failure of Progression in Talking. Another example in which failure of progression occurs is in talking because the formation of words depends on rapid and orderly succession of individual muscle movements in the larynx, mouth, and respiratory system. Lack of coordination among these structures and the inability to adjust in advance either the intensity of sound or the duration of each successive sound causes jumbled vocalization, with some syllables loud, some weak, some held for long intervals, and some held for short intervals, with resultant speech that is often unintelligible. This condition is called dysarthria.

Cerebellar Nystagmus-Tremor of the Eyeballs. Cerebellar nystagmus is tremor of the eyeballs that usually occurs when one attempts to fixate the eyes on a scene to one side of the head. This off-center type of fixation results in rapid, tremulous movements of the eyes rather than steady fixation, and it is another manifestation of the failure of damping by the cerebellum. It occurs especially when the flocculonodular lobes of the cerebellum are damaged; in this case, it is also associated with loss of equilibrium because of dysfunction of the pathways through the flocculonodular cerebellum from the semicircular ducts.

## Hypotonia-Decreased Tone of the Musculature

Loss of the deep cerebellar nuclei, particularly of the dentate and interposed nuclei, causes decreased tone of the peripheral body musculature on the side of the cerebellar lesion. The hypotonia results from loss of cerebellar facilitation of the motor cortex and brain stem motor nuclei by tonic signals from the deep cerebellar nuclei.

## THE BASAL GANGLIA AND THEIR MOTOR FUNCTIONS

The basal ganglia, like the cerebellum, constitute another accessory motor system that functions usually not by itself but in close association with the cerebral cortex and corticospinal motor control system. In fact, the basal ganglia receive most of their input signals from the cerebral cortex and also return almost all their output signals back to the cortex.

Figure 57-9 shows the anatomical relationships of the basal ganglia to other structures of the brain. On each side of the brain, these ganglia consist of the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus. They are located mainly lateral to and surrounding the thalamus, occupying a large portion of the interior regions of both cerebral hemispheres. Almost all motor and sensory nerve fibers connecting the
cerebral cortex and spinal cord pass through the space that lies between the major masses of the basal ganglia, the caudate nucleus and the putamen. This space is called the internal capsule of the brain. It is important for our current discussion because of the intimate association between the basal ganglia and the corticospinal system for motor control.

## NEURONAL CIRCUITRY OF THE BASAL GANGLIA

The anatomical connections between the basal ganglia and the other brain elements that provide motor control are complex, as shown in Figure 57-10. To the left is shown the motor cortex, thalamus, and associated brain stem and cerebellar circuitry. To the right is the major circuitry of the basal ganglia system, showing the tremendous interconnections among the basal ganglia plus extensive input and output pathways between the other motor regions of the brain and the basal ganglia.

In the next few sections we concentrate especially on two major circuits, the putamen circuit and the caudate circuit.

## FUNCTION OF THE BASAL GANGLIA IN EXECUTING PATTERNS OF MOTOR ACTIVITY-THE PUTAMEN CIRCUIT

One of the principal roles of the basal ganglia in motor control is to function in association with the corticospinal system to control complex patterns of motor activity. An example is the writing of letters of the alphabet. When the basal ganglia sustain serious damage, the cortical system of motor control can no longer provide these patterns. Instead, one's writing becomes crude, as if one were learning how to write for the first time.

Other patterns that require the basal ganglia are cutting paper with scissors, hammering nails, shooting a basketball through a hoop, passing a football, throwing a baseball, the movements of shoveling dirt, most aspects of vocalization, controlled movements of the eyes, and virtually any other of our skilled movements, most of them performed subconsciously.

Neural Pathways of the Putamen Circuit. Figure 5711 shows the principal pathways through the basal ganglia for executing learned patterns of movement. They begin mainly in the premotor and supplementary areas of the motor cortex and in the somatosensory areas of the sensory cortex. Next they pass to the putamen (mainly bypassing the caudate nucleus), then to the internal portion of the globus pallidus, and next to the ventroanterior and ventrolateral relay nuclei of the thalamus, and they finally return to the cerebral primary motor cortex and to portions of the premotor and supplementary cerebral areas closely associated with the primary motor cortex. Thus, the putamen circuit has its inputs mainly from the

parts of the brain adjacent to the primary motor cortex but not much from the primary motor cortex itself. Then its outputs do go mainly back to the primary motor cortex or closely associated premotor and supplementary cortex. Functioning in close association with this primary

putamen circuit are ancillary circuits that pass from the putamen through the external globus pallidus, the subthalamus, and the substantia nigra-finally returning to the motor cortex by way of the thalamus.

Abnormal Function in the Putamen Circuit: Athetosis, Hemiballismus, and Chorea. How does the putamen circuit function to help execute patterns of movement? Little is known about this function. However, when a portion of the circuit is damaged or blocked, certain patterns of movement become severely abnormal. For example, lesions in the globus pallidus frequently lead to spontaneous and often continuous writhing movements of a hand, an arm, the neck, or the face. These movements are called athetosis.

![gu378617462c](gu378617462c.jpg)

Figure 57-12 Caudate circuit through the basal ganglia for cognitive planning of sequential and parallel motor patterns to achieve specific conscious goals.

A lesion in the subthalamus often leads to sudden flailing movements of an entire limb, a condition called hemiballismus.

Multiple small lesions in the putamen lead to flicking movements in the hands, face, and other parts of the body, called chorea.

Lesions of the substantia nigra lead to the common and extremely severe disease of rigidity, akinesia, and tremors known as Parkinson's disease, which we discuss in more detail later in this chapter.

## ROLE OF THE BASAL GANGLIA FOR COGNITIVE CONTROL OF MOTOR PATTERN SEQUENCES-THE CAUDATE CIRCUIT

The term cognition means the thinking processes of the brain, using both sensory input to the brain plus information already stored in memory. Most of our motor actions occur as a consequence of thoughts generated in the mind, a process called cognitive control of motor activity. The caudate nucleus plays a major role in this cognitive control of motor activity.

The neural connections between the caudate nucleus and the corticospinal motor control system, shown in Figure 57-12, are somewhat different from those of the putamen circuit. Part of the reason for this difference is that the caudate nucleus, as shown in Figure 57-9, extends into all lobes of the cerebrum, beginning anteriorly in the frontal lobes, then passing posteriorly through the parietal and occipital lobes, and finally curving forward again like the letter "C" into the temporal lobes. Furthermore, the caudate nucleus receives large amounts of its input from the association areas of the cerebral cortex overlying
the caudate nucleus, mainly areas that also integrate the different types of sensory and motor information into usable thought patterns.

After the signals pass from the cerebral cortex to the caudate nucleus, they are transmitted to the internal globus pallidus, then to the relay nuclei of the ventroanterior and ventrolateral thalamus, and finally back to the prefrontal, premotor, and supplementary motor areas of the cerebral cortex, but with almost none of the returning signals passing directly to the primary motor cortex. Instead, the returning signals go to the accessory motor regions in the premotor and supplementary motor areas that are concerned with building sequential patterns of movement lasting 5 seconds or more instead of exciting individual muscle movements.

A good example of this phenomenon would be a person seeing a lion approach and then responding instantaneously and automatically by (1) turning away from the lion, (2) beginning to run, and (3) even attempting to climb a tree. Without the cognitive functions, the person might not have the instinctive knowledge, without thinking for too long a time, to respond quickly and appropriately. Thus, cognitive control of motor activity determines subconsciously, and within seconds, which patterns of movement will be used together to achieve a complex goal that might itself last for many seconds.

## FUNCTION OF THE BASAL GANGLIA TO CHANGE THE TIMING AND TO SCALE THE INTENSITY OF MOVEMENTS

Two important capabilities of the brain in controlling movement are to (1) determine how rapidly the movement is to be performed and (2) control how large the movement will be. For example, a person may write the letter "a" slowly or rapidly. Also, he or she may write a small "a" on a piece of paper or a large "A" on a chalkboard. Regardless of the choice, the proportional characteristics of the letter remain nearly the same.

In patients with severe lesions of the basal ganglia, these timing and scaling functions are poor-in fact, sometimes they are nonexistent. Here again, the basal ganglia do not function alone; rather, they function in close association with the cerebral cortex. One especially important cortical area is the posterior parietal cortex, which is the locus of the spatial coordinates for motor control of all parts of the body, as well as for the relationship of the body and its parts to all its surroundings. Damage to this area does not produce simple deficits of sensory perception, such as loss of tactile sensation, blindness, or deafness. Instead, lesions of the posterior parietal cortex produce an inability to perceive objects accurately through normally functioning sensory mechanisms, a condition called agnosia. Figure 57-13 shows how a person with a lesion in the right posterior parietal cortex might try to copy drawings.

![gu388617462c](gu388617462c.jpg)

Figure 57-13 Illustration of drawings that might be made by a person who has neglect syndrome caused by severe damage in his or her right posterior parietal cortex compared with the actual drawing the patient was requested to copy. Note that the person's ability to copy the left side of the drawings is severely impaired.

In these cases, the patient's ability to copy the left side of the drawings is severely impaired. Also, such a person will always try to avoid using his or her left arm, left hand, or other portions of his or her left body for the performance of tasks; the person may not even wash this side of the body (personal neglect syndrome), almost not knowing that these parts of the body exist.

Because the caudate circuit of the basal ganglial system functions mainly with association areas of the cerebral cortex, such as the posterior parietal cortex, presumably the timing and scaling of movements are functions of this caudate cognitive motor control circuit. However, our understanding of basal ganglia function is still so imprecise that much of what is discussed in the last few sections is analytical deduction rather than proven fact.

## FUNCTIONS OF SPECIFIC NEUROTRANSMITTER SUBSTANCES IN THE BASAL GANGLIAL SYSTEM

Figure 57-14 demonstrates the interplay of several specific neurotransmitters that are known to function in the basal ganglia, showing the following: (1) dopamine pathways from the substantia nigra to the caudate nucleus and putamen; (2) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathways from the caudate nucleus and putamen to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra; (3) acetylcholine pathways from the cortex to the caudate nucleus and putamen; and (4) multiple general pathways from the brain stem that secrete norepinephrine, serotonin, enkephalin, and several
![gu398617462c](gu398617462c.jpg)

Figure 57-14 Neuronal pathways that secrete different types of neurotransmitter substances in the basal ganglia. Ach, Acetylcholine; GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid.
other neurotransmitters in the basal ganglia, as well as in other parts of the cerebrum. In addition to all these are multiple glutamate pathways that provide most of the excitatory signals (not shown in the figure) that balance out the large numbers of inhibitory signals transmitted especially by the dopamine, GABA, and serotonin inhibitory transmitters. We have more to say about some of these neurotransmitter and hormonal systems in subsequent sections when we discuss diseases of the basal ganglia, as well as in subsequent chapters when we discuss behavior, sleep, wakefulness, and functions of the autonomic nervous system.

For the present, it should be remembered that GABA functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Therefore, GABA neurons in the feedback loops from the cortex through the basal ganglia and then back to the cortex make virtually all these loops negative feedback loops, rather than positive feedback loops, thus lending stability to the motor control systems. Dopamine also functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in most parts of the brain, so it also functions as a stabilizer under some conditions.

## Clinical Syndromes Resulting From Damage to the Basal Ganglia

Aside from athetosis and hemiballismus, which have already been mentioned in relation to lesions in the globus pallidus and subthalamus, two other major diseases result from damage in the basal ganglia. These diseases are Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.

## Parkinson's Disease

Parkinson's disease, which is also known as paralysis agitans, results from widespread degeneration of the portion of the substantia nigra (the pars compacta) that sends dopamine-secreting nerve fibers to the caudate nucleus and putamen. The disease is characterized by the following: (1) rigidity of much of the musculature of the body; (2)

involuntary tremor at a fixed rate of 3 to 6 cycles/sec of the involved areas, even when the person is resting; (3) serious difficulty in initiating movement, called akinesia; (4) postural instability caused by impaired postural reflexes, leading to poor balance and falls; and (5) other motor symptoms, including dysphagia (impaired ability to swallow), speech disorders, gait disturbances, and fatigue

The causes of these abnormal motor effects are not fully understood. However, the dopamine secreted in the caudate nucleus and putamen is an inhibitory transmitter; therefore, destruction of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra theoretically would allow the caudate nucleus and putamen to become overly active and possibly cause continuous output of excitatory signals to the corticospinal motor control system. These signals could overly excite many or all of the muscles of the body, thus leading to rigidity in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Some of the feedback circuits might easily oscillate because of high feedback gains after loss of their inhibition, leading to the tremor of Parkinson's disease. This tremor is quite different from that of cerebellar disease because it occurs during all waking hours and therefore is an involuntary tremor, in contradistinction to cerebellar tremor, which occurs only when the person performs intentionally initiated movements.

The akinesia that occurs in Parkinson's disease is often much more distressing to the patient than are the symptoms of muscle rigidity and tremor, because a person with severe Parkinson's disease must exert the highest degree of concentration to perform even the simplest movement. The mental effort, even mental anguish, that is necessary to make the desired movements is often at the limit of the patient's willpower. Then, when the movements do occur, they are usually stiff and staccato in character instead of smooth. The cause of this akinesia is still speculative. However, dopamine secretion in the limbic system, especially in the nucleus accumbens, is often decreased, along with its decrease in the basal ganglia. It has been suggested that this decrease might reduce the psychic drive for motor activity so greatly that akinesia results.

Nonmotor features of Parkinson's disease include sleep disturbances, depression and anxiety, autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive impairment in advanced stages.

Treatment With L-Dopa. Administration of the drug Ldopa to patients with Parkinson's disease usually ameliorates many of the motor disturbances, especially the rigidity and akinesia, but has little beneficial effect on nonmotor symptoms. The reason for the amelioration of motor disorders is believed to be that L-dopa is converted in the brain into dopamine, and the dopamine then restores the normal balance between inhibition and excitation in the caudate nucleus and putamen. Administration of dopamine does not have the same effect because dopamine has a chemical structure that will not allow it to pass through the bloodbrain barrier; the slightly different structure of L-dopa allows it to pass through this barrier.

Treatment With Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors. Another treatment for Parkinson's disease includes drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase, which is responsible for destruction of most of the dopamine after it has been se-
creted. Therefore, any dopamine that is released remains in the basal ganglial tissues for a longer time. In addition, for reasons that are not understood, this treatment helps to slow destruction of the dopamine-secreting neurons in the substantia nigra. Therefore, appropriate combinations of L-dopa therapy along with monoamine oxidase inhibitor therapy usually provide much better treatment than use of one of these drugs alone.

Treatment With Transplanted Fetal Dopamine Cells. Transplantation of fetal dopamine-secreting brain cells into the caudate nuclei and putamen has been used with some short-term success to treat Parkinson's disease. If persistence could be achieved, perhaps this treatment would become the treatment of the future.

## Huntington's Disease (Huntington's Chorea)

Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder that usually begins causing symptoms at age 30 to 40 years. It is characterized at first by flicking movements in individual muscles and then progressive severe distortional movements of the entire body. In addition, severe dementia develops along with the motor dysfunctions.

The abnormal movements of Huntington's disease are believed to be caused by the loss of most of the cell bodies of the GABA-secreting neurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen and the loss of acetylcholine-secreting neurons in many parts of the brain. The axon terminals of the GABA neurons normally inhibit portions of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. This loss of inhibition is believed to allow spontaneous outbursts of globus pallidus and substantia nigra activity that cause the distortional movements.

Dementia in persons with Huntington's disease probably does not result from the loss of GABA neurons but from the loss of acetylcholine-secreting neurons, perhaps especially in the thinking areas of the cerebral cortex.

The abnormal gene that causes Huntington's disease has been found; it has a codon (CAG) that repeats many times and codes for multiple extra glutamine amino acids in the molecular structure of an abnormal neuronal cell protein called huntingtin that causes the symptoms. How this protein causes the disease effects is now the question for major research efforts.

## INTEGRATION OF THE MANY PARTS OF THE TOTAL MOTOR CONTROL SYSTEM

Finally, we will summarize as best we can what is known about overall control of movement. To do this, let us first give a synopsis of the different levels of control.

## SPINAL LEVEL

Programmed in the spinal cord are local patterns of movement for all muscle areas of the body-for example, programmed withdrawal reflexes that pull any part of the body away from a source of pain. The cord is the locus also of complex patterns of rhythmic motions such as to-andfro movement of the limbs for walking, plus reciprocal motions on opposite sides of the body or of the hindlimbs versus the forelimbs in four-legged animals.

All these programs of the cord can be commanded into action by higher levels of motor control, or they can be inhibited while the higher levels take over control.

## HINDBRAIN LEVEL

The hindbrain provides two major functions for general motor control of the body: (1) maintenance of axial tone of the body for the purpose of standing and (2) continuous modification of the degrees of tone in the different muscles in response to information from the vestibular apparatuses for the purpose of maintaining body equilibrium.

## MOTOR CORTEX LEVEL

The motor cortex system provides most of the activating motor signals to the spinal cord. It functions partly by issuing sequential and parallel commands that set into motion various cord patterns of motor action. It can also change the intensities of the different patterns or modify their timing or other characteristics. When needed, the corticospinal system can bypass the cord patterns, replacing them with higher level patterns from the brain stem or cerebral cortex. The cortical patterns are usually complex; also, they can be "learned," whereas cord patterns are mainly determined by heredity and are said to be "hard wired."

Associated Functions of the Cerebellum. The cerebellum functions with all levels of muscle control. It functions with the spinal cord especially to enhance the stretch reflex, so when a contracting muscle encounters an unexpectedly heavy load, a long stretch reflex signal transmitted all the way through the cerebellum and back again to the cord strongly enhances the load-resisting effect of the basic stretch reflex.

At the brain stem level, the cerebellum functions to make the postural movements of the body, especially the rapid movements required by the equilibrium system, smooth and continuous and without abnormal oscillations.

At the cerebral cortex level, the cerebellum operates in association with the cortex to provide many accessory motor functions, especially to provide extra motor force for turning on muscle contraction rapidly at the start of a movement. Near the end of each movement, the cerebellum turns on antagonist muscles at exactly the right time and with proper force to stop the movement at the intended point. Furthermore, almost all aspects of this turn-on/turn-off patterning by the cerebellum can be learned with experience.

The cerebellum functions with the cerebral cortex at still another level of motor control; it helps to program in advance muscle contractions that are required for smooth progression from a present rapid movement in one direction to the next rapid movement in another direction, with all this occurring in a fraction of a second. The neural circuit for this passes from the cerebral cortex to the large lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres and then back to the cerebral cortex.

The cerebellum functions mainly when rapid muscle movements are required. Without the cerebellum, slow and calculated movements can still occur, but it is difficult for the corticospinal system to achieve rapid and changing intended movements to execute a particular goal or especially to progress smoothly from one rapid movement to the next.

Associated Functions of the Basal Ganglia. The basal ganglia are essential to motor control in ways entirely different from those of the cerebellum. Their most important functions are (1) to help the cortex execute subconscious but learned patterns of movement and (2) to help plan multiple parallel and sequential patterns of movement that the mind puts together to accomplish a purposeful task.

The types of motor patterns that require the basal ganglia include those for writing all the different letters of the alphabet, for throwing a ball, and for typing. Also, the basal ganglia are required to modify these patterns for writing small or writing very large, thus controlling dimensions of the patterns.

At a still higher level of control is another combined cerebral and basal ganglia circuit, beginning in the thinking processes of the cerebrum to provide overall sequential steps of action for responding to each new situation, such as planning one's immediate motor response to an assailant or one's sequential response to an unexpectedly fond embrace.

## WHAT DRIVES US TO ACTION?

What is it that arouses us from inactivity and sets into play our trains of movement? We are beginning to learn about the motivational systems of the brain. Basically, the brain has an older core located beneath, anterior, and lateral to the thalamus-including the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, septal region anterior to the hypothalamus and thalamus, and even old regions of the thalamus and cerebral cortex. All of these function together to initiate most motor and other functional activities of the brain. These areas are collectively called the limbic system of the brain. We discuss this system in more detail in Chapter 59.

# Cerebral Cortex, Intellectual Functions of the Brain, Learning, and Memory 

It is ironic that of all the parts of the brain, we are the least certain about the functions of the cerebral cortex, even though it is by far the largest and perhaps the most studied portion of the nervous system. However, we do know the effects of damage or stimulation of various portions of the cerebral cortex. In the first part of this chapter, the known cortical functions are discussed, and then basic theories of neuronal mechanisms involved in thought processes, memory, analysis of sensory information, and so forth are presented briefly.

## PHYSIOLOGIC ANATOMY OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX

The functional part of the cerebral cortex is a thin layer of neurons covering the surface of all the convolutions of the cerebrum. This layer is only 2 to 5 millimeters thick, with a total area of about $25 \%$ of a square meter. The total cerebral cortex has been estimated to contain over 80 billion neurons.

Figure 58-1 shows the typical histological structure of the neuronal surface of the cerebral cortex, with its successive layers of different types of neurons. Most of the neurons are of three types: (1) granular (also called stellate); (2) fusiform; and (3) pyramidal, the latter named for their characteristic pyramidal shape.

The granular neurons generally have short axons and, therefore, function mainly as interneurons that transmit neural signals only short distances in the cortex. Some are excitatory, releasing mainly the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, whereas others are inhibitory and release mainly the inhibitory neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA). The sensory areas of the cortex, as well as the association areas between sensory and motor areas, have large concentrations of these granule cells, suggesting a high degree of intracortical processing of incoming sensory signals within the sensory areas and association areas.

The pyramidal and fusiform cells give rise to almost all the output fibers from the cortex. The pyramidal cells, which are larger and more numerous than the fusiform cells, are the source of the long, large nerve fibers that go all the way to the spinal cord. The pyramidal cells also give
rise to most of the large subcortical association fiber bundles that pass from one major part of the brain to another.

To the right in Figure 58-1 is shown the typical organization of nerve fibers within the different layers of the cerebral cortex. Note particularly the large number of horizontal fibers that extend between adjacent areas of the cortex, but note also the vertical fibers that extend to and from the cortex to lower areas of the brain and some all the way to the spinal cord or to distant regions of the cerebral cortex through long association bundles.

The functions of the specific layers of the cerebral cortex are discussed in Chapters 48 and 52. By way of review,

let us recall that most incoming specific sensory signals from the body terminate in cortical layer IV. Most of the output signals leave the cortex through neurons located in layers V and VI, the very large fibers to the brain stem and cord arise generally in layer V, and the tremendous numbers of fibers to the thalamus arise in layer VI. Layers I, II, and III perform most of the intracortical association functions, with especially large numbers of neurons in layers II and III making short horizontal connections with adjacent cortical areas.

## ANATOMICAL AND FUNCTIONAL RELATIONS OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX TO THE THALAMUS AND OTHER LOWER CENTERS

All areas of the cerebral cortex have extensive to-and-fro efferent and afferent connections with deeper structures of the brain. It is important to emphasize the relation between the cerebral cortex and the thalamus. When the thalamus is damaged along with the cortex, the loss of cerebral function is far greater than when the cortex alone is damaged, because thalamic excitation of the cortex is necessary for almost all cortical activity.

Figure 58-2 shows the areas of the cerebral cortex that connect with specific parts of the thalamus. These connections act in two directions, both from the thalamus to the cortex and then from the cortex back to essentially the same area of the thalamus. Furthermore, when the thalamic connections are cut, the functions of the corresponding cortical area become almost entirely lost. Therefore, the cortex operates in close association with the thalamus and can almost be considered both anatomically and functionally a unit with the thalamus; for this reason, the thalamus and the cortex together are sometimes called the thalamocortical system. Almost all pathways from the sensory receptors and sensory organs to the cortex pass through the thalamus, with the principal exception of some sensory pathways of olfaction.

## FUNCTIONS OF SPECIFIC CORTICAL AREAS

Figure 58-3 is a map of some of the functions of different cerebral cortical areas as determined from electrical stimulation of the cortex in awake patients or during neurological examination of patients after portions of their cortex had been removed. The electrically stimulated patients told their thoughts evoked by the stimulation, and sometimes they experienced movements. Occasionally they spontaneously emitted a sound or even a word or gave some other evidence of the stimulation.

Putting large amounts of information together from many different sources gives a more general map, as shown in Figure 58-4. This figure shows the major primary and secondary premotor and supplementary motor areas of the cortex, as well as the major primary and secondary sensory areas for somatic sensation, vision, and hearing, all of which are discussed in earlier chapters. The primary motor areas have direct connections with specific muscles for causing discrete muscle movements. The primary sensory areas detect specific sensations-visual, auditory, or somatictransmitted to the brain from peripheral sensory organs.

The secondary areas make sense out of the signals in the primary areas. For example, the supplementary and premotor areas function along with the primary motor cortex and basal ganglia to provide "patterns" of motor activity. On the sensory side, the secondary sensory areas, located within a few centimeters of the primary areas, begin to analyze the meanings of the specific sensory signals, such as the following: (1) interpretation of the shape or texture

of an object in one's hand; (2) interpretation of color, light intensity, directions of lines and angles, and other aspects of vision; and (3) interpretations of the meanings of sound tones and sequence of tones in the auditory signals.

## ASSOCIATION AREAS

Figure 58-4 also shows several large areas of the cerebral cortex that do not fit into the rigid categories of primary and secondary motor and sensory areas. These areas are called association areas because they receive and analyze signals simultaneously from multiple regions of both the motor and sensory cortices, as well as from subcortical
![gu438617462c](gu438617462c.jpg)

Figure 58-4. Locations of major association areas of the cerebral cortex, as well as primary and secondary motor and sensory areas.
structures. Yet, even the association areas have their specializations. Important association areas include (1) the parieto-occipitotemporal association area, (2) the prefrontal association area, and (3) the limbic association area.

## Parieto-Occipitotemporal Association Area

The parieto-occipitotemporal association area lies in the large parietal and occipital cortical space bounded by the somatosensory cortex anteriorly, the visual cortex posteriorly, and the auditory cortex laterally. As would be expected, it provides a high level of interpretative meaning for signals from all the surrounding sensory areas. However, even the parieto-occipitotemporal association area has its own functional subareas, which are shown in Figure 58-5.

Analysis of the Spatial Coordinates of the Body. An area beginning in the posterior parietal cortex and extending into the superior occipital cortex provides continuous analysis of the spatial coordinates of all parts of the body, as well as of the surroundings of the body. This area receives visual sensory information from the posterior occipital cortex and simultaneous somatosensory information from the anterior parietal cortex. From all this information, it computes the coordinates of the visual, auditory, and body surroundings.

Wernicke's Area Is Important for Language Comprehension. The major area for language comprehension, called Wernicke's area, lies behind the primary auditory cortex in the posterior part of the superior gyrus of the temporal lobe. We discuss this area more fully later; it is one of the most important regions of the entire brain for higher intellectual function because most of these intellectual functions are language based.
![gu448617462c](gu448617462c.jpg)

Figure 58-5. Map of specific functional areas in the cerebral cortex, showing especially Wernicke's and Broca's areas for language comprehension and speech production, which in $95 \%$ of all people are located in the left hemisphere.

The Angular Gyrus Area Is Needed for Initial Processing of Visual Language (Reading). Posterior to the language comprehension area, lying mainly in the anterolateral region of the occipital lobe, is a visual association area that feeds visual information conveyed by words read from a book into Wernicke's area, the language comprehension area. This angular gyrus area is needed to make meaning out of the visually perceived words. In its absence, a person can still have excellent language comprehension through hearing but not through reading; injury to the angular gyrus can result in agraphia (inability to write) with alexia (inability to read), a condition in which a person cannot read, write, or spell words.

Area for Naming Objects. In the most lateral portions of the anterior occipital lobe and posterior temporal lobe is an area for naming objects. The names are learned mainly through auditory input, whereas the physical natures of the objects are learned mainly through visual input. In turn, the names are essential for both auditory and visual language comprehension (functions performed in Wernicke's area located immediately superior to the auditory "names" region and anterior to the visual word processing area).

## Prefrontal Association Area

As discussed in Chapter 57, the prefrontal association area functions in close association with the motor cortex to plan complex patterns and sequences of motor movements. To aid in this function, it receives strong input through a massive subcortical bundle of nerve fibers connecting the parieto-occipitotemporal association area with the prefrontal association area. Through this bundle, the prefrontal cortex receives much preanalyzed sensory information, especially information on the spatial coordinates of the body that is necessary for planning effective movements. Much of the output from the prefrontal area into the motor control system passes through the caudate portion of the basal ganglia-thalamic feedback circuit for motor planning, which provides many of the sequential and parallel components of movement stimulation.

The prefrontal association area is also essential to carrying out "thought" processes. This characteristic presumably results from some of the same capabilities of the prefrontal cortex that allow it to plan motor activities. It seems to be capable of processing nonmotor and motor information from widespread areas of the brain and therefore to achieve nonmotor types of thinking, as well as motor types. In fact, the prefrontal association area is frequently described simply as important for elaboration of thoughts, and it is said to store on a short-term basis "working memories" that are used to combine new thoughts while they are entering the brain.

Broca's Area Provides the Neural Circuitry for Word Formation. Broca's area, shown in Figure 58-5, is located partly in the posterior lateral prefrontal cortex and partly in the premotor area. It is here that plans and motor pat-
terns for expressing individual words or even short phrases are initiated and executed. This area also works in close association with the Wernicke language comprehension center in the temporal association cortex, as we discuss more fully later in the chapter.

An especially interesting discovery is the following: When a person has already learned one language and then learns a new language, the area in the brain where the new language is stored is slightly removed from the storage area for the first language. If both languages are learned simultaneously, they are stored together in the same area of the brain.

## Limbic Association Area

Figures 58-4 and 58-5 show still another association area called the limbic association area. This area is found in the anterior pole of the temporal lobe, in the ventral portion of the frontal lobe, and in the cingulate gyrus lying deep in the longitudinal fissure on the midsurface of each cerebral hemisphere. It is concerned primarily with behavior, emotions, and motivation. We discuss in Chapter 59 that the limbic cortex is part of a much more extensive system, the limbic system, that includes a complex set of neuronal structures in the midbasal regions of the brain. This limbic system provides most of the emotional drives for activating other areas of the brain and even provides motivational drive for the process of learning itself.

## Area for Recognition of Faces

An interesting type of brain abnormality called prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces. This condition occurs in people who have extensive damage on the medial undersides of both occipital lobes and along the medioventral surfaces of the temporal lobes, as shown in Figure 58-6. Loss of these face recognition areas, strangely enough, results in little other abnormality of brain function.

One may wonder why so much of the cerebral cortex should be reserved for the simple task of face recognition. However, most of our daily tasks involve associations with other people, and thus one can see the importance of this intellectual function.

The occipital portion of this facial recognition area is contiguous with the visual cortex, and the temporal portion is closely associated with the limbic system that has to do with emotions, brain activation, and control of one's behavioral response to the environment, as we see in Chapter 59.

## COMPREHENSIVE INTERPRETATIVE FUNCTION OF THE POSTERIOR SUPERIOR TEMPORAL LOBE-"WERNICKE'S AREA" (A GENERAL INTERPRETATIVE AREA)

The somatic, visual, and auditory association areas all meet one another in the posterior part of the superior temporal lobe, shown in Figure 58-7, where the

All of these feed also into Wernicke's area, located in the posterosuperior portion of the temporal lobe. Note also the prefrontal area and Broca's speech area in the frontal lobe.
temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes all come together. This area of confluence of the different sensory interpretative areas is especially highly developed in the dominant side of the brain-the left side in almost all right-handed people-and it plays the greatest single role of any part of the cerebral cortex for the higher comprehension levels of brain function that we call intelligence. Therefore, this region has been called by different names suggestive of an area that has almost global importance: the general interpretative area, the gnostic area, the knowing area, the tertiary association area, and so forth. It is best known as Wernicke's area in honor of the neurologist who first described its special significance in intellectual processes.

After severe damage in Wernicke's area, a person might hear perfectly well and even recognize different words but still be unable to arrange these words into a coherent thought. Likewise, the person may be able to read words from the printed page but be unable to recognize the thought that is conveyed.

Electrical stimulation of Wernicke's area in a conscious person occasionally causes a highly complex thought, particularly when the stimulation electrode is passed deep enough into the brain to approach the corresponding connecting areas of the thalamus. The types of thoughts that might be experienced include complicated visual scenes that one might remember from childhood, auditory hallucinations such as a specific musical piece, or even a statement made by a specific person. For this reason, it is believed that activation of Wernicke's area can call forth complicated memory patterns that involve more than one sensory modality even though most of the individual memories may be stored elsewhere. This belief is in accord with the importance of Wernicke's area in interpreting the complicated meanings of different patterns of sensory experiences.

## Angular Gyrus-Interpretation of Visual Information.

The angular gyrus is the most inferior portion of the posterior parietal lobe, lying immediately behind Wernicke's area and fusing posteriorly into the visual areas of the occipital lobe as well. If this region is destroyed while Wernicke's area in the temporal lobe is still intact, the person can still interpret auditory experiences as usual, but the stream of visual experiences passing into Wernicke's area from the visual cortex is mainly blocked. Therefore, the person may be able to see words and even know that they are words but may not be able to interpret their meanings. This condition is called alexia, or word blindness. The term "dyslexia" is used to describe difficulty in learning about written language, not complete word blindness.

## Concept of the Dominant Hemisphere

The general interpretative functions of Wernicke's area and the angular gyrus, as well as the functions of the speech and motor control areas, are usually much more highly developed in one cerebral hemisphere than in the other. Therefore, this hemisphere is called the dominant hemisphere. In about $95 \%$ of all people, the left hemisphere is the dominant one.

Even at birth, the area of the cortex that will eventually become Wernicke's area is as much as $50 \%$ larger in the left hemisphere than in the right in more than one-half of neonates. Therefore, it is easy to understand why the left side of the brain might become dominant over the right side. However, if for some reason this left side area is damaged or removed in very early childhood, the opposite side of the brain will usually develop dominant characteristics.

The following theory can explain the capability of one hemisphere to dominate the other hemisphere. The attention of the "mind" seems to be directed to one principal thought at a time. Presumably, because the left posterior temporal lobe at birth is usually slightly larger than the right lobe, the left side normally begins to be used to a greater extent than is the right side. Thereafter, because of the tendency to direct one's attention to the better developed region, the rate of learning in the cerebral hemisphere that gains the first start increases rapidly, whereas in the opposite, less used side, learning remains less well developed. Therefore, the left side normally becomes dominant over the right side.

In about $95 \%$ of all people, the left temporal lobe and angular gyrus become dominant, and in the remaining $5 \%$, either both sides develop simultaneously to have dual function or, more rarely, the right side alone becomes highly developed, with full dominance.

As discussed later in this chapter, the premotor speech area (Broca's area), located far laterally in the intermediate frontal lobe, is also almost always dominant on the left side of the brain. This speech area is responsible for formation of words by exciting simultaneously the laryngeal muscles, respiratory muscles, and muscles of the mouth.

The motor areas for controlling hands are also dominant in the left side of the brain in about $90 \%$ of persons, thus causing right-handedness in most people.

Although the interpretative areas of the temporal lobe and angular gyrus, as well as many of the motor areas, are usually highly developed in only the left hemisphere, these areas receive sensory information from both hemispheres and are also capable of controlling motor activities in both hemispheres. For this purpose, they use mainly fiber pathways in the corpus callosum for communication between the two hemispheres. This unitary, cross-feeding organization prevents interference between the two sides of the brain; such interference could create havoc with both mental thoughts and motor responses.

## Role of Language in the Function of Wernicke's Area and in Intellectual Functions

A major share of our sensory experience is converted into its language equivalent before being stored in the memory areas of the brain and before being processed for other intellectual purposes. For example, when we read a book, we do not store the visual images of the printed words but instead store the words themselves or their conveyed thoughts, often in language form.

The sensory area of the dominant hemisphere for interpretation of language is Wernicke's area, and this area is closely associated with both the primary and secondary hearing areas of the temporal lobe. This close relation probably results from the fact that the first introduction to language is by way of hearing. Later in life, when visual perception of language through the medium of reading develops, the visual information conveyed by written words is then presumably channeled through the angular gyrus, a visual association area, into the already developed Wernicke's language interpretative area of the dominant temporal lobe.

## FUNCTIONS OF THE PARIETOOCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX IN THE NONDOMINANT HEMISPHERE

When Wernicke's area in the dominant hemisphere of an adult person is destroyed, the person normally loses almost all intellectual functions associated with language or verbal symbolism, such as the ability to read, the ability to perform mathematical operations, and even the ability to think through logical problems. Many other types of interpretative capabilities, some of which use the temporal lobe and angular gyrus regions of the opposite hemisphere, are retained.

Psychological studies in patients with damage to the nondominant hemisphere have suggested that this hemisphere may be especially important for understanding and interpreting music, nonverbal visual experiences (especially visual patterns), spatial relations between the person and their surroundings, the significance of "body language" and intonations of people's voices, and probably many somatic experiences related to use of the limbs and hands. Thus, even though we speak of the "dominant" hemisphere, this dominance is primarily for languagebased intellectual functions; the so-called nondominant hemisphere might actually be dominant for some other types of intelligence.

## HIGHER INTELLECTUAL ("EXECUTIVE") FUNCTIONS OF THE PREFRONTAL ASSOCIATION AREAS

For years, it has been taught that the prefrontal cortex is the locus of "higher intellect" in the human being, principally because the main difference between the brains of monkeys and of human beings is the great prominence of the human prefrontal areas. Yet efforts to show that the prefrontal cortex is more important in higher intellectual functions than other portions of the brain have not been successful. Indeed, destruction of the language comprehension area in the posterior superior temporal lobe (Wernicke's area) and the adjacent angular gyrus region in the dominant hemisphere causes much more harm to the intellect than does destruction of the prefrontal areas.

The prefrontal areas do, however, have less definable but important intellectual functions of their own. Patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex may have normal motor functions and may even perform normally on some intelligence tests. However, they are unable to function effectively in normal daily life. These functions can be explained by describing what happens to patients in whom the prefrontal areas have become damaged, as follows.

Several decades ago, before the advent of modern drugs for treating psychiatric conditions, it was discovered that some patients could receive significant relief from severe psychotic depression by severing the neuronal connections between the prefrontal areas of the brain and the remainder of the brain by a procedure called prefrontal lobotomy. This procedure was performed by inserting a blunt, thin-bladed knife through a small opening in the lateral frontal skull on each side of the head and slicing the brain at the back edge of the prefrontal lobes from top to bottom. Subsequent studies in these patients showed the following mental changes:

1. The patients lost their ability to solve complex problems.
2. They became unable to string together sequential tasks to reach complex goals.
3. They became unable to learn to do several parallel tasks at the same time.
4. Their level of aggressiveness decreased, sometimes markedly, and they often lost ambition.
5. Their social responses were often inappropriate for the occasion, often including loss of morals and little reticence in relation to sexual activity and excretion.
6. The patients could still talk and comprehend language, but they were unable to carry through any long trains of thought, and their moods changed rapidly from sweetness to rage to exhilaration to madness.
7. The patients could also still perform most of the usual patterns of motor function that they had performed throughout life, but often without purpose.
From this information, let us try to piece together a coherent understanding of the function of the prefrontal association areas.

Decreased Aggressiveness and Inappropriate Social Responses. Decreased aggressiveness and inappropriate social responses probably result from loss of the ventral parts of the frontal lobes on the underside of the brain. As explained earlier and as shown in Figures 58-4 and 58-5, this area is part of the limbic association cortex rather than of the prefrontal association cortex. This limbic area helps to control behavior, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 59.

Inability to Progress Toward Goals or to Carry Through Sequential Thoughts. We learned earlier in this chapter that the prefrontal association areas have
the capability of calling forth information from widespread areas of the brain and using this information to achieve deeper thought patterns for attaining goals.

Although people without prefrontal cortices can still think, they show little concerted thinking in logical sequence for longer than a few seconds or a minute or so at most. Thus, people without prefrontal cortices are easily distracted from their central theme of thought, whereas people with functioning prefrontal cortices can drive themselves to completion of their thought goals, irrespective of distractions.

Elaboration of Thought, Prognostication, and Performance of Higher Intellectual Functions by the Prefrontal Areas-Concept of a "Working Memory." Another function that has been ascribed to the prefrontal areas is elaboration of thought, which means simply an increase in depth and abstractness of the different thoughts put together from multiple sources of information. Psychological tests have shown that prefrontal lobectomized lower animals presented with successive bits of sensory information fail to keep track of these bits even in temporary memory, probably because they are distracted so easily that they cannot hold thoughts long enough for memory storage to take place.

This ability of the prefrontal areas to keep track of many bits of information simultaneously and to cause recall of this information instantaneously as it is needed for subsequent thoughts is called the "brain's working memory," which may explain the many functions of the brain that we associate with higher intelligence. In fact, studies have shown that the prefrontal areas are divided into separate segments for storing different types of temporary memory, such as one area for storing shape and form of an object or a part of the body and another for storing movement.

By combining all these temporary bits of working memory, we have the abilities to do the following: (1) prognosticate; (2) plan for the future; (3) delay action in response to incoming sensory signals so that the sensory information can be weighed until the best course of response is decided; (4) consider the consequences of motor actions before they are performed; (5) solve complicated mathematical, legal, or philosophical problems; (6) correlate all avenues of information in diagnosing rare diseases; and (7) control our activities in accord with moral laws.

## Function of the Brain in Communication-Language Input and Language Output

Because neurological tests can easily assess the ability of a person to communicate with others, we know more about the sensory and motor systems related to communication than about any other segment of brain cortex function. Therefore, with the help of anatomical maps of neural pathways in Figure 58-8, we will review the function of the cortex in communication. From this examination, one will see immediately how the principles of sensory analysis and motor control apply to this art.

![gu468617462c](gu468617462c.jpg)

Figure 58-8. Brain pathways for (top) perceiving a heard word and then speaking the same word and (bottom) perceiving a written word and then speaking the same word. (Modified from Geschwind N: Specializations of the human brain. Sci Am 241:180, 1979.)

Communication has two aspects-the sensory (language input), involving the ears and eyes, and the motor (language output), involving vocalization and its control.

## Sensory Aspects of Communication

We noted earlier in the chapter that destruction of portions of the auditory or visual association areas of the cortex can result in the inability to understand the spoken or written word. These effects are called, respectively, auditory receptive aphasia and visual receptive aphasia or, more commonly, word deafness and word blindness (also called alexia).

Wernicke's Aphasia and Global Aphasia. Some people are capable of understanding either the spoken word or the written word but are unable to interpret the thought that is expressed. This condition results most frequently when Wernicke's area in the posterior superior temporal gyrus in the dominant hemisphere is damaged or destroyed. Therefore, this type of aphasia is called Wernicke's aphasia.

When the lesion in Wernicke's area is widespread and extends (1) backward into the angular gyrus region, (2) inferiorly into the lower areas of the temporal lobe, and (3) superiorly into the superior border of the sylvian fissure, the person is likely to be almost totally demented for language understanding or communication and therefore is said to have global aphasia.

## Motor Aspects of Communication

The process of speech involves two principal stages of mentation: (1) formation in the mind of thoughts to be expressed, as well as choice of words to be used; and then (2) motor control of vocalization and the actual act of vocalization itself.

The formation of thoughts and even most choices of words are the function of sensory association areas of the brain. Again, it is Wernicke's area in the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus that is most important for this ability. Therefore, a person with either Wernicke's aphasia or global aphasia is unable to formulate the thoughts that are to be communicated. Or, if the lesion is less severe, the person may be able to formulate the thoughts but unable to put together appropriate sequences of words to express the thought. The person sometimes is even fluent with words, but the words are jumbled.

Loss of Broca's Area Causes Motor Aphasia. Sometimes a person is capable of deciding what he or she wants to say but cannot make the vocal system emit words instead of noises. This effect, called motor aphasia, results from damage to Broca's speech area, which lies in the prefrontal and premotor facial regions of the cerebral cortex-about 95\% of the time in the left hemisphere, as shown in Figures 58-5 and 58-8. The skilled motor patterns for control of the larynx, lips, mouth, respiratory system, and other accessory muscles of speech are all initiated from this area.

Articulation. Finally, we have the act of articulation, which means the muscular movements of the mouth, tongue, larynx, vocal cords, and so forth that are responsible for the intonations, timing, and rapid changes in intensities of the sequential sounds. The facial and laryngeal regions of the motor cortex activate these muscles, and the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and sensory cortex all help to control the sequences and intensities of muscle contractions, making liberal use of basal ganglial and cerebellar feedback mechanisms described in Chapters 56 and 57. Destruction of any of these regions can cause either total or partial inability to speak distinctly.

## Summary

Figure 58-8 shows two principal pathways for communication. The upper half of the figure shows the pathway involved in hearing and speaking. This sequence is as follows: (1) reception in the primary auditory area of the sound signals that encode the words; (2) interpretation of the words in Wernicke's area; (3) determination, also in Wernicke's area, of the thoughts and the words to be spoken; (4) transmission of signals from Wernicke's area to Broca's area by way of the arcuate fasciculus; (5) activation of the skilled motor programs in Broca's area for control of word formation; and (6) transmission of appropriate signals into the motor cortex to control the speech muscles.

The lower part of the figure illustrates the comparable steps in reading and then speaking in response. The initial receptive area for the words is in the primary visual area rather than in the primary auditory area. The information then passes through early stages of interpretation in the angular gyrus region and finally reaches its full level of recognition in Wernicke's area. From here, the sequence is the same as for speaking in response to the spoken word.

## THE CORPUS CALLOSUM AND ANTERIOR COMMISSURE TRANSFER THOUGHTS, MEMORIES, TRAINING, AND OTHER INFORMATION BETWEEN THE TWO CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES

Fibers in the corpus callosum provide abundant bidirectional neural connections between most of the cortical areas of the two cerebral hemispheres, except for the anterior portions of the temporal lobes; these temporal areas, including especially the amygdala, are interconnected by fibers that pass through the anterior commissure.

One of the functions of the corpus callosum and the anterior commissure is to make information stored in the cortex of one hemisphere available to corresponding cortical areas of the opposite hemisphere. The following important examples illustrate such cooperation between the two hemispheres.

1. Cutting the corpus callosum blocks transfer of information from Wernicke's area of the dominant hemisphere to the motor cortex on the opposite side of the brain. Therefore, the intellectual functions of Wernicke's area, located in the left hemisphere, lose control over the right motor cortex that initiates voluntary motor functions of the left hand and arm, even though the usual subconscious movements of the left hand and arm are normal.
2. Cutting the corpus callosum prevents transfer of somatic and visual information from the right hemisphere into Wernicke's area in the left dominant hemisphere. Therefore, somatic and visual information from the left side of the body frequently fails to reach this general interpretative area of the brain and thus cannot be used for decision making.
3. Finally, people whose corpus callosum is completely sectioned have two separate conscious portions of the brain. For example, in a teenage boy with a sectioned corpus callosum, only the left half of his brain could understand both the written word and the spoken word because the left side was the dominant hemisphere. Conversely, the right side of the brain could understand the written word but not the spoken word. Furthermore, the right cortex could elicit a motor action response to the written word without the left cortex ever knowing why the response was performed. The effect was quite different when an emotional response was evoked in the right side of the brain: in this case, a subconscious emotional response occurred in the left side of the brain as well. This response undoubtedly occurred because the areas of the two sides of the brain for emotions, the anterior temporal cortices and adjacent areas, were still communicating with each other through the anterior commissure that was not sectioned. For example, when the command "kiss" was written for the right half of his brain to see, the boy immediately and with full emotion said, "No way!" This
response required function of Wernicke's area and the motor areas for speech in the left hemisphere because these left-sided areas were necessary to speak the words "No way!" When asked why he said this, however, the boy could not explain it.
Thus, the two halves of the brain have independent capabilities for consciousness, memory storage, communication, and control of motor activities. The corpus callosum is required for the two sides to operate cooperatively at the superficial subconscious level, and the anterior commissure plays an important additional role in unifying the emotional responses of the two sides of the brain.

## THOUGHTS, CONSCIOUSNESS, AND MEMORY

Our most difficult problem in discussing consciousness, thoughts, memory, and learning is that we do not know the neural mechanisms of a thought, and we know little about the mechanisms of memory. We know that destruction of large portions of the cerebral cortex does not prevent a person from having thoughts, but it does reduce the depth of the thoughts and also the degree of awareness of the surroundings.

Each thought certainly involves simultaneous signals in many portions of the cerebral cortex, thalamus, limbic system, and reticular formation of the brain stem. Some basic thoughts probably depend almost entirely on lower centers; the thought of pain is probably a good example because electrical stimulation of the human cortex seldom elicits anything more than mild pain, whereas stimulation of certain areas of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and mesencephalon can cause excruciating pain. Conversely, a type of thought pattern that does require large involvement of the cerebral cortex is that of vision, because loss of the visual cortex causes complete inability to perceive visual form or color.

We might formulate a provisional definition of a thought in terms of neural activity as follows. A thought results from a "pattern" of stimulation of many parts of the nervous system at the same time, probably involving most importantly the cerebral cortex, thalamus, limbic system, and upper reticular formation of the brain stem. This theory is called the holistic theory of thoughts and, in simplistic terms, means that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The stimulated areas of the limbic system, thalamus, and reticular formation are believed to determine the general nature of the thought, giving it such qualities as pleasure, displeasure, pain, comfort, crude modalities of sensation, localization to gross areas of the body, and other general characteristics. However, specific stimulated areas of the cerebral cortex determine discrete characteristics of the thought, such as (1) specific localization of sensations on the surface of the body and of objects in the fields of vision, (2) the feeling of the texture of silk, (3) visual recognition of the rectangular pattern of

a concrete block wall, and (4) other individual characteristics that enter into one's overall awareness of a particular instant. Consciousness can perhaps be described as our continuing stream of awareness of either our surroundings or our sequential thoughts.

## MEMORY—ROLES OF SYNAPTIC FACILITATION AND SYNAPTIC INHIBITION

Memories are stored in the brain by changing the basic sensitivity of synaptic transmission between neurons as a result of previous neural activity. The new or facilitated pathways are called memory traces. They are important because once the traces are established, they can be selectively activated by the thinking mind to reproduce the memories.

Experiments in lower animals have demonstrated that memory traces can occur at all levels of the nervous system. Even spinal cord reflexes can change at least slightly in response to repetitive cord activation, and these reflex changes are part of the memory process. Also, long-term memories result from changed synaptic conduction in lower brain centers. However, most memory that we associate with intellectual processes is based on memory traces in the cerebral cortex.

Positive and Negative Memory-"Sensitization" or "Habituation" of Synaptic Transmission. Although we often think of memories as being positive recollections of previous thoughts or experiences, probably the greater share of our memories is negative, not positive. That is, our brain is inundated with sensory information from all our senses. If our minds attempted to remember all this information, the memory capacity of the brain would be rapidly exceeded. Fortunately, the brain has the capability to ignore information that is of no consequence. This capability results from inhibition of the synaptic pathways for this type of information; the resulting effect is called habituation, which is a type of negative memory.

Conversely, for incoming information that causes important consequences such as pain or pleasure, the brain has a different automatic capability of enhancing and storing the memory traces, which is positive memory. It results from facilitation of the synaptic pathways, and the process is called memory sensitization. As we discuss later, special areas in the basal limbic regions of the brain determine whether information is important or unimportant and make the subconscious decision about whether to store the thought as a sensitized memory trace or to suppress it.

Classification of Memories. We know that some memories last for only a few seconds, whereas others last for hours, days, months, or years. For the purpose of discussing these types of memories, we can use a common classification that divides memories into
the following: (1) short-term memory, which includes memories that last for seconds or at most minutes unless they are converted into longer-term memories; (2) intermediate long-term memories, which last for days to weeks but then fade away; and (3) long-term memory, which, once stored, can be recalled up to years or even a lifetime later.

In addition to this general classification of memories, we also discussed earlier (in connection with the prefrontal lobes) another type of memory, called "working memory," which includes mainly short-term memory that is used during the course of intellectual reasoning but is terminated as each stage of the problem is resolved.

Memories are frequently classified according to the type of information that is stored. One of these classifications divides memory into declarative memory and skill memory, as follows:

1. Declarative memory basically means memory of the various details of an integrated thought, such as memory of an important experience that includes memory of the following: (1) the surroundings; (2) time relationships, (3) causes of the experience; (4) meaning of the experience; and (5) the deductions that were left in the person's mind.
2. Skill memory is frequently associated with motor activities of the person's body, such as all the skills developed for hitting a tennis ball, including automatic memories to (1) sight the ball, (2) calculate the relationship and speed of the ball to the racquet, and (3) deduce rapidly the motions of the body, the arms, and the racquet required to hit the ball as desired-with all of these skills activated instantly based on previous learning of the game-and then moving on to the next stroke of the game while forgetting the details of the previous stroke.

## SHORT-TERM MEMORY

Short-term memory is typified by one's memory of 7 to 10 numerals in a telephone number (or 7 to 10 other discrete facts) for a few seconds to a few minutes at a time but lasting only as long as the person continues to think about the numbers or facts.

Many physiologists have suggested that this short-term memory is caused by continual neural activity resulting from nerve signals that travel around and around a temporary memory trace in a circuit of reverberating neurons. It has not yet been possible to prove this theory. Another possible explanation of short-term memory is presynaptic facilitation or inhibition, which occurs at synapses that lie on terminal nerve fibrils immediately before these fibrils synapse with a subsequent neuron. The neurotransmitter chemicals secreted at such terminals frequently cause facilitation or inhibition lasting for seconds up to several minutes. Circuits of this type could lead to short-term memory.

## INTERMEDIATE LONG-TERM MEMORY

Intermediate long-term memories may last for many minutes or even weeks. They will eventually be lost unless the memory traces are activated enough to become more permanent; then they are classified as long-term memories. Experiments in animals have demonstrated that memories of the intermediate long-term type can result from temporary chemical or physical changes, or both, in either the synapse presynaptic terminals or the synapse postsynaptic membrane, changes that can persist for a few minutes up to several weeks. These mechanisms are so important that they deserve special description.

## Memory Based on Chemical Changes in Presynaptic Terminals or Postsynaptic Neuronal Membranes

Figure 58-9 shows a mechanism of memory studied especially by Eric Kandel and his colleagues that can cause memories lasting from a few minutes up to 3 weeks in the large snail Aplysia. In Figure 58-9, there are two synaptic terminals. One terminal, which is from a sensory input neuron, terminates directly on the surface of the neuron that is to be stimulated and is called the sensory terminal. The other terminal, a presynaptic ending that lies on the surface of the sensory terminal, is called the facilitator terminal. When the sensory terminal is stimulated repeatedly but without stimulation of the facilitator terminal, signal transmission at first is great, but it becomes less and less intense with repeated stimulation until transmission almost ceases. This phenomenon is habituation, as was explained previously. It is a type of negative memory that causes the neuronal circuit to lose its response to repeated events that are insignificant.

Conversely, if a noxious stimulus excites the facilitator terminal at the same time that the sensory terminal is stimulated, instead of the transmitted signal into the postsynaptic neuron becoming progressively weaker, the ease of transmission becomes stronger and stronger. It will remain strong for minutes, hours, days, or, with more intense training, up to about 3 weeks even
without further stimulation of the facilitator terminal. Thus, the noxious stimulus causes the memory pathway through the sensory terminal to become facilitated for days or weeks thereafter. It is especially interesting that even after habituation has occurred, this pathway can be converted back to a facilitated pathway with only a few noxious stimuli.

## Molecular Mechanism of Intermediate Memory

Mechanism for Habituation. At the molecular level, the habituation effect in the sensory terminal results from progressive closure of calcium channels through the terminal membrane, although the cause of this calcium channel closure is not fully known. Nevertheless, much smaller than normal amounts of calcium ions can diffuse into the habituated terminal, and much less sensory terminal transmitter is therefore released because calcium entry is the principal stimulus for transmitter release (as was discussed in Chapter 46).

Mechanism for Facilitation. In the case of facilitation, at least part of the molecular mechanism is believed to be the following:

1. Stimulation of the facilitator presynaptic terminal at the same time that the sensory terminal is stimulated causes serotonin release at the facilitator synapse on the surface of the sensory terminal.
2. The serotonin acts on serotonin receptors in the sensory terminal membrane, and these receptors activate the enzyme adenyl cyclase inside the membrane. The adenyl cyclase then causes formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), also inside the sensory presynaptic terminal.
3. The cAMP activates a protein kinase that causes phosphorylation of a protein that is part of the potassium channels in the sensory synaptic terminal membrane; this in turn blocks the channels for potassium conductance. The blockage can last for minutes up to several weeks.
4. Lack of potassium conductance causes a greatly prolonged action potential in the synaptic terminal because flow of potassium ions out of the terminal is necessary for rapid recovery from the action potential.
5. The prolonged action potential causes prolonged activation of the calcium channels, allowing tremendous quantities of calcium ions to enter the sensory synaptic terminal. These calcium ions cause greatly increased transmitter release by the synapse, thereby markedly facilitating synaptic transmission to the subsequent neuron.
Thus, in a very indirect way, the associative effect of stimulating the facilitator terminal at the same time that the sensory terminal is stimulated causes prolonged increase in excitatory sensitivity of the sensory terminal, which establishes the memory trace.

Additional studies in the snail Aplysia have suggested still another mechanism of synaptic memory. These studies have shown that stimuli from separate sources acting on a single neuron, under appropriate conditions, can cause long-term changes in membrane properties of the postsynaptic neuron instead of in the presynaptic neuronal membrane, but leading to essentially the same memory effects.

## LONG-TERM MEMORY

No obvious demarcation exists between the more prolonged types of intermediate long-term memory and true long-term memory. The distinction is one of degree. However, long-term memory is generally believed to result from actual structural changes, instead of only chemical changes, at the synapses, and these changes enhance or suppress signal conduction. Again, let us recall experiments in primitive animals (where the nervous systems are much easier to study) that have aided immensely in understanding possible mechanisms of long-term memory.

## Structural Changes Occur in Synapses During Development of Long-Term Memory

Electron microscopic pictures taken from invertebrate animals have demonstrated multiple physical structural changes in many synapses during development of longterm memory traces. The structural changes will not occur if a drug is given that blocks protein synthesis in the presynaptic neuron, nor will the permanent memory trace develop. Therefore, it appears that development of true long-term memory depends on physically restructuring the synapses in a way that changes their sensitivity for transmitting nervous signals.

The following important structural changes occur:

1. An increase in vesicle release sites for secretion of transmitter substance
2. An increase in the number of transmitter vesicles released
3. An increase in the number of presynaptic terminals
4. Changes in structures of the dendritic spines that permit transmission of stronger signals
Thus, in several different ways, the structural capability of synapses to transmit signals appears to increase during establishment of true long-term memory traces.

## Number of Neurons and Their Connectivities Often Change Significantly During Learning

During the first few weeks, months, and perhaps even a year or more of life, various parts of the brain produce many new neurons that send out numerous axon branches to make connections with other neurons. If the new axons fail to connect with appropriate neurons, muscle cells, or gland cells, the new axons will degenerate
within a few weeks. Thus, the number of neuronal connections is determined by specific nerve growth factors released retrogradely from the stimulated cells. Furthermore, when insufficient connectivity occurs, the entire neuron that is sending out the axon branches might eventually disappear.

Therefore, soon after birth, the principle of "use it or lose it" governs the final number of neurons and their connectivities in respective parts of the human nervous system. This is a type of learning. For example, if one eye of a newborn animal is covered for many weeks after birth, neurons in alternate stripes of the cerebral visual cortex-neurons normally connected to the covered eye-will degenerate, and the covered eye will remain either partially or totally blind for the remainder of life. Until recently, it was believed that very little "learning" is achieved in adult human beings and animals by modification of numbers of neurons in the memory circuits; however, recent research suggests that even adults use this mechanism at least to some extent.

## CONSOLIDATION OF MEMORY

For short-term memory to be converted into long-term memory that can be recalled weeks or years later, it must become "consolidated." That is, the short-term memory, if activated repeatedly, will initiate chemical, physical, and anatomical changes in the synapses that are responsible for the long-term type of memory. This process requires 5 to 10 minutes for minimal consolidation and 1 hour or more for strong consolidation which requires synthesis of messenger RNA and proteins in the neurons. For example, if a strong sensory impression is made on the brain but is then followed within a minute or so by an electrically induced brain convulsion, the sensory experience will not be remembered. Likewise, brain concussion, sudden application of deep general anesthesia, or any other effect that temporarily blocks the dynamic function of the brain can prevent consolidation.

Consolidation and the time required for it to occur can probably be explained by the phenomenon of rehearsal of the short-term memory, as described in the following section.

Rehearsal Enhances the Transference of Short-Term Memory Into Long-Term Memory. Studies have shown that rehearsal of the same information again and again in the mind accelerates and potentiates the degree of transfer of short-term memory into long-term memory and therefore accelerates and enhances consolidation. The brain has a natural tendency to rehearse newfound information, especially newfound information that catches the mind's attention. Therefore, over a period of time, the important features of sensory experiences become progressively more and more fixed in the memory stores. This phenomenon explains why a person can remember small amounts of information studied in depth far better than

large amounts of information studied only superficially. It also explains why a person who is wide awake can consolidate memories far better than a person who is in a state of mental fatigue.

New Memories Are Codified During Consolidation. One of the most important features of consolidation is that new memories are codified into different classes of information. During this process, similar types of information are pulled from the memory storage bins and used to help process the new information. The new and old are compared for similarities and differences, and part of the storage process is to store the information about these similarities and differences, rather than to store the new information unprocessed. Thus, during consolidation, the new memories are not stored randomly in the brain but are stored in direct association with other memories of the same type. This process is necessary for one to be able to "search" the memory store at a later date to find the required information.

## Role of the Hippocampus and Other Brain Regions in Memory

## Anterograde Amnesia-Inability to Create New Declarative Long-Term Memories After Hippocampal

Lesions. The hippocampus is the most medial portion of the temporal lobe cortex, where it folds first medially underneath the brain and then upward into the lower, inside surface of the lateral ventricle. The two hippocampi have been removed for the treatment of epilepsy in a few patients. This procedure does not seriously affect the person's memory for information stored in the brain before removal of the hippocampi. However, after removal, these people have virtually no capability thereafter for storing verbal and symbolic types of memories (declarative types of memory) in long-term memory or even in intermediate memory lasting longer than a few minutes. Therefore, these people are unable to create new long-term memories of those types of information that are the basis of intelligence. This condition is called anterograde amnesia.

But why are the hippocampi so important in helping the brain to store new memories? The probable answer is that the hippocampi are among the most important output pathways from the "reward" and "punishment" areas of the limbic system, as explained in Chapter 59. Sensory stimuli or thoughts that cause pain or aversion excite the limbic punishment centers, and stimuli that cause pleasure, happiness, or sense of reward excite the limbic reward centers. All these together provide the background mood and motivations of the person. Among these motivations is the drive in the brain to remember those experiences and thoughts that are either pleasant or unpleasant. The hippocampi especially and to a lesser degree the dorsal medial nuclei of the thalamus, another limbic structure, have proved especially important in making the decision about which of our thoughts are important enough on a basis of reward or punishment to be worthy of memory.

## Retrograde Amnesia-Inability to Recall Memories From the Past After Hippocampal or Thalmic Lesions.

When retrograde amnesia occurs, there is a loss of memory access to events and information learned prior to an injury or disease that caused the amnesia.

In some people who have hippocampal lesions, some degree of retrograde amnesia occurs along with anterograde amnesia, which suggests that these two types of amnesia are at least partially related and that hippocampal lesions can cause both. However, damage in some thalamic areas may lead specifically to retrograde amnesia without causing significant anterograde amnesia. A possible explanation of this is that the thalamus may play a role in helping the person "search" the memory storehouses and thus "read out" the memories. That is, the memory process not only requires the storing of memories but also an ability to search and find the memory at a later date. The possible function of the thalamus in this process is discussed further in Chapter 59.

Hippocampi Are Not Important in Reflexive Learning. People with hippocampal lesions usually do not have difficulty in learning physical skills that do not involve verbalization or symbolic types of intelligence. For example, these people can still learn the rapid hand and physical skills required in many types of sports. This type of learning is called skill learning or reflexive learning; it depends on physically repeating the required tasks over and over again, rather than on symbolic rehearsing in the mind.

# The Limbic System and the HypothalamusBehavioral and Motivational Mechanisms of the Brain 

Control of behavior is a function of the entire nervous system. Even the wakefulness and sleep cycle discussed in Chapter 60 is one of our most important behavioral patterns.

In this chapter, we deal first with the mechanisms that control activity levels in different parts of the brain. Then we discuss the causes of motivational drives, especially motivational control of the learning process and feelings of pleasure and punishment. These functions of the nervous system are performed mainly by the basal regions of the brain, which together are loosely called the limbic system, meaning the "border" system.

## ACTIVATING-DRIVING SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN

Without continuous transmission of nerve signals from the lower brain into the cerebrum, the cerebrum becomes useless. In fact, severe compression of the brain stem at the juncture between the mesencephalon and cerebrum, as sometimes results from a pineal tumor, often causes the person to enter into unremitting coma lasting for the remainder of his or her life.

Nerve signals in the brain stem activate the cerebrum in two ways: (1) by directly stimulating a background level of neuronal activity in wide areas of the brain and (2) by activating neurohormonal systems that release specific facilitory or inhibitory hormone-like neurotransmitters into selected areas of the brain.

## CONTROL OF CEREBRAL ACTIVITY BY CONTINUOUS EXCITATORY SIGNALS FROM THE BRAIN STEM

## Reticular Excitatory Area of the Brain Stem—a Driver of Brain Activity

Figure 59-1 shows a general system for controlling the activity level of the brain. The central driving component of this system is an excitatory area located in the reticular substance of the pons and mesencephalon. This area is also called the bulboreticular facilitory area. We also discuss this area in Chapter 56 because it is the same brain stem reticular area that transmits facilitory signals downward
to the spinal cord to maintain tone in the antigravity muscles and to control levels of activity of the spinal cord reflexes. In addition to these downward signals, this area also sends a profusion of signals in the upward direction. Most of these signals go first to the thalamus, where they excite a different set of neurons that transmit nerve signals to all regions of the cerebral cortex, as well as to multiple subcortical areas.

The signals passing through the thalamus are of two types. One type is rapidly transmitted action potentials that excite the cerebrum for only a few milliseconds. These signals originate from large neuronal cell bodies that lie throughout the brain stem reticular area. Their nerve endings release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which serves as an excitatory agent that lasts for only a few milliseconds before it is destroyed.

The second type of excitatory signal originates from large numbers of small neurons spread throughout the brain stem reticular excitatory area. Again, most of these signals pass to the thalamus, but through small, slowly conducting fibers that synapse mainly in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus and in the reticular nuclei over the surface of the thalamus. From here, additional small fibers are distributed throughout the cerebral cortex. The excitatory effect caused by this system of fibers can build up progressively for many seconds to a minute or more, which suggests that its signals are especially important for controlling the longer term background excitability level of the brain.

Excitation of the Reticular Excitatory Area by Peripheral Sensory Signals. The level of activity of the reticular excitatory area in the brain stem, and therefore the level of activity of the entire brain, is determined to a great extent by the number and type of sensory signals that enter the brain from the periphery. Pain signals in particular increase activity in this excitatory area and therefore strongly excite the brain to attention.

The importance of sensory signals in activating the excitatory area is demonstrated by the effect of cutting the brain stem above the point where the fifth cerebral nerves enter the pons. These nerves are the highest nerves entering the brain that transmit significant numbers of

![gu488617462c](gu488617462c.jpg)

Figure 59-1 The excitatory-activating system of the brain. Also shown is an inhibitory area in the medulla that can inhibit or depress the activating system.
somatosensory signals into the brain. When all these input sensory signals are gone, the level of activity in the brain excitatory area diminishes abruptly, and the brain proceeds instantly to a state of greatly reduced activity, approaching a permanent state of coma. However, when the brain stem is transected below the fifth nerves, which leaves much input of sensory signals from the facial and oral regions, the coma is averted.

Increased Activity of the Excitatory Area Caused by Feedback Signals Returning From the Cerebral Cortex. Not only do excitatory signals pass to the cerebral cortex from the bulboreticular excitatory area of the brain stem, but feedback signals also return from the cerebral cortex back to this same area. Therefore, any time the cerebral cortex becomes activated by brain thought processes or by motor processes, signals are sent from the cortex to the brain stem excitatory area, which in turn sends still more excitatory signals to the cortex. This process helps to maintain the level of excitation of the cerebral cortex or even to enhance it. This is a positive feedback mechanism that allows any beginning activity in the cerebral cortex to support still more activity, thus leading to an "awake" mind.

The Thalamus Is a Distribution Center That Controls Activity in Specific Regions of the Cortex. As pointed out in Chapter 58, almost every area of the cerebral cortex connects with its own highly specific area in the thalamus. Therefore, electrical stimulation of a specific point in the thalamus generally activates its own specific small region
of the cortex. Furthermore, signals regularly reverberate back and forth between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex, with the thalamus exciting the cortex and the cortex then re-exciting the thalamus via return fibers. Activation of these back-and-forth reverberation signals has been suggested to establish long-term memories.

Whether the thalamus also functions to call forth specific memories from the cortex or to activate specific thought processes is still unclear, but the thalamus does have appropriate neuronal circuitry for these purposes.

## A Reticular Inhibitory Area Is Located in the Lower Brain Stem

Figure 59-1 shows another area that is important in controlling brain activity-the reticular inhibitory area, located medially and ventrally in the medulla. In Chapter 56, we learned that this area can inhibit the reticular facility area of the upper brain stem and thereby decrease activity in the superior portions of the brain. One of the mechanisms for this activity is to excite serotonergic neurons, which in turn secrete the inhibitory neurohormone serotonin at crucial points in the brain; we discuss this concept in more detail later.

## NEUROHORMONAL CONTROL OF BRAIN ACTIVITY

Aside from direct control of brain activity by specific transmission of nerve signals from the lower brain areas to the cortical regions of the brain, still another physiological mechanism is often used to control brain activity. This mechanism is to secrete excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter hormonal agents into the substance of the brain. These neurohormones often persist for minutes or hours and thereby provide long periods of control, rather than just instantaneous activation or inhibition.

Figure 59-2 shows three neurohormonal systems that have been studied in detail in the rat brain: (1) a norepinephrine system, (2) a dopamine system, and (3) a serotonin system. Norepinephrine usually functions as an excitatory hormone, whereas serotonin is usually inhibitory and dopamine is excitatory in some areas but inhibitory in others. As would be expected, these three systems have different effects on levels of excitability in different parts of the brain. The norepinephrine system spreads to virtually every area of the brain, whereas the serotonin and dopamine systems are directed much more to specific brain regions-the dopamine system mainly into the basal ganglial regions and the serotonin system more into the midline structures.

Neurohormonal Systems in the Human Brain. Figure 59-3 shows the brain stem areas in the human brain for activating four neurohormonal systems, the same three discussed for the rat and one other, the acetylcholine system. Some of the specific functions of these systems are as follows.

![gu498617462c](gu498617462c.jpg)

Figure 59-2 Three neurohormonal systems that have been mapped in the rat brain-a norepinephrine system, a dopamine system, and a serotonin system. (Modified from Kandel ER, Schwartz JH [eds]: Principles of Neural Science, 2nd ed. New York: Elsevier, 1985.)

1. The locus ceruleus and the norepinephrine system. The locus ceruleus is a small area located bilaterally and posteriorly at the juncture between the pons and mesencephalon. Nerve fibers from this area spread throughout the brain, the same as shown for the rat in the top frame of Figure 59-2, and they secrete norepinephrine. The norepinephrine generally excites the brain to increased activity. However, it has inhibitory effects in a few brain areas because of inhibitory receptors at certain neuronal synapses. Chapter 60 describes how this system probably plays an important role in causing dreaming, thus leading to a type of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.
2. The substantia nigra and the dopamine system. The substantia nigra is discussed in Chapter 57 in relation to the basal ganglia. It lies anteriorly in the superior mesencephalon, and its neurons send nerve endings mainly to the caudate nucleus and putamen of the cerebrum, where they secrete dopamine. Other neurons located in adjacent regions also secrete dopamine, but they send their endings into more ventral
![gu508617462c](gu508617462c.jpg)

Figure 59-3 Multiple centers in the brain stem. These neurons secrete different transmitter substances (specified in parentheses). The neurons send control signals upward into the diencephalon and cerebrum and downward into the spinal cord.
areas of the brain, especially to the hypothalamus and the limbic system. The dopamine is believed to act as an inhibitory transmitter in the basal ganglia, but in some other areas of the brain it is possibly excitatory. Also, remember from Chapter 57 that destruction of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is the basic cause of Parkinson's disease.
3. The raphe nuclei and the serotonin system. In the midline of the pons and medulla are several thin nuclei called the raphe nuclei. Many of the neurons in these nuclei secrete serotonin. They send fibers into the diencephalon and a few fibers to the cerebral cortex; still other fibers descend to the spinal cord. The serotonin secreted at the cord fiber endings has the ability to suppress pain, which was discussed in Chapter 49. The serotonin released in the diencephalon and cerebrum almost certainly plays an essential inhibitory role to help cause normal sleep, as we discuss in Chapter 60.
4. The gigantocellular neurons of the reticular excitatory area and the acetylcholine system. We previously discussed the gigantocellular neurons (giant cells) in the reticular excitatory area of the pons and mesencephalon. The fibers from these large cells divide immediately into two branches, one passing upward to the higher levels of the brain and the other passing downward through the reticulospinal tracts into the spinal cord. The neurohormone secreted at their terminals is acetylcholine. In most places, the acetylcholine functions as an excitatory neurotransmitter. Activation of these acetylcholine neurons leads to an acutely awake and excited nervous system.

Figure 59-4 Anatomy of the limbic system, shown in the dark pink area. (Modified from Warwick R, Williams PL: Gray's Anatomy, 35th ed. London: Longman Group Ltd, 1973.)

Other Neurotransmitters and Neurohormonal Substances Secreted in the Brain. Without describing their function, the following is a partial list of still other neurohormonal substances that function either at specific synapses or by release into the fluids of the brain: enkephalins, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, vasopressin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, $\alpha$-melanocyte stimulating hormone ( $\alpha-\mathrm{MSH}$ ), neuropeptide-Y (NPY), epinephrine, histamine, endorphins, angiotensin II, and neurotensin. Thus, there are multiple neurohormonal systems in the brain, the activation of each of which plays its own role in controlling a different quality of brain function.

## LIMBIC SYSTEM

The word "limbic" means "border." Originally, the term "limbic" was used to describe the border structures around the basal regions of the cerebrum, but as we have learned more about the functions of the limbic system, the term limbic system has been expanded to mean the entire neuronal circuitry that controls emotional behavior and motivational drives.

A major part of the limbic system is the hypothala$m u s$, with its related structures. In addition to their roles in behavioral control, these areas control many internal conditions of the body, such as body temperature, osmolality of the body fluids, and the drives to eat and drink and to control body weight. These internal functions are
collectively called vegetative functions of the brain, and their control is closely related to behavior.

## FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE LIMBIC SYSTEM—KEY POSITION OF THE HYPOTHALAMUS

Figure 59-4 shows the anatomical structures of the limbic system, demonstrating that they are an interconnected complex of basal brain elements. Located in the middle of all these structures is the extremely small hypothalamus, which from a physiological point of view is one of the central elements of the limbic system. Figure 59-5 illustrates schematically this key position of the hypothalamus in the limbic system and shows other subcortical structures of the limbic system surrounding it, including the septum, paraolfactory area, anterior nucleus of the thalamus, portions of the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and amygdala.

Surrounding the subcortical limbic areas is the limbic cortex, composed of a ring of cerebral cortex on each side of the brain-(1) beginning in the orbitofrontal area on the ventral surface of the frontal lobes, (2) extending upward into the subcallosal gyrus, (3) then over the top of the corpus callosum onto the medial aspect of the cerebral hemisphere in the cingulate gyrus, and finally (4) passing behind the corpus callosum and downward onto the ventromedial surface of the temporal lobe to the parahippocampal gyrus and uncus.

![gu528617462c](gu528617462c.jpg)

Figure 59-5 The limbic system, showing the key position of the hypothalamus.

Thus, on the medial and ventral surfaces of each cerebral hemisphere is a ring of mostly paleocortex that surrounds a group of deep structures intimately associated with overall behavior and emotions. In turn, this ring of limbic cortex functions as a two-way communication and association linkage between the neocortex and the lower limbic structures.

Many of the behavioral functions elicited from the hypothalamus and other limbic structures are also mediated through the reticular nuclei in the brain stem and their associated nuclei. We pointed out in Chapter 56, as well as earlier in this chapter, that stimulation of the excitatory portion of this reticular formation can cause high degrees of cerebral excitability while also increasing the excitability of much of the spinal cord synapses. In Chapter 61, we see that most of the hypothalamic signals for controlling the autonomic nervous system are also transmitted through synaptic nuclei located in the brain stem.

An important route of communication between the limbic system and the brain stem is the medial forebrain bundle, which extends from the septal and orbitofrontal regions of the cerebral cortex downward through the middle of the hypothalamus to the brain stem reticular formation. This bundle carries fibers in both directions, forming a trunk line communication system. A second route of communication is through short pathways among the reticular formation of the brain stem, thalamus, hypothalamus, and most other contiguous areas of the basal brain.

## THE HYPOTHALAMUS, A MAJOR CONTROL HEADQUARTERS FOR THE LIMBIC SYSTEM

The hypothalamus, despite its small size of only a few cubic centimeters (weighing only about 4 grams), has two-way communicating pathways with all levels of the
limbic system. In turn, the hypothalamus and its closely allied structures send output signals in three directions: (1) backward and downward to the brain stem, mainly into the reticular areas of the mesencephalon, pons, and medulla, and from these areas into the peripheral nerves of the autonomic nervous system; (2) upward toward many higher areas of the diencephalon and cerebrum, especially to the anterior thalamus and limbic portions of the cerebral cortex; and (3) into the hypothalamic infundibulum to control or partially control most of the secretory functions of both the posterior and the anterior pituitary glands.

Thus, the hypothalamus, which represents less than 1\% of the brain mass, is one of the most important of the control pathways of the limbic system. It controls most of the vegetative and endocrine functions of the body and many aspects of emotional behavior.

## VEGETATIVE AND ENDOCRINE CONTROL FUNCTIONS OF THE HYPOTHALAMUS

The different hypothalamic mechanisms for controlling multiple functions of the body are so important that they are discussed in multiple chapters throughout this text. For example, the role of the hypothalamus to help regulate arterial pressure is discussed in Chapter 18, thirst and water conservation in Chapter 30, appetite and energy expenditure in Chapter 72, temperature regulation in Chapter 74, and endocrine control in Chapter 76. To illustrate the organization of the hypothalamus as a functional unit, we summarize the a few of its vegetative and endocrine functions here as well.

Figures 59-6 and 59-7 show enlarged sagittal and coronal views of the hypothalamus, which represents only a small area in Figure 59-4. Especially note in Figure 59-6 the multiple activities that are excited or inhibited when respective hypothalamic nuclei are stimulated. In addition to these centers, a large lateral hypothalamic area (shown in Figure 59-7) is present on each side of the hypothalamus. The lateral areas are especially important in controlling thirst, hunger, and many of the emotional drives.

A word of caution must be issued when studying these diagrams because the areas that cause specific activities are not nearly as accurately localized as suggested in the figures. Also, it is not known whether the effects noted in the figures result from stimulation of specific control nuclei or merely from activation of fiber tracts leading from or to control nuclei located elsewhere. With this caution in mind, we can give the following general description of the vegetative and control functions of the hypothalamus.

Cardiovascular Regulation. Stimulation of different areas throughout the hypothalamus can cause many neurogenic effects on the cardiovascular system, including changes in arterial pressure and heart rate. In general, stimulation in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus

![gu538617462c](gu538617462c.jpg)

Figure 59-7 Coronal view of the hypothalamus, showing the mediolateral positions of the respective hypothalamic nuclei.
increases the arterial pressure and heart rate, whereas stimulation in the preoptic area often has opposite effects, causing a decrease in both heart rate and arterial pressure. These effects are transmitted mainly through specific cardiovascular control centers in the reticular regions of the pons and medulla.

Body Temperature Regulation. The anterior portion of the hypothalamus, especially the preoptic area, is concerned with regulation of body temperature. An increase in temperature of the blood flowing through this area increases activity of temperature-sensitive neurons, whereas a decrease in temperature decreases their activity. In turn, these neurons control mechanisms for increasing or decreasing body temperature, as discussed in Chapter 74.

Body Water Regulation. The hypothalamus regulates body water in two ways: (1) by creating the sensation of thirst, which drives the animal or person to drink water,

Figure 59-6 Control centers of the hypothalamus (sagittal view). GI, Gastrointestinal.
and (2) by controlling the excretion of water into the urine. An area called the thirst center is located in the lateral hypothalamus. When the fluid electrolytes in either this center or closely allied areas become too concentrated, the animal develops an intense desire to drink water; it will search out the nearest source of water and drink enough to return the electrolyte concentration of the thirst center to normal.

Control of renal excretion of water is vested mainly in the supraoptic nuclei. When the body fluids become too concentrated, the neurons of these areas become stimulated. Nerve fibers from these neurons project downward through the infundibulum of the hypothalamus into the posterior pituitary gland, where the nerve endings secrete the hormone antidiuretic hormone (also called vasopressin). This hormone is then absorbed into the blood and transported to the kidneys, where it acts on the collecting tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys to cause increased reabsorption of water. This action decreases loss of water into the urine but allows continuing excretion of electrolytes, thus decreasing the concentration of the body fluids back toward normal. These functions are presented in Chapter 29.

Regulation of Uterine Contractility and Milk Ejection from the Breasts. Stimulation of the paraventricular nuclei causes their neuronal cells to secrete the hormone oxytocin. This hormone in turn causes increased contractility of the uterus, as well as contraction of the myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli of the breasts, which then causes the alveoli to empty their milk through the nipples.

At the end of pregnancy, especially large quantities of oxytocin are secreted, and this secretion helps promote

labor contractions that expel the baby. Then, whenever the baby suckles the mother's breast, a reflex signal from the nipple to the posterior hypothalamus also causes oxytocin release, and the oxytocin now performs the necessary function of contracting the ductules of the breast, thereby expelling milk through the nipples so that the baby can nourish itself. These functions are discussed in Chapter 83.

Gastrointestinal and Feeding Regulation. Stimulation of several areas of the hypothalamus causes an animal to experience extreme hunger, a voracious appetite, and an intense desire to search for food. One area associated with hunger is the lateral hypothalamic area. Conversely, damage to this area on both sides of the hypothalamus causes the animal to lose desire for food, sometimes causing lethal starvation, as discussed in Chapter 72.

A center that opposes the desire for food, called the satiety center, is located in the ventromedial nuclei. When this center is stimulated electrically, an animal that is eating food suddenly stops eating and shows complete indifference to food. However, if this area is destroyed bilaterally, the animal cannot be satiated; instead, its hypothalamic hunger centers become overactive, so it has a voracious appetite, resulting eventually in tremendous obesity. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus contains at least two different types neurons that, when stimulated, lead either to increased or decreased appetite. Another area of the hypothalamus that enters into overall control of gastrointestinal activity is the mammillary bodies, which control at least partially the patterns of many feeding reflexes, such as licking the lips and swallowing.

Hypothalamic Control of Endocrine Hormone Secretion by the Anterior Pituitary Gland. Stimulation of certain areas of the hypothalamus also causes the anterior pituitary gland to secrete its endocrine hormones. This subject is discussed in detail in Chapter 75 in relation to neural control of the endocrine glands. Briefly, the basic mechanisms are as follows. The anterior pituitary gland receives its blood supply mainly from blood that flows first through the lower part of the hypothalamus and then through the anterior pituitary vascular sinuses. As the blood courses through the hypothalamus before reaching the anterior pituitary, specific releasing and inhibitory hormones are secreted into the blood by various hypothalamic nuclei. These hormones are then transported via the blood to the anterior pituitary gland, where they act on the glandular cells to control release of specific anterior pituitary hormones.

Hypothalamic Control of Circadian Rhythms-The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus contains about 20,000 neurons and is located above the optic chiasm where the optic nerves cross underneath the hypothalamus, as discussed in Chapter 52. The neurons of the SCN serve as
![gu548617462c](gu548617462c.jpg)

Figure 59-8 The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus serves as a "master clock" for many physiological, mental, and behavioral activities. The SCN receives direct innervation from the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) to entrain its activity to day-night cycles. SCN neurons project to various brain centers, which contain local circadian clocks that direct feeding-fasting, sleep-wakefulness, autonomic and neuroendocrine circadian rhythms. These systemic cues synchronize local molecular clocks in peripheral tissues, and these local clocks then direct circadian gene expression that regulates physiological rhythms, including those related to mental alertness and cognition, cardiovascular regulation, metabolism, and renal function.
a "master clock," with a pacemaker firing frequency that follows a circadian rhythm (Figure 59-8). This pacemaker function is critical for organizing sleep into a recurring 24-hour circadian pattern of sleeping and waking. Lesions of the SCN cause many physiological and behavioral disturbances, including loss of the circadian sleep-wake rhythms. Thus, the SCN directs daily cycles of our physiology and behavior that set the tempo of our lives.

The importance of these daily cycles to human health has led to increasing interest in the field of chronobiology, the study of these circadian rhythms. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash, and Michael W. Young for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm in fruit flies.

The SCN is organized into specific functional groups that control the rhythmic patterns of biological clocks in other parts of the body. These biological clocks are

comprised of a complex set of gene transcription factors, proteins/enzymes, and other regulator factors that operate to establish circadian rhythms in most living organisms including mammals, microbes, and even plants. These biological clocks are found in nearly every tissue and organ of the body and capable of maintaining their own circadian rhythms, although their circadian rhythms are usually maintained for only a few days in the absence of signals from the SCN.

Key components of the clock mechanisms in the SCN, and in other tissues, are two feedback loops that rely on the transcriptional activators, CLOCK and BMAL1, which bind to each other and, following translocation to the nucleus, initiate transcription of "clock genes" (PER1, PER2, and PER3) and "cryptochrome genes" (CRY1 and CRY2). These genes turn on synthesis of PER and CRY proteins; as the proteins accumulate, they inhibit CLOCK and BMAL1, thereby repressing PER and CRY transcription. This feedback sequence of on-off PER and CRY protein synthesis normally occurs in a 24 -hour circadian pattern.

Once the SCN clock has established its circadian rhythm, this information is transmitted to other brain regions through action potentials and to various organs and tissues via nervous and hormonal signals. Axons from the SCN project to other regions of the hypothalamus that are especially important for circadian variations in body temperature, the sleep-wake cycle, and various hormonal changes.

Although the circadian rhythms of the SCN are endogenous and self-sustained, they are altered ("entrained") by environmental changes such as temperature and timing of the light-dark cycle. The SCN receives neural input from specialized intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells that contain the photopigment melanopsin and transmit signals through the retinohypothalamic tract. The importance of this pathway in altering the timing of circadian rhythms is illustrated by the observation that a person who travels across several time zones may experience "jet lag" but his or her circadian clock is eventually synchronized with local day-night time.

Summary. Several areas of the hypothalamus control specific vegetative and endocrine functions. The functions of these areas are not fully understood, so the specification given earlier of different areas for different hypothalamic functions is still partially tentative.

## BEHAVIORAL FUNCTIONS OF THE HYPOTHALAMUS AND ASSOCIATED LIMBIC STRUCTURES

## Effects Caused by Stimulation of the Hypothalamus.

In addition to the vegetative and endocrine functions of the hypothalamus, stimulation of or lesions in the hypothalamus often have profound effects on emotional
behavior of animals and human beings. Some of the behavioral effects of stimulation are the following:

1. Stimulation in the lateral hypothalamus not only causes thirst and eating, as discussed earlier, but also increases the general level of activity of the animal, sometimes leading to overt rage and fighting, discussed subsequently.
2. Stimulation in the ventromedial nucleus and surrounding areas mainly causes effects opposite to those caused by lateral hypothalamic stimulationthat is, a sense of satiety, decreased eating, and tranquility.
3. Stimulation of a thin zone of periventricular nuclei, located immediately adjacent to the third ventricle (or also stimulation of the central gray area of the mesencephalon that is continuous with this portion of the hypothalamus), usually leads to fear and punishment reactions.
4. Sexual drive can be stimulated from several areas of the hypothalamus, especially the most anterior and most posterior portions.

Effects Caused by Hypothalamic Lesions. Lesions in the hypothalamus, in general, cause effects opposite to those caused by stimulation, such as the following:

1. Bilateral lesions in the lateral hypothalamus will decrease drinking and eating almost to zero, often leading to lethal starvation. These lesions cause extreme passivity of the animal as well, with loss of most of its overt drives.
2. Bilateral lesions of the ventromedial areas of the hypothalamus cause effects that are mainly opposite to those caused by lesions of the lateral hypothalamus: excessive drinking and eating, as well as hyperactivity and often frequent bouts of extreme rage on the slightest provocation.
Stimulation or lesions in other regions of the limbic system, especially in the amygdala, the septal area, and areas in the mesencephalon, often cause effects similar to those elicited from the hypothalamus. We discuss some of these effects in more detail later.

## "REWARD" AND "PUNISHMENT" FUNCTION OF THE LIMBIC SYSTEM

From the discussion thus far, it is already clear that several limbic structures are particularly concerned with the affective nature of sensory sensations-that is, whether the sensations are pleasant or unpleasant. These affective qualities are also called reward or punishment, or satisfaction or aversion. Electrical stimulation of certain limbic areas pleases or satisfies the animal, whereas electrical stimulation of other regions causes terror, pain, fear, defense, escape reactions, and all the other elements of punishment. The degrees of stimulation of these two oppositely responding systems greatly affect the behavior of the animal.

## Reward Centers

Through experimental studies using electrical stimulators to map out the reward and punishment centers of the brain, the major reward centers have been found to be located along the course of the medial forebrain bundle, especially in the lateral and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. It is interesting that the lateral nucleus is included among the reward areas because strong stimuli in this area can actually cause rage. However, this phenomenon occurs in many areas, with weaker stimuli giving a sense of reward and stronger ones a sense of punishment. Less potent reward centers, which are perhaps secondary to the major ones in the hypothalamus, are found in the septum, the amygdala, certain areas of the thalamus and basal ganglia, and extending downward into the basal tegmentum of the mesencephalon.

## Punishment Centers

The most potent areas for punishment and escape tendencies have been found in the central gray area surrounding the aqueduct of Sylvius in the mesencephalon and extending upward into the periventricular zones of the hypothalamus and thalamus. Less potent punishment areas are found in some locations in the amygdala and hippocampus. It is particularly interesting that stimulation in the punishment centers can frequently inhibit the reward and pleasure centers completely, demonstrating that punishment and fear can take precedence over pleasure and reward.

## Association of Rage With Punishment Centers

An emotional pattern that involves the punishment centers of the hypothalamus and other limbic structures and that has also been well characterized is the rage pattern. This is described as follows.

Strong stimulation of the punishment centers of the brain, especially in the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus and in the lateral hypothalamus, causes the animal to (1) develop a defense posture; (2) extend its claws; (3) lift its tail; (4) hiss; (5) spit; (6) growl; and (7) develop piloerection, wide-open eyes, and dilated pupils. Furthermore, even the slightest provocation causes an immediate savage attack. This behavior is approximately the behavior that one would expect from an animal being severely punished, and it is a pattern of behavior called rage.

Fortunately, in the normal animal, the rage phenomenon is held in check mainly by inhibitory signals from the ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. In addition, portions of the hippocampi and anterior limbic cortex, especially in the anterior cingulate gyri and subcallosal gyri, help suppress the rage phenomenon.

Placidity and Tameness. Exactly the opposite emotional behavior patterns occur when the reward centers are stimulated—placidity and tameness.

## IMPORTANCE OF REWARD OR PUNISHMENT ON BEHAVIOR

Almost everything that we do is related in some way to reward and punishment. If we are doing something that is rewarding, we continue to do it; if it is punishing, we cease to do it. Therefore, the reward and punishment centers undoubtedly constitute one of the most important of all the controllers of our bodily activities, our drives, our aversions, and our motivations.

Effect of Tranquilizers on the Reward or Punishment Centers. Administration of a tranquilizer, such as chlorpromazine, usually inhibits both the reward and the punishment centers, thereby decreasing the affective reactivity of the animal. Therefore, it is presumed that tranquilizers function in psychotic states by suppressing many of the important behavioral areas of the hypothalamus and its associated regions of the limbic brain.

## Importance of Reward or Punishment in Learning and Memory—Habituation Versus Reinforcement

Animal experiments have shown that a sensory experience that causes neither reward nor punishment is hardly remembered at all. Electrical recordings from the brain show that a newly experienced sensory stimulus almost always excites multiple areas in the cerebral cortex. However, if the sensory experience does not elicit a sense of either reward or punishment, repetition of the stimulus over and over leads to almost complete extinction of the cerebral cortical response-that is, the animal becomes habituated to that specific sensory stimulus and thereafter ignores it.

If the stimulus does cause reward or punishment rather than indifference, the cerebral cortical response becomes progressively more and more intense during repeated stimulation instead of fading away, and the response is said to be reinforced. An animal builds up strong memory traces for sensations that are either rewarding or punishing but, conversely, develops complete habituation to indifferent sensory stimuli.

It is evident that the reward and punishment centers of the limbic system have much to do with selecting the information that we learn, usually throwing away more than $99 \%$ of it and selecting less than $1 \%$ for retention.

## SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF OTHER PARTS OF THE LIMBIC SYSTEM

## FUNCTIONS OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS

The hippocampus is the elongated portion of the cerebral cortex that folds inward to form the ventral surface of much of the inside of the lateral ventricle. One end of the hippocampus abuts the amygdaloid nuclei, and along its lateral border it fuses with the parahippocampal gyrus,

which is the cerebral cortex on the ventromedial outside surface of the temporal lobe.

The hippocampus (and its adjacent temporal and parietal lobe structures, all together called the hippocampal formation) has numerous but mainly indirect connections with many portions of the cerebral cortex, as well as with the basal structures of the limbic system-the amygdala, hypothalamus, septum, and mammillary bodies. Almost any type of sensory experience causes activation of at least some part of the hippocampus, and the hippocampus in turn distributes many outgoing signals to the anterior thalamus, hypothalamus, and other parts of the limbic system, especially through the fornix, a major communicating pathway. Thus, the hippocampus is an additional channel through which incoming sensory signals can initiate behavioral reactions for different purposes. As in other limbic structures, stimulation of different areas in the hippocampus can cause almost any of the different behavioral patterns such as pleasure, rage, passivity, or excess sex drive.

Another feature of the hippocampus is that it can become hyperexcitable. For example, weak electrical stimuli can cause focal epileptic seizures in small areas of the hippocampi. These seizures often persist for many seconds after the stimulation is over, suggesting that the hippocampi can perhaps give off prolonged output signals, even under normal functioning conditions. During hippocampal seizures, the person experiences various psychomotor effects, including olfactory, visual, auditory, tactile, and other types of hallucinations that cannot be suppressed as long as the seizure persists, even though the person has not lost consciousness and knows these hallucinations to be unreal. Probably one of the reasons for this hyperexcitability of the hippocampi is that they have a different type of cortex from that elsewhere in the cerebrum, with only three nerve cell layers in some of its areas instead of the six layers found elsewhere.

## Role of the Hippocampus in Learning

Anterograde Amnesia After Bilateral Removal of the Hippocampi. Portions of the hippocampi have been surgically removed bilaterally in a few human beings for treatment of epilepsy. These people can recall most previously learned memories satisfactorily. However, they often can learn essentially no new information that is based on verbal symbolism-they often cannot even learn the names of people with whom they come in contact every day. Yet they can remember for a moment or so what transpires during the course of their activities. Thus, they are capable of short-term memory for seconds up to a minute or two, although their ability to establish memories lasting longer than a few minutes is either completely or almost completely abolished. This phenomenon, called anterograde amnesia, was discussed in Chapter 58.

Theoretical Function of the Hippocampus in Learning. The hippocampus originated as part of the olfactory cortex. In many lower animals, this cortex plays
essential roles in determining whether the animal will eat a particular food, whether the smell of a particular object suggests danger, or whether the odor is sexually inviting, thus making decisions that are of life-or-death importance. Very early in evolutionary development of the brain, the hippocampus presumably became a critical decision-making neuronal mechanism, determining the importance of the incoming sensory signals. Once this critical decision-making capability had been established, presumably the remainder of the brain also began to call on the hippocampus for decision making. Therefore, if the hippocampus signals that a neuronal input is important, the information is likely to be committed to memory.

Thus, a person rapidly becomes habituated to indifferent stimuli but learns assiduously any sensory experience that causes either pleasure or pain. But what is the mechanism by which this occurs? It has been suggested that the hippocampus provides the drive that causes translation of short-term memory into longterm memory-that is, the hippocampus transmits signals that seem to make the mind rehearse over and over the new information until permanent storage takes place. Whatever the mechanism, without the hippocampi, consolidation of long-term memories of the verbal or symbolic thinking type is poor or does not take place.

## Functions of the Amygdala

The amygdala is a complex of multiple small nuclei located immediately beneath the cerebral cortex of the medial anterior pole of each temporal lobe. It has abundant bidirectional connections with the hypothalamus, as well as with other areas of the limbic system.

In lower animals, the amygdala is concerned to a great extent with olfactory stimuli and their interrelations with the limbic brain. It was noted in Chapter 54 that one of the major divisions of the olfactory tract terminates in a portion of the amygdala called the corticomedial nuclei, which lies immediately beneath the cerebral cortex in the olfactory pyriform area of the temporal lobe. In the human being, another portion of the amygdala, the basolateral nuclei, has become much more highly developed than the olfactory portion and plays important roles in many behavioral activities not generally associated with olfactory stimuli.

The amygdala receives neuronal signals from all portions of the limbic cortex, as well as from the neocortex of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes-especially from the auditory and visual association areas. Because of these multiple connections, the amygdala has been called the "window" through which the limbic system sees the place of the person in the world. In turn, the amygdala transmits signals (1) back into these same cortical areas, (2) into the hippocampus, (3) into the septum, (4) into the thalamus, and (5) especially into the hypothalamus.
Effects of Stimulating the Amygdala. In general, stimulation in the amygdala can cause almost all the same effects as those elicited by direct stimulation of the hypothalamus,

plus other effects. Effects initiated from the amygdala and then sent through the hypothalamus include the following: (1) increases or decreases in arterial pressure and heart rate; (2) increases or decreases in gastrointestinal motility and secretion; (3) defecation or micturition; (4) pupillary dilation or, rarely, constriction; (5) piloerection; and (6) secretion of various anterior pituitary hormones, especially the gonadotropins and adrenocorticotropic hormone.

Aside from these effects mediated through the hypothalamus, amygdala stimulation can also cause several types of involuntary movement. These types include the following: (1) tonic movements, such as raising the head or bending the body; (2) circling movements; (3) occasionally clonic, rhythmical movements; and (4) different types of movements associated with olfaction and eating, such as licking, chewing, and swallowing.

Stimulation of certain amygdaloid nuclei can also cause a pattern of rage, escape, punishment, severe pain, and fear similar to the rage pattern elicited from the hypothalamus, as described earlier. Stimulation of other amygdaloid nuclei can give reactions of reward and pleasure.

Finally, excitation of still other portions of the amygdala can cause sexual activities that include erection, copulatory movements, ejaculation, ovulation, uterine activity, and premature labor.

Effects of Bilateral Ablation of the Amygdala-The Klüver-Bucy Syndrome. When the anterior parts of both temporal lobes are destroyed in a monkey, this procedure removes not only portions of temporal cortex but also of the amygdalas that lie inside these parts of the temporal lobes. This removal causes changes in behavior called the KlüverBucy syndrome, which is demonstrated by an animal that (1) is not afraid of anything, (2) has extreme curiosity about everything, (3) forgets rapidly, (4) has a tendency to place everything in its mouth and sometimes even tries to eat solid objects, and (5) often has a sex drive so strong that it attempts to copulate with immature animals, animals of the wrong sex, or even animals of a different species. Although similar lesions in human beings are rare, afflicted people respond in a manner not too different from that of the monkey.

Overall Function of the Amygdalas. The amygdalas seem to be behavioral awareness areas that operate at a semiconscious level. They also seem to project into the limbic system one's current status in relation to both surroundings and thoughts. On the basis of this information, the amygdala is believed to make the person's behavioral response appropriate for each occasion.

## Function of the Limbic Cortex

The most poorly understood portion of the limbic system is the ring of cerebral cortex called the limbic cortex that surrounds the subcortical limbic structures. This cortex functions as a transitional zone through which signals are transmitted from the remainder of the brain cortex into the limbic system and also in the opposite direction. Therefore, the limbic cortex in effect functions as a cerebral association area for control of behavior.

Stimulation of the different regions of the limbic cortex has failed to give any clear idea of their functions. However,
many behavioral patterns can be elicited by stimulation of specific portions of the limbic cortex. Likewise, ablation of some limbic cortical areas can cause persistent changes in an animal's behavior, as follows.

Ablation of the Anterior Temporal Cortex. When the anterior temporal cortex is ablated bilaterally, the amygdalas are almost invariably damaged as well and, as discussed earlier, the Klüver-Bucy syndrome occurs. The animal especially develops consummatory behavior: it investigates any and all objects, has intense sex drives toward inappropriate animals or even inanimate objects, and loses all fear-and thus develops tameness as well.

Ablation of the Posterior Orbital Frontal Cortex. Bilateral removal of the posterior portion of the orbital frontal cortex often causes an animal to develop insomnia associated with intense motor restlessness; the animal becomes unable to sit still and moves about continuously.

## Ablation of the Anterior Cingulate Gyri and Subcallosal

Gyri. The anterior cingulate gyri and the subcallosal gyri are the portions of the limbic cortex that communicate between the prefrontal cerebral cortex and the subcortical limbic structures. Destruction of these gyri bilaterally releases the rage centers of the septum and hypothalamus from prefrontal inhibitory influence. Therefore, the animal can become vicious and much more subject to fits of rage than normally.

Summary. Until further information is available, it is perhaps best to state that the cortical regions of the limbic system occupy intermediate associative positions between the functions of the specific areas of the cerebral cortex and functions of the subcortical limbic structures for control of behavioral patterns. Thus, in the anterior temporal cortex, one especially finds gustatory and olfactory behavioral associations. In the parahippocampal gyri, there is a tendency for complex auditory associations and complex thought associations derived from Wernicke's area of the posterior temporal lobe. In the middle and posterior cingulate cortex, there is reason to believe that sensorimotor behavioral associations occur.

# States of Brain Activity-Sleep, Brain Waves, Epilepsy, Psychoses, and Dementia 

All of us are aware of the many different states of brain activity, including sleep, wakefulness, extreme excitement, and even different levels of mood such as exhilaration, depression, and fear. All these states result from different activating or inhibiting forces generated usually within the brain. In Chapter 59, we began a partial discussion of this subject when we described different systems that are capable of activating large portions of the brain. In this chapter, we present brief surveys of specific states of brain activity, beginning with sleep.

## SLEEP

Sleep is defined as unconsciousness from which a person can be aroused by sensory or other stimuli. It is to be distinguished from coma, which is unconsciousness from which a person cannot be aroused. There are multiple stages of sleep, from very light sleep to very deep sleep. Sleep researchers also divide sleep into two entirely different types of sleep that have different qualities, as described in the following section.

## TWO TYPES OF SLEEP—SLOW-WAVE SLEEP AND RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP

Each night, a person goes through stages of two major types of sleep that alternate with each other (Figure 60-1). These types are called (1) rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep), in which the eyes undergo rapid movements even though the person is still asleep, and (2) slow-wave sleep or non-REM (NREM) sleep, in which the brain waves are strong and of low frequency, as we discuss later.

REM sleep occurs in episodes that occupy about 25\% of the sleep time in young adults; each episode normally recurs about every 90 minutes. This type of sleep is not so restful, and it is often associated with vivid dreaming. Most sleep during each night is of the slow-wave (NREM) variety, which is the deep, restful sleep that the person experiences during the first hour of sleep after having been awake for many hours.

## REM (Paradoxical, Desynchronized) Sleep

In a normal night of sleep, bouts of REM sleep lasting 5 to 30 minutes usually appear on average every 90 minutes
in young adults. When a person is extremely sleepy, each bout of REM sleep is short and may even be absent. As the person becomes more rested through the night, the durations of the REM bouts increase.

REM sleep has several important characteristics:

1. It is an active form of sleep usually associated with dreaming and active bodily muscle movements.
2. The person is even more difficult to arouse by sensory stimuli than during deep slow-wave sleep, and yet people usually awaken spontaneously in the morning during an episode of REM sleep.
3. Muscle tone throughout the body is exceedingly depressed, indicating strong inhibition of the spinal muscle control areas.
4. Heart rate and respiratory rate usually become irregular, which is characteristic of the dream state.
5. Despite the extreme inhibition of the peripheral muscles, irregular muscle movements do occur in addition to the rapid movements of the eyes.
6. The brain is highly active in REM sleep, and overall brain metabolism may be increased as much as $20 \%$. An electroencephalogram (EEG) shows a pattern of brain waves similar to those that occur during wakefulness. This type of sleep is also called paradoxical sleep because it is a paradox that a person can still be asleep, despite the presence of marked activity in the brain.
In summary, REM sleep is a type of sleep in which the brain is quite active. However, the person is not fully aware of the surroundings and therefore is truly asleep.

## Slow-Wave Sleep

We can understand the characteristics of deep slow-wave sleep by remembering the last time we were kept awake for more than 24 hours and the deep sleep that occurred during the first hour after going to sleep. This sleep is exceedingly restful and is associated with decreases in peripheral vascular tone and many other vegetative functions of the body. For example, $10 \%$ to $30 \%$ decreases occur in blood pressure, respiratory rate, and basal metabolic rate.

Although slow-wave sleep is frequently called "dreamless sleep," dreams and sometimes even nightmares do occur during slow-wave sleep. The difference between

Figure 60-1. Progressive change in the characteristics of the brain waves during alert wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and stages one through four of sleep.
the dreams that occur in slow-wave sleep and those that occur in REM sleep is that those of REM sleep are associated with more bodily muscle activity. Also, the dreams of slow-wave sleep are usually not remembered because consolidation of the dreams in memory does not occur.

## BASIC THEORIES OF SLEEP

## Sleep Is Caused by an Active Inhibitory Process.

An earlier theory of sleep was that the excitatory areas of the upper brain stem, the reticular activating system, simply became fatigued during the waking day and became inactive as a result. An important experiment changed this thinking to the current view that sleep is caused by an active inhibitory process, because it was discovered that transecting the brain stem at the level of the midpons creates a brain cortex that never goes to sleep. In other words, a center located below the midpontile level of the brain stem appears to be required to cause sleep by inhibiting other parts of the brain.

## Neuronal Centers, Neurohumoral Substances, and Mechanisms That Can Cause Sleep-Possible Role for Serotonin

Stimulation of several specific areas of the brain can produce sleep with characteristics near those of natural sleep. Some of these areas are the following:

1. The raphe nuclei in the lower half of the pons and in the medulla is the most conspicuous stimulation area for causing almost natural sleep. These nuclei comprise a thin sheet of special neurons located in
the midline. Nerve fibers from these nuclei spread locally in the brain stem reticular formation and also upward into the thalamus, hypothalamus, most areas of the limbic system, and even the neocortex of the cerebrum. In addition, fibers extend downward into the spinal cord, terminating in the posterior horns, where they can inhibit incoming sensory signals, including pain, as discussed in Chapter 49. Many nerve endings of fibers from these raphe neurons secrete serotonin. When a drug that blocks the formation of serotonin is administered to an animal, the animal often cannot sleep for the next several days. Therefore, it has been assumed that serotonin is a transmitter substance associated with the production of sleep.
2. Stimulation of some areas in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius can also cause sleep. This nucleus is the termination in the medulla and pons for visceral sensory signals entering by way of the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves.
3. Sleep can be promoted by stimulation of several regions in the diencephalon, including (1) the rostral part of the hypothalamus, mainly in the suprachiasmal area, and (2) an occasional area in the diffuse nuclei of the thalamus.

Lesions in Sleep-Promoting Centers Can Cause Intense Wakefulness. Discrete lesions in the raphe nuclei lead to a high state of wakefulness. This phenomenon is also true of bilateral lesions in the medial rostral suprachiasmal area in the anterior hypothalamus. In both cases, the excitatory reticular nuclei of the mesencephalon and

upper pons seem to become released from inhibition, thus causing intense wakefulness. Indeed, sometimes lesions of the anterior hypothalamus can cause such intense wakefulness that the animal actually dies of exhaustion.

## Other Possible Transmitter Substances Related to

Sleep. Experiments have shown that the cerebrospinal fluid and the blood or urine of animals that have been kept awake for several days contain a substance or substances that will cause sleep when injected into the brain ventricular system of another animal. One likely substance has been identified as muramyl peptide, a low-molecularweight substance that accumulates in the cerebrospinal fluid and urine in animals kept awake for several days. When only micrograms of this sleep-producing substance are injected into the third ventricle, almost natural sleep occurs within a few minutes, and the animal may stay asleep for several hours.

Another substance that has similar effects in causing sleep is delta sleep-inducing peptide, a nonapeptide found in the cerebrospinal fluid after electrical stimulation of the thalamus to induce sleep. Several other potential sleep factors, mostly peptides, have been isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid or neuronal tissues of the brain stem of animals kept awake for days. It is possible that prolonged wakefulness causes progressive accumulation of a sleep factor or factors in the brain stem or cerebrospinal fluid that lead(s) to sleep.

Possible Cause of REM Sleep. It is not understood why slow-wave sleep is broken periodically by REM sleep. However, drugs that mimic the action of acetylcholine increase the occurrence of REM sleep. Therefore, it has been postulated that the large acetylcholine-secreting neurons in the upper brain stem reticular formation might, through their extensive efferent fibers, activate many portions of the brain. This mechanism theoretically could cause the increased activity that occurs in certain brain regions in REM sleep, even though the signals are not channeled appropriately in the brain to cause normal conscious awareness that is characteristic of wakefulness.

## Cycle Between Sleep and Wakefulness

The preceding discussions have merely identified neuronal areas, transmitters, and mechanisms that are related to sleep; they have not explained the cyclical, reciprocal operation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. There is as yet no definitive explanation. Therefore, we might suggest the following possible mechanism for causing the sleepwakefulness cycle.

When the sleep centers are not activated, the mesencephalic and upper pontile reticular activating nuclei are released from inhibition, which allows the reticular activating nuclei to become spontaneously active. This spontaneous activity in turn excites both the cerebral cortex and the peripheral nervous system, both of which send numerous positive feedback signals back to the same reticular activating nuclei to activate them still further.

Therefore, once wakefulness begins, it has a natural tendency to sustain itself because of all this positive feedback activity.

Then, after the brain remains activated for many hours, even the neurons in the activating system presumably become fatigued. Consequently, the positive feedback cycle between the mesencephalic reticular nuclei and the cerebral cortex fades and the sleep-promoting effects of the sleep centers take over, leading to rapid transition from wakefulness back to sleep.

This overall theory could explain the rapid transitions from sleep to wakefulness and from wakefulness to sleep. It could also explain arousal-that is, the insomnia that occurs when a person's mind becomes preoccupied with a thought-and the wakefulness that is produced by bodily physical activity.

Role of Orexin Neurons in Arousal and Wakefulness. Orexin (also called hypocretin) is produced by neurons in the hypothalamus that provide excitatory input to many other areas of the brain where there are orexin receptors. Orexin neurons are most active during waking and almost stop firing during slow wave and REM sleep. Loss of orexin signaling as a result of defective orexin receptors or destruction of orexin-producing neurons causes narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep that can occur, even when a person is talking or working. Patients with narcolepsy may also experience a sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy) that can be partial or even severe enough to cause paralysis during the attack. These observations point to an important role for orexin neurons in maintaining wakefulness, but their contribution to the normal daily cycle between sleep and wakefulness is unclear.

## SLEEP HAS IMPORTANT PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS

There is little doubt that sleep has important functions. It exists in all mammals, and after total deprivation there is usually a period of "catch-up" or "rebound" sleep; after selective deprivation of REM or slow-wave sleep, there is also a selective rebound of these specific stages of sleep. Even mild sleep restriction over a few days may degrade cognitive and physical performance, overall productivity, and the health of a person. The essential role of sleep in homeostasis is perhaps most vividly demonstrated by the fact that rats deprived of sleep for 2 to 3 weeks may actually die. Despite the obvious importance of sleep, our understanding of why sleep is an essential part of life is still limited.

Sleep causes two major types of physiological effects: first, effects on the nervous system, and second, effects on other functional systems of the body. Mammals, and even invertebrate animals, sleep more in the setting of infectious as well as non-infectious illnesses. Sickness-induced sleep has been suggested to be a beneficial response that diverts the organism's energy resources from neural and motor demands to fighting off infectious or injurious insults.

Lack of sleep certainly affects the functions of the central nervous system. Prolonged wakefulness is often associated with progressive malfunction of the thought processes and sometimes even causes abnormal behavioral activities. We are all familiar with the increased sluggishness of thought that occurs toward the end of a prolonged wakeful period, but in addition, a person can become irritable or even psychotic after forced wakefulness. Therefore, we can assume that sleep in multiple ways restores both normal levels of brain activity and normal "balance" among the different functions of the central nervous system.

Sleep has been postulated to serve many functions, including the following: (1) neural maturation; (2) facilitation of learning or memory; (3) targeted erasure of synapses to "forget" unimportant information that might clutter the synaptic network; (4) cognition; (5) clearance of metabolic waste products generated by neural activity in the awake brain; and (6) conservation of metabolic energy. There is some evidence for each of these functions, but evidence supporting each of these ideas has been challenged. We might postulate that the principal value of sleep is to restore natural balances among the neuronal centers, which is necessary for overall health. The specific physiological functions of sleep, however, remain a mystery and are the subject of much research.

## Brain Waves

Electrical recordings from the surface of the brain or even from the outer surface of the head demonstrate that there is continuous electrical activity in the brain. Both the intensity and the patterns of this electrical activity are determined by the level of excitation of different parts of the brain resulting from sleep, wakefulness, or brain disorders such as epilepsy or even psychoses. The undulations in the recorded electrical potentials, shown in Figure 60-2, are called brain waves, and the entire record is called an electroencephalogram (EEG).

The intensities of brain waves recorded from the surface of the scalp range from 0 to 200 microvolts, and their frequencies range from once every few seconds to 50 or more per second. The character of the waves is dependent on the degree of activity in respective parts of the cerebral cortex, and the waves change markedly between the states of wakefulness and sleep and coma.

Much of the time, the brain waves are irregular and no specific pattern can be discerned in the EEG. At other times, distinct patterns do appear, some of which are characteristic of specific abnormalities of the brain such as epilepsy, which is discussed later.

In healthy people, most waves in the EEG can be classified as alpha, beta, theta, and delta waves, which are shown in Figure 60-2.

Alpha waves are rhythmical waves that occur at frequencies between 8 and 13 cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$ and are found in the EEGs of almost all healthy adults when they are awake and in a quiet, resting state of cerebration. These waves occur most intensely in the occipital region but can also be recorded from the parietal and frontal regions of the scalp.

Figure 60-3. Replacement of the alpha rhythm by an asynchronous, low-voltage beta rhythm when the eyes are open.

Their voltage is usually about 50 microvolts. During deep sleep, the alpha waves disappear.

When the awake person's attention is directed to some specific type of mental activity, the alpha waves are replaced by asynchronous, higher frequency but lower voltage beta waves. Figure 60-3 shows the effect on the alpha waves of simply opening the eyes in bright light and then closing the eyes. Note that the visual sensations cause immediate cessation of the alpha waves and that these waves are replaced by low-voltage, asynchronous beta waves.

Beta waves occur at frequencies greater than 14 cycles/ sec and as high as 80 cycles/sec. They are recorded mainly from the parietal and frontal regions during specific activation of these parts of the brain.

Theta waves have frequencies between four and 7 cycles/sec. They occur normally in the parietal and temporal regions in children, but they also occur during emotional stress in some adults, particularly during disappointment and frustration. Theta waves also occur in many brain disorders, often in degenerative brain states.

Delta waves include all the waves of the EEG with frequencies less than 3.5 cycles/sec, and they often have voltages two to four times greater than most other types of brain waves. They occur in very deep sleep, in infancy, and in persons with serious organic brain disease. They also occur in the cortex of animals that have had subcortical transections in which the cerebral cortex is separated from the thalamus. Therefore, delta waves can occur strictly in the cortex independent of activities in lower regions of the brain.

## Origin of Brain Waves

The discharge of a single neuron or single nerve fiber in the brain can never be recorded from the surface of the head. Instead, many thousands or even millions of neurons or fibers must fire synchronously for the potentials from the individual neurons or fibers to summate enough to be recorded through the skull. Thus, the intensity of the brain

![gu588617462c](gu588617462c.jpg)

Figure 60-4. Effect of varying degrees of cerebral activity on the basic rhythm of the electroencephalogram.
waves from the scalp is determined mainly by the numbers of neurons and fibers that fire in synchrony with one another, not by the total level of electrical activity in the brain. In fact, strong nonsynchronous nerve signals often nullify one another in the recorded brain waves because of opposing polarities. This phenomenon is demonstrated in Figure $60-3$, which shows, when the eyes were closed, synchronous discharge of many neurons in the cerebral cortex at a frequency of about $12 / \mathrm{sec}$, thus causing alpha waves. Then, when the eyes were opened, the activity of the brain increased greatly, but synchronization of the signals became so little that the brain waves mainly nullified one another. The resultant effect was low voltage waves of generally high but irregular frequency, the beta waves.

Origin of Alpha Waves. Alpha waves will not occur in the cerebral cortex without cortical connections with the thalamus. Conversely, stimulation in the nonspecific layer of reticular nuclei that surround the thalamus or in "diffuse" nuclei deep inside the thalamus often sets up electrical waves in the thalamocortical system at a frequency between 8 and $13 / \mathrm{sec}$, which is the natural frequency of the alpha waves. Therefore, alpha waves are thought to result from spontaneous feedback oscillation in this diffuse thalamocortical system, possibly including the reticular activating system in the brain stem as well. This oscillation presumably causes the periodicity of the alpha waves and the synchronous activation of literally millions of cortical neurons during each wave.

Origin of Delta Waves. Transection of the fiber tracts from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex, which blocks thalamic activation of the cortex and thereby eliminates the alpha waves, nevertheless does not block delta waves in the cortex. This indicates that some synchronizing mechanism can occur in the cortical neuronal system by itself-mainly independent of lower structures in the brain-to cause the delta waves.

Delta waves also occur during deep slow-wave sleep, which suggests that the cortex then is mainly released from the activating influences of the thalamus and other lower centers.

## Effect of Varying Levels of Cerebral Activity on the Frequency of the EEG

There is a general correlation between level of cerebral activity and average frequency of the EEG rhythm, with the average frequency increasing progressively with higher degrees of activity. This is demonstrated in Figure 60-4, which shows the existence of delta waves in surgical anesthesia and deep sleep, theta waves in psychomotor states, alpha waves during relaxed states, and beta waves during periods of intense mental activity or fright. During periods of mental activity, the waves usually become asynchronous rather than synchronous, so the voltage falls considerably
despite markedly increased cortical activity, as shown in Figure 60-3.

## Changes in the EEG at Different Stages of Wakefulness and Sleep

Figure 60-1 shows typical EEG patterns in different stages of wakefulness and sleep. Alert wakefulness is characterized by high-frequency beta waves, whereas quiet wakefulness is usually associated with alpha waves, as demonstrated by the first two EEGs of the figure.

Slow-wave sleep is divided into four stages. In the first stage, a stage of light sleep, the voltage of the EEG waves becomes low. This stage is broken by "sleep spindles" (i.e., short spindle-shaped bursts of alpha waves that occur periodically). In stages 2, 3, and 4 of slow-wave sleep, the frequency of the EEG becomes progressively slower until it reaches a frequency of only one to three waves per second in stage 4 ; these waves are delta waves.

Figure 60-1 also shows the EEG during REM sleep. It is often difficult to tell the difference between this brain wave pattern and that of an awake, active person. The waves are irregular and of high frequency, which are normally suggestive of desynchronized nervous activity as found in the awake state. Therefore, REM sleep is frequently called desynchronized sleep because there is lack of synchrony in the firing of the neurons despite significant brain activity.

## Seizures and Epilepsy

Seizures are temporary disruptions of brain function caused by uncontrolled excessive neuronal activity. Depending on the distribution of neuronal discharges, seizure manifestations can range from experiential phenomena that are barely noticeable to dramatic convulsions. These temporary symptomatic seizures usually do not persist if the underlying disorder is corrected. They can be caused by multiple neurological or medical conditions, such as acute electrolyte disorders, hypoglycemia, drugs (e.g., cocaine), eclampsia, kidney failure, hypertensive encephalopathy, meningitis, and so forth. Approximately $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the population will have at least one seizure in their lifetime.

In contrast to symptomatic seizures, epilepsy is a chronic condition of recurrent seizures that can also vary from brief and nearly undetectable symptoms to periods of vigorous shaking and convulsions. Epilepsy is not a single disease. Its clinical symptoms are heterogeneous and reflect multiple underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that cause cerebral dysfunction and injury, such as trauma, stroke, tumors, infection, or degenerative changes. Hereditary factors appear to be important, although a specific cause cannot be identified in many patients and several factors may coexist, reflecting an acquired brain pathology and genetic predisposition. Epilepsy is estimated to affect approximately $1 \%$ of the population, or 65 million people worldwide.

At a basic level an epileptic seizure is caused by a disruption of the normal balance between inhibitory and excitatory currents or transmission in one or more regions of the brain. Drugs or pathological factors that increase neuronal excitation or impair inhibition tend to be epileptogenic (i.e., predisposing a person to epilepsy), whereas effective antiepileptic drugs attenuate excitation and facilitate inhibition. In cases in which a person has brain injury due to trauma, stroke, or infection, there may be a delay of several months or years after the injury before the seizures begin.

Epileptic seizures can be classified into two major types: (1) focal seizures (also called partial seizures) that are limited to a focal area of one cerebral hemisphere, and (2) generalized seizures that diffusely involve both hemispheres of the cerebral cortex. However, partial seizures may sometimes evolve into generalized seizures.

## Focal (Partial) Epileptic Seizures

Focal epileptic seizures begin in a small localized region of the cerebral cortex or deeper structures of the cerebrum and brain stem and have clinical manifestations that reflect the function of the affected brain area. Most often, focal epilepsy results from some localized organic lesion or functional abnormality, such as (1) scar tissue in the brain that pulls on the adjacent neuronal tissue, (2) a tumor that compresses an area of the brain, (3) a destroyed area of brain tissue, or (4) congenitally deranged local circuitry.

These lesions can promote extremely rapid discharges in the local neurons; when the discharge rate rises above several hundred per second, synchronous waves begin to spread over adjacent cortical regions. These waves presumably result from localized reverberating circuits that may gradually recruit adjacent areas of the cortex into the epileptic discharge zone. The process spreads to adjacent areas at a rate as slow as a few millimeters per minute to as fast as several centimeters per second.

Focal seizures can spread locally from a focus or more remotely to the contralateral cortex and subcortical areas of the brain through projections to the thalamus, which has widespread connections to both hemispheres (Figure 60-5). When such a wave of excitation spreads over the motor cortex, it causes a progressive "march" of muscle contractions throughout the opposite side of the body, beginning most characteristically in the mouth region and marching progressively downward to the legs but at other times marching in the opposite direction. This phenomenon is called Jacksonian march.

Focal seizures are often classified as simple partial seizures when there is no major change in consciousness or as complex partial seizures when consciousness is impaired. Simple partial seizures may be preceded by an aura, with sensations such as fear, followed by motor signs, such as rhythmic jerking or tonic stiffening movements of a body part. A focal epileptic attack may remain confined to a single area of the brain, often the temporal lobe, but in some cases strong signals spread from the focal region, and the person may lose consciousness. Complex partial seizures may also begin with an aura followed by impaired consciousness and strange repetitive movements (automatisms), such as chewing or lip smacking. After recovery from the seizure the person may have no memory of the attack, except for the aura.
![gu598617462c](gu598617462c.jpg)

Figure 60-5. A, Propagation of seizures from focal regions of the cortex can occur through fibers in the same cerebral hemisphere or fibers that connect to the contralateral cortex. B, Secondary generalization of a focal seizure can sometimes occur by spread to subcortical areas through projections to the thalamus, resulting in activation of both hemispheres. C, Primary generalized seizure spreads rapidly and simultaneously to both cerebral hemispheres through interconnections between the thalamus and cortex.

The time after the seizure, prior to the return of normal neurological function, is called the postictal period.

Psychomotor, temporal lobe, and limbic seizures are terms that have been used in the past to describe many of the behaviors that are now classified as complex partial seizures. However, these terms are not synonymous. Complex partial seizures can arise from regions other than the temporal lobe and do not always involve the limbic system. Also, automatisms (the "psychomotor" element) are not always present in complex partial seizures. Attacks of this type frequently involve part of the limbic portion of the

Generalized tonic-clonic seizure

brain, such as the hippocampus, the amygdala, the septum, and/or portions of the temporal cortex.

The lowest tracing of Figure 60-6 demonstrates a typical EEG during a psychomotor seizure, showing a lowfrequency rectangular wave with a frequency between 2 and $4 / \mathrm{sec}$ and with occasional superimposed $14 / \mathrm{sec}$ waves.

## Generalized Seizures

Generalized epileptic seizures are characterized by diffuse, excessive, and uncontrolled neuronal discharges that at the outset spread rapidly and simultaneously to both cerebral hemispheres through interconnections between the thalamus and cortex (Figure 60-5). However, it is sometimes difficult clinically to distinguish between a primary generalized seizure and a focal seizure that spreads rapidly. Generalized seizures are subdivided primarily on the basis of the ictal motor manifestations which, in turn, depend on the extent to which subcortical and brain stem regions participate in the seizure.

## Generalized Tonic-Clonic (Grand Mal) Seizures)

Generalized tonic-clonic seizures, previously called grand mal seizures, are characterized by an abrupt loss of consciousness and extreme neuronal discharges in all areas of the brain-the cerebral cortex, the deeper parts of the cerebrum, and even the brain stem. Also, discharges transmitted all the way into the spinal cord sometimes cause generalized tonic seizures of the entire body, followed toward the end of the attack by alternating tonic and spasmodic muscle contractions called tonic-clonic seizures. Often the person bites or "swallows" his or her tongue and may have difficulty breathing, sometimes to the extent that cyanosis occurs. Also, signals transmitted from the brain to the viscera frequently cause urination and defecation.

The usual generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasts from a few seconds to 3 to 4 minutes. It is also characterized by postseizure depression of the entire nervous system; the person remains in stupor for 1 minute to many minutes after the seizure attack is over and then often remains severely fatigued and asleep for hours thereafter.

The top recording of Figure 60-6 shows a typical EEG from almost any region of the cortex during the tonic phase of generalized tonic-clonic seizure. This demonstrates that high-voltage, high-frequency discharges occur over the entire cortex. Furthermore, the same type of discharge occurs on both sides of the brain at the same time, demonstrating
that the abnormal neuronal circuitry responsible for the attack strongly involves the basal regions of the brain that drive the two halves of the cerebrum simultaneously.

Electrical recordings from the thalamus, as well as from the reticular formation of the brain stem during the generalized tonic-clonic seizure, show typical high-voltage activity in both of these areas similar to that recorded from the cerebral cortex. Therefore, a generalized tonic-clonic seizure presumably involves not only abnormal activation of the thalamus and cerebral cortex but also abnormal activation in the subthalamic brain stem portions of the brainactivating system.

What Initiates a Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure? The majority of generalized seizures are idiopathic, which means that the cause is unknown. Many people who have generalized tonic-clonic attacks have a hereditary predisposition to epilepsy, a predisposition that occurs in about 1 of every 100 persons. In these people, factors that can increase the excitability of the abnormal "epileptogenic" circuitry enough to precipitate attacks include (1) strong emotional stimuli, (2) alkalosis caused by overbreathing, (3) drugs, (4) fever, and (5) loud noises or flashing lights.

Even in people who are not genetically predisposed, certain types of traumatic lesions in almost any part of the brain can cause excess excitability of local brain areas, as we discuss shortly. These local brain areas also sometimes transmit signals into the activating systems of the brain to elicit tonic-clonic seizures.

What Stops the Generalized Tonic-Clonic Attack? The extreme neuronal overactivity during a tonic-clonic attack is presumed to be caused by massive simultaneous activation of many reverberating neuronal pathways throughout the brain. Although the factors that terminate the attack are not well understood, it is likely that active inhibition occurs by inhibitory neurons that have been activated by the attack.

## Absence Seizures (Petit Mal Seizures)

Absence seizures, formerly called petit mal seizures, usually begin in childhood or early adolescence and account for $15 \%$ to $20 \%$ of epilepsy cases in children. Absence seizures almost certainly involve the thalamocortical brain activating system. They are usually characterized by 3 to 30 seconds of unconsciousness or diminished consciousness, during which time the person often stares and has twitchlike contractions of muscles, usually in the head region, especially blinking of the eyes; this phase is followed by a rapid return of consciousness and resumption of previous activities. The total sequence is called the absence syndrome or absence epilepsy.

The patient may have one such attack in many months or, in rare cases, may have a rapid series of attacks, one after the other. The usual course is for the absence seizures to appear first during childhood or adolescence and then to disappear by the age of 30 years. On occasion, an absence seizure will initiate a generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) attack.

The brain wave pattern in a person with absence seizure epilepsy is demonstrated by the middle recording of Figure $60-6$, which is typified by a spike and dome pattern. The spike and dome can be recorded over most or all of the

cerebral cortex, showing that the seizure involves much or most of the thalamocortical activating system of the brain. In fact, animal studies suggest that it results from oscillation of (1) inhibitory thalamic reticular neurons (which are inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]-producing neurons) and (2) excitatory thalamocortical and corticothalamic neurons.

## Treatment of Epilepsy

Most of the currently available drugs used to treat epilepsy appear to block the initiation or spread of seizures, although the precise mode of action for some drugs is unknown or may involve multiple actions. Some of the major effects of various antiepileptic drugs include the following: (1) blockade of voltage-dependent sodium channels (e.g., carbamazepine and phenytoin); (2) altered calcium currents (e.g., ethosuximide); (3) an increase in GABA activity (e.g., phenobarbital and benzodiazepines); (4) inhibition of receptors for glutamate, the most prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter (e.g., perampanel); and (5) multiple mechanisms of action (e.g., valproate and topiramate, which block voltage-dependent sodium channels and increase GABA levels in the brain). The choice of antiepileptic drug recommended by current guidelines depends on the type of seizure, the age of the patient, and other factors, but correction of the underlying cause of the seizures is the best option when possible.

Epilepsy can usually be controlled with appropriate medications. However, when the epilepsy is medically intractable and does not respond to treatments, the EEG can sometimes be used to localize abnormal spiking waves originating in areas of organic brain disease that predispose to focal epileptic attacks. Once such a focal point is found, surgical excision of the focus frequently prevents future attacks.

## Roles of Specific Neurotransmitter Systems in Brain Disorders

Clinical studies of patients with different psychoses or different types of dementia have suggested that many of these conditions result from diminished function of neurons that secrete a specific neurotransmitter. Use of appropriate drugs to counteract loss of the respective neurotransmitter has been successful in treating some patients.

In Chapter 57, we discussed the cause of Parkinson's disease, which results from loss of neurons in the substantia nigra, whose nerve endings secrete dopamine in the caudate nucleus and putamen. Also in Chapter 57, we pointed out that in Huntington's disease, loss of GABA-secreting neurons and acetylcholine-secreting neurons is associated with specific abnormal motor patterns plus dementia occurring in the same patient.

## Depression and Manic-Depressive PsychosesDecreased Activity of the Norepinephrine and Serotonin Neurotransmitter Systems

Evidence has accumulated suggesting that mental depression psychosis, which occurs in more than 8 million people in the United States, might be caused by diminished formation in the brain of norepinephrine or serotonin, or both. (New evidence has implicated still other neurotransmitters.) Depressed patients experience symptoms of grief, unhappiness, despair, and misery. In addition, they often
lose their appetite and sex drive and have severe insomnia. Often associated with these symptoms is a state of psychomotor agitation despite the depression.

Moderate numbers of norepinephrine-secreting neurons are located in the brain stem, especially in the locus ceruleus. These neurons send fibers upward to most parts of the brain limbic system, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. Also, many serotonin-producing neurons located in the midline raphe nuclei of the lower pons and medulla send fibers to many areas of the limbic system and to some other areas of the brain.

A principal reason for believing that depression might be caused by diminished activity of norepinephrine- and serotonin-secreting neurons is that drugs that block secretion of norepinephrine and serotonin, such as reserpine, frequently cause depression. Conversely, about 70\% of depressive patients can be treated effectively with drugs that increase the excitatory effects of norepinephrine and serotonin at the nerve endings, for example, as follows: (1) monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which block destruction of norepinephrine and serotonin once they are formed, and (2) tricyclic antidepressants, such as imipramine and amitriptyline, which block reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve endings so that these transmitters remain active for longer periods after secretion.

Some patients with mental depression alternate between depression and mania, which is called either bipolar disorder or manic-depressive psychosis, and fewer patients exhibit only mania without the depressive episodes. Drugs that diminish the formation or action of norepinephrine and serotonin, such as lithium compounds, can be effective in treating the manic phase of the condition.

It is presumed that the norepinephrine and serotonin systems normally provide drive to the limbic areas of the brain to increase a person's sense of well-being and to create happiness, contentment, good appetite, appropriate sex drive, and psychomotor balance-although too much of a good thing can cause mania. In support of this concept is the fact that pleasure and reward centers of the hypothalamus and surrounding areas receive large numbers of nerve endings from the norepinephrine and serotonin systems.

## Schizophrenia-Possible Exaggerated Function of Part of the Dopamine System

Schizophrenia comes in many varieties. One of the most common types is seen in the person who hears voices and has delusions, intense fear, or other types of feelings that are unreal. Many schizophrenics are highly paranoid, with a sense of persecution from outside sources. They may develop incoherent speech, dissociation of ideas, and abnormal sequences of thought, and they are often withdrawn, sometimes with abnormal posture and even rigidity.

There are reasons to believe that schizophrenia results from one or more of three possibilities: (1) multiple areas in the cerebral cortex prefrontal lobes in which neural signals have become blocked or where processing of the signals becomes dysfunctional because many synapses normally excited by the neurotransmitter glutamate lose their responsiveness to this transmitter; (2) excessive excitement of a group of neurons that secrete dopamine in the behavioral centers of the brain, including in the frontal lobes; and/or (3) abnormal function of a crucial part of the brain's limbic behavioral control system centered around the hippocampus.

The reason for believing that the prefrontal lobes are involved in schizophrenia is that a schizophrenic-like pattern of mental activity can be induced in monkeys by making multiple minute lesions in widespread areas of the prefrontal lobes.

Dopamine has been implicated in schizophrenia because schizophrenic-like symptoms develop in many patients with Parkinson's disease when they are treated with the drug called $\iota$-dopa. This drug releases dopamine in the brain, which is advantageous for treating Parkinson's disease, but at the same time it depresses various portions of the prefrontal lobes and other related areas.

It has been suggested that in persons with schizophrenia, excess dopamine is secreted by a group of dopaminesecreting neurons whose cell bodies lie in the ventral tegmentum of the mesencephalon, medial and superior to the substantia nigra. These neurons give rise to the so-called mesolimbic dopaminergic system that projects nerve fibers and dopamine secretion into the medial and anterior portions of the limbic system, especially into the hippocampus, amygdala, anterior caudate nucleus, and portions of the prefrontal lobes. All these areas are powerful behavioral control centers.

An even more compelling reason for believing that schizophrenia might be caused by excess production of dopamine is that many drugs that are effective in treating schizophrenia, such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and thiothixene, all either decrease secretion of dopamine at dopaminergic nerve endings or decrease the effect of dopamine on neurons.

Finally, possible involvement of the hippocampus in schizophrenia was discovered when it was learned that in persons with schizophrenia, the hippocampus is often reduced in size, especially in the dominant hemisphere.

## Alzheimer's Disease-Amyloid Plaques and Depressed Memory

Alzheimer's disease is defined as premature aging of the brain, usually beginning in mid adult life and progressing rapidly to extreme loss of mental powers-similar to that seen in very old age. The clinical features of Alzheimer's disease include (1) an amnesic type of memory impairment, (2) deterioration of language, and (3) visuospatial deficits. Motor and sensory abnormalities, gait disturbances, and seizures are uncommon until the late phases of the disease. One consistent finding in Alzheimer's disease is loss of neurons in the part of the limbic pathway that drives the memory process. Loss of this memory function is devastating.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that results in impairment of the person's ability to perform activities of daily living, as well as a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms and behavioral disturbances in the later stages of the disease. Patients with Alzheimer's disease usually require continuous care within a few years after the disease begins.

Alzheimer's disease is a common form of dementia in elderly persons; more than 5.5 million people in the United States are estimated to be afflicted by this disorder. About two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's disease are women. The percentage of persons with Alzheimer's
disease approximately doubles with every 5 years beyond age 65 , with about $30 \%$ of 85 -year-olds having the disease.

Alzheimer's Disease Is Associated With Accumulation of Brain Beta-Amyloid Peptide. Pathologically, one finds increased amounts of beta-amyloid peptide in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The peptide accumulates in amyloid plaques, which range in diameter from 10 micrometers to several hundred micrometers and are found in widespread areas of the brain, including in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, thalamus, and even the cerebellum. Thus, Alzheimer's disease appears to be a metabolic degenerative disease.

A key role for excess accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is suggested by the following observations: (1) all currently known mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease increase the production of beta-amyloid peptide; (2) patients with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) have three copies of the gene for amyloid precursor protein and develop neurological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease by midlife; (3) patients who have abnormality of a gene that controls apolipoprotein E, a blood protein that transports cholesterol to the tissues, have accelerated deposition of amyloid and greatly increased risk for Alzheimer's disease; (4) transgenic mice that overproduce the human amyloid precursor protein have learning and memory deficits in association with the accumulation of amyloid plaques; and (5) generation of anti-amyloid antibodies in humans with Alzheimer's disease appears to attenuate the disease process.

Vascular Disorders May Contribute to Progression of Alzheimer's Disease. There is also accumulating evidence that cerebrovascular disease caused by hypertension and atherosclerosis may play a key role in dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease. Cerebrovascular disease is the second most common cause of acquired cognitive impairment and dementia and likely contributes to cognitive decline in persons with Alzheimer's disease. In fact, many of the common risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, are also recognized to greatly increase the risk for developing dementia and progression of Alzheimer's disease. About $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of brains from individuals with dementia show evidence of vascular dementia alone. In older individuals with Alzheimer's disease, vascular disease is common with about $50 \%$ of patients having pathologic evidence of "silent strokes"-small brain infarcts that cause no readily apparent symptoms but could contribute to cognitive impairment.

# The Autonomic Nervous System and the Adrenal Medulla 

The autonomic nervous system is the portion of the nervous system that controls most visceral functions of the body. This system helps to control arterial pressure, gastrointestinal motility, gastrointestinal secretion, urinary bladder emptying, sweating, body temperature, and many other activities. Some of these activities are controlled almost entirely and some only partially by the autonomic nervous system.

One of the most striking characteristics of the autonomic nervous system is the rapidity and intensity with which it can change visceral functions. For example, within 3 to 5 seconds, it can increase the heart rate to twice normal, and within 10 to 15 seconds the arterial pressure can be doubled. At the other extreme, the arterial pressure can be decreased low enough within 10 to 15 seconds to cause fainting. Sweating can begin within seconds, and the urinary bladder may empty involuntarily, also within seconds.

## GENERAL ORGANIZATION OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

The autonomic nervous system is activated mainly by centers located in the spinal cord, brain stem, and hypothalamus. In addition, portions of the cerebral cortex, especially of the limbic cortex, can transmit signals to the lower centers and in this way can influence autonomic control.

The autonomic nervous system also often operates through visceral reflexes. That is, subconscious sensory signals from visceral organs can enter the autonomic ganglia, the brain stem, or the hypothalamus and then return subconscious reflex responses directly back to the visceral organs to control their activities.

The efferent autonomic signals are transmitted to the various organs of the body through two major subdivisions called the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system, the characteristics and functions of which are described in the following sections.

## Physiologic Anatomy of the Sympathetic Nervous System

Figure 61-1 shows the general organization of the peripheral portions of the sympathetic nervous system. Shown specifically in the figure are (1) one of the two paraverte-
bral sympathetic chains of ganglia that are interconnected with the spinal nerves on the side of the vertebral column, (2) prevertebral ganglia (the celiac, superior mesenteric, aorticorenal, inferior mesenteric, and hypogastric), and (3) nerves extending from the ganglia to the different internal organs.

The sympathetic nerve fibers originate in the spinal cord along with spinal nerves between cord segments T1 and L2 and pass first into the sympathetic chain and then to the tissues and organs that are stimulated by the sympathetic nerves.

## Preganglionic and Postganglionic Sympathetic Neurons

The sympathetic nerves are different from skeletal motor nerves in the following way. Each sympathetic pathway from the cord to the stimulated tissue is composed of two neurons, a preganglionic neuron and a postganglionic neuron, in contrast to only a single neuron in the skeletal motor pathway. The cell body of each preganglionic neuron lies in the intermediolateral horn of the spinal cord; its fiber passes through a ventral root of the cord into the corresponding spinal nerve, as shown in Figure 61-2.

Immediately after the spinal nerve leaves the spinal canal, the preganglionic sympathetic fibers leave the spinal nerve and pass through a white ramus into one of the ganglia of the sympathetic chain. The fibers then can take one of the following three courses: (1) they can synapse with postganglionic sympathetic neurons in the ganglion that they enter; (2) they can pass upward or downward in the chain and synapse in one of the other ganglia of the chain; or (3) they can pass for variable distances through the chain and then through one of the sympathetic nerves radiating outward from the chain, finally synapsing in a peripheral sympathetic ganglion.

The postganglionic sympathetic neuron thus originates either in one of the sympathetic chain ganglia or in one of the peripheral sympathetic ganglia. From either of these two sources, the postganglionic fibers then travel to their destinations in the various organs.

Sympathetic Nerve Fibers in the Skeletal Nerves. Some of the postganglionic fibers pass back from the sympathetic chain into the spinal nerves through gray rami at all levels of the cord, as shown in Figure 61-2. These sympathetic fibers are all very small type C fibers, and they extend to all parts of the body via the skeletal nerves. They control the blood vessels, sweat glands, and piloerector muscles of the hairs. About $8 \%$ of the fibers in the average skeletal nerve are sympathetic fibers, indicating their great importance.

![gu628617462c](gu628617462c.jpg)

Figure 61-1. Sympathetic nervous system. The black lines represent postganglionic fibers, and the red lines show preganglionic fibers.

## Segmental Distribution of the Sympathetic Nerve Fibers.

The sympathetic pathways that originate in the different segments of the spinal cord are not necessarily distributed to the same part of the body as the somatic spinal nerve fibers from the same segments. Instead, the sympathetic fibers from cord segment T1 generally pass as follows: (1) up the sympathetic chain to terminate in the head; (2) from T2 to terminate in the neck; (3) from T3, T4, T5, and T6 into the thorax; (4) from T7, T8, T9, T10, and T11 into the abdomen;
![gu638617462c](gu638617462c.jpg)

Figure 61-2. Nerve connections among the spinal cord, spinal nerves, sympathetic chain, and peripheral sympathetic nerves.
and (5) from T12, L1, and L2 into the legs. This distribution is only approximate and overlaps greatly.

The distribution of sympathetic nerves to each organ is determined partly by the locus in the embryo from which the organ originated. For example, the heart receives many sympathetic nerve fibers from the neck portion of the sympathetic chain because the heart originated in the neck of the embryo before translocating into the thorax. Likewise, the abdominal organs receive most of their sympathetic innervation from the lower thoracic spinal cord segments because most of the primitive gut originated in this area.

Special Sympathetic Nerve Endings in the Adrenal Medullae. Preganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers pass, without synapsing, all the way from the intermediolateral horn cells of the spinal cord, through the sympathetic chains, then through the splanchnic nerves, and finally into the two adrenal medullae. There they end directly on modified neuronal cells that secrete epinephrine and norepinephrine into the blood stream. These secretory cells embryologically are derived from nervous tissue and are actually postganglionic neurons; indeed, they even have rudimentary nerve fibers, and it is the endings of these fibers that secrete the adrenal hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine.

## Physiological Anatomy of the Parasympathetic Nervous System

The parasympathetic nervous system is shown in Figure 61-3, which demonstrates that parasympathetic fibers leave the central nervous system through cranial nerves III, VII, IX, and X; additional parasympathetic fibers leave the lowermost part of the spinal cord through the second and third sacral spinal nerves and occasionally the first and fourth sacral nerves. About $75 \%$ of all parasympathetic nerve fibers are in the vagus nerves (cranial nerve X), passing to the

![gu648617462c](gu648617462c.jpg)

Figure 61-3. The parasympathetic nervous system. The blue lines represent preganglionic fibers and the black lines show postganglionic fibers.
entire thoracic and abdominal regions of the body. The vagus nerves supply parasympathetic nerves to the heart, lungs, esophagus, stomach, entire small intestine, proximal half of the colon, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, and upper portions of the ureters.

Parasympathetic fibers in the third cranial nerve go to the pupillary sphincter and ciliary muscle of the eye. Fibers from the seventh cranial nerve pass to the lacrimal, nasal, and submandibular glands, and fibers from the ninth cranial nerve go to the parotid gland.

The sacral parasympathetic fibers are in the pelvic nerves, which pass through the spinal nerve sacral plexus on each side of the cord at the S2 and S3 levels. These fibers then distribute to the descending colon, rectum, urinary
bladder, and lower portions of the ureters. Also, this sacral group of parasympathetics supplies nerve signals to the external genitalia to cause erection.

Preganglionic and Postganglionic Parasympathetic Neurons. The parasympathetic system, like the sympathetic system, has both preganglionic and postganglionic neurons. However, except in the case of a few cranial parasympathetic nerves, the preganglionic fibers pass uninterrupted all the way to the organ that is to be controlled. The postganglionic neurons are located in the wall of the organ. The preganglionic fibers synapse with these neurons, and extremely short postganglionic fibers, a fraction of a millimeter to several centimeters in length, leave the neurons to innervate the tissues of the organ. This location of the parasympathetic postganglionic neurons in the visceral organ is quite different from the arrangement of the sympathetic ganglia because the cell bodies of the sympathetic postganglionic neurons are almost always located in the ganglia of the sympathetic chain or in various other discrete ganglia in the abdomen, rather than in the excited organ.

## BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF SYMPATHETIC AND PARASYMPATHETIC FUNCTION

## CHOLINERGIC AND ADRENERGIC FIBERSSECRETION OF ACETYLCHOLINE OR NOREPINEPHRINE

The sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers secrete mainly one or the other of two synaptic transmitter substances, acetylcholine or norepinephrine. The fibers that secrete acetylcholine are said to be cholinergic. Those that secrete norepinephrine are said to be adrenergic, a term derived from adrenalin, which is an alternate name for epinephrine.

All preganglionic neurons are cholinergic in both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems (Figure 61-4). Acetylcholine or acetylcholinelike substances, when applied to the ganglia, will excite both sympathetic and parasympathetic postganglionic neurons. Either all or almost all of the postganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic system are also cholinergic. In contrast, most of the postganglionic sympathetic neurons are adrenergic. However, the postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers to the sweat glands and perhaps to a very few blood vessels are cholinergic.

Thus, the terminal nerve endings of the parasympathetic system all or virtually all secrete acetylcholine. Almost all of the sympathetic nerve endings secrete norepinephrine, but a few secrete acetylcholine. These neurotransmitters in turn act on the different organs to cause respective parasympathetic or sympathetic effects. Therefore, acetylcholine is called a parasympathetic transmitter and norepinephrine is called a sympathetic transmitter.

![gu658617462c](gu658617462c.jpg)

Figure 61-4. Preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic axons are both lightly myelinated, and both use acetylcholine (Ach) as the neurotransmitter. Postganglionic axons are unmyelinated. Most sympathetic postganglionic axons store norepinephrine (NE) in their varicosities and release this neurotransmitter over the surface of the target tissue. Postganglionic parasympathetic axons store Ach in varicosities and release Ach onto the target tissue surface.

The molecular structures of acetylcholine and norepinephrine are as follows:
![gu668617462c](gu668617462c.jpg)

## Mechanisms of Transmitter Secretion and Removal at Postganglionic Endings

Secretion of Acetylcholine and Norepinephrine by Postganglionic Nerve Endings. A few of the postganglionic autonomic nerve endings, especially those of the parasympathetic nerves, are similar to but much smaller than those of the skeletal neuromuscular junction. However, many of the parasympathetic nerve fibers and almost all the sympathetic fibers merely touch the effector cells of the organs that they innervate as they pass by, or in some cases, they terminate in connective tissue located adjacent to the cells that are to be stimulated. Where these filaments touch or pass over or near the cells to be stimulated, they usually have bulbous enlargements called varicosities (see Figure 61-4). It is in these varicosities that the transmitter vesicles of acetylcholine or norepinephrine are synthesized and stored. Also in the varicosities are large numbers of mitochondria that supply adenosine triphosphate, which is required to energize acetylcholine or norepinephrine synthesis.

When an action potential spreads over the terminal fibers, the depolarization process increases the permeability of the fiber membrane to calcium ions, allowing these ions to diffuse into the nerve terminals or nerve varicosities. The calcium ions in turn cause the terminals or varicosities to empty their contents to the exterior. Thus, the transmitter substance is secreted.

Synthesis of Acetylcholine, Its Destruction After Secretion, and Its Duration of Action. Acetylcholine is synthesized in the terminal endings and varicosities of the cholinergic nerve fibers, where it is stored in vesicles in highly concentrated form until it is released. The basic chemical reaction of this synthesis is the following $(\mathrm{CoA}=$ coenzyme A$)$ :

Acetyl-CoA + Choline $\xrightarrow[\text { acetyltransferase }]{\text { Choline }}$ Acetylcholine
Once acetylcholine is secreted into a tissue by a cholinergic nerve ending, it persists in the tissue for a few seconds while it performs its nerve signal transmitter function. Then it is split into an acetate ion and choline, catalyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is bound with collagen and glycosaminoglycans in the local connective tissue. This mechanism is the same as that for acetylcholine signal transmission and subsequent acetylcholine destruction that occurs at the neuromuscular junctions of skeletal nerve fibers. The choline that is formed is then transported back into the terminal nerve ending, where it is used again and again for synthesis of new acetylcholine.

Synthesis of Norepinephrine, Its Removal, and Its Duration of Action. Synthesis of norepinephrine begins in the axoplasm of the terminal nerve endings of adrenergic nerve fibers but is completed inside the secretory vesicles. The basic steps are the following:

1. Tyrosine $\xrightarrow{\text { Hydroxylation }}$ Dopa
2. Dopa $\xrightarrow{\text { Decarboxylation }}$ Dopamine
3. Transport of dopamine into the vesicles

4. Dopamine $\xrightarrow{\text { Hydroxylation }}$ Norepinephrine

In the adrenal mtexedulla, this reaction goes still one step further to transform about $80 \%$ of the norepinephrine into epinephrine, as follows:

## 5. Norapinephrine $\xrightarrow{\text { Methylation }}$ Epinephrine

After secretion of norepinephrine by the terminal nerve endings, it is removed from the secretory site in three ways: (1) reuptake into the adrenergic nerve endings by an active transport process, accounting for removal of $50 \%$ to $80 \%$ of the secreted norepinephrine; (2) diffusion away from the nerve endings into the surrounding body fluids and then into the blood, accounting for removal of most of the remaining norepinephrine; and (3) destruction of small amounts by tissue enzymes. One of these enzymes is monoamine oxidase, which is found in the nerve endings, and another is catechol-O-methyl transferase, which is present diffusely in the tissues.

Ordinarily, the norepinephrine secreted directly into a tissue remains active for only a few seconds, demonstrating that its reuptake and diffusion away from the tissue are rapid. However, the norepinephrine and epinephrine secreted into the blood by the adrenal medullae remain active until they diffuse into some tissue, where they can be destroyed by catechol-O-methyl transferase; this action occurs mainly in the liver. Therefore, when secreted into the blood, both norepinephrine and epinephrine remain active for 10 to 30 seconds, but their activity declines to extinction over 1 minute to several minutes.

## RECEPTORS ON THE EFFECTOR ORGANS

Before acetylcholine, norepinephrine, or epinephrine secreted at an autonomic nerve ending can stimulate an effector organ, it must first bind with specific receptors on the effector cells. The receptor is on the outside of the cell membrane, bound as a prosthetic group to a protein molecule that penetrates all the way through the cell membrane. Binding of the transmitter substance with the receptor causes a conformational change in the structure of the protein molecule. In turn, the altered protein molecule excites or inhibits the cell, most often by (1) causing a change in cell membrane permeability to one or more ions or (2) activating or inactivating an enzyme attached to the other end of the receptor protein, where it protrudes into the interior of the cell.

## Excitation or Inhibition of the Effector Cell by Changing Its Membrane Permeability. Because the receptor

protein is an integral part of the cell membrane, a conformational change in structure of the receptor protein often opens or closes an ion channel through the interstices of the protein molecule, thus altering the permeability of the cell membrane to various ions. For example, sodium and/ or calcium ion channels frequently become opened and allow rapid influx of the respective ions into the cell, usually depolarizing the cell membrane and exciting the cell. At other times, potassium channels are opened, allowing potassium ions to diffuse out of the cell, which usually in-
hibits the cell because loss of electropositive potassium ions creates hypernegativity inside the cell. In some cells, the changed intracellular ion environment will cause an internal cell action, such as a direct effect of calcium ions to promote smooth muscle contraction.

Receptor Action by Altering Intracellular "Second Messenger" Enzymes. Another way a receptor often functions is to activate or inactivate an enzyme (or other intracellular chemical) inside the cell. The enzyme often is attached to the receptor protein where the receptor protrudes into the interior of the cell. For example, binding of norepinephrine with its receptor on the outside of many cells increases the activity of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase on the inside of the cell, which causes formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The cAMP in turn can initiate any one of many different intracellular actions, with the exact effect depending on the specific effector cell and its chemical machinery.

It is easy to understand how an autonomic transmitter substance can cause inhibition in some organs or excitation in others. This is usually determined by the nature of the receptor protein in the cell membrane and the effect of receptor binding on its conformational state. In each organ, the resulting effects are likely to be different from those in other organs.

## Two Principal Types of Acetylcholine Receptors—Muscarinic and Nicotinic Receptors

Acetylcholine activates mainly two types of receptors, which are called muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. The reason for these names is that muscarine, a poison from toadstools, activates only muscarinic receptors and will not activate nicotinic receptors, whereas nicotine activates only nicotinic receptors. Acetylcholine activates both of them.

Muscarinic receptors, which use G proteins as their signaling mechanism, are found on all effector cells that are stimulated by the postganglionic cholinergic neurons of either the parasympathetic nervous system or the sympathetic system.

Nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels found in autonomic ganglia at the synapses between the preganglionic and postganglionic neurons of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. (Nicotinic receptors are also present at many nonautonomic nerve endings-for example, at the neuromuscular junctions in skeletal muscle, discussed in Chapter 7.)

An understanding of the two types of receptors is especially important because specific drugs are frequently used as medicine to stimulate or block one or the other of the two types of receptors.

## Alpha and Beta Adrenergic Receptors

Two major classes of adrenergic receptors also exist; they are called alpha receptors and beta receptors. There are two major types of alpha receptors, alpha ${ }_{1}$ and alpha ${ }_{2}$,

Table 61-1 Adrenergic Receptors and Function

| Alpha Receptor | Beta Receptor |
| :-- | :-- |
| Vasoconstriction | Vasodilation $\left(\beta_{2}\right)$ |
| Iris dilation | Cardioacceleration $\left(\beta_{1}\right)$ |
| Intestinal relaxation | Increased myocardial strength $\left(\beta_{1}\right)$ |
| Intestinal sphincter <br> contraction | Intestinal relaxation $\left(\beta_{2}\right)$ <br> Uterus relaxation $\left(\beta_{2}\right)$ |
| Pilomotor contraction | Bronchodilation $\left(\beta_{2}\right)$ |
| Bladder sphincter <br> contraction | Calorigenesis $\left(\beta_{2}\right)$ |
| Inhibits neurotransmitter <br> release $\left(\alpha_{2}\right)$ | Glycogenolysis $\left(\beta_{3}\right)$ <br> Lipolysis $\left(\beta_{1}\right)$ <br> Bladder wall relaxation $\left(\beta_{2}\right)$ <br> Thermogenesis $\left(\beta_{3}\right)$ |

which are linked to different G proteins. The beta receptors are divided into beta $_{1}$, beta $_{2}$, and beta $_{3}$ receptors because certain chemicals affect only certain beta receptors. The beta receptors also use G proteins for signaling.

Norepinephrine and epinephrine, both of which are secreted into the blood by the adrenal medulla, have slightly different effects in exciting the alpha and beta receptors. Norepinephrine excites mainly alpha receptors but excites the beta receptors to a lesser extent as well. Epinephrine excites both types of receptors approximately equally. Therefore, the relative effects of norepinephrine and epinephrine on different effector organs are determined by the types of receptors in the organs. If they are all beta receptors, epinephrine will be the more effective excitant.

Table 61-1 lists the distribution of alpha and beta receptors in some of the organs and systems controlled by the sympathetic nerves. Note that certain alpha functions are excitatory, whereas others are inhibitory. Likewise, certain beta functions are excitatory and others are inhibitory. Therefore, alpha and beta receptors are not necessarily associated with excitation or inhibition but simply with the affinity of the hormone for the receptors in the given effector organ.

As discussed later in the chapter, several sympathomimetic drugs have been developed that mimic the actions of the endogenous catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine. Some of these compounds selectively activate alpha or beta adrenergic receptors. For example, a synthetic drug chemically similar to epinephrine and norepinephrine, isoprenaline (isoproterenol), has an extremely strong action on beta receptors but essentially no action on alpha receptors.

## EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY ACTIONS OF SYMPATHETIC AND PARASYMPATHETIC STIMULATION

Table 61-2 lists the effects on different visceral functions of the body caused by stimulating either the parasympathetic nerves or the sympathetic nerves. Note again that sympathetic stimulation causes excitatory effects in some organs but inhibitory effects in others. Likewise, parasympathetic stimulation causes excitation in some organs but inhibition in others. Also, when sympathetic stimulation excites a particular
organ, parasympathetic stimulation sometimes inhibits it, demonstrating that the two systems occasionally act reciprocally to each other. However, most organs are dominantly controlled by one or the other of the two systems.

There is no generalization one can use to explain whether sympathetic or parasympathetic stimulation will cause excitation or inhibition of a particular organ. Therefore, to understand sympathetic and parasympathetic function, one must learn all the separate functions of these two nervous systems on each organ, as listed in Table 61-2. Some of these functions need to be clarified in still greater detail, as follows.

## Effects of Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Stimulation on Specific Organs

Eyes. Two functions of the eyes are controlled by the autonomic nervous system: (1) the pupillary opening and (2) the focus of the lens.

Sympathetic stimulation contracts the meridional fibers of the iris that dilate the pupil, whereas parasympathetic stimulation contracts the circular muscle of the iris to constrict the pupil.

The parasympathetics that control the pupil are reflexly stimulated when excess light enters the eyes, which is explained in Chapter 52; this reflex reduces the pupillary opening and decreases the amount of light that strikes the retina. Conversely, the sympathetics become stimulated during periods of excitement and increase pupillary opening at these times.

Focusing of the lens is controlled almost entirely by the parasympathetic nervous system. The lens is normally held in a flattened state by intrinsic elastic tension of its radial ligaments. Parasympathetic excitation contracts the ciliary muscle, which is a ringlike body of smooth muscle fibers that encircles the outside ends of the lens radial ligaments. This contraction releases the tension on the ligaments and allows the lens to become more convex, causing the eye to focus on objects near at hand. The detailed focusing mechanism is discussed in Chapters 50 and 52 in relation to function of the eyes.

Glands of the Body. The nasal, lacrimal, salivary, and many gastrointestinal glands are strongly stimulated by the parasympathetic nervous system, usually resulting in copious quantities of watery secretion. The glands of the alimentary tract most strongly stimulated by the parasympathetics are those of the upper tract, especially those of the mouth and stomach. On the other hand, the glands of the small and large intestines are controlled principally by local factors in the intestinal tract and by the intestinal enteric nervous system; they are controlled much less by the autonomic nerves.

Sympathetic stimulation has a direct effect on most alimentary gland cells to cause formation of a concentrated secretion that contains high percentages of enzymes and mucus. However, it also causes vasoconstriction of the blood vessels that supply the glands and in this way sometimes reduces their rates of secretion.

The sweat glands secrete large quantities of sweat when the sympathetic nerves are stimulated, but no effect is caused by stimulating the parasympathetic nerves. However, the sympathetic fibers to most sweat glands are cholinergic (except for a few adrenergic fibers to the palms and soles), in contrast to almost all other sympathetic fibers, which are adrenergic. Furthermore, the sweat glands are stimulated primarily by centers in the hypothalamus that

are usually considered to be parasympathetic centers. Therefore, sweating could be called a parasympathetic function, even though it is controlled by nerve fibers that anatomically are distributed through the sympathetic nervous system.

The apocrine glands in the axillae secrete a thick, odoriferous secretion as a result of sympathetic stimulation, but they do not respond to parasympathetic stimulation. This secretion actually functions as a lubricant to allow easy sliding motion of the inside surfaces under the shoulder joint. The apocrine glands, despite their close embryological relation to sweat glands, are activated by adrenergic fibers rather than by cholinergic fibers and are also controlled by the sympathetic centers of the central nervous system rather than by the parasympathetic centers.

## Intramural Nerve Plexus of the Gastrointestinal System.

The gastrointestinal system has its own intrinsic set of nerves known as the intramural plexus or the intestinal enteric nervous system, located in the walls of the gut. Also, both parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation originating in the brain can affect gastrointestinal activity mainly by increasing or decreasing specific actions in the gastrointestinal intramural plexus. Parasympathetic stimulation, in general, increases the overall activity of the gastrointestinal tract by promoting peristalsis and relaxing the sphincters, thus allowing rapid propulsion of contents along the tract. This propulsive effect is associated with simultaneous increases in rates of secretion by many of the gastrointestinal glands, described earlier.

Normal motility functions of the gastrointestinal tract are not very dependent on sympathetic stimulation. However, strong sympathetic stimulation inhibits peristalsis and increases the tone of the sphincters. The net result is greatly slowed propulsion of food through the tract and sometimes decreased secretion as well-even to the extent of sometimes causing constipation.

Heart. In general, sympathetic stimulation increases the overall activity of the heart. This effect is accomplished by increasing both the rate and force of heart contraction.

Parasympathetic stimulation causes mainly opposite ef-fects-decreased heart rate and strength of contraction. To express these effects in another way, sympathetic stimulation increases the effectiveness of the heart as a pump, as required during heavy exercise, whereas parasympathetic stimulation decreases heart pumping, allowing the heart to rest between bouts of strenuous activity.

Systemic Blood Vessels. Most systemic blood vessels, especially those of the abdominal viscera and skin of the limbs, are constricted by sympathetic stimulation. Parasympathetic stimulation has almost no effects on most blood vessels. Under some conditions, the beta adrenergic function of the sympathetics causes vascular dilation instead of the usual vascular constriction; however, this dilation occurs rarely except after drugs have paralyzed the sympathetic alpha vasoconstrictor effects which, in most blood vessels, are usually far dominant over the beta effects.

Effect of Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Stimulation on Arterial Pressure. The arterial pressure is determined by two factors, propulsion of blood by the heart and resistance to flow of blood through the peripheral blood vessels. Sympathetic stimulation increases both propulsion by the heart and resistance to flow, which usually causes a marked acute increase in arterial pressure but often very little
change in long-term pressure unless the sympathetics also stimulate the kidneys to retain salt and water at the same time.

Conversely, moderate parasympathetic stimulation via the vagal nerves decreases pumping by the heart but has virtually no effect on vascular peripheral resistance. Therefore, the usual effect is a slight decrease in arterial pressure. However, very strong vagal parasympathetic stimulation can almost stop or occasionally stop the heart entirely for a few seconds and cause temporary loss of all or most arterial pressure.

Effects of Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Stimulation on Other Functions of the Body. Because of the great importance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic control systems, they are discussed many times in this text in relation to multiple body functions. In general, most of the entodermal structures, such as the ducts of the liver, gallbladder, ureter, urinary bladder, and bronchi, are inhibited by sympathetic stimulation but excited by parasympathetic stimulation. Sympathetic stimulation also has multiple metabolic effects such as release of glucose from the liver and an increase in blood glucose concentration, glycogenolysis in liver and muscle, skeletal muscle strength, basal metabolic rate, and mental activity. Finally, the sympathetics and parasympathetics are involved in execution of the male and female sexual acts, as explained in Chapters 81 and 82 .

## FUNCTION OF THE ADRENAL MEDULLAE

Stimulation of the sympathetic nerves to the adrenal medullae causes large quantities of epinephrine and norepinephrine to be released into the circulating blood, and these two hormones in turn are carried in the blood to all tissues of the body. On average, about $80 \%$ of the secretion is epinephrine and $20 \%$ is norepinephrine, although the relative proportions can change considerably under different physiological conditions.

The circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine have almost the same effects on the different organs as the effects caused by direct sympathetic stimulation, except that the effects last 5 to 10 times as long because both of these hormones are removed from the blood slowly over a period of 2 to 4 minutes.

The circulating norepinephrine causes constriction of most of the blood vessels of the body; it also increases activity of the heart, inhibits the gastrointestinal tract, dilates the pupils of the eyes, and so forth.

Epinephrine causes almost the same effects as those caused by norepinephrine, but the effects differ in the following respects. First, epinephrine, because of its greater effect in stimulating the beta receptors, has a greater effect on cardiac stimulation than does norepinephrine. Second, epinephrine causes only weak constriction of the blood vessels in the muscles, in comparison with much stronger constriction caused by norepinephrine. Because the muscle vessels represent a major segment of the vessels of the body, this difference is of special importance because norepinephrine greatly increases the total peripheral

resistance and elevates arterial pressure, whereas epinephrine raises the arterial pressure to a lesser extent but increases the cardiac output more.

A third difference between the actions of epinephrine and norepinephrine relates to their effects on tissue metabolism. Epinephrine has 5 to 10 times greater metabolic effect as does norepinephrine. Indeed, the epinephrine secreted by the adrenal medullae can increase the metabolic rate of the whole body as much as $100 \%$ above normal, in this way increasing the activity and excitability of the body. It also increases the rates of other metabolic activities, such as glycogenolysis in the liver and muscle and glucose release into the blood.

In summary, stimulation of the adrenal medullae causes release of the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine, which together have almost the same effects throughout the body as direct sympathetic stimulation, except that the effects are more prolonged, lasting 2 to 4 minutes after the stimulation is over.

The Adrenal Medullae Support Sympathetic Nervous System Functions. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are almost always released by the adrenal medullae at the same time that the different organs are stimulated directly by generalized sympathetic activation. Therefore, the organs are actually stimulated in two ways-directly by the sympathetic nerves and indirectly by the adrenal medullary hormones. The two means of stimulation support each other and either can, in most cases, substitute for the other. For example, destruction of the direct sympathetic pathways to the different body organs does not abrogate sympathetic excitation of the organs because norepinephrine and epinephrine are still released into the circulating blood and indirectly cause stimulation. Likewise, loss of the two adrenal medullae usually has little effect on the operation of the sympathetic nervous system because the direct pathways can still perform almost all the necessary duties. Thus, the dual mechanism of sympathetic stimulation provides a safety factor, with one mechanism substituting for the other if it is missing.

Another important value of the adrenal medullae is the capability of epinephrine and norepinephrine to stimulate structures of the body that are not innervated by direct sympathetic fibers. For example, the metabolic rate of almost every cell of the body is increased by these hormones, especially by epinephrine, even though only a small proportion of all the cells in the body are innervated directly by sympathetic fibers.

## RELATION OF STIMULUS RATE TO SYMPATHETIC AND PARASYMPATHETIC EFFECTS

A special difference between the autonomic nervous system and the skeletal nervous system is that only a low frequency of stimulation is required for full activation of autonomic effectors. In general, only one nerve impulse
every few seconds suffices to maintain normal sympathetic or parasympathetic effect, and full activation occurs when the nerve fibers discharge 10 to 20 times $/ \mathrm{sec}$. This rate compares with full activation in the skeletal nervous system at 50 to 500 or more impulses/sec.

## SYMPATHETIC AND PARASYMPATHETIC "TONE"

Normally, the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are continually active, and the basal rates of activity are known, respectively, as sympathetic tone and parasympathetic tone. The value of tone is that it allows a single nervous system to both increase and decrease the activity of a stimulated organ. For example, sympathetic tone normally keeps almost all the systemic arterioles constricted to about one-half their maximum diameter. By increasing the degree of sympathetic stimulation above normal, these vessels can be constricted even more; conversely, by decreasing the stimulation below normal, the arterioles can be dilated. Thus, the sympathetic system can cause vasoconstriction or vasodilation by increasing or decreasing its activity, respectively.

Another interesting example of tone is the background "tone" of the parasympathetics in the gastrointestinal tract. Surgical removal of the parasympathetic supply to most of the gut by cutting the vagus nerves can cause serious and prolonged gastric and intestinal "atony" with resulting blockage of much of the normal gastrointestinal propulsion and consequent serious constipation, thus demonstrating that parasympathetic tone to the gut is normally very much required. This tone can be decreased by the brain, thereby inhibiting gastrointestinal motility, or it can be increased, thereby promoting increased gastrointestinal activity.

Tone Caused by Basal Secretion of Epinephrine and Norepinephrine by the Adrenal Medullae. The normal resting rate of secretion by the adrenal medullae is about $0.2 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ of epinephrine and about $0.05 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ of norepinephrine. These quantities are enough to maintain the blood pressure almost normal even if all direct sympathetic pathways to the cardiovascular system are removed. Therefore, it is obvious that much of the overall tone of the sympathetic nervous system results from basal secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine in addition to the tone resulting from direct sympathetic stimulation.

Effect of Loss of Sympathetic or Parasympathetic Tone After Denervation. Immediately after a sympathetic or parasympathetic nerve is cut, the innervated organ loses its sympathetic or parasympathetic tone. In many blood vessels, for example, cutting the sympathetic nerves results in substantial vasodilation within 5 to 30 seconds. However, over minutes, hours, days, or weeks, intrinsic tone in the smooth muscle of the vessels increases-that is, increased tone caused by increased

![gu678617462c](gu678617462c.jpg)

smooth muscle contractile force that is not the result of sympathetic stimulation but of chemical adaptations in the smooth muscle fibers, including increased sensitivity to the effects of circulating catecholamines secreted by the adrenal medullae. This intrinsic tone and increased sensitivity to circulating catecholamines eventually restore almost normal vasoconstriction.

Essentially the same effects occur in most other effector organs whenever sympathetic or parasympathetic tone is lost. That is, intrinsic compensation soon develops to return the function of the organ almost to its normal basal level. However, in the parasympathetic system, the compensation sometimes requires many months. For example, loss of parasympathetic tone to the heart after cardiac vagotomy increases the heart rate to 160 beats/ min in a dog, and this rate will still be partially elevated 6 months later. Likewise, loss of parasympathetic tone to the gastrointestinal system has long lasting effects on the gut.

## "Supersensitivity" to Norepinephrine and Acetylcholine After Denervation

During the first week or so after a sympathetic or parasympathetic nerve is destroyed, the innervated organ becomes more sensitive to injected norepinephrine or acetylcholine, respectively. This effect is demonstrated in Figure 61-5, which shows that blood flow in the forearm before removal of the sympathetics is about $200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$; a test dose of norepinephrine causes only a slight depression in flow lasting a minute or so. Then the stellate ganglion is removed, and normal sympathetic tone is lost. At first, the blood flow rises markedly because of the lost vascular tone, but over a period of days to weeks the blood flow returns much of the way back toward normal because of a progressive increase in the intrinsic tone of the vascular musculature itself, thus partially compensating for the loss of sympathetic tone. Then, another test dose of norepinephrine is administered, and the blood flow decreases much more than before, demonstrating that the blood vessels have become about two to four times as responsive to norepinephrine as previously. This phenomenon is called denervation supersensitivity. It occurs in both sympathetic and parasympathetic organs but to a far greater extent in some organs than in others, occasionally increasing the response more than 10 -fold.

Mechanism of Denervation Supersensitivity. The cause of denervation supersensitivity is only partially known. Part of the answer is that the number of receptors in the postsynaptic membranes of the effector cells increases-sometimes many times-when norepinephrine or acetylcholine is no longer released at the synapses, a process called "upregulation" of the receptors. Therefore, when a dose of the hormone is now injected into the circulating blood, the effector reaction is vastly enhanced.

## Autonomic Reflexes

Many visceral functions of the body are regulated by $a u$ tonomic reflexes. Throughout this text, the functions of these reflexes are discussed in relation to individual organ systems; to illustrate their importance, a few are presented here briefly.

Cardiovascular Autonomic Reflexes. Several reflexes in the cardiovascular system help control the arterial blood pressure and heart rate. One of these reflexes is the baroreceptor reflex, which is described in Chapter 18 along with other cardiovascular reflexes. Briefly, stretch receptors called baroreceptors are located in the walls of several major arteries, including especially the internal carotid arteries and the arch of the aorta. When these become stretched by high pressure, signals are transmitted to the brain stem, where they inhibit the sympathetic impulses to the heart and blood vessels and excite the parasympathetics; this allows the arterial pressure to fall back toward normal.

Gastrointestinal Autonomic Reflexes. The uppermost part of the gastrointestinal tract and the rectum are controlled principally by autonomic reflexes. For example, the smell of appetizing food or the presence of food in the mouth initiates signals from the nose and mouth to the vagal, glossopharyngeal, and salivatory nuclei of the brain stem. These nuclei in turn transmit signals through the parasympathetic nerves to the secretory glands of the mouth and stomach, causing secretion of digestive juices sometimes even before food enters the mouth.

When fecal matter fills the rectum at the other end of the alimentary canal, sensory impulses initiated by stretching the rectum are sent to the sacral portion of the spinal cord, and a reflex signal is transmitted back through the sacral parasympathetics to the distal parts of the colon; these signals result in strong peristaltic contractions that cause defecation.

Other Autonomic Reflexes. Emptying of the urinary bladder is controlled in the same way as emptying of the rectum; stretching of the bladder sends impulses to the sacral cord, which in turn causes reflex contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the urinary sphincters, thereby promoting micturition.

Also important are the sexual reflexes, which are initiated both by psychic stimuli from the brain and by stimuli from the sexual organs. Impulses from these sources converge on the sacral cord and, in the male, result first in erection, mainly a parasympathetic function, and then ejaculation, partially a sympathetic function.

Other autonomic control functions include reflex contributions to the regulation of pancreatic secretion, gallbladder emptying, kidney excretion of urine, sweating, blood glucose concentration, and many other visceral functions, all of which are discussed in detail at other points in this text.

## SELECTIVE STIMULATION OF TARGET ORGANS BY SYMPATHETIC AND PARASYMPATHETIC SYSTEMS OR "MASS DISCHARGE"

The Sympathetic System Sometimes Responds by Mass Discharge. In some cases, almost all portions of the sympathetic nervous system discharge simultaneously as a complete unit, a phenomenon called mass discharge. This frequently occurs when the hypothalamus is activated by fright or severe pain. The result is a widespread reaction throughout the body called the alarm or stress response, which is discussed shortly.

At other times, activation occurs in isolated portions of the sympathetic nervous system. Important examples are the following:

1. During the process of heat regulation, the sympathetics control sweating and blood flow in the skin without affecting other organs innervated by the sympathetics.
2. Many "local reflexes" involving sensory afferent fibers travel centrally in the peripheral nerves to the sympathetic ganglia and spinal cord and cause highly localized reflex responses. For example, heating a skin area causes local vasodilation and enhanced local sweating, whereas cooling causes opposite effects.
3. Many of the sympathetic reflexes that control gastrointestinal functions operate by way of nerve pathways that do not even enter the spinal cord, merely passing from the gut mainly to the paravertebral ganglia, and then back to the gut through sympathetic nerves to control motor or secretory activity.

The Parasympathetic System Usually Causes Specific Localized Responses. Control functions by the parasympathetic system are often highly specific. For example, parasympathetic cardiovascular reflexes usually act on the heart only to increase or decrease its rate of beating with little direct effect on its force of contraction. Likewise, other parasympathetic reflexes cause secretion mainly by the mouth glands, and in other cases, secretion is mainly by the stomach glands. Finally, the rectal emptying reflex does not affect other parts of the bowel to a major extent.

Yet there is often association between closely allied parasympathetic functions. For example, although salivary secretion can occur independently of gastric secretion, these two often occur together, and pancreatic secretion frequently occurs at the same time. Also, the rectal emptying reflex often initiates a urinary bladder emptying reflex, resulting in simultaneous emptying of both the bladder and the rectum. Conversely, the bladder emptying reflex can help initiate rectal emptying.

## "ALARM" OR "STRESS" RESPONSE OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

When large portions of the sympathetic nervous system discharge at the same time-that is, a mass dischargethis action increases the ability of the body to perform vigorous muscle activity in many ways, as summarized in the following list:

1. Increased arterial pressure
2. Increased blood flow to active muscles concurrent with decreased blood flow to organs such as the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys that are not needed for rapid motor activity
3. Increased rates of cellular metabolism throughout the body
4. Increased blood glucose concentration
5. Increased glycolysis in the liver and in muscle
6. Increased muscle strength
7. Increased mental activity
8. Increased rate of blood coagulation

The sum of these effects permits a person to perform far more strenuous physical activity than would otherwise be possible. Because either mental or physical stress can excite the sympathetic system, it is frequently said that the purpose of the sympathetic system is to provide extra activation of the body in states of stress, which is called the sympathetic stress response.

The sympathetic system is especially strongly activated in many emotional states. For example, in the state of rage, which is elicited to a great extent by stimulating the hypothalamus, signals are transmitted downward through the reticular formation of the brain stem and into the spinal cord to cause massive sympathetic discharge; most aforementioned sympathetic events ensue immediately. This is called the sympathetic alarm reaction. It is also called the fight-or-flight reaction because an animal in this state decides almost instantly whether to stand and fight or to run. In either event, the sympathetic alarm reaction makes the animal's subsequent activities vigorous.

## MEDULLARY, PONTINE, AND MESENCEPHALIC CONTROL OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

Many neuronal areas in the brain stem reticular substance and along the course of the tractus solitarius of the medulla, pons, and mesencephalon, as well as in many special nuclei (Figure 61-6), control different autonomic functions, such as arterial pressure, heart rate, glandular secretion in the gastrointestinal tract, gastrointestinal peristalsis, and degree of contraction of the urinary bladder. Control of each of these is discussed at appropriate points in this text. Some of the most important factors controlled in the brain stem are arterial pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Indeed, transection of the brain stem above the midpontine level allows basal control of arterial pressure to continue as before but prevents its

![gu688617462c](gu688617462c.jpg)

Figure 61-6. Autonomic control areas in the brain stem and hypothalamus.
modulation by higher nervous centers such as the hypothalamus. Conversely, transection immediately below the medulla causes the arterial pressure to fall to less than one-half normal.

Closely associated with the cardiovascular regulatory centers in the brain stem are the medullary and pontine centers for regulation of respiration, which are discussed in Chapter 42. Although regulation of respiration is not considered to be an autonomic function, it is one of the involuntary functions of the body.

## Control of Brain Stem Autonomic Centers by Higher Areas. Signals from the hypothalamus and even

from the cerebrum can affect activities of almost all the brain stem autonomic control centers. For example, stimulation in appropriate areas-mainly of the posterior hypothalamus-can activate the medullary cardiovascular control centers strongly enough to increase arterial pressure to more than twice normal. Likewise, other hypothalamic centers control body temperature, increase or decrease salivation and gastrointestinal activity, and cause bladder emptying. To some extent, the autonomic centers in the brain stem act as relay stations for control activities initiated at higher levels of the brain, especially in the hypothalamus.

In Chapters 59 and 60, we pointed out also that many of our behavioral responses are mediated through the following: (1) the hypothalamus, (2) the reticular areas of the brain stem, and (3) the autonomic nervous system. Indeed, some higher areas of the brain can alter function of the whole autonomic nervous system or of portions of it strongly enough to cause severe autonomic-induced disease such as peptic ulcer of the stomach or duodenum, constipation, heart palpitation, or even heart attack.

## Pharmacology of the Autonomic Nervous System

## Drugs That Act on Adrenergic Effector OrgansSympathomimetic Drugs

From the foregoing discussion, it is obvious that intravenous injection of norepinephrine causes essentially the same effects throughout the body as sympathetic stimulation. Therefore, norepinephrine is called a sympathomimetic or adrenergic drug. Epinephrine and methoxamine are also sympathomimetic drugs, and there are many others. They differ from one another in the degree to which they stimulate different receptors in sympathetic effector organs and in their duration of action. Norepinephrine and epinephrine have actions as short as 1 to 2 minutes, whereas the actions of some other commonly used sympathomimetic drugs last for 30 minutes to 2 hours.

Important drugs that stimulate specific adrenergic receptors are phenylephrine (alpha receptors), isoproterenol (beta receptors), and albuterol (only beta ${ }_{2}$ receptors).

Drugs That Cause Release of Norepinephrine From Nerve Endings. Certain drugs have an indirect sympathomimetic action instead of directly exciting adrenergic effector organs. These drugs include ephedrine, tyramine, and amphetamine. Their effect is to cause release of norepinephrine from its storage vesicles in the sympathetic nerve endings. The released norepinephrine in turn causes the sympathetic effects.

Drugs That Block Adrenergic Activity. Adrenergic activity can be blocked at several points in the stimulatory process, as follows:

1. The synthesis and storage of norepinephrine in the sympathetic nerve endings can be prevented. The bestknown drug that causes this effect is reserpine.
2. Release of norepinephrine from the sympathetic endings can be blocked. This effect can be caused by guanethidine.
3. The sympathetic alpha receptors can be blocked. Two drugs that block both alpha ${ }_{1}$ and alpha ${ }_{2}$ adrenergic receptors are phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine. Selective alpha ${ }_{1}$ adrenergic blockers include prazosin and terazosin, whereas yohimbine blocks alpha ${ }_{2}$ receptors.
4. The sympathetic beta receptors can be blocked. A drug that blocks both beta ${ }_{1}$ and beta ${ }_{2}$ receptors is propranolol. Drugs that block mainly beta ${ }_{1}$ receptors are atenolol, nebivolol, and metoprolol.
5. Sympathetic activity can be blocked by drugs that block transmission of nerve impulses through the autonomic ganglia. They are discussed in a later section, but drugs that block both sympathetic and parasympathetic transmission through the ganglia include hexamethonium and pentolinium.

## Drugs That Act on Cholinergic Effector Organs

Parasympathomimetic Drugs (Cholinergic Drugs). Acetylcholine injected intravenously usually does not cause exactly the same effects throughout the body as parasympathetic stimulation because most of the acetylcholine is destroyed by cholinesterase in the blood and body fluids before it can reach all the effector organs. Yet, several other drugs that are not so rapidly destroyed can produce typical widespread parasympathetic effects; these are called parasympathomimetic drugs.

Two commonly used parasympathomimetic drugs are pilocarpine and methacholine. They act directly on the muscarinic type of cholinergic receptors.

Drugs That Have a Parasympathetic Potentiating Effect-Anticholinesterase Drugs. Some drugs do not have a direct effect on parasympathetic effector organs but do potentiate the effects of the naturally secreted acetylcholine at the parasympathetic endings. They are the same drugs as those discussed in Chapter 7 that potentiate the effect of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. These drugs include neostigmine, pyridostigmine, and ambenonium. They inhibit acetylcholinesterase, thus preventing rapid destruction of the acetylcholine liberated at parasympathetic nerve endings. As a consequence, the quantity of acetylcholine increases with successive stimuli, and the degree of action also increases.

Drugs That Block Cholinergic Activity at Effector Or-gans-Antimuscarinic Drugs. Atropine and similar drugs, such as homatropine and scopolamine, block the action of acetylcholine on the muscarinic type of cholinergic effector organs. These drugs do not affect the nicotinic action of acetylcholine on the postganglionic neurons or on skeletal muscle.

## Drugs That Stimulate or Block Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Postganglionic Neurons

Drugs That Stimulate Autonomic Postganglionic Neurons. The preganglionic neurons of both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous systems secrete acetylcholine at their endings, and the acetylcholine in turn stimulates the postganglionic neurons. Furthermore, injected acetylcholine can also stimulate the postganglionic neurons of both systems, thereby causing at the same time both sympathetic and parasympathetic effects throughout the body.

Nicotine is another drug that can stimulate postganglionic neurons in the same manner as acetylcholine, because the membranes of these neurons all contain the nicotinic type of acetylcholine receptor. Therefore, drugs that cause autonomic effects by stimulating postganglionic neurons are called nicotinic drugs. Some other drugs, such as methacholine, have both nicotinic and muscarinic actions, whereas pilocarpine has only muscarinic actions.

Nicotine excites both the sympathetic and parasympathetic postganglionic neurons at the same time, resulting in strong sympathetic vasoconstriction in the abdominal organs and limbs but at the same time resulting in parasympathetic effects such as increased gastrointestinal activity.

Ganglionic Blocking Drugs. Drugs that block impulse transmission from the autonomic preganglionic neurons
to the postganglionic neurons include tetraethyl ammonium ion, hexamethonium ion, and pentolinium. These drugs block acetylcholine stimulation of the postganglionic neurons in both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems simultaneously. They are often used for blocking sympathetic activity but seldom for blocking parasympathetic activity because their effects of sympathetic blockade usually far overshadow the effects of parasympathetic blockade. The ganglionic blocking drugs especially can reduce the arterial pressure rapidly, but they are not very useful clinically because their effects are difficult to control.

# Cerebral Blood Flow, Cerebrospinal Fluid, and Brain Metabolism 

Thus far, we have discussed the function of the brain as if it were independent of its blood flow, its metabolism, and its fluids. However, this is far from true because abnormalities of any of these aspects can profoundly affect brain function. For example, total cessation of blood flow to the brain causes unconsciousness within 5 to 10 seconds because lack of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ delivery to the brain cells nearly shuts down metabolism in these cells. Also, on a longer time scale, abnormalities of the cerebrospinal fluid, either its composition or its fluid pressure, can have equally severe effects on brain function.

## CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW

Blood flow of the brain is supplied by four large arter-ies-two carotid and two vertebral arteries-that merge to form the circle of Willis at the base of the brain. The arteries arising from the circle of Willis travel along the brain surface and give rise to pial arteries, which branch out into smaller vessels called penetrating arteries and arterioles (Figure 62-1). The penetrating vessels are separated slightly from the brain tissue by an extension of the subarachnoid space called the Virchow-Robin space. The penetrating vessels dive down into the brain tissue, giving rise to intracerebral arterioles, which eventually branch into capillaries where exchange among the blood and the tissues of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, nutrients, carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$, and metabolites occurs.

## REGULATION OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW

Normal blood flow through the brain of the adult person averages 50 to $65 \mathrm{ml} / 100 \mathrm{~g}$ of brain tissue $/ \mathrm{min}$. For the entire brain, this amounts to 750 to $900 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. Thus, the brain constitutes only about $2 \%$ of the body weight but receives $15 \%$ of the resting cardiac output.

As in most other tissues, cerebral blood flow is highly related to the tissue metabolism. Several metabolic factors are believed to contribute to cerebral blood flow regulation: (1) $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration; (2) hydrogen ion $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$concentration; (3) $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentration; and (4) substances released from astrocytes, which are specialized,
non-neuronal cells that appear to couple neuronal activity with local blood flow regulation (see Figure 62-1).
Excesses of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Concentration Increase Cerebral Blood Flow. An increase in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration in the arterial blood perfusing the brain greatly increases cerebral blood flow. This is demonstrated in Figure 62-2, which shows that a $70 \%$ increase in arterial partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)$ approximately doubles cerebral blood flow.
$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is believed to increase cerebral blood flow by combining first with water in the body fluids to form carbonic acid, with subsequent dissociation of this acid to form $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

Figure 62-1. Architecture of cerebral blood vessels and potential mechanism for blood flow regulation by astrocytes. The pial arteries lie on the glia limitans, and the penetrating arteries are surrounded by astrocyte foot processes. Note that the astrocytes also have fine processes that are closely associated with synapses.

Figure 62-2. Relationship between arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and cerebral blood flow.

The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$then causes vasodilation of the cerebral vessels, with the dilation being almost directly proportional to the increase in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration up to a blood flow limit of about twice normal.

Other substances that increase the acidity of the brain tissue and therefore increase $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration will likewise increase cerebral blood flow. Such substances include lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and any other acidic material formed by tissue metabolism.

Importance of Cerebral Blood Flow Control by $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Increased $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration greatly depresses neuronal activity. Therefore, it is fortunate that increased $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration also elicits increased blood flow, which in turn carries $\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and other acid-forming substances away from the brain tissues. Loss of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ removes carbonic acid from the tissues; this action, along with removal of other acids, reduces the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration back toward normal. Thus, this mechanism helps maintain a constant $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration in the cerebral fluids and thereby helps to maintain a normal, constant level of neuronal activity.

## Oxygen Deficiency as a Regulator of Cerebral Blood

Flow. Except during periods of intense brain activity, the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ utilization by the brain tissue remains within narrow limits-almost exactly $3.5( \pm 0.2) \mathrm{ml}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2} / 100 \mathrm{~g}$ of brain tissue $/ \mathrm{min}$. If brain blood flow becomes insufficient to supply adequate $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ deficiency almost immediately causes vasodilation, returning the brain blood flow and transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the cerebral tissues to near normal. Thus, this local blood flow regulatory mechanism is almost exactly the same in the brain as in coronary blood vessels, in skeletal muscle, and in most other circulatory areas of the body.

Experiments have shown that a decrease in cerebral tissue partial pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}\right)$ below about 30 mm Hg (the normal value is $35-40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) immediately begins to increase cerebral blood flow. This is fortuitous because brain function becomes deranged at lower values of $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$, especially at $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ levels below 20 mm Hg . Even coma can result at these low levels. Thus, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ mechanism for local regulation of cerebral blood flow is an important
protective response against diminished cerebral neuronal activity and, therefore, against derangement of mental capability.

Substances Released From Astrocytes Regulate Cerebral Blood Flow. Increasing evidence suggests that the close coupling between neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow is due, in part, to substances released from $a s$ trocytes (also called astroglial cells) that surround blood vessels of the central nervous system. Astrocytes are starshaped non-neuronal cells that support and protect neurons, as well as provide nutrition. They have numerous projections that make contact with neurons and the surrounding blood vessels, providing a potential mechanism for neurovascular communication. Gray matter astrocytes (protoplasmic astrocytes) extend fine processes that cover most synapses and large foot processes that are closely apposed to the vascular wall (see Figure 62-1).

Experimental studies have shown that electrical stimulation of excitatory glutaminergic neurons leads to increased intracellular calcium ion concentration in astrocyte foot processes and vasodilation of nearby arterioles. Additional studies have suggested that the vasodilation is mediated by several vasoactive metabolites released from astrocytes. Although the precise mediators are still unclear, nitric oxide, metabolites of arachidonic acid, potassium ions, adenosine, and other substances generated by astrocytes in response to stimulation of adjacent excitatory neurons have all been suggested to be important in mediating local vasodilation.

Measurement of Cerebral Blood Flow and Effect of Brain Activity on Flow. A method has been developed to record blood flow in as many as 256 isolated segments of the human cerebral cortex simultaneously. To record blood flow in these segments, a radioactive substance, such as radioactive xenon (Xe), is injected into the carotid artery; then the radioactivity of each segment of the cortex is recorded as the radioactive substance passes through the brain tissue. For this purpose, 256 small radioactive scintillation detectors are pressed against the surface of the cortex. The rapidity of rise and decay of radioactivity in each tissue segment is a direct measure of the rate of blood flow through that segment.

Using this technique, it has become clear that blood flow in each individual segment of the brain changes as much as $100 \%$ to $150 \%$ within seconds in response to changes in local neuronal activity. For example, simply clenching the hand into a fist causes an immediate increase in blood flow in the motor cortex of the opposite side of the brain. Reading a book increases the blood flow, especially in the visual areas of the occipital cortex and in the language perception areas of the temporal cortex. This measuring procedure can also be used for localizing the origin of epileptic attacks because local brain blood flow increases acutely and markedly at the focal point of each attack.

Figure 62-3 demonstrates the effect of local neuronal activity on cerebral blood flow by showing a typical increase in occipital blood flow recorded in a cat's brain when intense light is shined into its eyes for one-half minute.

Blood flow and neural activity in different regions of the brain can also be assessed indirectly by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This method is based on the

![gu718617462c](gu718617462c.jpg)

Figure 62-3. Increase in blood flow to the occipital regions of a cat's brain when light is shined into its eyes.
observation that oxygen-rich hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin) and oxygen-poor hemoglobin (deoxyhemoglobin) in the blood behave differently in a magnetic field. Deoxyhemoglobin is a paramagnetic molecule (i.e., attracted by an externally applied magnetic field), whereas oxyhemoglobin is diamagnetic (i.e., repelled by a magnetic field). The presence of deoxyhemoglobin in a blood vessel causes a measurable difference of the magnetic resonance (MR) proton signal of the vessel and its surrounding tissue. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals obtained from fMRI, however, depend on the total amount of deoxyhemoglobin in the specific three-dimensional space (voxel) of brain tissue being assessed. This, in turn, is influenced by the rate of blood flow, volume of blood, and rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption in the specific voxel of brain tissue. For this reason, BOLD fMRI provides only an indirect estimate of regional blood flow, although it can also be used to produce maps showing which parts of the brain are activated in a particular mental process.

An alternative MRI method called arterial spin labeling (ASL) can be used to provide a more quantitative assessment of regional blood flow. ASL works by manipulating the MR signal of arterial blood before it is delivered to different areas of the brain. By subtracting two images in which the arterial blood is manipulated differently, the static proton signal in the rest of the tissue subtracts out, leaving only the signal arising from the delivered arterial blood. ASL and BOLD imaging can be used together simultaneously to provide a probe of regional brain blood flow and neuronal function.

Cerebral Blood Flow Autoregulation Protects the Brain From Changes in Arterial Pressure. During normal daily activities, arterial pressure can fluctuate widely, rising to high levels during states of excitement or strenuous activity and falling to low levels during sleep. However, cerebral blood flow is "autoregulated" extremely well between arterial pressure limits of approximately 60 and 150 mm Hg (Figure 62-4). That is, acute reductions in mean arterial pressure to as low as 60 mm Hg or increases to as high as 150 mm Hg do not cause major changes in cerebral blood flow in people who have normal autoregulation.

In people who have chronic hypertension there is hypertrophic remodeling of their cerebral blood vessels, as well as blood vessels in other organs (discussed in Chapter 17), and the autoregulatory curve is shifted to higher blood pressures. This resetting of cerebral blood flow autoregulation partially protects the brain from the damaging effects of the high blood pressure. but also makes the brain vulner-
![gu728617462c](gu728617462c.jpg)

able to severe ischemia if blood pressure is reduced too rapidly below the range of autoregulation. If arterial pressure falls below the limits of autoregulation, cerebral blood flow becomes severely decreased.

Impairment of autoregulation makes cerebral blood flow much more dependent on arterial pressure. For example, in preeclampsia, a disorder of pregnancy associated with vascular dysfunction and hypertension, cerebral blood flow autoregulation may be impaired, leading to pressuredependent increases in cerebral blood flow, disruption of the vascular endothelium, edema, and seizures in some cases. In old age, atherosclerosis and various brain disorders, cerebral blood flow autoregulation may also be impaired, increasing the risk for blood pressure-dependent injury of the brain.

Role of the Sympathetic Nervous System in Controlling Cerebral Blood Flow. The cerebral circulatory system has strong sympathetic innervation that passes upward from the superior cervical sympathetic ganglia in the neck and then into the brain along with the cerebral arteries. This innervation supplies both the large brain arteries and the arteries that penetrate into the substance of the brain. However, transection of the sympathetic nerves or mild to moderate stimulation of them usually causes little change in cerebral blood flow because the blood flow autoregulation mechanism can override the nervous effects.

When mean arterial pressure rises acutely to an exceptionally high level, such as during strenuous exercise or during other states of excessive circulatory activity, the sympathetic nervous system normally constricts the large and intermediate-sized brain arteries enough to prevent the high pressure from reaching the smaller brain blood vessels. This mechanism is important in preventing vascular hemorrhages into the brain-that is, for preventing "cerebral stroke."

## CEREBRAL MICROCIRCULATION

As is true for almost all other tissues of the body, the number of blood capillaries in the brain is greatest where the metabolic needs are greatest. The overall metabolic rate

of the brain gray matter where the neuronal cell bodies lie is about four times as great as that of white matter; correspondingly, the number of capillaries and rate of blood flow are also about four times as great in the gray matter.

An important structural characteristic of the brain capillaries is that most of them are much less "leaky" than the blood capillaries in almost any other tissue of the body. One reason for this phenomenon is that the capillaries are supported on all sides by "glial feet," which are small projections from the surrounding glial cells (e.g., astroglial cells) that abut against all surfaces of the capillaries and provide physical support to prevent overstretching of the capillaries in case of high capillary blood pressure.

The walls of the small arterioles leading to the brain capillaries become greatly thickened in people in whom high blood pressure develops, and these arterioles remain significantly constricted all the time to prevent transmission of the high pressure to the capillaries. We shall see later in the chapter that whenever these systems for protecting against transudation of fluid into the brain break down, serious brain edema ensues, which can lead rapidly to coma and death.

## Cerebral "Stroke" Occurs When Cerebral Blood Vessels Are Blocked or Ruptured

Almost all elderly people have blockage of some small arteries in the brain, and up to $10 \%$ eventually have enough blockage to cause serious disturbance of brain function, a condition called a "stroke."

Many strokes are caused by arteriosclerotic plaques that occur in one or more of the feeder arteries to the brain. The plaques can activate the clotting mechanism of the blood, causing a blood clot to occur and block blood flow in the artery, thereby leading to acute loss of brain function in a localized area.

In about $25 \%$ of people in whom strokes develop, high blood pressure makes one of the blood vessels burst; hemorrhage then occurs, compressing the local brain tissue and further compromising its functions. The neurological effects of a stroke are determined by the brain area affected. One of the most common types of stroke is blockage of the middle cerebral artery that supplies the midportion of one brain hemisphere. For example, if the middle cerebral artery is blocked on the left side of the brain, the person is likely to lose function in Wernicke's speech comprehension area in the left cerebral hemisphere, and he or she also becomes unable to speak words because of loss of Broca's motor area for word formation. In addition, loss of function of neural motor control areas of the left hemisphere can create spastic paralysis of most muscles on the opposite side of the body.

In a similar manner, blockage of a posterior cerebral artery will cause infarction of the occipital pole of the hemisphere on the same side as the blockage, which causes loss of vision in both eyes in the half of the retina on the same side as the stroke lesion. Especially devastating are strokes that involve the blood supply to the midbrain because this effect can block nerve conduction in major pathways between the brain and spinal cord, causing both sensory and motor abnormalities.
![gu738617462c](gu738617462c.jpg)

Figure 62-5. The arrows show the pathway of cerebrospinal fluid flow from the choroid plexuses in the lateral ventricles to the arachnoidal villi protruding into the dural sinuses.

As discussed in Chapter 60, small infarcts or microbleeds in small blood vessels may cause "silent strokes" with no readily apparent symptoms other than subtle cognitive decline. These small areas where infarction has occurred, however, may be detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) imaging. It is estimated that approximately $25 \%$ of people greater than 80 years of age have had had one or more silent brain infarcts.

## CEREBROSPINAL FLUID SYSTEM

The entire cerebral cavity enclosing the brain and spinal cord has a capacity of about 1600 to 1700 ml . About 150 ml of this capacity is occupied by cerebrospinal fluid and the remainder by the brain and cord. This fluid, as shown in Figure 62-5, is present in the ventricles of the brain, in the cisterns around the outside of the brain, and in the subarachnoid space around both the brain and the spinal cord. All these chambers are connected with one another, and the pressure of the fluid is maintained at a surprisingly constant level.

## CUSHIONING FUNCTION OF THE CEREBROSPINAL FLUID

A major function of the cerebrospinal fluid is to cushion the brain within its solid vault. The brain and the cerebrospinal fluid have about the same specific gravity (with only about a $4 \%$ difference), so the brain simply floats in the fluid. Therefore, a blow to the head, if it is not too intense, moves the entire brain simultaneously with the skull, causing no one portion of the brain to be momentarily contorted by the blow.

Contrecoup. When a blow to the head is extremely severe, it may not damage the brain on the side of the head where the blow is struck but is likely to damage the opposite side. This phenomenon is known as "contrecoup," and the reason for this effect is the following: When the blow is

struck, the fluid on the struck side is so incompressible that as the skull moves, the fluid pushes the brain at the same time in unison with the skull. On the side opposite to the area that is struck, the sudden movement of the whole skull causes the skull to pull away from the brain momentarily because of the brain's inertia, creating for a split second a vacuum space in the cranial vault in the area opposite to the blow. Then, when the skull is no longer being accelerated by the blow, the vacuum suddenly collapses and the brain strikes the inner surface of the skull.

The poles and the inferior surfaces of the frontal and temporal lobes, where the brain comes into contact with bony protuberances in the base of the skull, are often the sites of injury and contusions (bruises) after a severe blow to the head, such as that experienced by a boxer. If the contusion occurs on the same side as the impact injury, it is a coup injury; if it occurs on the opposite side, the contusion is a contrecoup injury.

Coup and contrecoup injuries can also be caused by rapid acceleration or deceleration alone in the absence of physical impact due to a blow to the head. In these cases, the brain may bounce off the wall of the skull, causing a coup injury, and then also bounce off the opposite side, causing a contrecoup contusion. Such injuries are thought to occur, for example, in "shaken baby syndrome" or sometimes in vehicular accidents.

## FORMATION, FLOW, AND ABSORPTION OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID

Cerebrospinal fluid is formed at a rate of about $500 \mathrm{ml} /$ day, which is three to four times as much as the total volume of fluid in the entire cerebrospinal fluid system. About two-thirds or more of this fluid originates as secretion from the choroid plexuses in the four ventricles, mainly in the two lateral ventricles. Additional small amounts of fluid are secreted by the ependymal surfaces of all the ventricles and by the arachnoidal membranes. A small amount comes from the brain through the perivascular spaces that surround the blood vessels passing through the brain.

The arrows in Figure 62-5 show that the main channels of fluid flow from the choroid plexuses and then through the cerebrospinal fluid system. The fluid secreted in the lateral ventricles passes first into the third ventricle; then, after addition of minute amounts of fluid from the third ventricle, it flows downward along the aqueduct of Sylvius into the fourth ventricle, where still another minute amount of fluid is added. Finally, the fluid passes out of the fourth ventricle through three small openings, two lateral foramina of Luschka and a midline foramen of Magendie, entering the cisterna magna, a fluid space that lies behind the medulla and beneath the cerebellum.

The cisterna magna is continuous with the subarachnoid space that surrounds the entire brain and spinal cord. Almost all the cerebrospinal fluid then flows upward from the cisterna magna through the subarachnoid spaces surrounding the cerebrum. From here, the fluid flows into
![gu748617462c](gu748617462c.jpg)

Figure 62-6. Choroid plexus in a lateral ventricle.
and through multiple arachnoidal villi that project into the large sagittal venous sinus and other venous sinuses of the cerebrum. Thus, any extra fluid empties into the venous blood through pores of these villi.

Secretion by the Choroid Plexus. The choroid plexus, a section of which is shown in Figure 62-6, is a cauliflowerlike growth of blood vessels covered by a thin layer of epithelial cells. This plexus projects into the temporal horn of each lateral ventricle, the posterior portion of the third ventricle, and the roof of the fourth ventricle.

Secretion of fluid into the ventricles by the choroid plexus depends mainly on active transport of sodium ions through the epithelial cells lining the outside of the plexus. The positive charges of sodium ions in turn pull along large amounts of negatively charged chloride ions. The two ions increase the quantity of osmotically active sodium chloride in the cerebrospinal fluid, which then causes almost immediate osmosis of water through the membrane, thus providing the fluid of the secretion.

Less important transport processes move small amounts of glucose into the cerebrospinal fluid and both potassium and bicarbonate ions out of the cerebrospinal fluid into the capillaries. Therefore, the resulting characteristics of the cerebrospinal fluid become the following: osmotic pressure, approximately equal to that of plasma; sodium ion concentration, also approximately equal to that of plasma; chloride ion, about $15 \%$ greater than in plasma; potassium ion, approximately $40 \%$ less; and glucose, about $30 \%$ less.

Absorption of Cerebrospinal Fluid Through the Arachnoidal Villi. The arachnoidal villi are microscopic fingerlike inward projections of the arachnoidal membrane

![gu758617462c](gu758617462c.jpg)

Figure 62-7. Drainage of a perivascular space into the subarachnoid space. (Modified from Ranson SW, Clark SL: Anatomy of the Nervous System. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1959.)
through the walls and into the venous sinuses. Conglomerates of these villi form macroscopic structures called arachnoidal granulations that can be seen protruding into the sinuses. The endothelial cells covering the villi have been shown by electron microscopy to have vesicular passages directly through the bodies of the cells large enough to allow relatively free flow of (1) cerebrospinal fluid, (2) dissolved protein molecules, and (3) even particles as large as red and white blood cells into the venous blood.

Perivascular Spaces and Cerebrospinal Fluid. The large arteries and veins of the brain lie on the surface of the brain but their ends penetrate inward, carrying with them a layer of pia mater, the membrane that covers the brain, as shown in Figure 62-7. The pia is only loosely adherent to the vessels, so a space, the perivascular space, exists between it and each vessel. Therefore, perivascular spaces follow both the arteries and the veins into the brain as far as the arterioles and venules go.

Lymphatic Function of the Perivascular Spaces. As is true elsewhere in the body, a small amount of protein leaks out of the brain capillaries into the interstitial spaces of the brain. The protein that leaks into the brain interstitial spaces leaves the tissue flowing with fluid through the perivascular spaces into the subarachnoid spaces. On reaching the subarachnoid spaces, the protein then flows with the cerebrospinal fluid to be absorbed through the arachnoidal villi into the large cerebral veins. Therefore, perivascular spaces, in effect, provide a specialized lymphatic system for the brain.

In addition to transporting fluid and proteins, the perivascular spaces transport extraneous particulate matter out of the brain. For example, whenever infection occurs in the brain, dead white blood cells and other infectious debris are carried away through the perivascular spaces.

Scientists have long believed that the brain lacks true lymphatic vessels to drain the interstitial spaces of excess fluid, protein, and other macromolecules. Some studies, however, have reported that there are meningeal lymphatic vessels at the base of the skull, at least in rodents.

Whether these lymphatic vessels are present in human beings is still uncertain.

## Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure

The normal pressure in the cerebrospinal fluid system when one is lying in a horizontal position averages 130 mm of water ( 10 mm Hg ), although this pressure may be as low as 65 mm of water or as high as 195 mm of water even in the normal healthy person.

Regulation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure by the Arachnoidal Villi. The normal rate of cerebrospinal fluid formation remains nearly constant, so changes in fluid formation are seldom a factor in pressure control. The arachnoidal villi function like valves that allow cerebrospinal fluid and its contents to flow readily into the blood of the venous sinuses while not allowing blood to flow backward in the opposite direction. Normally, this valve action of the villi allows cerebrospinal fluid to begin to flow into the blood when cerebrospinal fluid pressure is about 1.5 mm Hg greater than the pressure of the blood in the venous sinuses. Then, if the cerebrospinal fluid pressure rises still higher, the valves open more widely. Under normal conditions, the cerebrospinal fluid pressure almost never rises more than a few millimeters of mercury higher than the pressure in the cerebral venous sinuses.

In disease states, the villi sometimes become blocked by large particulate matter, by fibrosis, or by blood cells that have leaked into the cerebrospinal fluid in brain diseases. Such blockage can cause high cerebrospinal fluid pressure, as described in the following section.

High Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure in Pathological Conditions of the Brain. Often a large brain tumor elevates the cerebrospinal fluid pressure by decreasing reabsorption of the cerebrospinal fluid back into the blood. As a result, the cerebrospinal fluid pressure can rise to as much as 500 mm of water ( 37 mm Hg ) or about four times normal.

The cerebrospinal fluid pressure also rises considerably when hemorrhage or infection occurs in the cranial vault. In both these conditions, large numbers of red and/or white blood cells suddenly appear in the cerebrospinal fluid and can cause serious blockage of the small absorption channels through the arachnoidal villi. This also sometimes elevates the cerebrospinal fluid pressure to 400 to 600 mm of water (about four times normal).

Some babies are born with high cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which is often caused by abnormally high resistance to fluid reabsorption through the arachnoidal villi, resulting either from too few arachnoidal villi or from villi with abnormal absorptive properties. This is discussed later in connection with hydrocephalus.

Measurement of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure. The usual procedure for measuring cerebrospinal fluid pressure is simple. First, the person lies exactly horizontally on his or her side so that the fluid pressure in the spinal canal is equal to the pressure in the cranial vault. A spinal needle is then inserted into the lumbar spinal canal below the lower end of the cord, and the needle is connected to a vertical glass tube that is open to the air at its top. The spinal fluid is allowed to rise in the tube as high as it will. If it rises to a level 136 mm above the level of the needle, the pressure is said

to be 136 mm of water pressure-or, dividing this number by 13.6 , which is the specific gravity of mercury, about 10 mm Hg pressure.

Obstruction to Flow of Cerebrospinal Fluid Can Cause Hydrocephalus. "Hydrocephalus" means excess water in the cranial vault. This condition is frequently divided into communicating hydrocephalus and noncommunicating hydrocephalus. In communicating hydrocephalus, fluid flows readily from the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space, whereas in noncommunicating hydrocephalus, fluid flow out of one or more of the ventricles is blocked.

Usually the noncommunicating type of hydrocephalus is caused by a block in the aqueduct of Sylvius, resulting from atresia (closure) before birth in many babies or from blockage by a brain tumor at any age. As fluid is formed by the choroid plexuses in the two lateral and the third ventricles, the volumes of these three ventricles increase greatly, which flattens the brain into a thin shell against the skull. In neonates, the increased pressure also causes the whole head to swell because the skull bones have not yet fused.

The communicating type of hydrocephalus is usually caused by blockage of fluid flow in the subarachnoid spaces around the basal regions of the brain or by blockage of the arachnoidal villi where the fluid is normally absorbed into the venous sinuses. Fluid therefore collects both on the outside of the brain and to a lesser extent inside the ventricles. This will also cause the head to swell tremendously if it occurs in infancy when the skull is still pliable and can be stretched, and it can damage the brain at any age. A therapy for many types of hydrocephalus is surgical placement of a silicone tube shunt all the way from one of the brain ventricles to the peritoneal cavity where the excess fluid can be absorbed into the blood.

## Blood-Cerebrospinal Fluid and Blood-Brain Barriers

It has already been pointed out that the concentrations of several important constituents of cerebrospinal fluid are not the same as in extracellular fluid elsewhere in the body. Furthermore, many large molecules hardly pass at all from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid or into the interstitial fluids of the brain, even though these same substances pass readily into the usual interstitial fluids of the body. Therefore, it is said that barriers, called the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and the blood-brain barrier, exist between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid and brain fluid, respectively.

These barriers exist both at the choroid plexus and at the tissue capillary membranes in essentially all areas of the brain parenchyma except in some areas of the hypothalamus, pineal gland, and area postrema, where substances diffuse with greater ease into the tissue spaces. The ease of diffusion in these areas is important because they have sensory receptors that respond to specific changes in the body fluids, such as changes in osmolality and in glucose concentration, as well as receptors for peptide hormones that regulate thirst, such as angiotensin II. The blood-brain barrier also has specific carrier molecules that facilitate transport of hormones, such as leptin, from the blood into the hypothalamus where they bind to specific receptors that control other functions such as appetite and sympathetic nervous system activity.

In general, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid and blood-brain barriers are highly permeable to water, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and most lipidsoluble substances such as alcohol and anesthetics; slightly permeable to electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, and potassium; and almost totally impermeable to plasma proteins and most non-lipid-soluble large organic molecules. Therefore, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid and blood-brain barriers often make it impossible to achieve effective concentrations of therapeutic drugs, such as protein antibodies and non-lipid-soluble drugs, in the cerebrospinal fluid or parenchyma of the brain.

The cause of the low permeability of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid and blood-brain barriers is the manner in which the endothelial cells of the brain tissue capillaries are joined to one another. They are joined by so-called tight junctions. That is, the membranes of the adjacent endothelial cells are tightly fused rather than having large slit pores between them, as is the case for most other capillaries of the body.

## Brain Edema

One of the most serious complications of abnormal cerebral fluid dynamics is the development of brain edema. Because the brain is encased in a solid cranial vault, accumulation of extra edema fluid compresses the blood vessels, often causing seriously decreased blood flow and destruction of brain tissue.

The usual cause of brain edema is either greatly increased capillary pressure or damage to the capillary wall that makes the wall leaky to fluid. A common cause is a serious blow to the head, leading to brain concussion, in which the brain tissues and capillaries are traumatized and capillary fluid leaks into the traumatized tissues.

Once brain edema begins, it often initiates two vicious circles because of the following positive feedbacks:

1. Edema compresses the vasculature, which in turn decreases blood flow and causes brain ischemia. The ischemia in turn causes arteriolar dilation with still further increase in capillary pressure. The increased capillary pressure then causes more edema fluid, so the edema becomes progressively worse.
2. The decreased cerebral blood flow also decreases $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery, which increases the permeability of the capillaries, allowing still more fluid leakage. The diminished blood flow also reduces delivery of substrates needed to produce adequate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that, in turn, is required for the sodium pumps of the neuronal tissue cells, thus allowing these cells to swell. Once these vicious circles have begun, heroic measures must be used to prevent total destruction of the brain. One such measure is to infuse intravenously a concentrated osmotic substance, such as a concentrated mannitol solution, which pulls fluid by osmosis from the brain tissue and breaks up the vicious circles. Another procedure is to remove fluid quickly from the lateral ventricles of the brain by means of ventricular needle puncture, thereby relieving the intracerebral pressure.

## BRAIN METABOLISM

Like other tissues, the brain requires $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and food nutrients to supply its metabolic needs. However, brain metabolism features special attributes that require mention.

## Total Brain Metabolic Rate and Metabolic Rate of

Neurons. Under resting but awake conditions, brain metabolism accounts for about $15 \%$ of the total metabolism in the body, even though brain mass is only $2 \%$ of the total body mass. Therefore, under resting conditions, brain metabolism per unit mass of tissue is about 7.5 times the average metabolism in non-nervous system tissues.

Most of this brain metabolism occurs in the neurons, not in the glial supportive tissues. The major need for metabolism in the neurons is to pump ions through their membranes, mainly to transport sodium and calcium ions to the outside of the neuronal membrane and potassium ions to the interior. Each time a neuron conducts an action potential, these ions move through the membranes, increasing the need for additional membrane transport to restore proper ionic concentration differences across the neuron membranes. Therefore, during high levels of brain activity, neuronal metabolism can increase as much as $100 \%$ to $150 \%$.

Special Requirement of the Brain for Oxygen—Lack of Significant Anaerobic Metabolism. Most tissues of the body can live without $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ for several minutes and some for as long as 30 minutes. During this time, the tissue cells obtain their energy through processes of anaerobic metabolism, which means release of energy by partially breaking down glucose and glycogen but without combining these with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. This process delivers energy but at the expense of consuming tremendous amounts of glucose and glycogen. However, it does keep the tissues alive.

The brain is not capable of much anaerobic metabolism after sudden reduction in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery. One of the reasons for this is the high metabolic rate of the neurons, so most neuronal activity depends on second-by-second delivery of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the blood. Putting these factors together, one can understand why sudden cessation of blood flow to the brain or sudden total lack of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the blood can cause unconsciousness within 5 to 10 seconds.

Under Normal Conditions, Most Brain Energy Is Supplied by Glucose. Under normal conditions, almost all the energy used by the brain cells is supplied by glucose derived from the blood. As is true for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, most of this glucose is derived minute by minute and second by second from the capillary blood, with a total of only about a 2-minute supply of glucose normally stored as glycogen in the neurons at any given time.

A special feature of glucose delivery to neurons is that its transport into the neurons through the cell membrane is not dependent on insulin, even though insulin is required for glucose transport into most other body cells. Therefore, in patients who have serious diabetes with essentially zero secretion of insulin, glucose still
diffuses readily into the neurons, which is most fortunate in preventing loss of mental function in persons with diabetes. Yet when a diabetic patient is overtreated with insulin, the blood glucose concentration can fall to an extremely low level because the excess insulin causes almost all the glucose in the blood to be transported rapidly into the vast numbers of insulin-sensitive nonneural cells throughout the body, especially into muscle and liver cells. When this happens, not enough glucose is left in the blood to supply the neurons properly, and mental function becomes seriously deranged, leading sometimes to coma and even more often to mental imbalances and psychotic disturbances-all caused by overtreatment with insulin.

# General Principles of Gastrointestinal Function-Motility, Nervous Control, and Blood Circulation 

The alimentary tract provides the body with a continual supply of water, electrolytes, vitamins, and nutrients, which requires the following: (1) movement of food through the alimentary tract; (2) secretion of digestive juices and digestion of the food; (3) absorption of water, various electrolytes, vitamins, and digestive products; (4) circulation of blood through the gastrointestinal organs to carry away the absorbed substances; and (5) control of all these functions by local, nervous, and hormonal systems.

Figure 63-1 shows the entire alimentary tract. Each part is adapted to its specific functions - some parts to simple passage of food, such as the esophagus; others to temporary storage of food, such as the stomach; and others to digestion and absorption, such as the small intestine. In this chapter we discuss the basic principles of function in the entire alimentary tract, and in subsequent chapters the specific functions of different segments of the tract will be addressed.

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF GASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY

## Physiologic Anatomy of the Gastrointestinal Wall

Figure 63-2 shows a typical cross section of the intestinal wall, including the following layers from the outer surface inward: (1) the serosa, (2) a longitudinal smooth muscle layer, (3) a circular smooth muscle layer, (4) the submucosa, and (5) the mucosa. In addition, sparse bundles of smooth muscle fibers, the mucosal muscle, lie in the deeper layers of the mucosa. The motor functions of the gut are performed by the different layers of smooth muscle.

The general characteristics of smooth muscle and its function are discussed in Chapter 8, which should be reviewed as a background for the following sections of this chapter.

Gastrointestinal Smooth Muscle Functions as a Syncytium. The individual smooth muscle fibers in the gastrointestinal tract are 200 to 500 micrometers in length and 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter, and they are ar-
ranged in bundles of as many as 1000 parallel fibers. In the longitudinal muscle layer, the bundles extend longitudinally down the intestinal tract; in the circular muscle layer, they extend around the gut.

Within each bundle, the muscle fibers are electrically connected with one another through large numbers of gap junctions that allow low-resistance movement of ions from one muscle cell to the next. Therefore, electrical signals that initiate muscle contractions can travel readily from one fiber to the next within each bundle but more rapidly along the length of the bundle than sideways.

Each bundle of smooth muscle fibers is partly separated from the next by loose connective tissue; however, the muscle bundles fuse with one another at many points, so in reality each muscle layer represents a branching latticework of smooth muscle bundles. Therefore, each muscle layer functions as a syncytium; that is, when an action potential is elicited anywhere within the muscle mass, it generally travels in all directions in the muscle. The distance that it travels depends on the excitability of the muscle; sometimes it stops after only a few millimeters, and at other times it travels many centimeters or even the entire length and breadth of the intestinal tract.

Also, because a few connections exist between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers, excitation of one of these layers often excites the other as well.

## Electrical Activity of Gastrointestinal Smooth Muscle

The smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract is excited by almost continual slow, intrinsic electrical activity along the membranes of the muscle fibers. This activity has two basic types of electrical waves: (1) slow waves and (2) spikes, both of which are shown in Figure 63-3. In addition, the voltage of the resting membrane potential of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle can change to different levels, which can also have important effects in controlling motor activity of the gastrointestinal tract.
"Slow Waves" Caused by Undulating Changes in Resting Membrane Potential. Most gastrointestinal contractions occur rhythmically, and this rhythm is determined mainly by the frequency of so-called "slow
