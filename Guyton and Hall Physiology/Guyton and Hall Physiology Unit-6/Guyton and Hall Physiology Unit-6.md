# Regulation of Body Fluid Compartments: Extracellular and Intracellular Fluids; Edema 

The maintenance of a relatively constant volume and stable composition of the body fluids is essential for homeostasis. Some of the most common and important problems in clinical medicine arise because of abnormalities in the control systems that maintain this relative constancy of the body fluids. In this chapter and in the following chapters on the kidneys, we discuss overall regulation of body fluid volume, constituents of the extracellular fluid, acid-base balance, and control of fluid exchange between extracellular and intracellular compartments.

## FLUID INTAKE AND OUTPUT ARE BALANCED DURING STEADY-STATE CONDITIONS

The relative constancy of the body fluids is remarkable, because there is continuous exchange of fluid and solutes with the external environment, as well as within the different body compartments. For example, fluid added to the body is highly variable and must be carefully matched by an equal output of water from the body to prevent body fluid volumes from increasing or decreasing.

## DAILY INTAKE OF WATER

Water is added to the body by two major sources: (1) it is ingested in the form of liquids or water in food, which together normally add about $2100 \mathrm{ml} /$ day to the body fluids; and (2) it is synthesized in the body by oxidation of carbohydrates, adding about $200 \mathrm{ml} /$ day. These mechanisms provide a total water intake of about $2300 \mathrm{ml} /$ day (Table 25-1). However, intake of water is highly variable among different people and even within the same person on different days, depending on climate, habits, and level of physical activity.

## DAILY LOSS OF BODY WATER

Insensible Water Loss. Some water losses cannot be precisely regulated. For example, humans experience continuous water loss by evaporation from the respiratory tract and diffusion through the skin, which together account for about $700 \mathrm{ml} /$ day of water loss under normal conditions. This loss is termed insensible water loss because we
are not consciously aware of it, even though it occurs continually in all living people.

Insensible water loss through the skin occurs independently of sweating and is present even in people who are born without sweat glands; the average water loss by diffusion through the skin is about 300 to $400 \mathrm{ml} /$ day. This loss is minimized by the cholesterol-filled, cornified layer of the skin, which provides a barrier against excessive loss by diffusion. When the cornified layer becomes denuded, as occurs with extensive burns, the rate of evaporation can increase as much as 10 -fold, to 3 to $5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. For this reason, persons with burns must be given large amounts of fluid, usually intravenously, to balance fluid loss.

Insensible water loss through the respiratory tract normally averages about 300 to $400 \mathrm{ml} /$ day. As air enters the respiratory tract, it becomes saturated with moisture to a vapor pressure of about 47 mm Hg before it is expelled. Because the vapor pressure of the inspired air is usually less than 47 mm Hg , water is continuously lost through the lungs with respiration. In cold weather, the atmospheric vapor pressure decreases to nearly 0 , causing an even greater loss of water from the lungs as the temperature decreases. This process explains the dry feeling in the respiratory passages in cold weather.

Fluid Loss in Sweat. The amount of water lost by sweating is highly variable, depending on physical activity and environmental temperature. The volume of sweat normally is about $100 \mathrm{ml} /$ day, but in very hot weather or during heavy exercise, fluid loss in sweat occasionally increases to 1 to $2 \mathrm{~L} /$ hour. This fluid loss would rapidly deplete the body fluids if intake were not also increased by activating the thirst mechanism, as discussed in Chapter 29.

Water Loss in Feces. Only a small amount of water ( $100 \mathrm{ml} /$ day) normally is lost in the feces. This loss can increase to several liters a day in people with severe diarrhea. Therefore, severe diarrhea can be life-threatening if not corrected within a few days.

Water Loss by the Kidneys. The remaining water loss from the body occurs in the urine excreted by the kidneys. Multiple mechanisms control the rate of urine excretion.

Table 25-1 Daily Intake and Output of Water (ml/day)

| Intake or Output | Normal | Prolonged <br> Heavy Exercise |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Intake |  |  |
| Fluids ingested | 2100 | $?$ |
| From metabolism | 200 | 200 |
| Total intake | 2300 | $?$ |
| Output |  |  |
| Insensible: skin | 350 | 350 |
| Insensible: lungs | 350 | 650 |
| Sweat | 100 | 5000 |
| Feces | 100 | 100 |
| Urine | 1400 | 500 |
| Total output | 2300 | 6600 |

The most important means whereby the body maintains balance between water intake and output, as well as a balance between intake and output of most electrolytes in the body, is by controlling the rate at which the kidneys excrete these substances. For example, urine volume can be as low as $0.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day in a dehydrated person or as high as $20 \mathrm{~L} /$ day in a person who has been drinking tremendous amounts of water.

This variability of intake is also true for most of the electrolytes of the body, such as sodium, chloride, and potassium. In some people, sodium intake may be as low as $20 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day, whereas in others, sodium intake may be as high as 300 to $500 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day. The kidneys have the task of adjusting the excretion rate of water and electrolytes to match the intake of these substances precisely, as well as compensating for excessive losses of fluids and electrolytes that occur in certain disease states. In Chapters 26 through 32, we discuss the mechanisms that allow the kidneys to perform these remarkable tasks.

## BODY FLUID COMPARTMENTS

The total body fluid is distributed mainly between two compartments, the extracellular fluid and the intracellular fluid (Figure 25-1). The extracellular fluid is divided into the interstitial fluid and the blood plasma.

There is another small compartment of fluid that is referred to as transcellular fluid. This compartment includes fluid in the synovial, peritoneal, pericardial, and intraocular spaces, as well as the cerebrospinal fluid; it is usually considered to be a specialized type of extracellular fluid, although in some cases its composition may differ markedly from that of the plasma or interstitial fluid. All the transcellular fluids together constitute about 1 to 2 liters.

In a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ adult man, the total body water is about $60 \%$ of the body weight, or about 42 liters. This percentage depends on age, sex, and degree of obesity. As a person grows older, the percentage of total body weight that is fluid gradually decreases. This decrease is due in part to
![gu017762836d](gu017762836d.jpg)

Figure 25-1. Summary of body fluid regulation, including the major body fluid compartments and the membranes that separate these compartments. The values shown are for an average $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man.
the fact that aging is usually associated with an increased percentage of the body weight being fat, which decreases the percentage of water in the body.

Because women normally have a greater percentage of body fat compared with men, their total body water averages about $50 \%$ of the body weight. In premature and newborn babies, the total body water ranges from $70 \%$ to $75 \%$ of body weight. Therefore, when discussing average body fluid compartments, we should realize that variations exist, depending on age, sex, and percentage of body fat.

In many other countries, the average body weight (and fat mass) has increased rapidly during the past 30 years. The average body weight for adult men older than 20 years in the United States is estimated to be approximately 88.8 kg ( $\sim 196$ pounds), and for adult women it is 77.4 kg ( $\sim 170$ pounds). Therefore, data discussed for an average $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man in this and other chapters would need to be adjusted accordingly when considering body fluid compartments in most people.

## INTRACELLULAR FLUID COMPARTMENT

About 28 of the 42 liters of fluid in the body are inside the trillions of cells and is collectively called the intracellular fluid. Thus, the intracellular fluid constitutes about $40 \%$ of the total body weight in an "average" person.

The fluid of each cell contains its individual mixture of different constituents, but the concentrations of these substances are similar from one cell to another. In fact, the composition of cell fluids is remarkably similar, even in different animals, ranging from the most primitive

microorganisms to humans. For this reason, the intracellular fluid of all the different cells together is considered to be one large fluid compartment.

## EXTRACELLULAR FLUID COMPARTMENT

All the fluids outside the cells are collectively called the extracellular fluid. Together these fluids account for about $20 \%$ of the body weight, or about 14 liters in a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man. The two largest compartments of the extracellular fluid are the interstitial fluid, which makes up more than three-fourths ( 11 liters) of the extracellular fluid, and the plasma, which makes up almost one-fourth of the extracellular fluid, or about 3 liters. The plasma is the noncellular part of the blood; it exchanges substances continuously with the interstitial fluid through the pores of the capillary membranes. These pores are highly permeable to almost all solutes in the extracellular fluid, except the proteins. Therefore, the extracellular fluids are constantly mixing, so the plasma and interstitial fluids have about the same composition, except for proteins, which have a higher concentration in the plasma.

## BLOOD VOLUME

Blood contains extracellular fluid (the fluid in plasma) and intracellular fluid (the fluid in the red blood cells). However, blood is considered to be a separate fluid compartment because it is contained in a chamber of its own, the circulatory system. The blood volume is especially important in the control of cardiovascular dynamics.

The average blood volume of adults is about $7 \%$ of body weight, or about 5 liters. About $60 \%$ of the blood is plasma and $40 \%$ is red blood cells, but these percentages can vary considerably in different people, depending on sex, weight, and other factors.

Hematocrit (Packed Red Blood Cell Volume). The hematocrit is the fraction of the blood composed of red blood cells, as determined by centrifuging blood in a hematocrit tube until the cells become tightly packed in the bottom of the tube. Because the centrifuge does not completely pack the red blood cells together, about $3 \%$ to $4 \%$ of the plasma remains entrapped among the cells, and the true hematocrit is only about $96 \%$ of the measured hematocrit.

In men, the measured hematocrit is normally about 0.40 , and in women, it is about 0.36 . In persons with severe anemia, the hematocrit may fall as low as 0.10 , a value that is barely sufficient to sustain life. Conversely, in persons with some conditions, excessive production of red blood cells occurs, resulting in polycythemia. In these persons, the hematocrit can rise to 0.65 .

ionic composition is similar. The most important difference between these two compartments is the higher concentration of protein in the plasma; because the capillaries have a low permeability to the plasma proteins, only small amounts of proteins are leaked into the interstitial spaces in most tissues.

Because of the Donnan effect, the concentration of positively charged ions (cations) is slightly greater ( $\sim 2 \%$ ) in plasma than in interstitial fluid. Plasma proteins have a net negative charge and therefore tend to bind cations such as sodium and potassium ions, thus holding extra amounts of these cations in the plasma, along with the plasma proteins. Conversely, negatively charged ions (anions) tend to have a slightly higher concentration in interstitial fluid compared with plasma because the negative charges of the plasma proteins repel the negatively charged anions. For practical purposes, however, the concentrations of ions in interstitial fluid and plasma are considered to be about equal.

Referring again to Figure 25-2, one can see that the extracellular fluid, including the plasma and interstitial
![gu047762836d](gu047762836d.jpg)

Figure 25-4. Indicator-dilution method for measuring fluid volumes.
fluid, contains large amounts of sodium and chloride ions and reasonably large amounts of bicarbonate ions but only small quantities of potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and organic acid ions. The composition of extracellular fluid is carefully regulated by various mechanisms, but especially by the kidneys, as discussed later. This regulation allows the cells to remain continually bathed in a fluid that contains the proper concentration of electrolytes and nutrients for optimal cell function.

## INTRACELLULAR FLUID CONSTITUENTS

The intracellular fluid is separated from the extracellular fluid by a cell membrane that is highly permeable to water but is not permeable to most electrolytes in the body. In contrast to the extracellular fluid, the intracellular fluid contains only small quantities of sodium and chloride ions and almost no calcium ions. Instead, it contains large amounts of potassium and phosphate ions plus moderate quantities of magnesium and sulfate ions, all of which have low concentrations in the extracellular fluid. Also, cells contain large amounts of protein-almost four times as much as in the plasma.

## MEASUREMENT OF BODY FLUID COMPARTMENT VOLUMES-INDICATOR-DILUTION PRINCIPLE

The volume of a fluid compartment in the body can be measured by placing an indicator substance in the compartment, allowing it to disperse evenly throughout the compartment's fluid, and then analyzing the extent to which the substance becomes diluted. Figure 25-4 shows this indicator-dilution method of measuring the volume of a fluid compartment. This method is based on the conservation of mass principle, which means that the total mass of a substance after dispersion in the fluid

compartment will be the same as the total mass injected into the compartment.

In the example shown in Figure 25-4, a small amount of dye or other substance contained in the syringe is injected into a chamber, and the substance is allowed to disperse throughout the chamber until it becomes mixed in equal concentrations in all areas. Then a sample of fluid containing the dispersed substance is removed, and the concentration is analyzed chemically, photoelectrically, or by other means. If none of the substance leaks out of the compartment, the total mass of substance in the compartment (Volume $\mathrm{B} \times$ Concentration B ) will equal the total mass of the substance injected (Volume $\mathrm{A} \times$ Concentration A). By simple rearrangement of the equation, one can calculate the unknown volume of chamber B as follows:

$$
\text { Volume } B=\frac{\text { Volume } \mathrm{A} \times \text { Concentration } \mathrm{A}}{\text { Concentration } B}
$$

For this calculation, one needs to know the following: (1) the total amount of substance injected into the chamber (the numerator of the equation); and (2) the concentration of the fluid in the chamber after the substance has been dispersed (the denominator).

For example, if 1 milliliter of a solution containing 10 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ of dye is dispersed into chamber B , and the final concentration in the chamber is $0.01 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ of fluid, the unknown volume of the chamber can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text { Volume } B=\frac{1 \mathrm{ml} \times 10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}}{0.01 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}}=1000 \mathrm{ml}
$$

This method can be used to measure the volume of virtually any compartment in the body as long as the following occur: (1) the indicator disperses evenly throughout the compartment; (2) the indicator disperses only in the compartment that is being measured; and (3) the indicator is not metabolized or excreted. If the indicator is metabolized or excreted, correction must be made for loss of the indicator from the body. Several substances can be used to measure the volume of each of the different body fluids.

## DETERMINATION OF VOLUMES OF SPECIFIC BODY FLUID COMPARTMENTS

Measurement of Total Body Water. Radioactive water (tritium, ${ }^{3} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ) or heavy water (deuterium, ${ }^{2} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ) can be used to measure total body water. These forms of water mix with the total body water within a few hours after being injected into the blood, and the dilution principle can be used to calculate total body water (Table 25-3). Another substance that has been used to measure total body water is antipyrine, which is very lipid-soluble, rapidly penetrates cell membranes, and distributes uniformly throughout the intracellular and extracellular compartments.

Table 25-3 Measurement of Body Fluid Volumes

| Volume | Indicators |
| :--: | :--: |
| Total body water | ${ }^{3} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O},{ }^{2} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, antipyrine |
| Extracellular fluid | ${ }^{22} \mathrm{Na},{ }^{125}$ I-iothalamate, thiosulfate, inulin |
| Intracellular fluid | (Calculated as total body waterextracellular fluid volume) |
| Plasma volume | ${ }^{125}$ I-albumin, Evans blue dye (T-1824) |
| Blood volume | ${ }^{51} \mathrm{Cr}$-labeled red blood cells, or calculated as blood volume = plasma volume/(1 - hematocrit) |
| Interstitial fluid | Calculated as extracellular fluid volume - plasma volume |

Measurement of Extracellular Fluid Volume. The volume of extracellular fluid can be estimated using any of several substances that disperse in the plasma and interstitial fluid but do not readily permeate the cell membrane. These include radioactive sodium, radioactive chloride, radioactive iothalamate, thiosulfate ion, and inulin. When any one of these substances is injected into the blood, it usually disperses almost completely throughout the extracellular fluid within 30 to 60 minutes. Some of these substances, however, such as radioactive sodium, may diffuse into the cells in small amounts. Therefore, one frequently speaks of the sodium space or inulin space instead of calling the measurement the true extracellular fluid volume.

Calculation of Intracellular Volume. The intracellular volume cannot be measured directly. However, it can be calculated as follows:

Intracellular volume
$=$ Today body water -Extracellular volume
Measurement of Plasma Volume. Plasma volume can be measured using a substance that does not readily penetrate capillary membranes but remains in the vascular system after injection. One of the most commonly used substances for measuring plasma volume is serum albumin labeled with radioactive iodine ( ${ }^{125}$ I-albumin) or with a dye that avidly binds to the plasma proteins, such as Evans blue dye (also called T-1824).

Calculation of Interstitial Fluid Volume. Interstitial fluid volume cannot be measured directly, but it can be calculated as follows:
Interstitial fluid volume
$=$ Extracellular fluid volume - Plasma volume
Measurement of Blood Volume. If one measures the hematocrit (the fraction of the total blood volume composed of cells) and plasma volume using the methods described earlier, blood volume can also be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\text { Total blood volume }=\frac{\text { Plasma volume }}{1-\text { Hematocrit }}
$$

For example, if the plasma volume is 3 liters and hematocrit is 0.40 , the total blood volume would be calculated as follows:

$$
\frac{3 \text { liters }}{1-0.4}=5 \text { liters }
$$

Another way to measure blood volume is to inject red blood cells that have been labeled with radioactive material into the circulation. After these mix in the circulation, the radioactivity of a mixed blood sample can be measured, and the total blood volume can be calculated using the indicator-dilution principle. One substance that can used to label the red blood cells is radioactive chromium $\left({ }^{51} \mathrm{Cr}\right)$, which binds tightly with the red blood cells.

## FLUID EXCHANGE AND OSMOTIC EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN INTRACELLULAR AND EXTRACELLULAR FLUID

A frequent problem in treating seriously ill patients is maintaining adequate fluids in one or both of the intracellular and extracellular compartments. As discussed in Chapter 16 and later in this chapter, the relative amounts of extracellular fluid distributed between the plasma and interstitial spaces are determined mainly by the balance of hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces across the capillary membranes.

The distribution of fluid between intracellular and extracellular compartments, in contrast, is determined mainly by the osmotic effect of smaller solutes-especially sodium, chloride, and other electrolytes-acting across the cell membrane. The reason for this is that the cell membranes are highly permeable to water but relatively impermeable to even small ions such as sodium and chloride. Therefore, water moves across the cell membrane rapidly, and the intracellular fluid remains isotonic with the extracellular fluid.

In the next section, we discuss the interrelations between intracellular and extracellular fluid volumes and the osmotic factors that can cause shifts of fluid between these two compartments.

## BASIC PRINCIPLES OF OSMOSIS AND OSMOTIC PRESSURE

The basic principles of osmosis and osmotic pressure were presented in Chapter 4. Therefore, we review here only the most important aspects of these principles as they apply to volume regulation.

Because cell membranes are relatively impermeable to most solutes but are highly permeable to water (i.e., they are selectively permeable), whenever there is a higher concentration of solute on one side of the cell membrane, water diffuses across the membrane toward the region of higher solute concentration. Thus, if a solute such as sodium chloride is added to the extracellular fluid, water rapidly diffuses from the cells through the cell membranes
into the extracellular fluid until the water concentration on both sides of the membrane becomes equal. Conversely, if a solute such as sodium chloride is removed from the extracellular fluid, water diffuses from the extracellular fluid through the cell membranes and into the cells.

Osmolality and Osmolarity. The osmolal concentration of a solution is called osmolality when the concentration is expressed as osmoles per kilogram of water; it is called osmolarity when it is expressed as osmoles per liter of solution. In dilute solutions such as the body fluids, these two terms can be used almost synonymously because the differences are small. Most of the calculations used clinically and the calculations expressed in the next several chapters are based on osmolarities rather than osmolalities.

Calculation of the Osmolarity and Osmotic Pressure of a Solution. Using the van't Hoff law, one can calculate the potential osmotic pressure of a solution, assuming that the cell membrane is impermeable to the solute. For example, the osmotic pressure of a $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride solution is calculated as follows. A $0.9 \%$ solution means that there is 0.9 gram of sodium chloride per 100 milliliters of solution, or $9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$. Because the molecular weight of sodium chloride is $58.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$, the molarity of the solution is $9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ divided by $58.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$, or about $0.154 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$. Because each molecule of sodium chloride is equal to 2 osmoles, the osmolarity of the solution is $0.154 \times 2$, or $0.308 \mathrm{Osm} / \mathrm{L}$. Therefore, the osmolarity of this solution is $308 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. The potential osmotic pressure of this solution would therefore be $308 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L} \times 19.3 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} /$ $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, or 5944 mm Hg .

This calculation is an approximation, because sodium and chloride ions do not behave entirely independently in solution as a result of interionic attraction between them. One can correct for these deviations from the predictions of van't Hoff's law by using a correction factor called the osmotic coefficient. For sodium chloride, the osmotic coefficient is about 0.93 . Therefore, the actual osmolarity of a $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride solution is $308 \times 0.93$, or about 286 $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. For practical reasons, the osmotic coefficients of different solutes are sometimes neglected in determining the osmolarity and osmotic pressures of physiologic solutions.

Osmolarity of Body Fluids. Referring back to Table 25-2, note the approximate osmolarity of the various osmotically active substances in plasma, interstitial fluid, and intracellular fluid. About $80 \%$ of the total osmolarity of the interstitial fluid and plasma is due to sodium and chloride ions, whereas for intracellular fluid, almost half the osmolarity is due to potassium ions, and the remainder is divided among many other intracellular substances.

As shown in Table 25-2, the total osmolarity of each of the three compartments is about $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, with the plasma being about $1 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ greater than that of the interstitial and intracellular fluids. The slight difference between plasma and interstitial fluid is caused by the osmotic effects of the plasma proteins, which maintain

about 20 mm Hg greater pressure in the capillaries than in the surrounding interstitial spaces, as discussed in Chapter 16.

Corrected Osmolar Activity of Body Fluids. At the bottom of Table 25-2 are shown corrected osmolar activities of plasma, interstitial fluid, and intracellular fluid. The reason for these corrections is that cations and anions exert interionic attraction, which can cause a slight decrease in the osmotic activity of the dissolved substances.

## Osmotic Equilibrium Between Intracellular and Extracellular Fluids

High osmotic pressures can develop across the cell membrane with relatively small changes in the concentrations of solutes in the extracellular fluid. As discussed earlier, for each milliosmole concentration gradient of an impermeant solute (one that will not permeate the cell membrane), about 19.3 mm Hg of osmotic pressure is exerted across the cell membrane. If the cell membrane is exposed to pure water, and the osmolarity of intracellular fluid is 282 $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, the potential osmotic pressure that can develop across the cell membrane is more than 5400 mm Hg . This demonstrates the large force that can move water across the cell membrane when the intracellular and extracellular fluids are not in osmotic equilibrium. As a result of these forces, relatively small changes in the concentration of impermeant solutes in the extracellular fluid can cause large changes in cell volume.

Isotonic, Hypotonic, and Hypertonic Fluids. The effects of different concentrations of impermeant solutes in the extracellular fluid on cell volume are shown in Figure 25-5. If a cell is placed in a solution of impermeant solutes having an osmolarity of $282 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, the cells will not
![gu057762836d](gu057762836d.jpg)

Figure 25-5. Effects of isotonic (A), hypertonic (B), and hypotonic (C) solutions on cell volume.
shrink or swell because the water concentration in the intracellular and extracellular fluids is equal, and the solutes cannot enter or leave the cell. Such a solution is said to be isotonic because it neither shrinks nor swells the cells. Examples of isotonic solutions include a $0.9 \%$ solution of sodium chloride or a $5 \%$ glucose solution. These solutions are important in clinical medicine because they can be infused into the blood without the danger of upsetting the osmotic equilibrium between the intracellular and extracellular fluids.

If a cell is placed into a hypotonic solution that has a lower concentration of impermeant solutes ( $<282$ $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ ), water will diffuse into the cell, causing it to swell; water will continue to diffuse into the cell, diluting the intracellular fluid while also concentrating the extracellular fluid until both solutions have about the same osmolarity. Solutions of sodium chloride with a concentration of less than $0.9 \%$ are hypotonic and cause cells to swell.

If a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution having a higher concentration of impermeant solutes, water will flow out of the cell into the extracellular fluid, concentrating the intracellular fluid and diluting the extracellular fluid. In this case, the cell will shrink until the two concentrations become equal. Sodium chloride solutions of more than $0.9 \%$ are hypertonic.

Isosmotic, Hyperosmotic, and Hypo-Osmotic Fluids. The terms isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic refer to whether solutions will cause a change in cell volume. The tonicity of solutions depends on the concentration of impermeant solutes. Some solutes, however, can permeate the cell membrane. Solutions with an osmolarity the same as the cell are called isosmotic, regardless of whether the solute can penetrate the cell membrane.

The terms hyperosmotic and hypo-osmotic refer to solutions that have a higher or lower osmolarity, respectively, compared with the normal extracellular fluid, without regard for whether the solute permeates the cell membrane. Highly permeating substances, such as urea, can cause transient shifts in fluid volume between the intracellular and extracellular fluids but, given enough time, the concentrations of these substances eventually become equal in the two compartments and have little effect on intracellular volume under steady-state conditions.

Osmotic Equilibrium Between Intracellular and Extracellular Fluids Is Rapidly Attained. Transfer of fluid across the cell membrane occurs so rapidly that any differences in osmolarities between these two compartments are usually corrected within seconds or, at the most, minutes. This rapid movement of water across the cell membrane does not mean that complete equilibrium occurs between the intracellular and extracellular compartments throughout the whole body within the same short period. This is because fluid usually enters the body through the gut and must be transported by the blood to all tissues before complete osmotic equilibrium can occur.

The normal state is indicated by the solid lines, and the shifts from normal are shown by the shaded areas. The volumes of intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments are shown in the abscissa of each diagram, and the osmolarities of these compartments are shown on the ordinates.

It usually takes about 30 minutes to achieve osmotic equilibrium everywhere in the body after drinking water.

## VOLUME AND OSMOLALITY OF EXTRACELLULAR AND INTRACELLULAR FLUIDS IN ABNORMAL STATES

Some of the different factors that can cause extracellular and intracellular volumes to change markedly are excess ingestion or renal retention of water, dehydration, intravenous infusion of different types of solutions, loss of large amounts of fluid from the gastrointestinal tract, and loss of abnormal amounts of fluid by sweating or through the kidneys.

The changes in intracellular and extracellular fluid volumes and the types of therapy that should be instituted can be calculated if the following basic principles are kept in mind:

1. Water moves rapidly across cell membranes; therefore, the osmolarities of intracellular and extracellular fluids remain almost exactly equal to each other, except for a few minutes after a change in one of the compartments.
2. Cell membranes are almost completely impermeable to many solutes, such as sodium and chloride; therefore, the number of osmoles in the extracellular or intracellular fluid generally remains relatively constant unless solutes are added to or lost from the extracellular compartment.
With these basic principles in mind, we can analyze the effects of different abnormal fluid conditions on extracellular and intracellular fluid volumes and osmolarities.

## Effect of Adding Saline Solution to the Extracellular Fluid

If isotonic saline is added to the extracellular fluid compartment, the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid does not change. The main effect is an increase in extracellular fluid volume (Figure 25-6A). The sodium and chloride largely remain in the extracellular fluid because the cell membrane behaves as though it were virtually impermeable to the sodium chloride.

If a hypertonic solution is added to the extracellular fluid, the extracellular osmolarity increases and causes osmosis of water out of the cells and into the extracellular compartment (see Figure 25-6B). Again, almost all the added sodium chloride remains in the extracellular compartment, and fluid diffuses from the cells into the extracellular space to achieve osmotic equilibrium. The net effect is an increase in extracellular volume (greater than the volume of fluid added), a decrease in intracellular volume, and a rise in osmolarity in both compartments.

If a hypotonic solution is added to the extracellular fluid, the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid decreases, and some of the extracellular water diffuses into the cells until the intracellular and extracellular compartments have the same osmolarity (see Figure 25-6C). Both the intracellular and extracellular volumes are increased by the addition of hypotonic fluid, although the intracellular volume increases to a greater extent.

Calculation of Fluid Shifts and Osmolarities After Infusion of Hypertonic Saline Solution. We can calculate the sequential effects of infusing different solutions on extracellular and intracellular fluid volumes and osmolarities. For example, if 2 liters of a hypertonic $3.0 \%$

sodium chloride solution were infused into the extracellular fluid compartment of a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ patient whose initial plasma osmolarity is $280 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, what would be the intracellular and extracellular fluid volumes and osmolarities after osmotic equilibrium?

The first step is to calculate the initial conditions, including the volume, concentration, and total milliosmoles in each compartment. Assuming that extracellular fluid volume is $20 \%$ of body weight, and intracellular fluid volume is $40 \%$ of body weight, the following volumes and concentrations can be calculated.

Step 1. Initial Conditions

|  | Volume <br> (liters) | Concentration <br> (mOsm/L) | Total <br> (mOsm) |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Extracellular fluid | 14 | 280 | 3920 |
| Intracellular fluid | 28 | 280 | 7840 |
| Total body fluid | 42 | 280 | 11,760 |

Next, we calculate the total milliosmoles added to the extracellular fluid in 2 liters of $3.0 \%$ sodium chloride. A $3.0 \%$ solution means that there are $3.0 \mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{ml}$, or 30 grams of sodium chloride per liter. Because the molecular weight of sodium chloride is about $58.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$, this means that there is about 0.5128 mole of sodium chloride per liter of solution. For 2 liters of solution, this would be 1.0256 mole of sodium chloride. Because 1 mole of sodium chloride is equal to approximately 2 osmoles (sodium chloride has two osmotically active particles per mole), the net effect of adding 2 liters of this solution is to add 2051 milliosmoles of sodium chloride to the extracellular fluid.

In step 2, we calculate the instantaneous effect of adding 2051 milliosmoles of sodium chloride to the extracellular fluid along with 2 liters of volume. There would be no change in the intracellular fluid concentration or volume, and there would be no osmotic equilibrium. In the extracellular fluid, however, there would be an additional 2051 milliosmoles of total solute, yielding a total of 5971 milliosmoles. Because the extracellular compartment now has 16 liters of volume, the concentration can be calculated by dividing 5971 milliosmoles by 16 liters to yield a concentration of about $373 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. Thus, the following values would occur instantly after adding the solution.

Step 2. Instantaneous Effect of Adding 2 Liters of 3.0\% Sodium Chloride

|  | Volume <br> (liters) | Concentration <br> $(\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L})$ | Total <br> $(\mathrm{mOsm})$ |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Extracellular fluid | 16 | 373 | 5971 |
| Intracellular fluid | 28 | 280 | 7840 |
| Total body fluid | 44 | No equilibrium | 13,811 |

In the third step, we calculate the volumes and concentrations that would be found within a few minutes after
osmotic equilibrium develops. In this case, the concentrations in the intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments would be equal and can be calculated by dividing the total milliosmoles in the body, 13,811 , by the total volume, which is now 44 liters. This calculation yields a concentration of $313.9 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. Therefore, all the body fluid compartments will have this same concentration after osmotic equilibrium. Assuming that no solute or water has been lost from the body, and that there is no movement of sodium chloride into or out of the cells, we then calculate the volumes of the intracellular and extracellular compartments. The intracellular fluid volume is calculated by dividing the total milliosmoles in the intracellular fluid (7840) by the concentration ( $313.9 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ ) to yield a volume of 24.98 liters. Extracellular fluid volume is calculated by dividing the total milliosmoles in extracellular fluid (5971) by the concentration ( $313.9 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ ) to yield a volume of 19.02 liters. Again, these calculations are based on the assumption that the sodium chloride added to the extracellular fluid remains there and does not move into the cells.

Step 3. Effect of Adding 2 Liters of 3.0\% Sodium Chloride After Osmotic Equilibrium

|  | Volume <br> (liters) | Concentration <br> $(\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L})$ | Total <br> $(\mathrm{mOsm})$ |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Extracellular fluid | 19.02 | 313.9 | 5971 |
| Intracellular fluid | 24.98 | 313.9 | 7840 |
| Total body fluid | 44.0 | 313.9 | 13,811 |

Thus, one can see from this example that adding 2 liters of a hypertonic sodium chloride solution causes more than a 5-liter increase in extracellular fluid volume while decreasing intracellular fluid volume by almost 3 liters.

This method of calculating changes in intracellular and extracellular fluid volumes and osmolarities can be applied to virtually any clinical problem of fluid volume regulation. The reader should be familiar with such calculations because an understanding of the mathematical aspects of osmotic equilibrium between intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments is essential for understanding almost all fluid abnormalities of the body and their treatment.

## GLUCOSE AND OTHER SOLUTIONS ADMINISTERED FOR NUTRITIVE PURPOSES

Several types of solutions are administered intravenously to provide nutrition to people who cannot otherwise ingest adequate amounts of nutrition. Glucose solutions are widely used; amino acid and homogenized fat solutions are used to a lesser extent. When these solutions are administered, their concentrations of osmotically active substances are usually adjusted nearly to isotonicity, or

they are given slowly enough that they do not upset the osmotic equilibrium of the body fluids.

After the glucose or other nutrients are metabolized, an excess of water often remains, especially if additional fluid is ingested. Ordinarily, the kidneys excrete this fluid in the form of dilute urine. The net result, therefore, is the addition of only nutrients to the body.

A 5\% glucose solution, which is nearly isosmotic, is often used to treat dehydration. Because the solution is isosmotic, it can be infused intravenously without causing red blood cell swelling, as would occur with an infusion of pure water. Glucose in the solution is rapidly transported into the cells and metabolized. Therefore, infusion of a $5 \%$ glucose solution reduces extracellular fluid osmolarity and therefore helps correct the increase in extracellular fluid osmolarity associated with dehydration.

## CLINICAL ABNORMALITIES OF FLUID VOLUME REGULATION: HYPONATREMIA AND HYPERNATREMIA

A measurement that is readily available to the clinician for evaluating a patient's fluid status is the plasma sodium concentration. Plasma osmolarity is not routinely measured but, because sodium and its associated anions (mainly chloride) account for more than $90 \%$ of the solute in the extracellular fluid, plasma sodium concentration is a reasonable indicator of plasma osmolarity under many conditions. When plasma sodium concentration is reduced more than a few milliequivalents below normal (about $142 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ), a person is said to have hyponatremia. When plasma sodium concentration is elevated above normal, a person is said to have hypernatremia.

## Causes of Hyponatremia: Excess Water or Loss of Sodium

Decreased plasma sodium concentration can result from loss of sodium from the extracellular fluid or addition of excess water to the extracellular fluid (Table 25-4). A primary loss of sodium usually results in hyponatremia and dehydration and is associated with decreased extracellular
fluid volume. Conditions that can cause hyponatremia as a result of the loss of sodium include diarrhea and vomiting. Overuse of diuretics that inhibit the ability of the kidneys to conserve sodium and certain types of sodium-wasting kidney diseases can also cause modest degrees of hyponatremia. Addison disease, which results from decreased secretion of the hormone aldosterone, impairs the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb sodium and can cause a modest degree of hyponatremia.

Hyponatremia can also be associated with excess water retention, which dilutes the sodium in the extracellular fluid, a condition referred to as hyponatremiaoverhydration. For example, excessive secretion of antidiuretic hormone $(\mathrm{ADH})$, which increases water reabsorption by the kidney tubules, can lead to hyponatremia and overhydration.

## Hyponatremia Causes Cell Edema

Rapid changes in cell volume as a result of hyponatremia can have profound effects on tissue and organ function, especially the brain. A rapid reduction in plasma sodium concentration, for example, can cause brain cell edema and neurological symptoms, including headache, nausea, lethargy, and disorientation. If plasma sodium concentration rapidly falls below 115 to $120 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, brain swelling may lead to seizures, coma, permanent brain damage, and death. Because the skull is rigid, the brain cannot increase its volume by more than about $10 \%$ without it being forced down the neck (herniation), which can lead to permanent brain injury and death.

When hyponatremia evolves more slowly, over several days, the brain and other tissues respond by transporting sodium, chloride, potassium, and organic solutes, such as glutamate, from the cells into the extracellular compartment. This response attenuates osmotic flow of water into the cells and swelling of the tissues (Figure 25-7).

Transport of solutes from the cells during slowly developing hyponatremia, however, can make the brain vulnerable to injury if the hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly. When hypertonic solutions are added too rapidly to correct hyponatremia, this intervention can outpace the brain's ability to recapture the solutes lost from the

Figure 25-7. Brain cell volume regulation during hyponatremia. During acute hyponatremia, caused by loss of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or excess $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, there is diffusion of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ into the cells (1) and swelling of the brain tissue (indicated by the dashed lines). This process stimulates transport of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and organic solutes out of the cells (2), which then causes water diffusion out of the cells (3). With chronic hyponatremia, the brain swelling is attenuated by transport of solutes from the cells.
cells and may lead to osmotic injury of the neurons that is associated with demyelination, a loss of the myelin sheath from nerves. This osmosis-mediated demyelination of neurons can be avoided by limiting the correction of chronic hyponatremia to less than 10 to $12 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ in 24 hours and to less than $18 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ in 48 hours. This slow rate of correction permits the brain to recover the osmoles that were lost from the cells as a result of adaptation to chronic hyponatremia.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice and may occur in up to $15 \%$ to $25 \%$ of hospitalized patients.

## Causes of Hypernatremia: Water Loss or Excess Sodium

An increased plasma sodium concentration, which also causes increased osmolarity, can be due to loss of water from the extracellular fluid, which concentrates the sodium ions, or excess sodium in the extracellular fluid. Primary loss of water from the extracellular fluid results in hypernatremia and dehydration. This condition can occur from an inability to secrete ADH , which is needed for the kidneys to conserve water. As a result of lack of ADH , the kidneys excrete large amounts of dilute urine (a disorder referred to as central diabetes insipidus), causing dehydration and increased concentration of sodium chloride in the extracellular fluid. In certain types of renal diseases, the kidneys cannot respond to ADH , causing a type of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. A more common cause of hypernatremia associated with decreased extracellular fluid volume is simple dehydration caused by water intake that is less than water loss, as can occur with sweating during prolonged heavy exercise.

Hypernatremia can also occur when excessive sodium chloride is added to the extracellular fluid. This often results in hypernatremia-overhydration because excess extracellular sodium chloride is also usually associated with at least some degree of water retention by the kidneys. For example, excessive secretion of the sodiumretaining hormone aldosterone can cause a mild degree of hypernatremia and overhydration. The reason that the hypernatremia is not more severe is that the sodium retention also stimulates secretion of ADH and causes the kidneys to reabsorb greater amounts of water.

Thus, in analyzing abnormalities of plasma sodium concentration and deciding on proper therapy, one should first determine whether the abnormality is caused by a primary loss or gain of sodium or a primary loss or gain of water.

## Hypernatremia Causes Cell Shrinkage

Hypernatremia is much less common than hyponatremia and severe symptoms usually occur only with rapid and large increases in the plasma sodium concentration above 158 to $160 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$. Hypernatremia usually promotes intense thirst and stimulates secretion of ADH , which both protect against a large increase in plasma and extracellular fluid sodium, as discussed in Chapter 29. However, severe hypernatremia can occur in patients with hypothalamic lesions that impair their sense of thirst, in infants who may not have ready access to water, in older patients with altered mental status, or in persons with diabetes insipidus.

Correction of hypernatremia can be achieved by administering a hypo-osmotic sodium chloride or dextrose solution. However, it is prudent to correct the

hypernatremia slowly in patients who have had chronic increases in their plasma sodium concentration because hypernatremia also activates defense mechanisms that protect the cell from changes in volume. These defenses are the opposite of those that occur for hyponatremia and consist of mechanisms that increase the intracellular concentration of sodium and other solutes.

## EDEMA: EXCESS FLUID IN THE TISSUES

Edema refers to the presence of excess fluid in the body tissues. In many cases, edema occurs mainly in the extracellular fluid compartment, but it can also involve intracellular fluid accumulation.

## INTRACELLULAR EDEMA

Three conditions are especially prone to cause intracellular swelling: (1) hyponatremia, as discussed earlier; (2) depression of the metabolic systems of the tissues; and (3) lack of adequate nutrition to the cells. For example, when blood flow to a tissue is decreased, the delivery of oxygen and nutrients is reduced. If blood flow becomes too low to maintain normal tissue metabolism, the cell membrane ionic pumps become depressed, and sodium ions that normally leak into the interior of the cell can no longer be pumped out of the cells. The excess intracellular sodium ions then cause osmosis of water into the cells. Sometimes this process can increase intracellular volume of a tissue area-even of an entire ischemic leg, for example-to two to three times normal. When such an increase in intracellular volume occurs, it is usually a prelude to death of the tissue.

Intracellular edema can also occur in inflamed tissues. Inflammation usually increases cell membrane permeability, allowing sodium and other ions to diffuse into the interior of the cell, with subsequent osmosis of water into the cells.

## EXTRACELLULAR EDEMA

Extracellular edema occurs when excess fluid accumulates in the extracellular spaces. There are two general causes of extracellular edema: (1) abnormal leakage of fluid from the plasma to the interstitial spaces across the capillaries; and (2) failure of the lymphatics to return fluid from the interstitium back into the blood, often called lymphedema. The most common clinical cause of interstitial fluid accumulation is excessive capillary fluid filtration.

## Factors That Can Increase Capillary Filtration

To understand the causes of excessive capillary filtration, it is useful to review the determinants of capillary filtration discussed in Chapter 16. Mathematically, the capillary filtration rate can be expressed as follows:

Filtration $=\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}} \times\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{c}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{if}}-\pi_{\mathrm{c}}+\pi_{\mathrm{if}}\right)$
where $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ is the capillary filtration coefficient (the product of the permeability and surface area of the capillaries), $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{c}}$ is the capillary hydrostatic pressure, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{if}}$ is the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure, $\pi_{\mathrm{c}}$ is the capillary plasma colloid osmotic pressure, and $\pi_{\mathrm{if}}$ is the interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure. From this equation, one can see that any one of the following changes can increase the capillary filtration rate:

- Increased capillary filtration coefficient
- Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure
- Decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure


## Lymphedema-Failure of Lymph Vessels to Return Fluid and Protein to the Blood

When lymphatic function is greatly impaired as a result of blockage or loss of the lymph vessels, edema can become especially severe because plasma proteins that leak into the interstitium cannot be removed in any other way. The rise in protein concentration raises the colloid osmotic pressure of interstitial fluid, which draws even more fluid out of the capillaries.

Blockage of lymph flow can be especially severe with infections of the lymph nodes, such as occurs with infection by filarial nematodes (Wuchereria bancrofti), which are microscopic threadlike worms. The adult worms live in the human lymph system and are spread from person to person by mosquitoes. People with filarial infections can have severe lymphedema and elephantiasis and men can have swelling of the scrotum, called hydrocele. Lymphatic filariasis affects more than 120 million people in 80 countries throughout the tropics and subtropics of Asia, Africa, the Western Pacific, and parts of the Caribbean and South America.

Lymphedema can also occur in persons who have certain types of cancer or after surgery in which lymph vessels are removed or obstructed. For example, large numbers of lymph vessels are removed during a radical mastectomy, impairing the removal of protein and fluid from the breast and arm areas and causing edema and swelling of the tissue spaces. A few lymph vessels eventually regrow after this type of surgery; thus, the interstitial edema is usually temporary.

## Summary of Causes of Extracellular Edema

A large number of conditions can cause fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces by abnormal leaking of fluid from the capillaries or by preventing the lymphatics from returning fluid from the interstitium back to the circulation. The following is a partial list of conditions that can cause extracellular edema by these two types of abnormalities:
I. Increased capillary pressure

E. Prolonged ischemia
F. Burns
IV. Blockage of lymph return
A. Cancer
B. Infections (e.g., filarial nematodes)
C. Surgery
D. Congenital absence or abnormality of lymphatic vessels

Edema Caused by Heart Failure. One of the most serious and common causes of edema is heart failure, which was discussed in Chapter 22. In heart failure, the heart fails to pump blood normally from the veins into the arteries, which raises venous and capillary pressures, causing increased capillary filtration. In addition, the arterial pressure tends to fall, causing decreased excretion of salt and water by the kidneys, which causes still more edema. Also, blood flow to the kidneys is reduced in persons with heart failure, and this reduced blood flow stimulates secretion of renin, causing increased formation of angiotensin II and aldosterone, which both cause additional salt and water retention by the kidneys. In advanced heart failure, increased secretion of ADH stimulates water reabsorption by the renal tubules, leading to hyponatremia as well as intracellular and extracellular edema. Thus, in persons with untreated heart failure, all these factors acting together can cause serious generalized edema.

In patients with left-sided heart failure but without significant failure of the right side of the heart, blood is pumped into the lungs normally by the right side of the heart but cannot escape easily from the pulmonary veins
to the left side of the heart because this part of the heart has been greatly weakened. Consequently, all the pulmonary vascular pressures, including pulmonary capillary pressure, rise far above normal, causing serious and lifethreatening pulmonary edema. When untreated, fluid accumulation in the lungs can rapidly progress, causing death within a few hours.

## Edema Caused by Decreased Kidney Excretion of Salt

and Water. Most sodium chloride added to the blood remains in the extracellular compartment, and only a small amount enters the cells. Therefore, in kidney diseases that compromise urinary excretion of salt and water, large amounts of sodium chloride and water are added to the extracellular fluid. Most of this salt and water leaks from the blood into the interstitial spaces, but some remains in the blood. The main effects of this are as follows: (1) widespread increases in interstitial fluid volume (extracellular edema); and (2) hypertension because of the increase in blood volume, as explained in Chapter 19. As an example, in children who have acute glomerulonephritis, in which the renal glomeruli are injured by inflammation and therefore fail to filter adequate amounts of fluid, serious extracellular fluid edema also develops; along with the edema, severe hypertension usually develops.

Edema Caused by Decreased Plasma Proteins. Failure to produce normal amounts of proteins or leakage of proteins from the plasma causes the plasma colloid osmotic pressure to fall. This leads to increased capillary filtration throughout the body and extracellular edema.

One of the most important causes of decreased plasma protein concentration is loss of proteins in the urine in certain kidney diseases, a condition referred to as nephrotic syndrome. Multiple types of renal diseases can damage the membranes of the renal glomeruli, causing the membranes to become leaky to the plasma proteins and often allowing large quantities of these proteins to pass into the urine. When this loss exceeds the ability of the body to synthesize proteins, a reduction in plasma protein concentration occurs. Serious generalized edema occurs when the plasma protein concentration falls below $2.5 \mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{ml}$.

Cirrhosis of the liver is another condition that reduces plasma protein concentration. Cirrhosis means the development of large amounts of fibrous tissue among the liver parenchymal cells. One result is failure of these cells to produce sufficient plasma proteins, leading to decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure and the generalized edema that accompanies this condition.

Another way that cirrhosis causes edema is that the liver fibrosis sometimes compresses the abdominal portal venous drainage vessels as they pass through the liver before emptying back into the general circulation. Blockage of this portal venous outflow raises capillary hydrostatic pressure throughout the gastrointestinal area and further increases fluid filtration out of the plasma into

the intra-abdominal areas. When this occurs, the combined effects of decreased plasma protein concentration and high portal capillary pressures cause transudation of large amounts of fluid and protein into the abdominal cavity, a condition referred to as ascites.

## SAFETY FACTORS THAT NORMALLY PREVENT EDEMA

Even though many disturbances can cause edema, the abnormality must usually be severe before serious edema develops. The reason the abnormality must be severe is that three major safety factors prevent excessive fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces: (1) low compliance of the interstitium when interstitial fluid pressure is in the negative pressure range; (2) the ability of lymph flow to increase 10 - to 50 -fold; and (3) washdown of the interstitial fluid protein concentration, which reduces interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure as capillary filtration increases.

## Safety Factor Caused by Low Compliance of the Interstitium in the Negative Pressure Range

In Chapter 16, we noted that interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure in loose subcutaneous tissues of the body is slightly less than atmospheric pressure, averaging about -3 mm Hg . This slight suction in the tissues helps hold the tissues together. Figure 25-8 shows the approximate
![gu087762836d](gu087762836d.jpg)

Figure 25-8. Relationship between interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure and interstitial fluid volumes, including total volume, free fluid volume, and gel fluid volume, for loose tissues such as skin. Note that significant amounts of free fluid occur only when the interstitial fluid pressure becomes positive. (Modified from Guyton AC, Granger HJ, Taylor AE: Interstitial fluid pressure. Physiol Rev 51:527, 1971.)
relationships between different levels of interstitial fluid pressure and interstitial fluid volume, as extrapolated to people from animal studies. Note in Figure 25-8 that as long as the interstitial fluid pressure is in the negative range, small changes in interstitial fluid volume are associated with relatively large changes in interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure. Therefore, in the negative pressure range, the compliance of the tissues, defined as the change in volume per millimeter of Hg pressure change, is low.

How does the low compliance of the tissues in the negative pressure range act as a safety factor against edema? To answer this question, recall the determinants of capillary filtration discussed previously. When interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure increases, this increased pressure tends to oppose further capillary filtration. Therefore, as long as the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure is in the negative pressure range, small increases in interstitial fluid volume cause relatively large increases in interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure, opposing further filtration of fluid into the tissues.

Because the normal interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure is -3 mm Hg , the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure must increase by about 3 mm Hg before large amounts of fluid will begin to accumulate in the tissues. Therefore, the safety factor against edema is a change of interstitial fluid pressure of about 3 mm Hg . In the positive tissue pressure range, this safety factor against edema is lost because of the large increase in compliance of the tissues.

Importance of Interstitial Gel in Preventing Fluid Accumulation in the Interstitium. Note in Figure 25-8 that in normal tissues with negative interstitial fluid pressure, virtually all the fluid in the interstitium is in gel form. That is, the fluid is bound in a proteoglycan meshwork so that there are virtually no free fluid spaces larger than a few hundredths of a micrometer in diameter. The importance of the gel is that it prevents fluid from flowing easily through the tissues because of impediment from the brush pile of trillions of proteoglycan filaments. Also, when the interstitial fluid pressure falls to very negative values, the gel does not contract very much because the meshwork of proteoglycan filaments offers an elastic resistance to compression. In the negative fluid pressure range, the interstitial fluid volume does not change much, regardless of whether the degree of suction is only a few mm Hg negative pressure or 10 to 20 mm Hg negative pressure. In other words, the compliance of the tissues is very low in the negative pressure range.

By contrast, when interstitial fluid pressure rises to the positive pressure range, there is a tremendous accumulation of free fluid in the tissues. In this pressure range, the tissues are compliant, allowing large amounts of fluid to accumulate, with relatively small additional increases in interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure. Most of the extra fluid that accumulates is free fluid because it pushes the brush pile of proteoglycan filaments apart. Therefore, the

fluid can flow freely through the tissue spaces because it is not in gel form. When this free flow of fluid occurs, the edema is said to be pitting edema because one can press the thumb against the tissue area and push the fluid out of the area. When the thumb is removed, a pit is left in the skin for a few seconds until the fluid flows back from the surrounding tissues. This type of edema is distinguished from nonpitting edema, which occurs when the tissue cells swell instead of the interstitium or when the fluid in the interstitium becomes clotted with fibrinogen so that it cannot move freely within the tissue spaces.

## Importance of Proteoglycan Filaments as a Spacer for Cells and in Preventing Rapid Flow of Fluid in Tissues.

The proteoglycan filaments, along with much larger collagen fibrils in the interstitial spaces, act as a spacer between the cells. Nutrients and ions do not diffuse readily through cell membranes; therefore, without adequate spacing between the cells, these nutrients, electrolytes, and cell waste products cannot be rapidly exchanged between the blood capillaries and cells located at a distance from one another.

The proteoglycan filaments also prevent fluid from flowing too easily through the tissue spaces. If it were not for the proteoglycan filaments, the simple act of a person standing up would cause large amounts of interstitial fluid to flow from the upper body to the lower body. When too much fluid accumulates in the interstitium, as occurs in edema, this extra fluid creates large channels that allow the fluid to flow readily through the interstitium. Therefore, when severe edema occurs in the legs, the edema fluid often can be decreased by simply elevating the legs.

Even though fluid does not flow easily through the tissues in the presence of the compacted proteoglycan filaments, different substances within the fluid can diffuse through the tissues at least $95 \%$ as easily as they normally diffuse. Therefore, the usual diffusion of nutrients to the cells and the removal of waste products from the cells are not compromised by the proteoglycan filaments of the interstitium.

## Increased Lymph Flow as a Safety Factor Against Edema

A major function of the lymphatic system is to return the fluid and proteins filtered from the capillaries into the interstitium to the circulation. Without this continuous return of the filtered proteins and fluid to the blood, the plasma volume would be rapidly depleted, and interstitial edema would occur.

The lymphatics act as a safety factor against edema because lymph flow can increase 10 - to 50 -fold when fluid begins to accumulate in the tissues. This increased lymph flow allows the lymphatics to carry away large amounts of fluid and proteins in response to increased capillary filtration, preventing the interstitial pressure from rising into the positive pressure range. The safety factor caused by increased lymph flow has been calculated to be about 7 mm Hg .

## Washdown of Interstitial Fluid Protein as a Safety Factor Against Edema

As increased amounts of fluid are filtered into the interstitium, the interstitial fluid pressure increases, causing increased lymph flow. In most tissues, the protein concentration of the interstitium decreases as lymph flow is increased because larger amounts of protein are carried away than can be filtered out of the capillaries. The reason for this phenomenon is that the capillaries are relatively impermeable to proteins compared with the lymph vessels. Therefore, the proteins are washed out of the interstitial fluid as lymph flow increases.

Because the interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure caused by the proteins tends to draw fluid out of the capillaries, decreasing the interstitial fluid proteins lowers the net filtration force across the capillaries and tends to prevent further accumulation of fluid. The safety factor from this effect has been calculated to be about 7 mm Hg .

## SUMMARY OF SAFETY FACTORS THAT PREVENT EDEMA

Putting together all the safety factors against edema, we find the following:

1. The safety factor caused by low tissue compliance in the negative pressure range is about 3 mm Hg .
2. The safety factor caused by increased lymph flow is about 7 mm Hg .
3. The safety factor caused by washdown of proteins from the interstitial spaces is about 7 mm Hg .
Therefore, the total safety factor against edema is about 17 mm Hg . This means that the capillary pressure in a peripheral tissue could theoretically rise by 17 mm Hg , or approximately double the normal value, before marked edema would occur.

## FLUIDS IN POTENTIAL SPACES OF THE BODY

Some examples of potential spaces are the pleural, pericardial, peritoneal, and synovial cavities, including both the joint cavities and the bursae. Virtually all these potential spaces have surfaces that almost touch each other, with only a thin layer of fluid in between, and the surfaces slide over each other. To facilitate the sliding, a viscous proteinaceous fluid lubricates the surfaces.

Fluid Is Exchanged Between Capillaries and Potential Spaces. The surface membrane of a potential space usually does not offer significant resistance to the passage of fluids, electrolytes, or even proteins, which all move back and forth between the space and interstitial fluid in the surrounding tissue with relative ease. Therefore, each potential space is in reality a large tissue space. Consequently, fluid in the capillaries adjacent to the potential space diffuses not only into the interstitial fluid but also into the potential space.

## Lymphatic Vessels Drain Protein From the Potential

Spaces. Proteins collect in the potential spaces because of leakage out of the capillaries, similar to the collection of protein in the interstitial spaces throughout the body. The protein must be removed through lymphatics or other channels and returned to the circulation. Each potential space is directly or indirectly connected with lymph vessels. In some cases, such as the pleural cavity and peritoneal cavity, large lymph vessels arise directly from the cavity itself.

## Edema Fluid in the Potential Spaces Is Called Effusion.

When edema occurs in the subcutaneous tissues adjacent to the potential space, edema fluid usually collects in the potential space as well; this fluid is called effusion. Thus, lymph blockage or any of the multiple abnormalities that can cause excessive capillary filtration can cause effusion in the same way that interstitial edema is caused. The abdominal cavity is especially prone to collect effusion fluid, and in this case, the effusion is called ascites. In serious cases, 20 liters or more of ascitic fluid can accumulate.

The other potential spaces, such as the pleural cavity, pericardial cavity, and joint spaces, can become seriously swollen when generalized edema is present. Also, injury or local infection in any one of the cavities often blocks the lymph drainage, causing isolated swelling in the cavity.

The dynamics of fluid exchange in the pleural cavity are discussed in detail in Chapter 39. These dynamics are mainly representative of all the other potential spaces as well. The normal fluid pressure in most or all of the potential spaces in the nonedematous state is negative in the same way that this pressure is negative (subatmospheric) in loose subcutaneous tissue. For example, the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure is normally about -7 to -8 mm Hg in the pleural cavity, -3 to -5 mm Hg in
the joint spaces, and -5 to -6 mm Hg in the pericardial cavity.

# The Urinary System: Functional Anatomy and Urine Formation by the Kidneys 

## MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS OF THE KIDNEYS

Most people are familiar with one important function of the kidneys-to rid the body of waste materials that are ingested or produced by metabolism. A second function that is especially critical is to control the volume and electrolyte composition of the body fluids. For water and virtually all electrolytes in the body, the balance between intake (due to ingestion or metabolic production) and output (due to excretion or metabolic consumption) is maintained largely by the kidneys. This regulatory function of the kidneys maintains the stable internal environment necessary for the cells to perform their various activities.

The kidneys perform their most critical functions by filtering the plasma and removing substances from the filtrate at variable rates, depending on the needs of the body. Ultimately, the kidneys clear unwanted substances from the filtrate (and therefore from the blood) by excreting them in the urine while returning substances that are needed back to the blood.

Although this chapter and the next few chapters focus mainly on the control of renal excretion of water, electrolytes, and metabolic waste products, the kidneys serve many important homeostatic functions, including the following:

- Excretion of metabolic waste products and foreign chemicals
- Regulation of water and electrolyte balances
- Regulation of body fluid osmolality and electrolyte concentrations
- Regulation of arterial pressure
- Regulation of acid-base balance
- Regulation of erythrocyte production
- Secretion, metabolism, and excretion of hormones
- Gluconeogenesis

Excretion of Metabolic Waste Products, Foreign Chemicals, Drugs, and Hormone Metabolites. The kidneys are the primary means for eliminating most of the waste products of metabolism that are no longer needed by the body. These products include urea (from the metabolism of amino acids), creatinine (from muscle
creatine), uric acid (from nucleic acids), end products of hemoglobin breakdown (e.g., bilirubin), and metabolites of various hormones. These waste products must be eliminated from the body as rapidly as they are produced. The kidneys also eliminate most toxins and other foreign substances that are produced by the body or ingested, such as pesticides, drugs, and food additives.

Regulation of Water and Electrolyte Balances. For maintenance of homeostasis, excretion of water and electrolytes must match intake precisely. If intake exceeds excretion, the amount of that substance in the body will increase. If intake is less than excretion, the amount of that substance in the body will decrease. Although temporary (or cyclic) imbalances of water and electrolytes may occur in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions associated with altered intake or renal excretion, the maintenance of life depends on restoration of water and electrolyte balance.

Intake of water and many electrolytes is usually governed by a person's eating and drinking habits, requiring the kidneys to adjust their excretion rates to match the intakes of various substances. Figure 26-1 shows the response of the kidneys to a sudden 10 -fold increase in sodium intake from a low level of $30 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day to a high level of $300 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day. Within 2 to 3 days after raising the sodium intake, renal excretion also increases to about 300 $\mathrm{mEq} /$ day so that the balance between intake and output is rapidly re-established. However, during the 2 to 3 days of renal adaptation to the high sodium intake, there is a modest accumulation of sodium that raises extracellular fluid volume slightly and triggers hormonal changes and other compensatory responses that signal the kidneys to increase their sodium excretion.

The capability of the kidneys to alter sodium excretion in response to changes in sodium intake is tremendous. Experimental studies have shown that in many people, sodium intake can be increased to $1500 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day (more than 10 times normal) or decreased to $10 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day ( $<0.1$ of normal), with relatively small changes in extracellular fluid volume or plasma sodium concentration. This phenomenon is also true for water and for most

Figure 26-1. Effect of increasing sodium intake 10 -fold (from 30 to $300 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day) on urinary sodium excretion and extracellular fluid volume. The shaded areas represent the net sodium retention or net sodium loss, determined by the difference between sodium intake and sodium excretion.
other electrolytes, such as chloride, potassium, calcium, hydrogen, magnesium, and phosphate ions. In the next few chapters, we discuss the specific mechanisms that permit the kidneys to perform these amazing feats of homeostasis.

Regulation of Arterial Pressure. As discussed in Chapter 19, the kidneys play a dominant role in longterm regulation of arterial pressure by excreting variable amounts of sodium and water. The kidneys also contribute to short-term arterial pressure regulation by secreting hormones and vasoactive factors or substances (e.g., renin) that lead to the formation of vasoactive products (e.g., angiotensin II).

Regulation of Acid-Base Balance. The kidneys contribute to acid-base regulation, along with the lungs and body fluid buffers, by excreting acids and by regulating the body fluid buffer stores. The kidneys are the only means of eliminating certain types of acids from the body, such as sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, which are generated by the metabolism of proteins.

Regulation of Erythrocyte Production. The kidneys secrete erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells by hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, as discussed in Chapter 33. One important stimulus for erythropoietin secretion by the kidneys is hypoxia. The kidneys normally account for almost all the erythropoietin secreted into the circulation. In people with severe kidney disease or who have had their kidneys removed and have been placed on hemodialysis, severe anemia develops as a result of decreased erythropoietin production.

Regulation of 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ Production. The kidneys produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ (calcitriol), the active form of vitamin D, by hydroxylating this vitamin at the "number 1" position. Calcitriol is essential for normal calcium deposition in bone and calcium reabsorption by the gastrointestinal tract. As discussed in Chapter 80, calcitriol plays an important role in calcium and phosphate regulation.

Glucose Synthesis. The kidneys synthesize glucose from amino acids and other precursors during prolonged fasting, a process referred to as gluconeogenesis. The kidneys' capacity to add glucose to the blood during prolonged periods of fasting rivals that of the liver.

With chronic kidney disease or acute failure of the kidneys, these homeostatic functions are disrupted, and severe abnormalities of body fluid volumes and composition rapidly occur. With complete renal failure, enough potassium, acids, fluid, and other substances accumulate in the body to cause death within a few days unless clinical interventions such as hemodialysis are initiated to restore, at least partially, the body fluid and electrolyte balances.

## PHYSIOLOGIC ANATOMY OF THE KIDNEYS

## GENERAL ORGANIZATION OF THE KIDNEYS AND URINARY TRACT

The two kidneys lie on the posterior wall of the abdomen, outside the peritoneal cavity (Figure 26-2). Each kidney of the adult human weighs about 150 grams and is about the size of a clenched fist. The medial side of each kidney contains an indented region called the hilum through which pass the renal artery and vein, lymphatics, nerve supply, and ureter, which carries the final urine from the kidney to the bladder, where it is stored until the bladder is emptied. The kidney is surrounded by a tough fibrous capsule that protects its delicate inner structures.

If the kidney is bisected from top to bottom, the two major regions that can be visualized are the outer cortex and the inner medulla regions. The medulla is divided into 8 to 10 cone-shaped masses of tissue called renal pyramids. The base of each pyramid originates at the border between the cortex and medulla and terminates in the papilla, which projects into the space of the renal pelvis, a funnel-shaped continuation of the upper end of the ureter. The outer border of the pelvis is divided into open-ended pouches called major calyces that extend downward and divide into minor calyces, which collect urine from the tubules of each papilla. The walls of the calyces, pelvis, and ureter contain contractile elements that propel the urine toward the bladder, where urine is stored until it is emptied by micturition, discussed later in this chapter.

![gu107762836d](gu107762836d.jpg)

Figure 26-2. General organization of the kidneys and the urinary system.

## RENAL BLOOD SUPPLY

Blood flow to the two kidneys is normally about $22 \%$ of the cardiac output, or $1100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. The renal artery enters the kidney through the hilum and then branches progressively to form the interlobar arteries, arcuate arteries, interlobular arteries (also called radial arteries), and afferent arterioles, which lead to the glomerular capillaries, where large amounts of fluid and solutes (except the plasma proteins) are filtered to begin urine formation (Figure 26-3). The distal ends of the capillaries of each glomerulus coalesce to form the efferent arteriole, which leads to a second capillary network, the peritubular capillaries, that surrounds the renal tubules.

The renal circulation is unique in having two capillary beds, the glomerular and peritubular capillaries, which are arranged in series and are separated by the efferent arterioles. These arterioles help regulate the hydrostatic pressure in both sets of capillaries. High hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries ( $\approx 60 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) causes rapid fluid filtration, whereas a much lower hydrostatic pressure in the peritubular capillaries ( $\approx 13 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) permits rapid fluid reabsorption. By adjusting the resistance of the afferent and efferent arterioles, the kidneys can regulate the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular and the peritubular capillaries, thereby changing the rate of glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, or both in response to the body's homeostatic demands.

The peritubular capillaries empty into the vessels of the venous system, which run parallel to the arteriolar vessels. The blood vessels of the venous system progressively form the interlobular vein, arcuate vein, interlobar vein, and renal vein, which leaves the kidney beside the renal artery and ureter.

## THE NEPHRON IS THE FUNCTIONAL UNIT OF THE KIDNEY

Each human kidney contains about 800,000 to 1,000,000 nephrons, each of which is capable of forming urine.

The kidney cannot regenerate new nephrons. Therefore, with renal injury, disease, or normal aging, the number of nephrons gradually decreases. After age 40 years, the number of functioning nephrons usually decreases about $10 \%$ every 10 years; thus, at age 80 years, many people have $40 \%$ fewer functioning nephrons than they did at age 40 years. This loss is not life-threatening because adaptive changes in the remaining nephrons allow them to excrete the proper amounts of water, electrolytes, and waste products, as discussed in Chapter 32.

Each nephron contains (1) a tuft of glomerular capillaries called the glomerulus, through which large amounts of fluid are filtered from the blood, and (2) a long tubule in which the filtered fluid is converted into urine on its way to the pelvis of the kidney (see Figure 26-3).

The glomerulus contains a network of branching and anastomosing glomerular capillaries that, compared with other capillaries, have high hydrostatic pressure ( $\approx 60 \mathrm{~mm}$ Hg ). The glomerular capillaries are covered by epithelial cells, and the total glomerulus is encased in Bowman's capsule.

Fluid filtered from the glomerular capillaries flows into Bowman's capsule and then into the proximal tubule, which lies in the cortex of the kidney (Figure 26-4). From the proximal tubule, fluid flows into the loop of Henle, which dips into the renal medulla. Each loop consists of a descending and an ascending limb. The walls of the descending limb and lower end of the ascending limb are very thin and therefore are called the thin segment of the loop of Henle. After the ascending limb of the loop returns partway back to the cortex, its wall becomes much thicker; this segment is referred to as the thick segment of the ascending limb.

At the end of the thick ascending limb is a short segment that has in its wall a plaque of specialized epithelial cells, known as the macula densa. As discussed later, the macula densa plays an important role

![gu117762836d](gu117762836d.jpg)

Figure 26-3. Section of the human kidney showing the major vessels that supply the blood flow to the kidney and a schematic of the microcirculation of each nephron.
in controlling nephron function. Beyond the macula densa, fluid enters the distal tubule, which, like the proximal tubule, lies in the renal cortex. The distal tubule is followed by the connecting tubule and cortical collecting tubule, which lead to the cortical collecting duct. The initial parts of 8 to 10 cortical collecting ducts join to form a single, larger collecting duct that runs downward into the medulla and becomes the medullary collecting duct. The collecting ducts merge to form progressively larger ducts that eventually empty into the renal pelvis through the tips of the renal papillae. In each kidney, there are about 250 of these very large collecting ducts, each of which collects urine from about 4000 nephrons.
![gu127762836d](gu127762836d.jpg)

Figure 26-4. Basic tubular segments of the nephron. The relative lengths of the different tubular segments are not drawn to scale.

Regional Differences in Nephron Structure: Cortical and Juxtamedullary Nephrons. Although each nephron has all the components described earlier, there are some differences, depending on how deep the nephron lies within the kidney mass. The nephrons that have glomeruli located in the outer cortex are called cortical nephrons; they have short loops of Henle that penetrate only a short distance into the medulla (Figure 26-5).

About $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ of the nephrons have glomeruli that lie deep in the renal cortex near the medulla and are called juxtamedullary nephrons. These nephrons have long loops of Henle that dip deeply into the medulla, in some cases all the way to the tips of the renal papillae.

The vascular structures supplying the juxtamedullary nephrons also differ from those supplying the cortical nephrons. For the cortical nephrons, the entire tubular system is surrounded by an extensive network of peritubular capillaries. For the juxtamedullary nephrons, long efferent arterioles extend from the glomeruli down into the outer medulla and then divide into specialized peritubular capillaries called vasa recta, which extend downward into the medulla, lying side by side with the loops of Henle. Like the loops of Henle, the vasa recta return toward the cortex and empty into the cortical veins. This specialized network of capillaries in the medulla plays an essential role in the formation of a concentrated urine, discussed in Chapter 29.

## MICTURITION

Micturition is the process whereby the urinary bladder empties when it becomes filled. This process involves two main steps. First, the bladder fills progressively until the tension in its walls rises above a threshold level. This tension elicits the second step, which is a nervous reflex called the micturition reflex that empties the bladder or,

if this fails, at least causes a conscious desire to urinate. Although the micturition reflex is an autonomic spinal cord reflex, it can also be inhibited or facilitated by centers in the cerebral cortex or brain stem.

## PHYSIOLOGIC ANATOMY OF THE BLADDER

The urinary bladder, shown in Figure 26-6, is a smooth muscle chamber composed of two main parts: (1) the body, which is the major part of the bladder in which urine collects; and (2) the neck, which is a funnel-shaped extension of the body, passing inferiorly and anteriorly into the urogenital triangle and connecting with the urethra. The lower part of the bladder neck is also called the posterior urethra because of its relationship to the urethra.

The smooth muscle of the bladder is called the detrusor muscle. Its muscle fibers extend in all directions and, when contracted, can increase the pressure in the bladder to 40 to 60 mm Hg . Thus, contraction of the detrusor muscle is a major step in emptying the bladder. Smooth muscle cells of the detrusor muscle fuse with one another so that low-resistance electrical pathways exist from one muscle cell to the other. Therefore, an action potential can spread throughout the detrusor muscle, from one muscle cell to the next, to cause contraction of the entire bladder at once.

On the posterior wall of the bladder, lying immediately above the bladder neck, is a small triangular area called the trigone. At the lowermost apex of the trigone, the bladder neck opens into the posterior urethra, and the two ureters enter the bladder at the uppermost angles of the trigone. The trigone can be identified by the fact that its mucosa, the inner lining of the bladder, is smooth, in contrast to the remaining bladder mucosa, which is folded to form rugae.

Each ureter, as it enters the bladder, courses obliquely through the detrusor muscle and then passes another 1 to 2 centimeters beneath the bladder mucosa before emptying into the bladder.

The bladder neck (posterior urethra) is 2 to 3 centimeters long, and its wall is composed of detrusor muscle interlaced with a large amount of elastic tissue. The muscle in this area is called the internal sphincter. Its natural tone normally keeps the bladder neck and posterior urethra empty of urine and, therefore, prevents emptying of the bladder until the pressure in the main part of the bladder rises above a critical threshold.

Beyond the posterior urethra, the urethra passes through the urogenital diaphragm, which contains a layer of muscle called the external sphincter of the bladder. This muscle is a voluntary skeletal muscle, in contrast to the muscle of the bladder body and bladder neck, which is entirely smooth muscle. The external sphincter muscle is

Figure 26-7. Innervation of the urinary bladder.
![gu147762836d](gu147762836d.jpg)
under voluntary control of the nervous system and can be used to consciously prevent urination, even when involuntary controls are attempting to empty the bladder.

Innervation of the Bladder. The principal nerve supply of the bladder is via the pelvic nerves, which connect with the spinal cord through the sacral plexus, mainly connecting with cord segments S2 and S3 (Figure 26-7). Coursing through the pelvic nerves are both sensory nerve fibers and motor nerve fibers. The sensory fibers detect the degree of stretch in the bladder wall. Stretch signals from the posterior urethra are especially strong and are mainly
responsible for initiating the reflexes that cause bladder emptying.

The motor nerves transmitted in the pelvic nerves are parasympathetic fibers. These fibers terminate on ganglion cells located in the wall of the bladder. Short postganglionic nerves then innervate the detrusor muscle.

In addition to the pelvic nerves, two other types of innervation are important in bladder function. Most important are the skeletal motor fibers transmitted through the pudendal nerve to the external bladder sphincter. These fibers are somatic nerve fibers that innervate and control the voluntary skeletal muscle of the

sphincter. Also, the bladder receives sympathetic innervation from the sympathetic chain through the hypogastric nerves, connecting mainly with the L2 segment of the spinal cord. These sympathetic fibers stimulate mainly the blood vessels and have little to do with bladder contraction. Some sensory nerve fibers also pass via the sympathetic nerves and may be important in the sensation of fullness and, in some cases, pain.

## URINE TRANSPORT FROM THE KIDNEYS THROUGH THE URETERS AND INTO THE BLADDER

Urine that is expelled from the bladder has essentially the same composition as fluid flowing out of the collecting ducts. There are no significant changes in the composition of urine as it flows through the renal calyces and ureters to the bladder.

Urine flowing from the collecting ducts into the renal calyces stretches the calyces and increases their inherent pacemaker activity, which in turn initiates peristaltic contractions that spread to the renal pelvis and then downward along the length of the ureter, thereby forcing urine from the renal pelvis toward the bladder. In adults, the ureters are normally 25 to 35 centimeters ( $10-14$ inches) long.

The walls of the ureters contain smooth muscle and are innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, as well as by an intramural plexus of neurons and nerve fibers that extends along the entire length of the ureters. As with other visceral smooth muscle, peristaltic contractions in the ureter are enhanced by parasympathetic stimulation and inhibited by sympathetic stimulation.

The ureters enter the bladder through the detrusor muscle in the trigone region of the bladder, as shown in Figure 26-6. Normally, the ureters course obliquely for several centimeters through the bladder wall. The normal tone of the detrusor muscle in the bladder wall tends to compress the ureter, thereby preventing backflow (reflux) of urine from the bladder when pressure builds up in the bladder during micturition or bladder compression. Each peristaltic wave along the ureter increases the pressure within the ureter so that the region passing through the bladder wall opens and allows urine to flow into the bladder.

In some people, the distance that the ureter courses through the bladder wall is less than normal, and thus contraction of the bladder during micturition does not always lead to complete occlusion of the ureter. As a result, some of the urine in the bladder is propelled backward into the ureter, a condition called vesicoureteral reflux. Such reflux can lead to enlargement of the ureters and, if severe, can increase the pressure in the renal calyces and structures of the renal medulla, causing damage to these regions.

Pain Sensation in the Ureters and the Ureterorenal Reflex. The ureters are extensively supplied with pain
![gu157762836d](gu157762836d.jpg)

Figure 26-8. A normal cystometrogram, showing also acute pressure waves (dashed spikes) caused by micturition reflexes.
nerve fibers. When a ureter becomes blocked (e.g., by a ureteral stone), intense reflex constriction occurs, which is associated with severe pain. Also, the pain impulses cause a sympathetic reflex back to the kidney to constrict the renal arterioles, thereby decreasing urine output from the kidney. This effect is called the ureterorenal reflex and is important for attenuating flow of fluid into the pelvis of a kidney with a blocked ureter.

## Filling of the Bladder and Bladder Wall Tone-the Cystometrogram

Figure 26-8 shows the approximate changes in intravesicular pressure as the bladder fills with urine. When there is no urine in the bladder, the intravesicular pressure is about 0 , but by the time 30 to 50 milliliters of urine have collected, the pressure rises to 5 to 10 centimeters of water. Additional urine-200 to 300 milliliterscan collect with only a small additional rise in pressure; this constant level of pressure is caused by intrinsic tone of the bladder wall. Beyond 300 to 400 milliliters, collection of more urine in the bladder causes the pressure to rise rapidly.

Superimposed on the tonic pressure changes during filling of the bladder are periodic acute increases in pressure that last from a few seconds to more than 1 minute. The pressure peaks may rise only a few centimeters of water or may rise to more than 100 centimeters of water. These pressure peaks are called micturition waves in the cystometrogram and are caused by the micturition reflex.

## MICTURITION REFLEX

Referring again to Figure 26-8, one can see that as the bladder fills, many superimposed micturition contractions begin to appear, as shown by the dashed spikes. These are the result of a stretch reflex initiated by sensory stretch receptors in the bladder wall, especially by the receptors in the posterior urethra when this area begins to fill with

urine at the higher bladder pressures. Sensory signals from the bladder stretch receptors are conducted to the sacral segments of the cord through the pelvic nerves and then reflexively back again to the bladder through the parasympathetic nerve fibers by way of these same nerves.

When the bladder is only partially filled, these micturition contractions usually relax spontaneously after a fraction of a minute, the detrusor muscles stop contracting, and pressure falls back to the baseline. As the bladder continues to fill, the micturition reflexes become more frequent and cause greater contractions of the detrusor muscle.

Once a micturition reflex begins, it is self-regenerative. That is, initial contraction of the bladder activates the stretch receptors to cause a greater increase in sensory impulses from the bladder and posterior urethra, which causes a further increase in reflex contraction of the bladder; thus, the cycle is repeated again and again until the bladder has reached a strong degree of contraction. Then, after a few seconds to more than a minute, the selfregenerative reflex begins to fatigue, and the regenerative cycle of the micturition reflex ceases, permitting the bladder to relax.

Thus, the micturition reflex is a single complete cycle of the following: (1) progressive and rapid increase of pressure; (2) a period of sustained pressure; and (3) return of the pressure to the basal tone of the bladder. Once a micturition reflex has occurred but has not succeeded in emptying the bladder, the nervous elements of this reflex usually remain in an inhibited state for a few minutes to 1 hour or more before another micturition reflex occurs. As the bladder becomes filled more and more, micturition reflexes occur more and more often and powerfully.

Once the micturition reflex becomes powerful enough, it causes another reflex, which passes through the pudendal nerves to the external sphincter to inhibit it. If this inhibition is more potent in the brain than the voluntary constrictor signals to the external sphincter, urination will occur. If not, urination will not occur until the bladder fills still further, and the micturition reflex becomes more powerful.

Facilitation or Inhibition of Micturition by the Brain. The micturition reflex is an autonomic spinal cord reflex, but it can be inhibited or facilitated by centers in the brain. These centers include the following: (1) strong $f a$ cilitative and inhibitory centers in the brain stem, located mainly in the pons; and (2) several centers located in the cerebral cortex that are mainly inhibitory but can become excitatory.

The micturition reflex is the basic cause of micturition, but the higher centers normally exert final control of micturition, as follows:

1. The higher centers keep the micturition reflex partially inhibited, except when micturition is desired.
2. The higher centers can prevent micturition, even if the micturition reflex occurs, by tonic contraction
of the external bladder sphincter until a convenient time presents itself.
3. When it is time to urinate, the cortical centers can facilitate the sacral micturition centers to help initiate a micturition reflex and, at the same time, inhibit the external urinary sphincter so that urination can occur.
Voluntary urination is usually initiated in the following way. First, a person voluntarily contracts the abdominal muscles, which increases pressure in the bladder and allows extra urine to enter the bladder neck and posterior urethra under pressure, thus stretching their walls. This action stimulates the stretch receptors, which excites the micturition reflex and simultaneously inhibits the external urethral sphincter. Ordinarily, all the urine will be emptied, with rarely more than 5 to 10 milliliters left in the bladder.

## Abnormalities of Micturition

Atonic Bladder and Incontinence Caused by Destruction of Sensory Nerve Fibers. Micturition reflex contraction cannot occur if the sensory nerve fibers from the bladder to the spinal cord are destroyed, thereby preventing transmission of stretch signals from the bladder. When this happens, a person loses bladder control, despite intact efferent fibers from the cord to the bladder and despite intact neurogenic connections within the brain. Instead of emptying periodically, the bladder fills to capacity and overflows a few drops at a time through the urethra. This occurrence is called overflow incontinence.

A common cause of atonic bladder is crush injury to the sacral region of the spinal cord. Certain diseases can also cause damage to the dorsal root nerve fibers that enter the spinal cord. For example, syphilis can cause constrictive fibrosis around the dorsal root nerve fibers, destroying them. This condition is called tabes dorsalis, and the resulting bladder condition is called tabetic bladder.

Automatic Bladder Caused by Spinal Cord Damage Above the Sacral Region. If the spinal cord is damaged above the sacral region but the sacral cord segments are still intact, typical micturition reflexes can still occur. However, they are no longer controlled by the brain. During the first few days to several weeks after the damage to the cord has occurred, the micturition reflexes are suppressed because of the state of spinal shock caused by the sudden loss of facilitative impulses from the brain stem and cerebrum. However, if the bladder is emptied periodically by catheterization to prevent bladder injury caused by overstretching of the bladder, the excitability of the micturition reflex gradually increases until typical micturition reflexes return; then, periodic (but unannounced) bladder emptying occurs.

Uninhibited Neurogenic Bladder Caused by Lack of Inhibitory Signals From the Brain. Another abnormality of micturition is the so-called uninhibited neurogenic bladder, which results in frequent and relatively uncontrolled micturition. This condition derives from partial damage in the spinal cord or the brain stem that interrupts most of the inhibitory signals. Therefore, facilitative impulses passing continually down the cord keep the sacral centers so excitable that even a small quantity of urine elicits an uncontrollable micturition reflex, thereby promoting frequent urination.

Excretion $\neq$ Filtration - Reabsorption + Secretion
Figure 26-9. Basic kidney processes that determine the composition of the urine. The urinary excretion rate of a substance is equal to the rate at which the substance is filtered minus its reabsorption rate plus the rate at which it is secreted from the peritubular capillary blood into the tubules.

## URINE FORMATION RESULTS FROM GLOMERULAR FILTRATION, TUBULAR REABSORPTION, AND TUBULAR SECRETION

The rates at which different substances are excreted in the urine represent the sum of three renal processes, shown in Figure 26-9: (1) glomerular filtration of substances in the blood; (2) reabsorption of substances from the renal tubules into the blood; and (3) secretion of substances from the blood into the renal tubules as follows:

## Urinary excretion rate <br> = Filtration rate - Reabsorption rate + Secretion rate

Urine formation begins when a large amount of fluid that is virtually free of protein is filtered from the glomerular capillaries into Bowman's capsule. Most substances in the plasma, except for proteins, are freely filtered, so their concentration in the glomerular filtrate in Bowman's capsule is almost the same as in the plasma. As filtered fluid leaves Bowman's capsule and passes through the tubules, it is modified by reabsorption of water and specific solutes back into the blood or by secretion of other substances from the peritubular capillaries into the tubules.

Figure 26-10 shows the renal handling of four hypothetical substances. The substance shown in panel A is freely filtered by the glomerular capillaries but is neither reabsorbed nor secreted. Therefore, its excretion rate is
![gu177762836d](gu177762836d.jpg)

B, The substance is freely filtered, but part of the filtered load is reabsorbed back in the blood.

D, The substance is freely filtered and is not reabsorbed but is secreted from the peritubular capillary blood into the renal tubules.
equal to the rate at which it was filtered. Certain waste products in the body, such as creatinine, are handled by the kidneys in this manner, allowing excretion of essentially all that is filtered.

In panel B, the substance is freely filtered but is also partly reabsorbed from the tubules back into the blood. Therefore, the rate of urinary excretion is less than the rate of filtration at the glomerular capillaries. In this case, the excretion rate is calculated as the filtration rate minus the reabsorption rate. This pattern is typical for many of the electrolytes of the body, such as sodium and chloride ions.

In panel C, the substance is freely filtered at the glomerular capillaries but is not excreted into the urine because all the filtered substance is reabsorbed from the tubules back into the blood. This pattern occurs for some of the nutritional substances in the blood, such as amino acids and glucose, allowing them to be conserved in the body fluids.

The substance in panel D is freely filtered at the glomerular capillaries and is not reabsorbed, but additional quantities of this substance are secreted from the peritubular

capillary blood into the renal tubules. This pattern often occurs for organic acids and bases, permitting them to be cleared from the blood rapidly and excreted in large amounts in the urine. The excretion rate in this case is calculated as filtration rate plus tubular secretion rate.

For each substance in the plasma, a particular combination of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion occurs. The rate at which the substance is excreted in the urine depends on the relative rates of these three basic renal processes.

## FILTRATION, REABSORPTION, AND SECRETION OF DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES

In general, tubular reabsorption is quantitatively more important than tubular secretion in the formation of urine, but secretion plays an important role in determining the amounts of potassium and hydrogen ions and a few other substances that are excreted in the urine. Most substances that must be cleared from the blood, especially the end products of metabolism, such as urea, creatinine, uric acid, and urates, are poorly reabsorbed and are therefore excreted in large amounts in the urine. Certain foreign substances and drugs are also poorly reabsorbed but, in addition, are secreted from the blood into the tubules, so their excretion rates are high. Conversely, electrolytes, such as sodium ions, chloride ions, and bicarbonate ions, are highly reabsorbed, so only small amounts appear in the urine. Certain nutritional substances, such as amino acids and glucose, are completely reabsorbed from the tubules and do not appear in the urine, even though large amounts are filtered by the glomerular capillaries.

Each of the processes-glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion-is regulated according to the needs of the body. For example, when there is excess sodium in the body, the rate at which sodium is filtered usually increases slightly, and a smaller fraction of
the filtered sodium is reabsorbed, causing increased urinary excretion of sodium.

For most substances, the rates of filtration and reabsorption are extremely large relative to the rates of excretion. Therefore, even slight changes of filtration or reabsorption can lead to relatively large changes in renal excretion. For example, an increase in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of only $10 \%$ (from 180 to $198 \mathrm{~L} /$ day) would raise the urine volume by 13 -fold (from 1.5 to 19.5 $\mathrm{L} /$ day) if tubular reabsorption remained constant. In reality, changes in glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption usually act in a coordinated manner to produce the necessary changes in renal excretion.

## Why Are Large Amounts of Solutes Filtered and Then

Reabsorbed by the Kidneys? One might question the wisdom of filtering such large amounts of water and solutes and then reabsorbing most of these substances. One advantage of a high GFR is that it allows the kidneys to remove waste products rapidly from the body that depend mainly on glomerular filtration for their excretion. Most waste products are poorly reabsorbed by the tubules and, therefore, depend on a high GFR for effective removal from the body.

A second advantage of a high GFR is that it allows all the body fluids to be filtered and processed by the kidneys many times each day. Because the entire plasma volume is only about 3 liters, whereas the GFR is about $180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, the entire plasma can be filtered and processed about 60 times each day. This high GFR allows the kidneys to control the volume and composition of the body fluids precisely and rapidly.

# Glomerular Filtration, Renal Blood Flow, and Their Control 

## GLOMERULAR FILTRATION-THE FIRST STEP IN URINE FORMATION

The first step in urine formation is filtration of large amounts of fluid through the glomerular capillaries into Bowman's capsule-almost $180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. Most of this filtrate is reabsorbed, leaving only about 1 liter of fluid to be excreted each day, although the renal fluid excretion rate is highly variable, depending on fluid intake. The high rate of glomerular filtration depends on a high rate of kidney blood flow, as well as the special properties of the glomerular capillary membranes. In this chapter, we discuss the physical forces that determine the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as well as the physiological mechanisms that regulate GFR and renal blood flow.

## COMPOSITION OF THE GLOMERULAR FILTRATE

Like most capillaries, the glomerular capillaries are relatively impermeable to proteins, so the filtered fluid (called the glomerular filtrate) is essentially protein-free and devoid of cellular elements, including red blood cells. The concentrations of other constituents of the glomerular filtrate, including most salts and organic molecules, are similar to the concentrations in the plasma. Exceptions to this generalization include a few low-molecular-weight substances such as calcium and fatty acids that are not freely filtered because they are partially bound to the plasma proteins. For example, almost half of the plasma calcium and most of the plasma fatty acids are bound to proteins, and these bound portions are not filtered through the glomerular capillaries.

## GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE IS ABOUT 20\% OF RENAL PLASMA FLOW

Similar to other capillaries, the glomerular capillaries filter fluid at a rate that is determined by the following: (1) the balance of hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces acting across the capillary membrane; and (2) the capillary filtration coefficient $\left(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$, the product of the permeability and filtering surface area of the capillaries. The glomerular capillaries have a much higher rate of filtration than most other capillaries because of a high glomerular hydrostatic pressure and a large $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$. In the average adult human, the

GFR is about $125 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, or $180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. The fraction of the renal plasma flow that is filtered (the filtration fraction) averages about 0.2 , which means that about $20 \%$ of the plasma flowing through the kidney is filtered through the glomerular capillaries (Figure 27-1). The filtration fraction is calculated as follows:

Filtration fraction $=$ GFR/Renal plasma flow

## GLOMERULAR CAPILLARY MEMBRANE

The glomerular capillary membrane is similar to that of other capillaries, except that it has three (instead of the usual two) major layers: (1) the endothelium of the capillary; (2) a basement membrane; and (3) a layer of epithelial cells (podocytes) surrounding the outer surface of the capillary basement membrane (Figure 27-2). Together, these layers make up the filtration barrier, which, despite the three layers, filters several hundred times as much water and solutes as the usual capillary membrane. Even with this high rate of filtration, the glomerular capillary membrane normally filters only a small amount of plasma proteins.

The high filtration rate across the glomerular capillary membrane is due partly to its special characteristics. The capillary endothelium is perforated by thousands of small holes called fenestrae, similar to the fenestrated capillaries found in the liver, although smaller than the fenestrae of the liver. Although the fenestrations are relatively large, endothelial cell proteins are richly endowed with fixed negative charges that hinder the passage of plasma proteins.

Surrounding the endothelium is the basement membrane, which consists of a meshwork of collagen and proteoglycan fibrillae that have large spaces through which large amounts of water and small solutes can filter. The basement membrane greatly hinders filtration of plasma proteins, partly because of strong negative electrical charges associated with the proteoglycans.

The final part of the glomerular membrane is a layer of epithelial cells (podocytes) that line the outer surface of the glomerulus. These podocytes are not continuous but have long footlike processes (pedicels) that encircle the outer surface of the capillaries (see Figure 27-2). The foot

Figure 27-1. Average values for total renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), tubular reabsorption (REAB), and urine flow rate. RPF is equal to renal blood flow $\times$ ( 1 - hematocrit). Note that the GFR averages about $20 \%$ of the RPF, whereas urine flow rate is less than $1 \%$ of the GFR. Therefore, more than $99 \%$ of the fluid filtered is normally reabsorbed. The filtration fraction is GFR/RPF.

Table 27-1 Filterability of Substances by Glomerular Capillaries Based on Molecular Weight

| Substance | Molecular Weight | Filterability |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Water | 18 | 1.0 |
| Sodium | 23 | 1.0 |
| Glucose | 180 | 1.0 |
| Inulin | 5500 | 1.0 |
| Myoglobin | 17,000 | 0.75 |
| Albumin | 69,000 | 0.005 |

processes are separated by gaps called slit pores through which the glomerular filtrate moves. The epithelial cells, which also have negative charges, provide additional restriction to filtration of plasma proteins. Thus, all layers of the glomerular capillary wall provide a barrier to the filtration of plasma proteins but permit rapid filtration of water and most solutes in the plasma.

Filterability of Solutes Inversely Related to Their Size. The glomerular capillary membrane is thicker than most other capillaries, but it is also much more porous and therefore filters fluid at a high rate. Despite the high filtration rate, the glomerular filtration barrier is selective in determining which molecules will be filtered, based on their size and electrical charge.

Table 27-1 lists the effect of molecular size on filterability of different molecules. A filterability of 1.0 means that the substance is filtered as freely as water, whereas a filterability of 0.75 means that the substance is filtered only $75 \%$ as rapidly as water. Note that electrolytes such as sodium and small organic compounds such as glucose are freely filtered. As the molecular weight of the molecule approaches that of albumin, the filterability rapidly decreases, approaching zero.

## Negatively Charged Large Molecules Are Filtered Less Easily Than Positively Charged Molecules of Equal Molecular Size. The molecular diameter of the plasma protein albumin is only about 6 nanometers, whereas the pores of the glomerular membrane are thought to be about 8 nanometers ( 80 angstroms $[\AA]$ ). Albumin is restricted from filtration, however, because of its negative charge and the electrostatic repulsion exerted by negative charges of the glomerular capillary wall proteoglycans.

Figure 27-3 shows how electrical charge affects the filtration of different molecular weight dextrans by the glomerulus. Dextrans are polysaccharides that can be manufactured as neutral molecules or with negative or positive charges. Note that for any given molecular radius, positively charged molecules are filtered much more readily than negatively charged molecules. Neutral dextrans are also filtered more readily than negatively charged dextrans of equal molecular weight. The

Figure 27-3. Effect of molecular radius and electrical charge of dextran on its filterability by the glomerular capillaries. A value of 1.0 indicates that the substance is filtered as freely as water, whereas a value of 0 indicates that it is not filtered. Dextrans are polysaccharides that can be manufactured as neutral molecules or with negative or positive charges and with varying molecular weights.
reason for these differences in filterability is that the negative charges of the basement membrane and podocytes provide an important means for restricting large negatively charged molecules, including the plasma proteins.

## Minimal-Change Nephropathy and Increased Glomerular Permeability to Plasma Proteins. In minimal-

change nephropathy, the glomeruli become more permeable to plasma proteins, even though they may look normal when viewed with a standard light microscope. However, when viewed at high magnification with an electron microscope, the glomeruli usually display flattened podocytes with foot processes that may be detached from the glomerular basement membrane (podocyte effacement).

The causes of minimal change nephropathy are unclear but may be at least partly related to an immunological response and abnormal T-cell secretion of cytokines that injure the podocytes and increase their permeability to some of the lower molecular weight proteins, especially albumin. This increased permeability permits the proteins to be filtered by the glomerular capillaries and excreted in the urine, a condition known as proteinuria or albuminuria. Minimal change nephropathy is most common in young children but can also occur in adults, especially in those who have autoimmune disorders.

## DETERMINANTS OF THE GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE

The GFR is determined by the following: (1) the sum of the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces across the glomerular membrane, which gives the net filtration pressure; and (2) the glomerular $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$. Expressed mathematically,
![gu217762836d](gu217762836d.jpg)

Figure 27-4. Summary of forces causing filtration by the glomerular capillaries. The values shown are estimates for healthy humans.
the GFR equals the product of $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ and the net filtration pressure:

## GFR $=\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}} \times$ Net filtration pressure

The net filtration pressure represents the sum of the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces that favor or oppose filtration across the glomerular capillaries (Figure 27-4). These forces include the following: (1) hydrostatic pressure inside the glomerular capillaries (glomerular hydrostatic pressure, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{G}}$ ), which promotes filtration; (2) the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's capsule $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}\right)$ outside the capillaries, which opposes filtration; (3) the colloid osmotic pressure of the glomerular capillary plasma proteins $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{G}}\right)$, which opposes filtration; and (4) the colloid osmotic pressure of the proteins in Bowman's capsule $\left(\pi_{B}\right)$, which promotes filtration. Under normal conditions, the concentration of protein in the glomerular filtrate is so low that the colloid osmotic pressure of the Bowman's capsule fluid is considered to be zero.

The GFR can therefore be expressed as follows:

$$
\mathrm{GFR}=\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}} \times\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{G}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}-\pi_{\mathrm{G}}+\pi_{\mathrm{B}}\right)
$$

Although the normal values for the determinants of GFR have not been measured directly in humans, they have been estimated in animals such as dogs and rats. Based on the results in experimental animals, the approximate normal forces favoring and opposing glomerular filtration in humans are believed to be as follows (see Figure 27-4):

## Forces Favoring Filtration (mm Hg)

Glomerular hydrostatic pressure 60
Bowman's capsule colloid osmotic pressure 0

## Forces Opposing Filtration (mm Hg)

Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure 18
Glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure 32

Thus, the net filtration pressure $=60-18-32=+10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$.

Some of these values can change markedly under different physiological conditions, whereas others are altered mainly in disease states, as discussed later.

## INCREASED GLOMERULAR CAPILLARY FILTRATION COEFFICIENT INCREASES GLOMERULAR FILTRATE RATE

The $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ is a measure of the product of the hydraulic conductivity and surface area of the glomerular capillaries. The $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ cannot be measured directly, but can be is estimated experimentally by dividing the GFR by the net filtration pressure:

$$
\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}=\text { GFR/Net filtration pressure }
$$

Because the total GFR for both kidneys is about 125 $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, and the net filtration pressure is 10 mm Hg , the normal $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ is calculated to be about $12.5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per mm Hg of filtration pressure. When $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ is expressed per 100 grams of kidney weight, it averages about $4.2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per mm Hg , a value about 400 times as high as the $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ of most other capillary systems of the body. The average $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ of many other tissues in the body is only about 0.01 $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per $\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg} / 100 \mathrm{~g}$. This high $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ for the glomerular capillaries contributes to their rapid rate of fluid filtration.

Although increased $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ raises the GFR and decreased $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ reduces the GFR, changes in $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ probably do not provide a primary mechanism for the normal daily regulation of GFR. Some diseases, however, lower $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ by reducing the number of functional glomerular capillaries (thereby reducing the surface area for filtration) or by increasing the thickness of the glomerular capillary membrane and reducing its hydraulic conductivity. For example, chronic uncontrolled hypertension may gradually reduce $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ by increasing the thickness of the glomerular capillary basement membrane and, eventually, by damaging the capillaries so severely that there is loss of capillary function.

## INCREASED BOWMAN'S CAPSULE HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE DECREASES GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE

Direct measurements of hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's capsule and at different points in the proximal tubule in experimental animals using micropipettes have suggested that a reasonable estimate for Bowman's capsule pressure in humans is about 18 mm Hg under normal conditions. Increasing the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's capsule reduces GFR, whereas decreasing this pressure raises GFR. However, changes in Bowman's capsule pressure normally do not serve as a primary means for regulating GFR.

In certain pathological states associated with obstruction of the urinary tract, Bowman's capsule pressure can increase markedly, causing serious reduction of GFR. For example, precipitation of calcium or of uric acid may lead
![gu227762836d](gu227762836d.jpg)

Figure 27-5. Increase in colloid osmotic pressure in plasma flowing through the glomerular capillary. Normally, about one-fifth of the fluid in the glomerular capillaries filters into Bowman's capsule, thereby concentrating the plasma proteins that are not filtered. Increases in the filtration fraction (glomerular filtration rate/renal plasma flow) increase the rate at which the plasma colloid osmotic pressure rises along the glomerular capillary; decreases in the filtration fraction have the opposite effect.
to formation of stones that lodge in the urinary tract, often in the ureter, thereby obstructing outflow of the urinary tract and raising Bowman's capsule pressure. This situation reduces GFR and eventually can cause hydronephrosis (distention and dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces) and can damage or even destroy the kidney unless the obstruction is relieved.

## INCREASED GLOMERULAR CAPILLARY COLLOID OSMOTIC PRESSURE DECREASES GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE

As blood passes from the afferent arteriole through the glomerular capillaries to the efferent arterioles, the plasma protein concentration increases about 20\% (Figure 27-5). The reason for this increase is that about one-fifth of the fluid in the capillaries filters into Bowman's capsule, thereby concentrating the glomerular plasma proteins that are not filtered. Assuming that the normal colloid osmotic pressure of plasma entering the glomerular capillaries is 28 mm Hg , this value usually rises to about 36 mm Hg by the time the blood reaches the efferent end of the capillaries. Therefore, the average colloid osmotic pressure of the glomerular capillary plasma proteins is midway between 28 and 36 mm Hg , or about 32 mm Hg .

Two factors that influence the glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure are the following: (1) the arterial plasma colloid osmotic pressure; and (2) the fraction of plasma filtered by the glomerular capillaries (filtration fraction). Increasing the arterial plasma colloid osmotic pressure raises the glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure, which in turn tends to decrease the GFR.

Increasing the filtration fraction also concentrates the plasma proteins and raises the glomerular colloid osmotic pressure (see Figure 27-5). Because the filtration fraction is defined as the GFR divided by the renal plasma flow, the filtration fraction can be increased by raising the GFR or

by reducing renal plasma flow. For example, a reduction in renal plasma flow with no initial change in GFR would tend to increase the filtration fraction, which would raise the glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure and tend to reduce the GFR. For this reason, changes in renal blood flow can influence GFR independently of changes in glomerular hydrostatic pressure.

With increasing renal blood flow, a lower fraction of the plasma is initially filtered out of the glomerular capillaries, causing a slower rise in the glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure and less inhibitory effect on the GFR. Consequently, even with a constant glomerular hydrostatic pressure, a greater rate of blood flow into the glomerulus tends to increase the GFR and a lower rate of blood flow into the glomerulus tends to decrease the GFR.

## INCREASED GLOMERULAR CAPILLARY HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE INCREASES GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE

The glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure has been estimated to be about 60 mm Hg under normal conditions. Changes in glomerular hydrostatic pressure serve as the primary means for physiological regulation of GFR. Increases in glomerular hydrostatic pressure raise the GFR, whereas decreases in glomerular hydrostatic pressure reduce the GFR.

Glomerular hydrostatic pressure is determined by three variables, each of which is under physiological control: (1) arterial pressure; (2) afferent arteriolar resistance; and (3) efferent arteriolar resistance.

Increased arterial pressure tends to raise glomerular hydrostatic pressure and, therefore, to increase the GFR. However, as discussed later, this effect is buffered by autoregulatory mechanisms that maintain a relatively constant glomerular pressure as arterial pressure fluctuates.

Increased resistance of afferent arterioles reduces glomerular hydrostatic pressure and decreases the GFR (Figure 27-6). Conversely, dilation of the afferent arterioles increases glomerular hydrostatic pressure and GFR.

Constriction of the efferent arterioles increases the resistance to outflow from the glomerular capillaries. This mechanism raises glomerular hydrostatic pressure and, as long as the increase in efferent resistance does not reduce renal blood flow too much, GFR increases slightly (see Figure 27-6). However, because efferent arteriolar constriction also reduces renal blood flow, filtration fraction and glomerular colloid osmotic pressure increase as efferent arteriolar resistance increases. Therefore, if constriction of efferent arterioles is severe (more than about a threefold increase in efferent arteriolar resistance), the rise in colloid osmotic pressure exceeds the increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure caused by efferent arteriolar constriction. When this situation occurs, the net force for filtration actually decreases, causing a reduction in GFR.
![gu237762836d](gu237762836d.jpg)

Figure 27-6. Effect of increases in afferent arteriolar resistance ( $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{A}}$, top panel) or efferent arteriolar resistance ( $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{E}}$, bottom panel) on renal blood flow, glomerular hydrostatic pressure $\left(P_{G}\right)$, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Figure 27-7. Effect of change in afferent arteriolar resistance or efferent arteriolar resistance on glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow.

Thus, efferent arteriolar constriction has a biphasic effect on GFR (Figure 27-7). At moderate levels of constriction, there is a slight increase in GFR but, with severe constriction, there is a decrease in GFR. The primary cause of the eventual decrease in GFR is as follows. As efferent constriction becomes severe, and as plasma

protein concentration increases, there is a rapid nonlinear increase in colloid osmotic pressure caused by the Donnan effect; the higher the protein concentration, the more rapidly the colloid osmotic pressure rises because of the interaction of ions bound to the plasma proteins, which also exert an osmotic effect, as discussed in Chapter 16.

To summarize, constriction of afferent arterioles reduces GFR. However, the effect of efferent arteriolar constriction depends on the severity of the constriction; modest efferent constriction raises GFR, but severe efferent constriction (more than a threefold increase in resistance) tends to reduce GFR.

Table 27-2 summarizes the factors that can decrease the GFR.

## RENAL BLOOD FLOW

In a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man, the combined blood flow through both kidneys is about $1100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, or about $22 \%$ of the cardiac output. Considering that the two kidneys constitute only about $0.4 \%$ of the total body weight, one can readily see that they receive extremely high blood flow compared with other organs.

As with other tissues, blood flow supplies the kidneys with nutrients and removes waste products. However, the high blood flow to the kidneys greatly exceeds this need. The purpose of this additional flow is to supply enough plasma for the high rates of glomerular filtration that are necessary for precise regulation of body fluid volumes and solute concentrations. As might be expected, the mechanisms that regulate renal blood flow are closely linked to control of GFR and excretory functions of the kidneys.
![gu257762836d](gu257762836d.jpg)

Figure 27-8. Relationship between oxygen consumption and sodium reabsorption in dog kidneys. (From Kramer K, Deetjen P: [Relation of renal oxygen consumption to blood supply and glomerular filtration during variations of blood pressure.] Pflugers Arch Physiol 271:782, 1960.)

## RENAL BLOOD FLOW AND OXYGEN CONSUMPTION

On a per gram-weight basis, the kidneys normally consume oxygen at twice the rate of the brain but have almost seven times the blood flow of the brain. Thus, the oxygen delivered to the kidneys far exceeds their metabolic needs, and the arterial-venous extraction of oxygen is relatively low compared with that of most other tissues.

A large fraction of the oxygen consumed by the kidneys is related to the high rate of active sodium reabsorption by the renal tubules. If renal blood flow and GFR are reduced, and less sodium is filtered, less sodium is reabsorbed and less oxygen is consumed. Therefore, renal oxygen consumption varies in proportion to renal tubular sodium reabsorption, which in turn is closely related to GFR and the rate of sodium filtered (Figure 27-8). If glomerular filtration ceases completely, renal sodium reabsorption also ceases and oxygen consumption decreases to about one-fourth normal. This residual oxygen consumption reflects the basic metabolic needs of the renal cells.

## DETERMINANTS OF RENAL BLOOD FLOW

Renal blood flow (RBF) is determined by the pressure gradient across the renal vasculature (the difference between renal artery and renal vein hydrostatic pressures), divided by the total renal vascular resistance:

$$
\mathrm{RBF}=\frac{(\text { Renal artery pressure }- \text { Renal vein pressure })}{\text { Total renal vascular resistance }}
$$

Renal artery pressure is about equal to systemic arterial pressure, and renal vein pressure averages about 3 to 4 mm Hg under most conditions. As in other vascular

beds, the total vascular resistance through the kidneys is determined by the sum of the resistances in the individual vasculature segments, including the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins (Table 27-3).

Most of the renal vascular resistance resides in three major segments-interlobular arteries, afferent arterioles, and efferent arterioles. Resistance of these vessels is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, various hormones, and local internal renal control mechanisms, as discussed later. An increase in the resistance of any of the vascular segments of the kidneys tends to reduce the renal blood flow, whereas a decrease in vascular resistance increases renal blood flow if renal artery and renal vein pressures remain constant.

Although changes in arterial pressure have some influence on renal blood flow, the kidneys have effective mechanisms for maintaining renal blood flow and GFR relatively constant over an arterial pressure range between 80 and 170 mm Hg , a process called autoregulation. This capacity for autoregulation occurs through mechanisms that are intrinsic to the kidneys, as discussed later in this chapter.

## BLOOD FLOW IN VASA RECTA OF RENAL MEDULLA IS LOW COMPARED WITH RENAL CORTEX FLOW

The outer part of the kidney, the renal cortex, receives most of the kidney's blood flow. Blood flow in the renal medulla accounts for only $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ of the total renal blood flow. Flow to the renal medulla is supplied by a specialized portion of the peritubular capillary system called the vasa recta. These vessels descend into the medulla in parallel with the loops of Henle and then loop back along with the loops of Henle and return to the cortex before emptying into the venous system. As discussed in Chapter 29,

Table 27-4 Hormones and Autacoids That Influence the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)

| Hormone or Autacoid | Effect on GFR |
| :-- | :-- |
| Norepinephrine | $\downarrow$ |
| Epinephrine | $\downarrow$ |
| Endothelin | $\downarrow$ |
| Angiotensin II | $\leftrightarrow$ (prevents $\downarrow$ ) |
| Endothelial-derived nitric oxide | $\uparrow$ |
| Prostaglandins | $\uparrow$ |

the vasa recta play an important role in allowing the kidneys to form concentrated urine.

## PHYSIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF GLOMERULAR FILTRATION AND RENAL BLOOD FLOW

The determinant of GFR that is most variable and subject to physiological control is the glomerular hydrostatic pressure. This variable, in turn, is influenced by the sympathetic nervous system, hormones, autacoids (vasoactive substances that are released in the kidneys and act locally), and other feedback controls that are intrinsic to the kidneys.

## STRONG SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVATION DECREASES GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE

Essentially all the blood vessels of the kidneys, including the afferent and efferent arterioles, are richly innervated by sympathetic nerve fibers. Strong activation of the renal sympathetic nerves can constrict the renal arterioles and decrease renal blood flow and GFR. Moderate or mild sympathetic stimulation has little influence on renal blood flow and GFR. For example, reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system resulting from moderate decreases in pressure at the carotid sinus baroreceptors or cardiopulmonary receptors has little influence on renal blood flow or GFR. However, as discussed in Chapter 28, even mild increases in renal sympathetic activity can stimulate renin release and increase renal tubular reabsorption, causing decreased sodium and water excretion.

The renal sympathetic nerves seem to be the most important in reducing GFR during severe acute disturbances lasting for a few minutes to a few hours, such as those elicited by the defense reaction, brain ischemia, or severe hemorrhage.

## HORMONAL AND AUTACOID CONTROL OF RENAL CIRCULATION

Several hormones and autacoids can influence GFR and renal blood flow, as summarized in Table 27-4.

## Norepinephrine, Epinephrine, and Endothelin Constrict Renal Blood Vessels and Decrease Glomerular Filtration Rate. Hormones that constrict afferent and efferent arterioles, causing reductions in GFR and renal blood flow, include norepinephrine and epinephrine released from the adrenal medulla. In general, blood levels of these hormones parallel the activity of the sympathetic nervous system; thus, norepinephrine and epinephrine have little influence on renal hemodynamics except under conditions associated with strong activation of the sympathetic nervous system, such as severe hemorrhage.

Another vasoconstrictor, endothelin, is a peptide that can be released by damaged vascular endothelial cells of the kidneys, as well as by other tissues. The physiological role of this autacoid is not completely understood. However, endothelin may contribute to hemostasis (minimizing blood loss) when a blood vessel is severed, which damages the endothelium and releases this powerful vasoconstrictor. Plasma endothelin levels are also increased in many disease states associated with vascular injury, such as toxemia of pregnancy, acute renal failure, and chronic uremia, and may contribute to renal vasoconstriction and decreased GFR in some of these pathophysiological conditions.

Angiotensin II Preferentially Constricts Efferent Arterioles in Most Physiological Conditions. A powerful renal vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II, can be considered to be a circulating hormone and a locally produced autacoid or paracrine hormone because it is formed in the kidneys and in the systemic circulation. Receptors for angiotensin II are present in virtually all blood vessels of the kidneys. However, the preglomerular blood vessels, especially the afferent arterioles, appear to be relatively protected from angiotensin II-mediated constriction in most physiological conditions associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system, such as during a lowsodium diet or reduced renal perfusion pressure due to renal artery stenosis. This protection is due to release of vasodilators, especially nitric oxide and prostaglandins, which counteract the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II in these blood vessels.

The efferent arterioles, however, are highly sensitive to angiotensin II. Because angiotensin II preferentially constricts efferent arterioles in most physiological conditions, increased angiotensin II levels raise glomerular hydrostatic pressure while reducing renal blood flow. It should be kept in mind that increased angiotensin II formation usually occurs in circumstances associated with decreased arterial pressure or volume depletion, which tend to decrease GFR. In these circumstances, the increased level of angiotensin II, by constricting efferent arterioles, helps prevent decreases in glomerular hydrostatic pressure and GFR. At the same time, though, the reduction in renal blood flow caused by efferent arteriolar constriction contributes to decreased flow through the peritubular capillaries, which in turn increases the
reabsorption of sodium and water, as discussed in Chapter 28.

Thus, increased angiotensin II levels that occur with a low-sodium diet or volume depletion help maintain GFR and normal excretion of metabolic waste products, such as urea and creatinine, which depend on glomerular filtration for their excretion. At the same time, the angiotensin II-induced constriction of efferent arterioles increases tubular reabsorption of sodium and water, which helps restore blood volume and blood pressure. This effect of angiotensin II in helping autoregulate GFR is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

Endothelial-Derived Nitric Oxide Decreases Renal Vascular Resistance and Increases Glomerular Filtration Rate. An autacoid that decreases renal vascular resistance and is released by the vascular endothelium throughout the body is endothelial-derived nitric oxide. A basal level of nitric oxide production appears to be important for maintaining vasodilation of the kidneys and normal excretion of sodium and water. Therefore, administration of drugs that inhibit formation of nitric oxide increases renal vascular resistance and decreases GFR and urinary sodium excretion, eventually causing high blood pressure. In some hypertensive patients or in patients with atherosclerosis, damage of the vascular endothelium and impaired nitric oxide production may contribute to increased renal vasoconstriction and elevated blood pressure.

Prostaglandins and Bradykinin Decrease Renal Vascular Resistance and Tend to Increase Glomerular Filtration Rate. Prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGI2) and bradykinin serve as hormones and autacoids that cause vasodilation, increased renal blood flow, and increased GFR. These substances are discussed in Chapter 17. Although these vasodilators do not appear to be of major importance in regulating renal blood flow or the GFR in normal conditions, they may dampen the renal vasoconstrictor effects of the sympathetic nerves or angiotensin II, especially their effects to constrict the afferent arterioles.

By opposing vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles, the prostaglandins help prevent excessive reductions in GFR and renal blood flow. Under stressful conditions, such as volume depletion or after surgery, the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis may cause significant reductions in GFR.

## AUTOREGULATION OF GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE AND RENAL BLOOD FLOW

Feedback mechanisms intrinsic to the kidneys normally keep renal blood flow and GFR relatively constant, despite marked changes in arterial blood pressure.

![gu267762836d](gu267762836d.jpg)

Figure 27-9. Autoregulation of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate but lack of autoregulation of urine flow during changes in renal arterial pressure.

These mechanisms still function in blood-perfused kidneys that have been removed from the body, independent of systemic influences. This relative constancy of GFR and renal blood flow is referred to as autoregulation (Figure 27-9).

The primary function of blood flow autoregulation in most tissues, other than the kidneys, is to maintain the delivery of oxygen and nutrients at a normal level and remove the waste products of metabolism, despite changes in the arterial pressure. In the kidneys, the normal blood flow is much higher than that required for these functions. The major function of autoregulation in the kidneys is to maintain a relatively constant the GFR and allow precise control of renal excretion of water and solutes.

The GFR normally remains relatively constant, despite considerable arterial pressure fluctuations that occur during a person's usual activities. For example, a decrease in arterial pressure to as low as 70 to 75 mm Hg or an increase to as high as 160 to 180 mm Hg usually changes the GFR less than $10 \%$. In general, renal blood flow is autoregulated in parallel with GFR, but GFR is more efficiently autoregulated under certain conditions.

## Importance of Glomerular Filtration Rate Autoregulation in Preventing Extreme Changes in Renal Excretion

Although the renal autoregulatory mechanisms are not perfect, they do prevent potentially large changes in GFR and renal excretion of water and solutes that would otherwise occur with changes in blood pressure. One can understand the quantitative importance of autoregulation by considering the relative magnitudes of glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and renal excretion and
the changes in renal excretion that would occur without autoregulatory mechanisms.

Normally, GFR is about $180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, and tubular reabsorption is $178.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, leaving $1.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day of fluid to be excreted in the urine. In the absence of autoregulation, a relatively small increase in blood pressure (from 100 to 125 mm Hg ) would cause a similar $25 \%$ increase in GFR (from about 180 to $225 \mathrm{~L} /$ day). If tubular reabsorption remained constant at $178.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, the urine flow would increase to $46.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day (the difference between GFR and tubular reabsorption)-a total increase in urine of more than 30 -fold. Because the total plasma volume is only about 3 liters, such a change would quickly deplete the blood volume.

In reality, changes in arterial pressure usually exert much less of an effect on urine volume for two reasons: (1) renal autoregulation prevents large changes in GFR that would otherwise occur; and (2) there are additional adaptive mechanisms in the renal tubules that cause them to increase their reabsorption rate when GFR rises, a phenomenon referred to as glomerulotubular balance (discussed in Chapter 28). Even with these special control mechanisms, changes in arterial pressure still have significant effects on renal excretion of water and sodium; this effect is referred to as pressure diuresis or pressure natriuresis, and it is crucial in the regulation of body fluid volumes and arterial pressure, as discussed in Chapters 19 and 30.

## TUBULOGLOMERULAR FEEDBACK AND AUTOREGULATION OF GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE

The kidneys have a special feedback mechanism that links changes in the sodium chloride concentration at the macula densa with the control of renal arteriolar resistance and autoregulation of GFR. This feedback helps ensure a relatively constant delivery of sodium chloride to the distal tubule and helps prevent spurious fluctuations in renal excretion that would otherwise occur. In many circumstances, this feedback autoregulates renal blood flow and GFR in parallel. However, because this mechanism is specifically directed toward stabilizing sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule, instances occur when GFR is autoregulated at the expense of changes in renal blood flow, as discussed later. In other cases, this mechanism may actually cause changes in GFR in response to primary changes in renal tubular sodium chloride reabsorption.

The tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism has two components that act together to control GFR: (1) an afferent arteriolar feedback mechanism; and (2) an efferent arteriolar feedback mechanism. These feedback mechanisms depend on special anatomical arrangements of the juxtaglomerular complex (Figure 27-10).

The juxtaglomerular complex consists of macula densa cells in the initial portion of the distal tubule and juxtaglomerular cells in the walls of the afferent and efferent arterioles. The macula densa is a specialized group

![gu277762836d](gu277762836d.jpg)

Figure 27-10. Structure of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, demonstrating its possible feedback role in the control of nephron function.
of epithelial cells in the distal tubules that comes in close contact with the afferent and efferent arterioles. The macula densa cells contain the Golgi apparatus, which consists of intracellular secretory organelles directed toward the arterioles, suggesting that these cells may be secreting a substance toward the arterioles.

## Decreased Macula Densa Sodium Chloride Causes Dilation of Afferent Arterioles and Increased Renin

Release. The macula densa cells sense changes in sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule by way of signals that are not completely understood. Experimental studies have suggested that a decreased GFR slows the flow rate in the loop of Henle, causing increased reabsorption of the percentage of sodium and chloride ions delivered to the ascending loop of Henle and thereby reducing the concentration of sodium chloride at the macula densa cells. This decrease in sodium chloride concentration initiates a signal from the macula densa that has two effects (Figure 27-11): (1) it decreases resistance to blood flow in the afferent arterioles, which raises glomerular hydrostatic pressure and helps return GFR toward normal; and (2) it increases renin release from the juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles, which are the major storage sites for renin. Renin released from these cells then functions as an enzyme to increase the formation of angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II. Finally, angiotensin II constricts the efferent arterioles, thereby increasing glomerular hydrostatic pressure and helping return GFR toward normal.
![gu287762836d](gu287762836d.jpg)

Figure 27-11. Macula densa feedback mechanism for autoregulation of glomerular hydrostatic pressure and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during decreased renal arterial pressure.

These two components of the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism, operating together by way of the special anatomical structure of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, provide feedback signals to the afferent and efferent arterioles for efficient autoregulation of GFR during changes in arterial pressure. When both of these mechanisms are functioning together, GFR changes by only a few percentage points, even with large fluctuations in arterial pressure between the limits of 75 and 160 mm Hg .

## Blockade of Angiotensin II Formation Further Reduces

Glomerular Filtration Rate During Renal Hypoperfusion. As discussed earlier, a preferential constrictor action of angiotensin II on efferent arterioles helps prevent serious reductions in glomerular hydrostatic pressure and GFR when renal perfusion pressure falls below normal. The administration of drugs that block the formation of angiotensin II (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or that block the action of angiotensin II (angiotensin II receptor antagonists) may cause greater reductions in GFR than usual when the renal arterial pressure falls below normal. Therefore, an important complication of using these drugs to treat patients who have hypertension because of renal artery stenosis (partial blockage of the renal artery) is a severe decrease in GFR that can, in some cases, cause acute renal failure. Nevertheless, angiotensin II-blocking drugs are important therapeutic agents in many patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and other conditions, as long as the patients are monitored to ensure that severe decreases in GFR do not occur.

## MYOGENIC AUTOREGULATION OF RENAL BLOOD FLOW AND GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE

Another mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of a relatively constant renal blood flow and GFR is the ability of individual blood vessels to resist stretching during increased arterial pressure, referred to as the myogenic mechanism. Studies of individual blood vessels (especially small arterioles) throughout the body have shown that they respond to increased wall tension or wall stretch by contraction of the vascular smooth muscle. Stretch of the vascular wall allows increased movement of calcium ions from the extracellular fluid into the cells, causing them to contract through the mechanisms discussed in Chapter 8. This contraction prevents excessive stretch of the vessel and, at the same time, by raising vascular resistance, helps prevent excessive increases in renal blood flow and the GFR when arterial pressure increases.

Although the myogenic mechanism probably operates in most arterioles throughout the body, its importance in renal blood flow and GFR autoregulation has been questioned by some physiologists because this pressuresensitive mechanism has no means of directly detecting changes in renal blood flow or GFR per se. On the other hand, this mechanism may be more important in protecting the kidney from hypertension-induced injury. In response to sudden increases in blood pressure, the myogenic constrictor response in afferent arterioles occurs within seconds and therefore attenuates transmission of increased arterial pressure to the glomerular capillaries.

High Protein Intake and Hyperglycemia Increase Renal Blood Flow and Glomerular Filtration Rate. Although renal blood flow and GFR are relatively stable under most conditions, there are circumstances in which these variables change significantly. For example, a high protein intake is known to increase renal blood flow and GFR. With a long-term, high-protein diet, such as one that contains large amounts of meat, increases in GFR and renal blood flow are due partly to growth of the kidneys. However, the GFR and renal blood flow also increase $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ within 1 or 2 hours after a person eats a high-protein meal.

One likely explanation for the increased GFR is the following. A high-protein meal releases into the blood amino acids, which are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules. Because amino acids and sodium are reabsorbed together by cotransport in the proximal tubules, increased amino acid reabsorption also stimulates sodium reabsorption. This increased reabsorption of sodium decreases sodium delivery to the macula densa (see Figure 27-12), which elicits a tubuloglomerular feedback-mediated decrease in resistance of the afferent arterioles, as discussed earlier. The decreased afferent arteriolar resistance then raises renal blood flow and GFR, allowing sodium excretion to be maintained at a nearly normal level while increasing excretion of the waste products of protein metabolism, such as urea.
![gu297762836d](gu297762836d.jpg)

Figure 27-12. Possible role of macula densa feedback in mediating increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) after a high-protein meal.

A similar mechanism may also explain the marked increases in renal blood flow and the GFR that occur with large increases in blood glucose levels in persons with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Because glucose, like some of the amino acids, is also reabsorbed along with sodium in the proximal tubule, increased glucose delivery to the tubules causes them to reabsorb excess sodium along with glucose. This increased reabsorption of sodium, in turn, decreases the sodium chloride concentration at the macula densa, activating a tubuloglomerular feedback-mediated dilation of the afferent arterioles and subsequent increases in renal blood flow and GFR.

These examples demonstrate that renal blood flow and GFR per se are not the primary variables controlled by the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism. The main purpose of this feedback is to ensure a constant delivery of sodium chloride to the distal tubule, where final processing of the urine takes place. Thus, disturbances that tend to increase the reabsorption of sodium chloride at tubular sites before the macula densa tend to elicit increased renal blood flow and GFR, which helps return distal sodium chloride delivery toward normal so that normal rates of sodium and water excretion can be maintained (see Figure 27-12).

An opposite sequence of events occurs when proximal tubular reabsorption is reduced. For example, when the proximal tubules are damaged (which can occur as a result of poisoning by heavy metals, such as mercury, or large doses of drugs, such as tetracyclines), their ability to reabsorb sodium chloride is decreased. As a consequence, large amounts of sodium chloride are delivered to the distal tubule and, without appropriate compensation, would quickly cause excessive volume depletion. One of the important compensatory responses appears to be a

Table 27-5 Some Conditions That Influence Renal Blood Flow (RBF) and the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)

tubuloglomerular feedback-mediated renal vasoconstriction that occurs in response to the increased sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa in these circumstances. These examples again demonstrate the importance of this feedback mechanism for ensuring that the distal tubules receive the proper rate of delivery of sodium chloride, other tubular fluid solutes, and tubular fluid volume so that appropriate amounts of these substances are excreted in the urine.

Other Factors That Influence Renal Blood Flow and Glomerular Filtration Rate. The GFR and renal blood flow are low at birth, approach normal adult levels after about 2 years of life, and in the absence of kidney disease, are maintained relatively constant until the fourth decade. Thereafter, GFR declines by about $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ per decade, although there is considerable variability among individuals. This decline in GFR coincides with nitric oxide deficiency, increased oxidative stress, and loss of functional nephrons, which may be related partly to increasing blood pressure, metabolic disorders, and other insults that cause cumulative glomerular injury with aging.

Men have higher renal blood flow and GFR than women, even when corrected for body mass. However, men also have a more rapid decline in GFR with aging than premenopausal women. Although the mechanisms responsible for these sex differences are not fully understood, beneficial effects of estrogens and damaging effects of androgens on the kidneys have been suggested as a partial explanation. Table 27-5 summarizes some additional factors that influence renal blood flow and GFR regulation, and should be considered when assessing kidney function.

# Renal Tubular Reabsorption and Secretion 

As the glomerular filtrate enters the renal tubules, it flows sequentially through the successive parts of the tubulethe proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, collecting tubule, and collecting duct-before it is excreted as urine. Along this course, some substances are selectively reabsorbed from the tubules back into the blood, whereas others are secreted from the blood into the tubular lumen. Eventually, the urine that is formed and all the substances in the urine represent the sum of three basic renal pro-cesses-glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion:

## Urinary excretion $=$ Glomerular filtration - Tubular reabsorption + Tubular secretion

For many substances, tubular reabsorption plays a much more important role than secretion in determining the final urinary excretion rate. However, tubular secretion accounts for significant amounts of potassium ions, hydrogen ions, and a few other substances that appear in the urine.

## TUBULAR REABSORPTION IS QUANTITATIVELY LARGE AND HIGHLY SELECTIVE

Table 28-1 shows the renal handling of several substances that are all freely filtered in the kidneys and reabsorbed at variable rates. The rate at which each of these substances is filtered is calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Filtration }=\text { Glomerular filtration rate } \times \\
& \text { Plasma concentration }
\end{aligned}
$$

This calculation assumes that the substance is freely filtered and not bound to plasma proteins. For example, if plasma glucose concentration is $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$, the amount of glucose filtered each day is about $180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day $\times 1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$, or $180 \mathrm{~g} /$ day. Because virtually none of the filtered glucose is normally excreted, the rate of glucose reabsorption is also $180 \mathrm{~g} /$ day.

From Table 28-1, two things are immediately apparent. First, the processes of glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption are quantitatively large relative to urinary
excretion for many substances. Thus, a small change in glomerular filtration or tubular reabsorption can potentially cause a relatively large change in urinary excretion. For example, a $10 \%$ decrease in tubular reabsorption, from 178.5 to $160.7 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, would increase urine volume from 1.5 to $19.3 \mathrm{~L} /$ day (almost a 13 -fold increase) if the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remained constant. In reality, changes in tubular reabsorption and glomerular filtration are closely coordinated so that large fluctuations in urinary excretion are avoided.

Second, unlike glomerular filtration, which is relatively nonselective (essentially all solutes in the plasma are filtered except the plasma proteins or substances bound to them), tubular reabsorption is highly selective. Some substances, such as glucose and amino acids, are almost completely reabsorbed from the tubules, so the urinary excretion rate is essentially zero. Many ions in the plasma, such as sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate, are also highly reabsorbed, but their rates of reabsorption and urinary excretion are variable, depending on the needs of the body. Waste products, such as urea and creatinine, conversely, are poorly reabsorbed from the tubules and are excreted in relatively large amounts.

Therefore, by controlling their reabsorption of different substances, the kidneys regulate excretion of solutes independently of one another, a capability that is essential for precise control of the body fluid composition. In this chapter, we discuss the mechanisms that allow the kidneys to selectively reabsorb or secrete different substances at variable rates.

## TUBULAR REABSORPTION INCLUDES PASSIVE AND ACTIVE MECHANISMS

For a substance to be reabsorbed, it must first be transported (1) across the tubular epithelial membranes into the renal interstitial fluid and then (2) through the peritubular capillary membrane back into the blood (Figure 28-1). Thus, reabsorption of water and solutes includes a series of transport steps. Reabsorption across the tubular epithelium into the interstitial fluid includes active or passive transport by the same basic mechanisms discussed

| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Glucose (g/day) | 180 | 180 | 0 | 100 |

Figure 28-1 Reabsorption of filtered water and solutes from the tubular lumen across the tubular epithelial cells, through the renal interstitium, and back into the blood. Solutes are transported through the cells (transcellular path) by passive diffusion or active transport, or between the cells (paracellular path) by diffusion. Water is transported through the cells and between the tubular cells by osmosis. Transport of water and solutes from the interstitial fluid into the peritubular capillaries occurs by ultrafiltration (bulk flow).
in Chapter 4 for transport across other cell membranes of the body. For example, water and solutes can be transported through the cell membranes (transcellular route) or through the spaces between the cell junctions (paracellular route). Then, after absorption across the tubular epithelial cells into the interstitial fluid, water and solutes are transported through the peritubular capillary walls into the blood by ultrafiltration (bulk flow) that is mediated by hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces. The peritubular capillaries behave like the venous ends of most other capillaries because there is a net reabsorptive force that moves the fluid and solutes from the interstitium into the blood.

## ACTIVE TRANSPORT

Active transport can move a solute against an electrochemical gradient; this requires energy derived from metabolism. Transport that is coupled directly to an energy source, such as the hydrolysis of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), is termed primary active transport. An example of this mechanism is the sodiumpotassium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) pump $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}\right.$ATPase pump) that functions throughout most parts of the renal tubule. Transport that is coupled indirectly to an energy source, such as that due to an ion gradient, is referred to as secondary active transport. Reabsorption of glucose by the renal tubule is an example of secondary active transport. Although solutes can be reabsorbed by active and/or passive mechanisms by the tubule, water is always reabsorbed passively across the tubular epithelial membrane by the process of osmosis.

## Solutes Can Be Transported Through Epithelial Cells

or Between Cells. Renal tubular cells, like other epithelial cells, are held together by tight junctions. Lateral intercellular spaces lie behind the tight junctions and separate the epithelial cells of the tubule. Solutes can be reabsorbed or secreted across the cells through the transcellular pathway or between the cells by moving across the tight junctions and intercellular spaces via the paracellular pathway. Sodium is a substance that moves through both routes, although most of the sodium is transported through the transcellular pathway. In some nephron segments, especially the proximal tubule, water is also reabsorbed across the paracellular pathway, and substances dissolved in the water, especially potassium, magnesium, and chloride ions, are carried with the reabsorbed fluid between the cells.

The special importance of primary active transport is that it can move solutes against an electrochemical gradient. The energy for this active transport comes from the hydrolysis of ATP by way of membrane-bound ATPase, which is also a component of the carrier mechanism that binds and moves solutes across the cell membranes. The primary active transporters in the kidneys that are known include $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase, hydrogen ATPase, hydrogen-potassium ATPase, and calcium ATPase.

A good example of a primary active transport system is the reabsorption of sodium ions across the proximal tubular membrane, as shown in Figure 28-2. On the

![gu317762836d](gu317762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-2 Basic mechanism for active transport of sodium through the tubular epithelial cell. The sodium-potassium pump transports sodium from the interior of the cell across the basolateral membrane, creating a low intracellular sodium concentration and a negative intracellular electrical potential. The low intracellular sodium concentration and negative electrical potential cause sodium ions to diffuse from the tubular lumen into the cell through the brush border.
basolateral sides of the tubular epithelial cell, the cell membrane has an extensive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase system that hydrolyzes ATP and uses the released energy to transport sodium ions out of the cell into the interstitium. At the same time, potassium is transported from the interstitium to the inside of the cell. The operation of this ion pump maintains low intracellular sodium and high intracellular potassium concentrations and creates a net negative charge of about -70 millivolts within the cell. This active pumping of sodium out of the cell across the basolateral membrane of the cell favors passive diffusion of sodium across the luminal membrane of the cell, from the tubular lumen into the cell, for two reasons: (1) there is a concentration gradient favoring sodium diffusion into the cell because the intracellular sodium concentration is low ( $12 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and tubular fluid sodium concentration is high ( $140 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ); and (2) the negative, -70-millivolt, intracellular potential attracts the positive sodium ions from the tubular lumen into the cell.

Active reabsorption of sodium by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase occurs in most parts of the tubule. In certain parts of the nephron, there are also additional provisions for moving large amounts of sodium into the cell. In the proximal tubule, there is an extensive brush border on the luminal side of the membrane (the side that faces the tubular lumen) that multiplies the surface area by about 20 -fold. There are also carrier proteins that bind sodium ions on the luminal surface of the membrane and release them inside the cell, providing facilitated diffusion of sodium through the membrane into the cell. These sodium carrier proteins are also important for secondary active transport of other substances, such as glucose and amino acids, as discussed later.

Thus, the net reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubular lumen back into the blood involves at least three steps:

1. Sodium diffuses across the luminal membrane (also called the apical membrane) into the cell down an electrochemical gradient established by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase pump on the basolateral side of the membrane.
2. Sodium is transported across the basolateral membrane against an electrochemical gradient by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump.
3. Sodium, water, and other substances are reabsorbed from the interstitial fluid into the peritubular capillaries by ultrafiltration, a passive process driven by the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressure gradients.

Secondary Active Reabsorption Through the Tubular Membrane. In secondary active transport, two or more substances interact with a specific membrane protein (a carrier molecule) and are transported together across the membrane. As one of the substances (e.g., sodium) diffuses down its electrochemical gradient, the energy released is used to drive another substance (e.g., glucose) against its electrochemical gradient. Thus, secondary active transport does not require energy directly from ATP or from other high-energy phosphate sources. Rather, the direct source of the energy is that liberated by the simultaneous facilitated diffusion of another transported substance down its own electrochemical gradient.

Figure 28-3 shows secondary active transport of glucose and amino acids in the proximal tubule. In both cases, specific carrier proteins in the brush border combine with a sodium ion and an amino acid or a glucose molecule at the same time. These transport mechanisms are so efficient that they remove virtually all the glucose and amino acids from the tubular lumen. After entry into the cell, glucose and amino acids exit across the basolateral membranes by diffusion, driven by the high glucose and amino acid concentrations in the cell facilitated by specific transport proteins.

Sodium glucose co-transporters (SGLT2 and SGLT1) are located on the brush border of proximal tubular cells and carry glucose into the cell cytoplasm against a concentration gradient, as described previously. Approximately 90\% of the filtered glucose is reabsorbed by SGLT2 in the early part of the proximal tubule ( S 1 segment), and the residual $10 \%$ is transported by SGLT1 in the latter segments of the proximal tubule. On the basolateral side of the membrane, glucose diffuses out of the cell into the interstitial spaces with the help of glucose transporters-GLUT2 in the S1 segment and GLUT1 in the latter part (S3 segment) of the proximal tubule.

Although transport of glucose against a chemical gradient does not directly use ATP, the reabsorption of glucose depends on energy expended by the primary active $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump in the basolateral membrane. Because of the activity of this pump, an electrochemical gradient for

![gu327762836d](gu327762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-3 Mechanisms of secondary active transport. The upper cell shows the co-transport of glucose and amino acids along with sodium ions through the apical side of the tubular epithelial cells, followed by facilitated diffusion through the basolateral membranes. The lower cell shows the counter-transport of hydrogen ions from the interior of the cell across the apical membrane and into the tubular lumen; movement of sodium ions into the cell, down an electrochemical gradient established by the sodium-potassium pump on the basolateral membrane, provides the energy for transport of the hydrogen ions from inside the cell into the tubular lumen. ATP, Adenosine triphosphate; GLUT, glucose transporter; NHE, sodium-hydrogen exchanger; SGLT, sodium-glucose co-transporter.
facilitated diffusion of sodium across the luminal membrane is maintained, and it is this downhill diffusion of sodium to the interior of the cell that provides the energy for the simultaneous uphill transport of glucose across the luminal membrane. Thus, this reabsorption of glucose is referred to as secondary active transport because glucose itself is reabsorbed uphill against a chemical gradient, but it is secondary to primary active transport of sodium.

Another important point is that a substance is said to undergo active transport when at least one of the steps in the reabsorption involves primary or secondary active transport, even though other steps in the reabsorption process may be passive. For glucose reabsorption, secondary active transport occurs at the luminal membrane, but passive facilitated diffusion occurs at the basolateral membrane, and passive uptake by bulk flow occurs at the peritubular capillaries.

Secondary Active Secretion Into the Tubules. Some substances are secreted into the tubules by secondary active transport, which often involves counter-transport of the substance with sodium ions. In counter-transport, the energy liberated from the downhill movement of one of the substances (e.g., sodium ions) enables the uphill movement of a second substance in the opposite direction.

One example of counter-transport, shown in Figure 28-3, is the active secretion of hydrogen ions coupled to sodium reabsorption in the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule. In this case, sodium entry into the cell is coupled with hydrogen extrusion from the cell by sodiumhydrogen counter-transport. This transport is mediated by a specific protein (sodium-hydrogen exchanger) in the brush border of the luminal membrane. As sodium is carried to the interior of the cell, hydrogen ions are forced outward in the opposite direction into the tubular lumen. The basic principles of primary and secondary active transport are discussed in Chapter 4.

## Pinocytosis Is an Active Transport Mechanism for Reabsorption of Proteins. Some parts of the tubule, especially the proximal tubule, reabsorb large molecules such as proteins via pinocytosis, a type of endocytosis. In this process, the protein attaches to the brush border of the luminal membrane, and this portion of the membrane then invaginates to the interior of the cell until it is completely pinched off and a vesicle is formed containing the protein. Once inside the cell, the protein is digested into its constituent amino acids, which are reabsorbed through the basolateral membrane into the interstitial fluid. Because pinocytosis requires energy, it is considered a form of active transport.

## Transport Maximum for Substances That Are Actively

Reabsorbed. For most substances that are actively reabsorbed or secreted, there is a limit to the rate at which the solute can be transported, which is often referred to as the transport maximum. This limit is due to saturation of the specific transport systems involved when the amount of solute delivered to the tubule (referred to as the tubular load) exceeds the capacity of the carrier proteins and specific enzymes involved in the transport process.

The glucose transport system in the proximal tubule is a good example. Normally, measurable glucose does not appear in the urine because essentially all the filtered glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. However, when the filtered load exceeds the capability of the tubules to reabsorb glucose, urinary excretion of glucose does occur.

In the adult human, the transport maximum for glucose averages about $375 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$, whereas the filtered load of glucose is only about $125 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ (GFR $\times$ plasma glucose $=125 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} \times 1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ ). With large increases in GFR and/or plasma glucose concentration that increase the filtered load of glucose above $375 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$, the excess glucose filtered is not reabsorbed and passes into the urine.

Figure 28-4 shows the relationship between plasma concentration of glucose, filtered load of glucose, tubular transport maximum for glucose, and rate of glucose loss in the urine. Note that when the plasma glucose concentration is $100 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{ml}$ and the filtered load is at its normal level ( $125 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ ), there is no loss of glucose in the urine. However, when the plasma concentration of glucose rises above about $200 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{ml}$, increasing the filtered load to about $250 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$, a small amount of glucose begins to appear in the urine. This point is termed the threshold for

![gu337762836d](gu337762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-4 Relationships among the filtered load of glucose, rate of glucose reabsorption by the renal tubules, and rate of glucose excretion in the urine. The transport maximum is the maximum rate at which glucose can be reabsorbed from the tubules. The threshold for glucose refers to the filtered load of glucose at which glucose first begins to be excreted in the urine.
glucose. Note that this appearance of glucose in the urine (at the threshold) occurs before the transport maximum is reached. One reason for the difference between the threshold and transport maximum is that not all nephrons have the same transport maximum for glucose, and some of the nephrons therefore begin to excrete glucose before others have reached their transport maximum. The overall transport maximum for the kidneys, which is normally about $375 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$, is reached when all nephrons have reached their maximal capacity to reabsorb glucose.

The plasma glucose of a healthy person almost never becomes high enough to cause glucose excretion in the urine, even after eating a meal. However, in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, plasma glucose concentration may rise to high levels, causing the filtered load of glucose to exceed the transport maximum and resulting in urinary glucose excretion. Some of the important transport maximums for substances actively reabsorbed by the tubules are as follows:

| Substance | Transport Maximum |
| :-- | :-- |
| Glucose | $375 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ |
| Phosphate | $0.10 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{min}$ |
| Sulfate | $0.06 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{min}$ |
| Amino acids | $1.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{min}$ |
| Urate | $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ |
| Lactate | $75 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ |
| Plasma protein | $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ |

Transport Maximums for Actively Secreted Substances. Substances that are actively secreted also exhibit transport maximums, as follows:

| Substance | Transport Maximum |
| :-- | :-- |
| Creatinine | $16 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ |
| Para-aminohippuric acid | $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ |

Substances That Are Actively Transported but Do Not Exhibit a Transport Maximum. The reason that actively transported solutes often exhibit a transport maximum is that the transport carrier system becomes saturated as the tubular load increases. Some substances that are actively reabsorbed do not demonstrate a transport maximum because their rate of transport is determined by other factors, such as the following: (1) the electrochemical gradient for diffusion of the substance across the membrane; (2) the permeability of the membrane for the substance; and (3) the time that the fluid containing the substance remains within the tubule. Transport of this type is referred to as gradient-time transport because the rate of transport depends on the electrochemical gradient and the time that the substance is in the tubule, which in turn depends on the tubular flow rate.

An example of gradient-time transport is sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, where the maximum transport capacity of the basolateral $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase pump is usually far greater than the actual rate of net sodium reabsorption because a significant amount of sodium transported out of the cell leaks back into the tubular lumen through junctions of the epithelial cells. The rate at which this backleak occurs depends on (1) the permeability of the tight junctions; and (2) the interstitial physical forces, which determine the rate of bulk flow reabsorption from the interstitial fluid into the peritubular capillaries. Therefore, sodium transport in the proximal tubules obeys mainly gradient-time transport principles rather than tubular maximum transport characteristics. This observation means that the higher the concentration of sodium in the proximal tubules, the higher is its reabsorption rate. Also, the slower the flow rate of tubular fluid, the greater the percentage of sodium that can be reabsorbed from the proximal tubules.

In the more distal parts of the nephron, the epithelial cells have much tighter junctions and transport much smaller amounts of sodium. In these segments, sodium reabsorption exhibits a transport maximum similar to that for other actively transported substances. Furthermore, this transport maximum can be increased by certain hormones, such as aldosterone.

## PASSIVE WATER REABSORPTION BY OSMOSIS COUPLED MAINLY TO SODIUM REABSORPTION

When solutes are transported out of the tubule by primary or secondary active transport, their concentrations tend to decrease inside the tubule while increasing in the renal interstitium. This phenomenon creates a concentration difference that causes osmosis of water in the

same direction that the solutes are transported, from the tubular lumen to the renal interstitium. Some parts of the renal tubule, especially the proximal tubule, are highly permeable to water, and water reabsorption occurs so rapidly that there is only a small concentration gradient for solutes across the tubular membrane.

A large part of the osmotic flow of water in the proximal tubules occurs through water channels (aquaporins) in the cell membranes, as well as through the tight junctions between the epithelial cells. As noted previously, the junctions between the cells are not as tight as their name would imply and permit significant diffusion of water and small ions. This condition is especially true in the proximal tubules, which have a high permeability for water and a smaller but significant permeability to most ions, such as sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, and magnesium.

Water moving across the tight junctions by osmosis also carries with it some of the solutes, a process referred to as solvent drag. In addition, because the reabsorption of water, organic solutes, and ions is coupled to sodium reabsorption, changes in sodium reabsorption significantly influence the reabsorption of water and many other solutes.

In the more distal parts of the nephron, beginning in the loop of Henle and extending through the collecting tubule, the tight junctions become far less permeable to water and solutes, and the epithelial cells also have a greatly decreased membrane surface area. Therefore, water cannot move easily across the tight junctions of the tubular membrane by osmosis. However, antidiuretic hormone $(\mathrm{ADH})$ greatly increases the water permeability in the distal and collecting tubules.

Thus, water movement across the tubular epithelium can occur only if the membrane is permeable to water, no matter how large the osmotic gradient. In the proximal tubule and descending loop of Henle, water permeability is always high, and water is rapidly reabsorbed to reach osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding interstitial fluid. This high permeability is due to abundant expression of the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) in the luminal and basolateral membranes. In the ascending loop of Henle, water permeability is always low, so almost no water is reabsorbed, despite a large osmotic gradient. Water permeability in the last parts of the tubules-the distal tubules, collecting tubules, and collecting ductsoccurs through aquaporins and can be high or low, depending on the presence or absence of ADH.

## REABSORPTION OF CHLORIDE, UREA, AND OTHER SOLUTES BY PASSIVE DIFFUSION

When sodium is reabsorbed through the tubular epithelial cell, negative ions such as chloride are transported along with sodium because of electrical potentials. That is, transport of positively charged sodium ions out of the lumen leaves the inside of the lumen negatively charged, compared with the interstitial fluid causing chloride ions
![gu347762836d](gu347762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-5 Mechanisms whereby water, chloride, and urea reabsorption are coupled with sodium reabsorption.
to diffuse passively through the paracellular pathway. Additional reabsorption of chloride ions occurs because of a chloride concentration gradient that develops when water is reabsorbed from the tubule by osmosis, thereby concentrating the chloride ions in the tubular lumen (Figure 28-5). Thus, active reabsorption of sodium is closely coupled to passive reabsorption of chloride by way of an electrical potential and a chloride concentration gradient.

Chloride ions can also be reabsorbed by secondary active transport. The most important of the secondary active transport processes for chloride reabsorption involves the co-transport of chloride with sodium across the luminal membrane.

Urea is also passively reabsorbed from the tubule, but to a much lesser extent than chloride ions. As water is reabsorbed from the tubules (by osmosis coupled to sodium reabsorption), urea concentration in the tubular lumen increases (see Figure 28-5). This increase creates a concentration gradient favoring reabsorption of urea. However, urea does not permeate the tubule as readily as water. In some parts of the nephron, especially the inner medullary collecting duct, passive urea reabsorption is facilitated by specific urea transporters. Yet, only about half of the urea that is filtered by the glomerular capillaries is reabsorbed from the tubules. The remaining urea passes into the urine, allowing the kidneys to excrete large amounts of this waste product of metabolism. In mammals, more than $90 \%$ of waste nitrogen, mainly generated in the liver as a product of protein metabolism, is normally excreted by the kidneys as urea.

Another waste product of metabolism, creatinine, is an even larger molecule than urea and is essentially impermeant to the tubular membrane. Therefore, almost none of the creatinine that is filtered is reabsorbed, so virtually all the creatinine filtered by the glomerulus is excreted in the urine.

![gu357762836d](gu357762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-6 Cellular ultrastructure and primary transport characteristics of the proximal tubule. The proximal tubules reabsorb about $65 \%$ of the filtered sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and potassium and essentially all the filtered glucose and amino acids. The proximal tubules also secrete organic acids, bases, and hydrogen ions into the tubular lumen.

## REABSORPTION AND SECRETION ALONG DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE NEPHRON

In the previous sections, we discussed the basic principles whereby water and solutes are transported across the tubular membrane. With these generalizations in mind, we can now discuss the different characteristics of the individual tubular segments that enable them to perform their specific functions. Only the tubular transport functions that are quantitatively most important will be discussed, especially as they relate to the reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and water. In subsequent chapters, we discuss the reabsorption and secretion of other substances in different parts of the tubular system.

## PROXIMAL TUBULAR REABSORPTION

Normally, about $65 \%$ of the filtered load of sodium and water and a slightly lower percentage of filtered chloride are reabsorbed by the proximal tubule before the filtrate reaches the loops of Henle. These percentages can be increased or decreased in different physiological conditions, as discussed later.

Proximal Tubules Have High Capacity for Active and Passive Reabsorption. The high capacity of the proximal tubule for reabsorption results from its special cellular characteristics, as shown in Figure 28-6. The proximal tubule epithelial cells are highly metabolic and have large numbers of mitochondria to support powerful active transport processes. In addition, the proximal tubular cells have an extensive brush border on the luminal (apical) side of the membrane, as well as an extensive labyrinth of intercellular and basal channels, all of which together provide an extensive membrane surface area on the luminal and basolateral sides of the epithelium for rapid transport of sodium ions and other substances.

The extensive membrane surface of the epithelial brush border is also loaded with protein carrier molecules that transport a large fraction of the sodium ions across the luminal membrane linked via the co-transport mechanism with multiple organic nutrients such as amino acids and glucose. Additional sodium is transported from the tubular lumen into the cell by counter-transport mechanisms that reabsorb sodium while secreting other substances into the tubular lumen, especially hydrogen ions. As discussed in Chapter 31, secretion of hydrogen ions into the tubular lumen is an important step in the removal of bicarbonate ions from the tubule (by combining $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ with the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which then dissociates into $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ).

Although the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump provides the major force for the reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and water throughout proximal tubule, there are some differences in the mechanisms whereby sodium and chloride are transported through the luminal side of the early and late portions of the proximal tubular membrane.

In the first half of the proximal tubule, sodium is reabsorbed by co-transport along with glucose, amino acids, and other solutes. However, in the second half of the proximal tubule, little glucose and few amino acids remain to be reabsorbed. Instead, sodium is now reabsorbed, mainly with chloride ions. The second half of the proximal tubule has a relatively high concentration of chloride ( $\approx 140$ $\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) compared with the early proximal tubule ( $\approx 105$ $\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) because when sodium is reabsorbed, it preferentially carries with it glucose, bicarbonate, and organic ions in the early proximal tubule, leaving behind a solution that has a higher concentration of chloride. In the second half of the proximal tubule, the higher chloride concentration favors diffusion of this ion from the tubule lumen through the intercellular junctions into the renal interstitial fluid. Smaller amounts of chloride may also be reabsorbed through specific chloride channels in the proximal tubular cell membrane.

Concentrations of Solutes Along Proximal Tubules. Figure 28-7 summarizes the changes in concentration of various solutes along the proximal tubule. Although the amount of sodium in the tubular fluid decreases markedly along the proximal tubule, sodium concentration (and total osmolarity) remains relatively constant because water permeability of the proximal tubules is so great that water reabsorption keeps pace with sodium reabsorption. Certain organic solutes, such as glucose, amino acids, and bicarbonate, are much more avidly reabsorbed than water, and their concentrations decrease markedly along the length of the proximal tubule. Other organic solutes that are less permeant and not actively reabsorbed, such as creatinine, increase their concentration along the proximal tubule. The total solute concentration, as reflected by osmolarity, remains essentially the same all along the proximal tubule because of the extremely high permeability of this part of the nephron to water.

![gu367762836d](gu367762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-7 Changes in concentrations of different substances in tubular fluid along the proximal convoluted tubule relative to the concentrations of these substances in the plasma and glomerular filtrate. A value of 1.0 indicates that the concentration of the substance in the tubular fluid is the same as the concentration in the plasma. Values below 1.0 indicate that the substance is reabsorbed more avidly than water, whereas values above 1.0 indicate that the substance is reabsorbed to a lesser extent than water or is secreted into the tubules.

Secretion of Organic Acids and Bases by Proximal Tubules. The proximal tubule is also an important site for secretion of organic acids and bases such as bile salts, oxalate, urate, and catecholamines. Many of these substances are the end products of metabolism and must be rapidly removed from the body. The secretion of these substances into the proximal tubule plus filtration into the proximal tubule by the glomerular capillaries and almost total lack of reabsorption by the tubules, all combined, contribute to rapid excretion in the urine.

In addition to the waste products of metabolism, the kidneys secrete many potentially harmful drugs or toxins into the tubules and rapidly clear these substances from the blood. In the case of certain drugs, such as penicillin and salicylates, the rapid clearance by the kidneys creates a challenge in maintaining a therapeutically effective drug concentration.

Another compound that is rapidly secreted by the proximal tubule is para-aminohippuric acid (PAH). PAH is secreted so rapidly that the average person can clear about $90 \%$ of the PAH from the plasma flowing through the kidneys and excrete it in the urine. For this reason, the rate of PAH clearance can be used to estimate the renal plasma flow (RPF), as discussed later.

## SOLUTE AND WATER TRANSPORT IN LOOPS OF HENLE

The loop of Henle consists of three functionally distinct segments-the thin descending segment, thin ascending segment, and thick ascending segment. The thin
![gu377762836d](gu377762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-8 Cellular ultrastructure and transport characteristics of the thin descending loop of Henle (top) and thick ascending segment of the loop of Henle (bottom). The descending part of the thin segment of the loop of Henle is highly permeable to water and moderately permeable to most solutes but has few mitochondria and little or no active reabsorption. The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle reabsorbs about $25 \%$ of the filtered loads of sodium, chloride, and potassium, as well as large amounts of calcium, bicarbonate, and magnesium. This segment also secretes hydrogen ions into the tubular lumen.
descending and thin ascending segments, as their names imply, have thin epithelial membranes with no brush borders, few mitochondria, and minimal levels of metabolic activity (Figure 28-8).

The descending part of the thin segment is highly permeable to water and moderately permeable to most solutes, including urea and sodium. The function of this nephron segment is mainly to allow simple diffusion of substances through its walls. About $20 \%$ of the filtered water is reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, and almost all of this occurs in the thin descending limb. The ascending limb, including both the thin and thick portions, is virtually impermeable to water, a characteristic that is important for concentrating the urine.

The thick segment of the loop of Henle, which begins about halfway up the ascending limb, has thick epithelial cells that have high metabolic activity and are capable of active reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and potassium (see Figure 28-8). About $25 \%$ of the filtered loads of sodium, chloride, and potassium are reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, mostly in the thick ascending limb. Considerable amounts of other ions, such as calcium, bicarbonate, and magnesium, are also reabsorbed in the thick

![gu387762836d](gu387762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-9 Mechanisms of sodium, chloride, and potassium transport in the thick ascending loop of Henle. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump in the basolateral cell membrane maintains a low intracellular sodium concentration and a negative electrical potential in the cell. The 1-sodium, 2-chloride, 1-potassium co-transporter in the luminal membrane transports these three ions from the tubular lumen into the cells, using the potential energy released by the diffusion of sodium down an electrochemical gradient into the cells. Sodium is also transported into the tubular cell by sodium-hydrogen countertransport. The positive charge ( +8 mV ) of the tubular lumen relative to the interstitial fluid forces cations such as $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to diffuse from the lumen to the interstitial fluid via the paracellular pathway.
ascending loop of Henle. The thin segment of the ascending limb has a much lower reabsorptive capacity than the thick segment, and the thin descending limb does not reabsorb significant amounts of any of these solutes.

An important component of solute reabsorption in the thick ascending limb is the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump in the epithelial cell basolateral membranes. As in the proximal tubule, the reabsorption of other solutes in the thick segment of the ascending loop of Henle is closely linked to the reabsorptive capability of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump, which maintains a low intracellular sodium concentration. The low intracellular sodium concentration in turn provides a favorable gradient for movement of sodium from the tubular fluid into the cell. In the thick ascending loop, movement of sodium across the luminal membrane is mediated primarily by a 1-sodium, 2-chloride, 1-potassium cotransporter (NKCC2) (Figure 28-9). This co-transport protein in the luminal membrane uses the potential energy released by downhill diffusion of sodium into the cell to drive the reabsorption of potassium into the cell against a concentration gradient.

The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is the site of action of the powerful loop diuretics furosemide, ethacrynic acid, and bumetanide, all of which inhibit the action of the NKCC2 co-transporter. These diuretics are
discussed in Chapter 32. The thick ascending limb also has a sodium-hydrogen counter-transport mechanism in its luminal cell membrane that mediates sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion (see Figure 28-9).

There is also significant paracellular reabsorption of cations, such as $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, in the thick ascending limb as a result of the slight positive charge of the tubular lumen relative to the interstitial fluid. Although the NKCC2 co-transporter moves equal amounts of cations and anions into the cell, there is a slight backleak of potassium ions into the lumen, creating a positive charge of about +8 millivolts in the tubular lumen. This positive charge forces cations such as $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to diffuse from the tubular lumen through the paracellular space and into the interstitial fluid.

The thick segment of the ascending loop of Henle is virtually impermeable to water. Therefore, most of the water delivered to this segment remains in the tubule, despite reabsorption of large amounts of solute. The tubular fluid in the ascending limb becomes very dilute as it flows toward the distal tubule, a feature that is important in allowing the kidneys to dilute or concentrate the urine under different conditions, as discussed in more detail in Chapter 29.

## DISTAL TUBULES

The thick segment of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle empties into the distal tubule. The first portion of the distal tubule forms the macula densa, a group of closely packed epithelial cells that is part of the juxtaglomerular complex and provides feedback control of the GFR and blood flow in this same nephron.

The next part of the distal tubule is highly convoluted and has many of the same reabsorptive characteristics of the thick segment of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. That is, it avidly reabsorbs most of the ions, including sodium, potassium, and chloride, but is virtually impermeable to water and urea. For this reason, it is referred to as the diluting segment because it also dilutes the tubular fluid.

Approximately 5\% of the filtered load of sodium chloride is reabsorbed in the early distal tubule. The sodiumchloride co-transporter moves sodium chloride from the tubular lumen into the cell, and the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump transports sodium out of the cell across the basolateral membrane (Figure 28-10). Chloride diffuses out of cell into the renal interstitial fluid through chloride channels in the basolateral membrane.

The thiazide diuretics, which are widely used to treat disorders such as hypertension and heart failure, inhibit the sodium-chloride co-transporter.

## LATE DISTAL TUBULES AND CORTICAL COLLECTING TUBULES

The second half of the distal tubule and subsequent cortical collecting tubule have similar functional characteristics. Anatomically, they are composed of two distinct cell types, the principal cells and intercalated cells

![gu397762836d](gu397762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-10 Mechanism of sodium chloride transport in the early distal tubule. Sodium and chloride are transported from the tubular lumen into the cell by a co-transporter that is inhibited by thiazide diuretics. Sodium is pumped out of the cell by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase adenosine triphosphatase, and chloride diffuses into the interstitial fluid via chloride channels.
(Figure 28-11). The principal cells reabsorb sodium and water from the lumen and secrete potassium ions into the lumen. The type A intercalated cells reabsorb potassium ions and secrete hydrogen ions into the tubular lumen.

## Principal Cells Reabsorb Sodium and Secrete Potassium.

Sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion by the principal cells depend on the activity of a $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump in each cell's basolateral membrane (Figure 28-12). This pump maintains a low sodium concentration inside the cell and, therefore, favors sodium diffusion into the cell through special channels. Secretion of potassium by these cells from the blood into the tubular lumen involves two steps: (1) potassium enters the cell because of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump, which maintains a high intracellular potassium concentration; and (2) once in the cell, potassium diffuses down its concentration gradient across the luminal membrane into the tubular fluid.

The principal cells are the primary sites of action of the potassium-sparing diuretics, including spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride, and triamterene. Spironolactone and eplerenone are mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists that compete with aldosterone for receptor sites in the principal cells and therefore inhibit the stimulatory effects of aldosterone on sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. Amiloride and triamterene are sodium channel blockers that directly inhibit the entry of sodium into the sodium channels of the luminal membranes and therefore reduce the amount of sodium that can be transported across the basolateral membranes by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump. This, in turn, decreases transport of potassium into the cells and ultimately reduces potassium secretion into the tubular fluid. For this reason, sodium channel blockers, as well as aldosterone antagonists, decrease urinary excretion of potassium and act as potassium-sparing diuretics.

Figure 28-11 Cellular ultrastructure and transport characteristics of the early distal tubule and late distal tubule and collecting tubule. The early distal tubule has many of the same characteristics as the thick ascending loop of Henle and reabsorbs sodium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium but is virtually impermeable to water and urea. The late distal tubules and cortical collecting tubules are composed of two distinct cell types, the principal cells and intercalated cells. The principal cells reabsorb sodium from the lumen and secrete potassium ions into the lumen. Type A intercalated cells reabsorb potassium and bicarbonate ions from the lumen and secrete hydrogen ions into the lumen. The reabsorption of water from this tubular segment is controlled by the concentration of antidiuretic hormone.

Intercalated Cells Can Secrete or Reabsorb Hydrogen, Bicarbonate, and Potassium Ions. Intercalated cells play a major role in acid-base regulation and constitute $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ of the cells in the collecting tubules and collecting ducts. There are two types of intercalated cells, type A and type B (Figure 28-13). Type A intercalated cells secrete hydrogen ions by a hydrogen-ATPase transporter and by a hydrogen-potassium-ATPase transporter. Hydrogen is generated in this cell by the action of carbonic anhydrase on water and carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid, which then dissociates into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions. The hydrogen ions are then secreted into the tubular lumen and, for each hydrogen ion secreted, a bicarbonate ion becomes available for reabsorption across the basolateral membrane. Type A intercalated cells are especially important in eliminating hydrogen ions while reabsorbing bicarbonate in acidosis.

Type B intercalated cells have functions opposite to those of type A cells and secrete bicarbonate into the tubular lumen while reabsorbing hydrogen ions in alkalosis. Type B intercalated cells have hydrogen and bicarbonate

Figure 28-12 Mechanism of sodium-chloride reabsorption and potassium secretion in the principal cells of the late distal tubules and cortical collecting tubules. Sodium enters the cell through special channels and is transported out of the cell by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump. Aldosterone antagonists compete with aldosterone for binding sites in the cell and therefore inhibit the effects of aldosterone to stimulate sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. Sodium channel blockers directly inhibit the entry of sodium into the sodium channels.
transporters on opposite sides of the cell membrane compared with type A cells. The chloride-bicarbonate counter-transporter on the apical membrane of type B cells is called pendrin and is different than the chloridebicarbonate transporter of type A cells. Hydrogen ions are actively transported out of the type B intercalated cell on the basolateral side of the cell membrane by hydrogenATPase, and bicarbonate is secreted into the lumen, thus eliminating excess plasma bicarbonate in alkalosis. Induction of chronic metabolic alkalosis increases the number of type B intercalated cells, which contribute to increased excretion of bicarbonate, whereas acidosis increases the number of type A cells.

A more detailed discussion of this mechanism is presented in Chapter 31. The intercalated cells can also reabsorb or secrete potassium ions, as shown in Figure 28-13.

The functional characteristics of the late distal tubule and cortical collecting tubule can be summarized as follows:

1. The tubular membranes of both segments are almost completely impermeable to urea, similar to the diluting segment of the early distal tubule. Thus, almost all the urea that enters these segments passes on through and into the collecting duct to be excreted in the urine, although some reabsorption of urea occurs in the medullary collecting ducts.
2. Both the late distal tubule and cortical collecting tubule segments reabsorb sodium ions, and the rate of reabsorption is controlled by hormones, especially aldosterone. At the same time, these segments secrete potassium ions from the peritubular capillary blood
![gu427762836d](gu427762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-13 Type $A$ and type $B$ intercalated cells of the collecting tubule. Type A cells contain hydrogen-ATPase and hydrogen-potassium-ATPase in the luminal membrane and secrete hydrogen ions while reabsorbing bicarbonate and potassium ions in acidosis. In type B cells, the hydrogen-ATPase and hydrogen-potassium-ATPase transporters are located in the basolateral membrane and reabsorb hydrogen ions while secreting bicarbonate and potassium ions in alkalosis. The chloride-bicarbonate counter-transporter on the apical membrane of type B cells is called pendrin and is different than the chloride-bicarbonate transporter of type A intercalated cells.
into the tubular lumen, a process that is also controlled by aldosterone and other factors, such as the concentration of potassium ions in the body fluids.
3. The type A intercalated cells of these nephron segments can avidly secrete hydrogen ions by an active hydrogen-ATPase mechanism in acidosis. This process is different from the secondary active secretion of hydrogen ions by the proximal tubule because it is capable of secreting hydrogen ions against a large concentration gradient, as much as 1000 to 1 . This is in contrast to the relatively small gradient (4- to 10 -fold) for hydrogen ions that can be achieved by secondary active secretion in the proximal tubule.

![gu437762836d](gu437762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-14 Cellular ultrastructure and transport characteristics of the medullary collecting duct. The medullary collecting ducts actively reabsorb sodium and secrete hydrogen ions and are permeable to urea, which is reabsorbed in these tubular segments. The reabsorption of water in medullary collecting ducts is controlled by the concentration of antidiuretic hormone.

In alkalosis, the type B intercalated cells secrete bicarbonate and actively reabsorb hydrogen ions. Thus, the intercalated cells play a key role in acidbase regulation of the body fluids.
4. The permeability of the late distal tubule and cortical collecting duct to water is controlled by the concentration of ADH , which is also called vasopressin. With high levels of ADH , these tubular segments are permeable to water but, in the absence of ADH , they are virtually impermeable to water. This special characteristic provides an important mechanism for controlling the degree of dilution or concentration of the urine.

## MEDULLARY COLLECTING DUCTS

Although the medullary collecting ducts usually reabsorb less than $5 \%$ of the filtered water and sodium, they are the final site for processing the urine and, therefore, play a critical role in determining the final urine output of water and solutes.

The epithelial cells of the collecting ducts are nearly cuboidal in shape, with smooth surfaces and relatively few mitochondria (Figure 28-14). Special characteristics of this tubular segment are as follows:

1. The permeability of the medullary collecting duct to water is controlled by the level of ADH . With high levels of ADH , water is avidly reabsorbed into the medullary interstitium, thereby reducing the urine volume and concentrating most of the solutes in the urine.
2. Unlike the cortical collecting tubule, the medullary collecting duct is permeable to urea, and there are special urea transporters that facilitate urea diffusion across the luminal and basolateral membranes. Therefore, some of the tubular urea is reabsorbed into the medullary interstitium, helping raise the osmolality in this region of the kidneys and contributing to the kidneys' overall ability to form concentrated urine. This topic is discussed in Chapter 29.
3. The medullary collecting duct is capable of secreting hydrogen ions against a large concentration

Figure 28-15 Changes in average concentrations of different substances at different points in the tubular system relative to the concentration of that substance in the plasma and glomerular filtrate. A value of 1.0 indicates that the concentration of the substance in the tubular fluid is the same as the concentration of that substance in the plasma. Values below 1.0 indicate that the substance is reabsorbed more avidly than water, whereas values above 1.0 indicate that the substance is reabsorbed to a lesser extent than water or is secreted into the tubules. PAH, Para-aminohippuric acid.
gradient, as also occurs in the cortical collecting tubule. Thus, the medullary collecting duct also plays a key role in regulating acid-base balance.

## SUMMARY OF CONCENTRATIONS OF DIFFERENT SOLUTES IN DIFFERENT TUBULAR SEGMENTS

Whether a solute will become concentrated in the tubular fluid is determined by the relative degree of reabsorption of that solute versus the reabsorption of water. If a greater percentage of water is reabsorbed, the substance becomes more concentrated. If a greater percentage of the solute is reabsorbed, the substance becomes more diluted.

Figure 28-15 shows the degree of concentration of several substances in different tubular segments. All the values in this figure represent the tubular fluid concentration divided by the plasma concentration of a substance. If plasma concentration of the substance is assumed to be constant, any change in the tubular fluid/plasma concentration ratio reflects changes in tubular fluid concentration.

As the filtrate moves along the tubular system, the concentration rises progressively to higher than 1.0 if more water is reabsorbed than solute, or if there has been a net secretion of the solute into the tubular fluid. If the concentration ratio becomes progressively less than 1.0 , this

means that relatively more solute has been reabsorbed than water.

The substances represented at the top of Figure 28-15, such as creatinine, become highly concentrated in the urine. In general, these substances are not needed by the body, and the kidneys have become adapted to reabsorb them only slightly or not at all or even to secrete them into the tubules, thereby excreting large quantities into the urine. Conversely, the substances represented at the bottom of the figure, such as glucose and amino acids, are all strongly reabsorbed. These are all substances that the body needs to conserve, and almost none of them are lost in the urine.

Tubular Fluid/Plasma Inulin Concentration Ratio Can Be Used to Assess Water Reabsorption by Renal Tubules. Inulin, a polysaccharide used to measure the GFR, is not reabsorbed or secreted by the renal tubules. Changes in inulin concentration at different points along the renal tubule, therefore, reflect changes in the amount of water present in the tubular fluid.

For example, the tubular fluid/plasma concentration ratio for inulin rises to about 3.0 at the end of the proximal tubules, indicating that inulin concentration in the tubular fluid is three times greater than in the plasma and glomerular filtrate. Because inulin is not secreted or reabsorbed from the tubules, a tubular fluid/plasma concentration ratio of 3.0 means that only one-third of the water that was filtered remains in the renal tubule and that two-thirds of the filtered water has been reabsorbed as the fluid passes through the proximal tubule. At the end of the collecting ducts, the tubular fluid/plasma inulin concentration ratio rises to about 125 (see Figure 28-15), indicating that only $1 / 125$ of the filtered water remains in the tubule and that more than $99 \%$ has been reabsorbed.

## REGULATION OF TUBULAR REABSORPTION

Because it is essential to maintain a precise balance between tubular reabsorption and glomerular filtration, there are multiple nervous, hormonal, and local control mechanisms that regulate tubular reabsorption, just as there are for control of glomerular filtration. An important feature of tubular reabsorption is that reabsorption of some solutes can be regulated independently of others, especially through hormonal control mechanisms.

## GLOMERULOTUBULAR BALANCEREABSORPTION RATE INCREASES IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED TUBULAR LOAD

One of the most basic mechanisms for controlling tubular reabsorption is the intrinsic ability of the tubules to increase their reabsorption rate in response to increased tubular load (increased tubular inflow). This phenomenon is referred to as glomerulotubular balance. For example, if the GFR increases from 125 to $150 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, the absolute
rate of proximal tubular reabsorption also increases from about $81 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}(65 \%$ of GFR) to about $97.5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}(65 \%$ of GFR). Thus, glomerulotubular balance refers to the fact that the total rate of reabsorption increases as the filtered load increases, even though the percentage of GFR reabsorbed in the proximal tubule remains relatively constant, at about $65 \%$.

Some degree of glomerulotubular balance also occurs in other tubular segments, especially the loop of Henle. The precise mechanisms responsible for this are not fully understood but may be due partly to changes in physical forces in the tubule and surrounding renal interstitium, as discussed later. It is clear that the mechanisms for glomerulotubular balance can occur independently of hormones and can be demonstrated in completely isolated kidneys or even in completely isolated proximal tubular segments.

Glomerulotubular balance helps prevent overloading of the distal tubular segments when GFR increases. Glomerulotubular balance acts as another line of defense to buffer the effects of spontaneous changes in the GFR on urine output. (The other line of defense, discussed earlier, includes the renal autoregulatory mechanisms, especially tubuloglomerular feedback, which help prevent large changes in GFR.) Working together, the autoregulatory and glomerulotubular balance mechanisms prevent large changes in fluid flow in the distal tubules when the arterial pressure changes or when there are other disturbances that would otherwise upset sodium and volume homeostasis.

## PERITUBULAR CAPILLARY AND RENAL INTERSTITIAL FLUID PHYSICAL FORCES

Hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces govern the rate of reabsorption across the peritubular capillaries, just as they control filtration in the glomerular capillaries. Changes in peritubular capillary reabsorption can in turn influence the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures of the renal interstitium and, ultimately, reabsorption of water and solutes from the renal tubules.

## Normal Values for Physical Forces and Reabsorption

Rate. As the glomerular filtrate passes through the renal tubules, more than $99 \%$ of the water and most of the solutes are normally reabsorbed. Fluid and electrolytes are reabsorbed from the tubules into the renal interstitium and from there into the peritubular capillaries. The normal rate of peritubular capillary reabsorption is about $124 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$.

Reabsorption across the peritubular capillaries can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text { Reabsorption }=\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}} \times \text { Net reabsorptive force }
$$

The net reabsorptive force represents the sum of the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces that favor or oppose reabsorption across the peritubular capillaries. These forces include the following: (1) hydrostatic pressure inside the peritubular capillaries (peritubular hydrostatic pressure $\left[\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{c}}\right]$ ), which opposes reabsorption;

![gu457762836d](gu457762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-16 Summary of the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces that determine fluid reabsorption by the peritubular capillaries. The numerical values shown are estimates of the normal values for humans. The net reabsorptive pressure is normally about 10 mm Hg , causing fluid and solutes to be reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries as they are transported across the renal tubular cells. ATP, Adenosine triphosphate; $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$, peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure; $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{d}}$, interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure; $\pi_{\mathrm{c}}$, peritubular capillary colloid osmotic pressure; $\pi_{\mathrm{d}}$, interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure.
(2) hydrostatic pressure in the renal interstitium $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{d}}\right)$ outside the capillaries, which favors reabsorption; (3) colloid osmotic pressure of the peritubular capillary plasma proteins $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$, which favors reabsorption; and (4) colloid osmotic pressure of the proteins in the renal interstitium $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{d}}\right)$, which opposes reabsorption.

Figure 28-16 shows the approximate normal forces that favor and oppose peritubular reabsorption. Because the normal peritubular capillary pressure averages about 13 mm Hg and the renal interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure averages 6 mm Hg , there is a positive hydrostatic pressure gradient from the peritubular capillary to the interstitial fluid of about 7 mm Hg , which opposes fluid reabsorption. This opposition to fluid reabsorption is more than counterbalanced by the colloid osmotic pressures that favor reabsorption. The plasma colloid osmotic pressure, which favors reabsorption, is about 32 mm Hg , and the colloid osmotic pressure of the interstitium, which opposes reabsorption, is 15 mm Hg , causing a net colloid osmotic force of about 17 mm Hg , favoring reabsorption. Therefore, subtracting the net hydrostatic forces that oppose reabsorption ( 7 mm Hg ) from the net colloid osmotic forces that favor reabsorption ( 17 mm Hg ) gives a net reabsorptive force of about 10 mm Hg . This value is high, similar to that found in the glomerular capillaries, but in the opposite direction.

The other factor that contributes to the high rate of fluid reabsorption in the peritubular capillaries is a large filtration coefficient $\left(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ because of the high hydraulic conductivity and large surface area of the capillaries. Because the reabsorption rate is normally about $124 \mathrm{ml} /$ min and net reabsorption pressure is $10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ normally is about $12.4 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per mm Hg .

## Regulation of Peritubular Capillary Physical Forces.

The two determinants of peritubular capillary reabsorption
that are directly influenced by renal hemodynamic changes are the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures of the peritubular capillaries. The peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure is influenced by the arterial pressure and resistances of the afferent and efferent arterioles as follows:

1. Increases in arterial pressure tend to raise peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure and decrease the reabsorption rate. This effect is buffered to some extent by autoregulatory mechanisms that maintain relatively constant renal blood flow, as well as relatively constant hydrostatic pressures in the renal blood vessels.
2. An increase in resistance of the afferent or efferent arterioles reduces peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure and tends to increase reabsorption rate. Although constriction of the efferent arterioles increases glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, it lowers peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure.
The second major determinant of peritubular capillary reabsorption is the colloid osmotic pressure of the plasma in these capillaries; raising the colloid osmotic pressure increases peritubular capillary reabsorption. The colloid osmotic pressure of peritubular capillaries is determined by the following: (1) the systemic plasma colloid osmotic pressure (increasing the plasma protein concentration of systemic blood tends to raise peritubular capillary colloid osmotic pressure, thereby increasing reabsorption); and (2) the filtration fraction-the higher the filtration fraction, the greater the fraction of plasma filtered through the glomerulus and, consequently, the more concentrated the protein becomes in the plasma that remains behind. Thus, increasing the filtration fraction also tends to increase the peritubular capillary reabsorption rate. Because filtration fraction is defined as the ratio of GFR/RPF, an increased filtration fraction can occur as a result of increased GFR or decreased RPF. Some renal vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II, increase peritubular capillary reabsorption by decreasing RPF and increasing filtration fraction, as discussed later.

Changes in the peritubular capillary $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ can also influence the reabsorption rate because $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ is a measure of the permeability and surface area of the capillaries. Increases in $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ raise reabsorption, whereas decreases in $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ lower peritubular capillary reabsorption. $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ remains relatively constant in most physiological conditions. Table 28-2 summarizes the factors that can influence the peritubular capillary reabsorption rate.

Renal Interstitial Hydrostatic and Colloid Osmotic Pressures. Ultimately, changes in peritubular capillary physical forces influence tubular reabsorption by changing the physical forces in the renal interstitium surrounding the tubules. For example, a decrease in the reabsorptive force across the peritubular capillary membranes, caused by increased peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure or decreased peritubular capillary colloid osmotic pressure, reduces the uptake of fluid and solutes from the

interstitium into the peritubular capillaries. This action in turn raises renal interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure and decreases interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure because of dilution of the proteins in the renal interstitium. These changes then decrease the net reabsorption of fluid from the renal tubules into the interstitium, especially in the proximal tubules.

The mechanisms whereby changes in interstitial fluid hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures influence tubular reabsorption can be understood by examining the pathways through which solute and water are reabsorbed (Figure 28-17). Once the solutes enter the intercellular channels or renal interstitium by active transport or passive diffusion, water is drawn from the tubular lumen into the interstitium by osmosis. Furthermore, once the water and solutes are in the interstitial spaces, they can be swept up into the peritubular capillaries or diffuse back through the epithelial junctions into the tubular lumen. The so-called tight junctions between the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule are actually leaky, so considerable amounts of sodium can diffuse in both directions through these junctions. With the normal high rate of peritubular capillary reabsorption, the net movement of water and solutes is into the peritubular capillaries, with little backleak into the lumen of the tubule. However, when peritubular capillary reabsorption is reduced, there is increased interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure and a tendency for greater amounts of solute and water to leak back into the tubular lumen, thereby reducing the rate of net reabsorption (see Figure 28-17).

The opposite is true when peritubular capillary reabsorption increases above the normal level. An initial increase in reabsorption by the peritubular capillaries tends to reduce interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure and raise interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure. Both these forces favor movement of fluid and solutes out of the tubular lumen and into the interstitium; therefore, backleak of water and solutes into the tubular lumen is reduced, and net tubular reabsorption is increased.

Thus, through changes in the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures of the renal interstitium, the uptake of water and solutes by the peritubular capillaries is closely

Reduced peritubular capillary reabsorption, in turn, decreases the net reabsorption of solutes and water by increasing the amounts of solutes and water that leak back into the tubular lumen through the tight junctions of the tubular epithelial cells, especially in the proximal tubule.
matched to the net reabsorption of water and solutes from the tubular lumen into the interstitium. In general, forces that increase peritubular capillary reabsorption also increase reabsorption from the renal tubules. Conversely, hemodynamic changes that inhibit peritubular capillary reabsorption also inhibit tubular reabsorption of water and solutes.

## EFFECT OF ARTERIAL PRESSURE ON URINE OUTPUT—PRESSURE NATRIURESIS AND PRESSURE DIURESIS

Even small increases in arterial pressure can cause marked increases in urinary excretion of sodium and water, phenomena referred to as pressure natriuresis and pressure diuresis. Because of the autoregulatory mechanisms described in Chapter 27, increasing the arterial pressure between the limits of 75 and 160 mm Hg usually has only a small effect on renal blood flow and GFR. The slight increase in GFR that does occur contributes in part to

the effect of increased arterial pressure on urine output. When GFR autoregulation is impaired, as often occurs in kidney disease, increases in arterial pressure can cause much larger increases in the GFR.

A second effect of increased renal arterial pressure that raises urine output is that it decreases the percentages of the filtered loads of sodium and water that are reabsorbed by the tubules. Although the mechanisms responsible for this effect are not fully understood, they include a cascade of physical factors, as well as paracrine and hormonal effects. Increased arterial pressure causes a slight increase in peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure, especially in the vasa recta of the renal medulla, and a subsequent increase in the renal interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure. As discussed earlier, an increase in the renal interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure enhances backleak of sodium into the tubular lumen, thereby reducing the net reabsorption of sodium and water and further increasing the rate of urine output when renal arterial pressure rises.

A third factor that contributes to pressure natriuresis and pressure diuresis is reduced angiotensin II formation. Angiotensin II itself increases sodium reabsorption by the tubules and stimulates aldosterone secretion, which further increases sodium reabsorption. Therefore, decreased angiotensin II formation contributes to the decreased tubular sodium reabsorption that occurs when arterial pressure is increased.

A fourth factor that may contribute to pressure natriuresis is internalization of sodium transporter proteins from the apical membranes to the cytoplasm of the renal tubules, thereby reducing the amount of sodium that can be transported across the cell membranes. This effect of increased arterial pressure may be mediated, in part, by decreased angiotensin II formation and other autacoid or paracrine signals.

## HORMONAL CONTROL OF TUBULAR REABSORPTION

Precise regulation of body fluid volumes and solute concentrations requires the kidneys to excrete different solutes and water at variable rates, sometimes independently of one another. For example, when potassium intake is increased, the kidneys must excrete more potassium while maintaining normal excretion of sodium and other
electrolytes. Likewise, when sodium intake is changed, the kidneys must adjust urinary sodium excretion appropriately without major changes in excretion of other electrolytes. Several hormones in the body provide this specificity of tubular reabsorption for different electrolytes and water. Table 28-3 summarizes some of the most important hormones for regulating tubular reabsorption, their principal sites of action on the renal tubule, and their effects on solute and water excretion. Some of these hormones are discussed in more detail in Chapters 29 and 30, but here we briefly review their renal tubular actions.

Aldosterone Stimulates Renal Sodium Reabsorption and Potassium Secretion. Aldosterone, secreted by the zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex, is an important regulator of sodium reabsorption and secretion of potassium and hydrogen ions by the renal tubules. $A$ major renal tubular site of aldosterone action is on the principal cells of the cortical collecting tubule. The mechanism whereby aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion is by stimulating the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase pump on the basolateral side of the cortical collecting tubule membrane. Aldosterone also increases the sodium permeability of the luminal side of the membrane by the insertion of epithelial sodium channels. The cellular mechanisms of aldosterone action are discussed in Chapter 78.

The most important stimuli for aldosterone are the following: (1) increased extracellular potassium concentration; and (2) increased angiotensin II levels, which typically occur in conditions associated with sodium and volume depletion or low blood pressure. Increased secretion of aldosterone associated with these conditions causes renal sodium and water retention, helping restore extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure toward normal.

When there is a deficit of aldosterone, as occurs with adrenal destruction or malfunction (Addison disease), there is marked sodium loss from the body and accumulation of potassium. Conversely, excess aldosterone secretion, as occurs in patients with adrenal tumors (Conn syndrome), is associated with sodium retention and decreased plasma potassium concentration due, in part, to excessive potassium secretion by the kidneys. Although daily regulation of sodium balance can be maintained as long as minimal levels of aldosterone are present, the

Table 28-3 Hormones That Regulate Tubular Reabsorption

| Hormone | Site of Action | Effects |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Aldosterone | Collecting tubule and duct | $\begin{aligned} & \text { INaCl, } \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \text { reabsorption; } \mathrm{I} \mathrm{K}^{+} \text {secretion; } \\ & \mathrm{IH}^{+} \text {secretion } \end{aligned}$ |
| Angiotensin II | Proximal tubule, thick ascending loop of Henle, distal tubule, collecting tubule | $\mathrm{INaCl}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ reabsorption; $\mathrm{IH}^{+}$secretion |
| Antidiuretic hormone | Distal tubule/collecting tubule and duct | $\mathrm{IH}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ reabsorption |
| Atrial natriuretic peptide | Distal tubule/collecting tubule and duct | $\mathrm{INaCl}$ reabsorption |
| Parathyroid hormone | Proximal tubule, thick ascending loop of Henle, distal tubule | $\mathrm{IPO}_{4}{ }^{-}$reabsorption; $\mathrm{ICa}^{2+}$ reabsorption |

inability to adjust aldosterone secretion appropriately greatly impairs the regulation of renal potassium excretion and potassium concentration of the body fluids. Thus, aldosterone is even more important as a regulator of potassium concentration than for sodium concentration, as discussed in Chapter 30.

Angiotensin II Increases Sodium and Water Reabsorption. Angiotensin II is perhaps the body's most powerful sodium-retaining hormone. As discussed in Chapter 19, angiotensin II formation increases in circumstances associated with low blood pressure and/or low extracellular fluid volume, such as during hemorrhage or loss of salt and water from the body fluids by excessive sweating or severe diarrhea. Increased formation of angiotensin II helps return blood pressure and extracellular volume toward normal by increasing sodium and water reabsorption from the renal tubules through three main effects:

1. Angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone secretion, which in turn increases sodium reabsorption.
2. Angiotensin II constricts the efferent arterioles, which has two effects on peritubular capillary dynamics that increase sodium and water reabsorption. First, efferent arteriolar constriction reduces peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure, which increases net tubular reabsorption, especially from the proximal tubules. Second, efferent arteriolar constriction, by reducing renal blood flow, raises filtration fraction in the glomerulus and increases the concentration of proteins and colloid osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries. This mechanism also increases the reabsorptive force at the peritubular capillaries and raises tubular reabsorption of sodium and water.
3. Angiotensin II directly stimulates sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubules, the loops of Henle, the distal tubules, and the collecting tubules. One of the direct effects of angiotensin II is to stimulate the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump on the tubular epithelial cell basolateral membrane. A second effect is to stimulate sodium-hydrogen exchange in the luminal membrane, especially in the proximal tubule. A third effect of angiotensin II is to stimulate sodiumbicarbonate co-transport in the basolateral membrane (Figure 28-18).
Thus, angiotensin II stimulates sodium transport across both the luminal and basolateral surfaces of the epithelial cell membrane in most renal tubular segments. These multiple actions of angiotensin II cause marked sodium and water retention by the kidneys when angiotensin II levels are increased and play a critical role in permitting the body to adapt to wide variations in sodium intake without large changes in extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure, as discussed in Chapter 30.

At the same time that angiotensin II increases renal tubular sodium reabsorption, its vasoconstrictor effect on efferent arterioles also aids in the maintenance of normal excretion of metabolic waste products such as urea and
creatinine that depend mainly on an adequate GFR for their excretion. Thus, increased formation of angiotensin II permits the kidneys to retain sodium and water without causing retention of metabolic waste products.

## Antidiuretic Hormone Increases Water Reabsorption.

The most important renal action of ADH is to increase the water permeability of the distal tubule, collecting tubule, and collecting duct epithelia. This effect helps the body conserve water in circumstances such as dehydration. In the absence of ADH , the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water is low, causing the kidneys to excrete large amounts of dilute urine, a condition called diabetes insipidus. Thus, the actions of ADH play a key role in controlling the degree of dilution or concentration of the urine, as discussed further in Chapters 29 and 76.

ADH binds to specific $V_{2}$ receptors in the late distal tubules, collecting tubules, and collecting ducts, increasing the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and activating protein kinases (Figure 28-19). This action, in turn, stimulates movement of an intracellular protein, called aquaporin-2 (AQP-2), to the luminal side of the cell membranes. The molecules of AQP-2 cluster together and fuse with the cell membrane by exocytosis to form water channels that permit rapid diffusion of water through the cells. There are other aquaporins, AQP-3 and AQP-4, in the basolateral side of the cell membrane that provide a path for water to exit the cells rapidly, although these aquaporins are not regulated by ADH. Chronic increases in ADH levels also increase the formation of AQP-2 protein in the renal tubular cells by stimulating AQP-2 gene transcription. When the concentration of ADH decreases, the molecules of AQP-2 are shuttled back to the cell cytoplasm, thereby removing the water channels from the luminal membrane and reducing water permeability. These actions of ADH are discussed further in Chapters 29 and 76.

Ang II stimulates sodium-hydrogen exchange ( $N H E$ ) on the luminal membrane and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase transporter as well as sodium-bicarbonate co-transport on the basolateral membrane. These same effects of Ang II likely occur in several other parts of the renal tubule, including the loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting tubule. $\mathrm{AT}_{1}$, Angiotensin II type I receptor.

Figure 28-19 Mechanism of action of arginine vasopressin ( $A V P$ ) on the epithelial cells of the late distal tubules, collecting tubules, and collecting ducts. AVP binds to its $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ receptors, which are coupled with stimulatory G proteins $\left(G_{s}\right)$ that activate adenylate cyclase $(A C)$ and stimulate formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This, in turn, activates protein kinase A and phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, causing movement of aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) to the luminal side of the cell membrane. The molecules of AQP-2 fuse together to form water channels. On the basolateral side of the cell membrane are other aquaporins, $A Q P-3$ and $A Q P-4$, that permit water to flow out of the cell, although these aquaporins do not appear to be regulated by AVP.

Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Decreases Sodium and Water Reabsorption. When specific cells of the cardiac atria are stretched because of plasma volume expansion and increased atrial blood pressure, they secrete a peptide called atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Increased levels of this peptide in turn directly inhibit reabsorption of sodium and water by the renal tubules, especially in the collecting ducts. ANP also inhibits renin secretion and therefore angiotensin II formation, which in turn reduces renal tubular reabsorption. This decreased sodium and water reabsorption increases urinary excretion, which helps return the blood volume back toward normal.

ANP levels are greatly elevated in congestive heart failure when the cardiac atria are stretched because of impaired pumping of the ventricles. The increased ANP level helps attenuate sodium and water retention in heart failure.

Parathyroid Hormone Increases Calcium Reabsorption. Parathyroid hormone is one of the most important calcium-regulating hormones in the body. Its principal action in the kidneys is to increase tubular reabsorption of calcium, especially in the distal tubules and connecting tubules, a tubular segment that connects the distal tubules with the cortical collecting duct. Parathyroid hormone also has other actions, including inhibition of phosphate reabsorption by the proximal tubule and stimulation of magnesium reabsorption by the loop of Henle, as discussed in Chapter 30.

## SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVATION INCREASES SODIUM REABSORPTION

Activation of the sympathetic nervous system, if severe, can decrease sodium and water excretion by constricting the renal arterioles, thereby reducing the GFR. Even low levels of sympathetic activation, however, decrease sodium and water excretion by increasing sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and perhaps in more distal parts of the renal tubule. This occurs by activation of $\alpha$-adrenergic receptors on the renal tubular epithelial cells.

Sympathetic nervous system stimulation also increases renin release and angiotensin II formation, which adds to the overall effect to increase tubular reabsorption and decrease renal excretion of sodium.

## USE OF CLEARANCE METHODS TO QUANTIFY KIDNEY FUNCTION

The rates at which different substances are cleared from the plasma provide a useful way of quantitating the effectiveness with which the kidneys excrete various substances (Table 28-4). By definition, the renal clearance of a substance is the volume of plasma that is completely cleared of the substance by the kidneys per unit of time.

Although there is no single volume of plasma that is completely cleared of a substance, renal clearance provides a useful way of quantifying excretory function of the kidneys. We can use renal clearance to quantify renal blood flow, GFR, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion.

To illustrate the clearance principle, consider the following example. If the plasma passing through the kidneys contains 1 milligram of a substance in each milliliter, and if 1 milligram of this substance is also excreted into the urine each minute, then $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ of the plasma is cleared of the substance. Clearance refers to the volume of plasma that would be necessary to supply the amount of substance excreted in the urine per unit of time. Stated mathematically:

$$
C_{s} \times P_{s}=U_{s} \times V
$$

where $C_{s}$ is the clearance rate of a substance $s, P_{s}$ is the plasma concentration of the substance, $U_{s}$ is the urine concentration of that substance, and V is the urine flow rate. Rearranging this equation, clearance can be expressed as:

$$
C_{s}=\frac{U_{s} \times V}{P_{s}}
$$

Thus, renal clearance of a substance is calculated from the urinary excretion rate $\left(U_{s} \times V\right)$ of that substance divided by its plasma concentration.

## INULIN CLEARANCE CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE

If a substance is freely filtered (filtered as freely as water) and is not reabsorbed or secreted by the renal tubules, then the rate at which that substance is excreted in the

urine $\left(U_{s} \times V\right)$ is equal to the filtration rate of the substance by the kidneys $\left(\mathrm{GFR} \times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{s}}\right)$. Thus:

$$
\mathrm{GFR} \times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{s}}=\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{s}} \times \mathrm{V}
$$

The GFR, therefore, can be calculated as the clearance of the substance as follows:

$$
\mathrm{GFR}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{s}} \times \mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{s}}}=\mathrm{C}_{2}
$$

A substance that fits these criteria is inulin, a polysaccharide molecule with a molecular weight of about 5200. Inulin, which is not produced in the body, is found in the roots of certain plants and must be administered intravenously to a patient to measure GFR.

Figure 28-20 shows the renal handling of inulin. In this example, the plasma concentration is $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$, urine concentration is $125 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$, and urine flow rate is $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. Therefore, $125 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ of inulin passes into the urine. Then, inulin clearance is calculated as the urine excretion rate of inulin divided by the plasma concentration, which yields a value of $125 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. Thus, 125 milliliters of plasma flowing through the kidneys must be filtered to deliver the inulin that appears in the urine.

Inulin is not the only substance that can be used for determining the GFR. Other substances that have been used clinically to estimate the GFR include iothalamate, chromium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), cystatin $C$, and creatinine.

## CREATININE CLEARANCE AND PLASMA CREATININE CONCENTRATION CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE

Creatinine is a by-product of muscle metabolism and is cleared from the body fluids almost entirely by glomerular filtration. Therefore, creatinine clearance can also be used to assess GFR. Because measurement of creatinine clearance does not require intravenous infusion into the patient, this method is much more widely used than inulin clearance for estimating GFR clinically. However, creatinine clearance is not a perfect marker of GFR because a small amount of it is secreted by the tubules, so the amount of creatinine excreted slightly exceeds the amount filtered. There is normally a slight error in measuring plasma creatinine that leads to an overestimation of the plasma creatinine concentration; fortuitously, these two errors tend to cancel each other. Therefore, creatinine clearance provides a reasonable estimate of GFR.

In some cases, it may not be practical to collect urine in a patient for measuring creatinine clearance $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}\right)$. An approximation of changes in GFR, however, can be obtained by simply measuring the plasma creatinine concentration $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}}\right)$, which is inversely proportional to the GFR:

$$
\mathrm{GFR} \approx \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Cr}} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}}}
$$

![gu497762836d](gu497762836d.jpg)

Inulin is freely filtered by the glomerular capillaries but is not reabsorbed by the renal tubules. $\mathrm{P}_{\text {inulin }}$, Plasma inulin concentration; $\mathrm{U}_{\text {inulin }}$, urine inulin concentration; $\dot{V}$, urine flow rate.

If GFR suddenly decreases by $50 \%$, the kidneys will transiently filter and excrete only half as much creatinine, causing the accumulation of creatinine in the body fluids and raising plasma concentration. The plasma concentration of creatinine will continue to rise until the filtered load of creatinine $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Ci}} \times \mathrm{GFR}\right)$ and creatinine excretion $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Ci}} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right)$ return to normal, and a balance between creatinine production and creatinine excretion is re-established. This response will occur when the plasma creatinine level increases to approximately twice normal, as shown in Figure 28-21.

If GFR falls to one-fourth normal, plasma creatinine level would increase to about four times normal, and a decrease of GFR to one-eighth normal would raise plasma creatinine level to eight times normal. Thus, under steady-state conditions, creatinine excretion rate equals the rate of creatinine production, despite reductions in GFR. However, this normal rate of creatinine excretion occurs at the expense of an elevated plasma creatinine concentration, as shown in Figure 28-22.

## PARA-AMINOHIPPURIC ACID CLEARANCE CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE RENAL PLASMA FLOW

Theoretically, if a substance is completely cleared from the plasma, the clearance rate of that substance is equal to the total RPF. In other words, the amount of the substance delivered to the kidneys in the blood (RPF $\times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{k}}$ ) would be equal to the amount excreted in the urine $\left(U_{k} \times \dot{V}\right)$. Thus, RPF could be calculated as follows:

$$
\mathrm{RPF}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{k}} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{k}}}=\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{k}}
$$

![gu527762836d](gu527762836d.jpg)

Figure 28-23 Measurement of renal plasma flow from the renal clearance of para-aminohippuric acid (PAH). PAH is freely filtered by the glomerular capillaries and is also secreted from the peritubular capillary blood into the tubular lumen. The amount of PAH in the plasma of the renal artery is about equal to the amount of PAH excreted in the urine. Therefore, the renal plasma flow can be calculated from the clearance of PAH. To be more accurate, one can correct for the percentage of PAH that is still in the blood when it leaves the kidneys. $\mathrm{P}_{\text {PAH }}$, Arterial plasma PAH concentration; $\mathrm{U}_{\text {PAH }}$, urine PAH concentration; $\dot{\mathbf{V}}$, urine flow rate.

Because the GFR is only about $20 \%$ of the total plasma flow, a substance that is completely cleared from the plasma must be excreted by tubular secretion, as well as by glomerular filtration (Figure 28-23). There is no known substance that is completely cleared by the kidneys. One substance, PAH, is about $90 \%$ cleared from the plasma. Therefore, clearance of PAH can be used to approximate RPF. To be more accurate, one can correct for the percentage of PAH that is still in the blood when it leaves the kidneys. The percentage of PAH removed from the blood is known as the extraction ratio of PAH and averages about $90 \%$ in normal kidneys. In diseased kidneys, this extraction ratio may be reduced because of the inability of damaged tubules to secrete PAH into the tubular fluid.

The calculation of RPF can be demonstrated by the following example. Assume that the plasma concentration of PAH is $0.01 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$, urine concentration is $5.85 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$, and urine flow rate is $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. PAH clearance can be calculated from the rate of urinary PAH excretion (5.85 $[\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}] \times 1[\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}]$ ) divided by the plasma PAH concentration $(0.01 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml})$. Thus, the clearance of PAH is calculated to be $585 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$.

If the extraction ratio for PAH is $90 \%$, the actual RPF can be calculated by dividing $585 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ by 0.9 , yielding a value of $650 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. Thus, total RPF can be calculated as follows:

Total renal plasma flow $=\frac{\text { PAH clearance }}{\text { PAH extraction ratio }}$

The extraction ratio $\left(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{PAH}}\right)$ is calculated as the difference between the renal arterial $\mathrm{PAH}\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PAH}}\right)$ and renal venous $\mathrm{PAH}\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{PAH}}\right)$ concentrations, divided by the renal arterial PAH concentration:

$$
\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{PAH}}=\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PAH}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{PAH}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PAH}}}
$$

One can calculate the total blood flow through the kidneys from the total RPF and hematocrit (the percentage of red blood cells in the blood). If the hematocrit is 0.45 and the total RPF is $650 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, the total blood flow through both kidneys is $650 /(1-0.45)$, or $1182 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$.

## FILTRATION FRACTION IS CALCULATED FROM GFR DIVIDED BY RPF

To calculate the filtration fraction, which is the fraction of plasma that filters through the glomerular membrane, one must first know the RPF (PAH clearance) and the GFR (inulin clearance). If the RPF is $650 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ and the GFR is $125 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, the filtration fraction (FF) is calculated as follows:

$$
\mathrm{FF}=\mathrm{GFR} / \mathrm{RPF}=125 / 650=0.19
$$

## CALCULATION OF TUBULAR REABSORPTION OR SECRETION FROM RENAL CLEARANCES

If the rates of glomerular filtration and renal excretion of a substance are known, one can calculate whether there is a net reabsorption or net secretion of that substance by the renal tubules. For example, if the rate of excretion of the substance $\left(U_{e} \times V\right)$ is less than the filtered load of the substance $\left(\mathrm{GFR} \times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{e}}\right)$, then some of the substance must have been reabsorbed from the renal tubules. Conversely, if the excretion rate of the substance is greater than its filtered load, then the rate at which it appears in the urine represents the sum of the rate of glomerular filtration plus tubular secretion.

The following example demonstrates the calculation of tubular reabsorption. Assume the following laboratory values for a patient were obtained:

- Urine flow rate $=1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$
- Urine concentration of sodium $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)=70 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}=$ $70 \mu \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{ml}$
- Plasma sodium concentration $=140 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}=140$ $\mu \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{ml}$
- GFR (inulin clearance) $=100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$

In this example, the filtered sodium load is GFR $\times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Na}}$, or $100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} \times 140 \mu \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{ml}=14,000 \mu \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{min}$. Urinary sodium excretion ( $\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Na}} \times$ urine flow rate) is $70 \mu \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{min}$. Therefore, tubular reabsorption of sodium is the difference between the filtered load and urinary excretion, or $14,000 \mu \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{min}-70 \mu \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{min}=13,930 \mu \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{min}$.

## Comparisons of Inulin Clearance with Clearances of

Different Solutes. The following generalizations can be made by comparing the clearance of a substance with the clearance of inulin, the gold standard for measuring GFR: (1) if the clearance rate of the substance equals that of inulin, the substance is only filtered and not reabsorbed or secreted; (2) if the clearance rate of a substance is less than inulin clearance, the substance must have been reabsorbed by the nephron tubules; and (3) if the clearance rate of a substance is greater than that of inulin, the substance must be secreted by the nephron tubules. Listed below are the approximate clearance rates for some of the substances normally handled by the kidneys:

| Substance | Clearance Rate $(\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min})$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| Glucose | 0 |
| Sodium | 0.9 |
| Chloride | 1.3 |
| Potassium | 12.0 |
| Phosphate | 25.0 |
| Inulin | 125.0 |
| Creatinine | 140.0 |

# Urine Concentration and Dilution; Regulation of Extracellular Fluid Osmolarity and Sodium Concentration 

For the cells of the body to function properly, they must be bathed in extracellular fluid with a relatively constant concentration of electrolytes. The total concentration of solutes in the extracellular fluid-and therefore the osmolarity-must also be precisely regulated to prevent the cells from shrinking or swelling. The osmolarity is determined by the amount of solute (mainly sodium chloride) divided by the volume of the extracellular fluid. Thus, to a large extent, extracellular fluid osmolarity and sodium chloride concentration are regulated by the amount of extracellular water. The total body water is controlled by (1) fluid intake, which is regulated by factors that determine thirst; and (2) renal water excretion, which is controlled by multiple factors that influence glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption.

In this chapter, we discuss the following: (1) mechanisms that cause the kidneys to eliminate excess water by excreting a dilute urine; (2) mechanisms that cause the kidneys to conserve water by excreting a concentrated urine; (3) renal feedback mechanisms that control the extracellular fluid sodium concentration and osmolarity; and (4) thirst and salt appetite mechanisms that determine the intakes of water and salt, which also help control extracellular fluid volume, osmolarity, and sodium concentration.

## KIDNEYS EXCRETE EXCESS WATER BY FORMING DILUTE URINE

Normal kidneys have a tremendous capability to vary the relative proportions of solutes and water in the urine in response to various challenges. When there is excess water in the body, and body fluid osmolarity is reduced, the kidneys can excrete urine with an osmolarity as low as $50 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, a concentration that is only about one-sixth the osmolarity of normal extracellular fluid. Conversely, when there is a deficit of water in the body, and extracellular fluid osmolarity is high, the kidneys can excrete highly concentrated urine with an osmolarity of 1200 to $1400 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. Equally important, the kidneys can excrete a large volume of dilute urine or a small volume
of concentrated urine without major changes in rates of excretion of solutes such as sodium and potassium. This ability to regulate water excretion independently of solute excretion is necessary for survival, especially when fluid intake is limited.

## ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE CONTROLS URINE CONCENTRATION

The body has a powerful feedback system for regulating plasma osmolarity and sodium concentration that operates by altering renal excretion of water independently of solute excretion rate. A primary effector of this feedback is antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin.

When osmolarity of the body fluids increases above normal (i.e., the solutes in the body fluids become too concentrated), the posterior pituitary gland secretes more ADH , which increases the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water, as discussed in Chapter 28. This mechanism increases water reabsorption and decreases urine volume but does not markedly alter the rate of renal excretion of the solutes.

When there is excess water in the body, and extracellular fluid osmolarity is reduced, secretion of ADH by the posterior pituitary decreases, thereby reducing the permeability of the distal tubule and collecting ducts to water, which causes increased amounts of more dilute urine to be excreted. Thus, the rate of ADH secretion determines, to a large extent, whether the kidney excretes dilute or concentrated urine.

## RENAL MECHANISMS FOR EXCRETING DILUTE URINE

When there is a large excess of water in the body, the kidney can excrete as much as $20 \mathrm{~L} /$ day of dilute urine, with a concentration as low as $50 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. The kidney performs this impressive feat by continuing to reabsorb solutes without reabsorbing large amounts of water in the distal parts of the nephron, including the late distal tubule and collecting ducts.

![gu537762836d](gu537762836d.jpg)

Figure 29-1. Water diuresis in a person after ingestion of 1 liter of water. Note that after water ingestion, urine volume increases and urine osmolarity decreases, causing excretion of a large volume of dilute urine; however, the total amount of solute excreted by the kidneys remains relatively constant. These responses of the kidneys prevent plasma osmolarity from decreasing markedly during excess water ingestion.

Figure 29-1 shows the approximate renal responses in a human after ingestion of 1 liter of water. Note that urine volume increased to about six times normal within 45 minutes after the water had been ingested. However, the total amount of solute excreted remained relatively constant because the urine formed became dilute, and urine osmolarity decreased from 600 to about $100 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. Thus, after ingestion of excess water, the kidney rids the body of the excess water but does not excrete excess amounts of solutes.

When the glomerular filtrate is initially formed, its osmolarity is about the same as that of plasma (300 $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ ). To excrete excess water, the filtrate is diluted as it passes along the tubule by reabsorbing solutes to a greater extent than water, as shown in Figure 29-2. This dilution, however, occurs only in certain segments of the tubular system, as described in the following sections.

Tubular Fluid Remains Isosmotic in Proximal Tubules. As fluid flows through the proximal tubule, solutes and water are reabsorbed in equal proportions, so little change in osmolarity occurs. Thus, the proximal tubule fluid remains isosmotic to the plasma, with an osmolarity of about $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. As fluid passes down the descending loop of Henle, water is reabsorbed by osmosis, and the tubular fluid reaches equilibrium with the surrounding interstitial fluid of the renal medulla, which is very hypertonic-about two to four times the osmolarity of the original glomerular filtrate. Therefore, the tubular fluid becomes more concentrated as it flows into the inner medulla.

Figure 29-2. Formation of dilute urine when antidiuretic hormone $(\mathrm{ADH})$ levels are very low. Note that in the ascending loop of Henle, the tubular fluid becomes very dilute. In the distal tubules and collecting tubules, the tubular fluid is further diluted by the reabsorption of sodium chloride and the failure to reabsorb water when ADH levels are very low. The failure to reabsorb water and continued reabsorption of solutes lead to a large volume of dilute urine. (Numerical values are in milliosmoles per liter.)

Tubular Fluid Is Diluted in the Ascending Loop of Henle. In the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, especially in the thick segment, sodium, potassium, and chloride are avidly reabsorbed. However, this portion of the tubular segment is impermeable to water, even in the presence of large amounts of ADH. Therefore, the tubular fluid becomes more dilute as it flows up the ascending loop of Henle into the early distal tubule, with the osmolarity decreasing progressively to about $100 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ by the time the fluid enters the early distal tubular segment. Thus, regardless of whether ADH is present or absent, fluid leaving the early distal tubular segment is hypo-osmotic, with an osmolarity of only about one-third the osmolarity of plasma.

Tubular Fluid in Distal and Collecting Tubules Is Further Diluted in Absence of ADH. As the dilute fluid in the early distal tubule passes into the late distal convoluted tubule, cortical collecting duct, and medullary collecting duct, there is additional reabsorption of sodium chloride. In the absence of ADH , this portion of the tubule is also impermeable to water, and the additional reabsorption of solutes causes the tubular fluid to become even more dilute, decreasing its osmolarity to as low as 50 $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. The failure to reabsorb water and continued reabsorption of solutes lead to a large volume of dilute urine.

To summarize, the mechanism for forming dilute urine is to continue reabsorbing solutes from the distal segments of the tubular system while reducing water reabsorption. In healthy kidneys, fluid leaving the ascending loop of Henle and early distal tubule is always dilute, regardless of the level of ADH . In the absence of ADH , the urine is further diluted in the late distal tubule and collecting ducts, and a large volume of dilute urine is excreted.

## KIDNEYS CONSERVE WATER BY EXCRETING CONCENTRATED URINE

The ability of the kidney to form concentrated urine is essential for survival of mammals that live on land, including humans. Water is continuously lost from the body through various routes, including the lungs by evaporation into the expired air, the gastrointestinal tract by way of the feces, the skin through evaporation and perspiration, and the kidneys through excretion of urine. Fluid intake is required to match this loss, but the ability of the kidneys to form a small volume of concentrated urine minimizes the fluid intake required to maintain homeostasis, a function that is especially important when water is in short supply.

When there is a water deficit in the body, the kidneys form concentrated urine by continuing to excrete solutes while increasing water reabsorption and decreasing the urine volume. The human kidney can produce a maximal urine concentration of 1200 to $1400 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, four to five times the osmolarity of plasma.

Some desert animals, such as the Australian hopping mouse, can concentrate urine to as high as 10,000 $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. This ability allows the mouse to survive in the desert without drinking water; sufficient water can be obtained through the ingested food and water produced in the body by metabolism of the food. Animals adapted to freshwater environments usually have minimal urineconcentrating ability. Beavers, for example, can concentrate the urine only to about $500 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$.

## Obligatory Urine Volume

The maximal concentrating ability of the kidney dictates how much urine volume must be excreted each day to rid the body of metabolic waste products and electrolytes that are ingested. A normal $70-\mathrm{kg}$ person must excrete about 600 milliosmoles of solute each day. If the maximal urine concentrating ability is $1200 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, the minimal volume of urine that must be excreted, called the obligatory urine volume, can be calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{gathered}
600 \mathrm{mOsm} / \text { day } \\
1200 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}=0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \text { day }
\end{gathered}
$$

This minimal loss of volume in the urine contributes to dehydration, along with water loss from the skin, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract, when water is not available to drink.

The limited ability of the human kidney to concentrate the urine to only about $1200 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ explains why severe dehydration occurs if one attempts to drink seawater. Sodium chloride concentration in the ocean averages about $3.0 \%$ to $3.5 \%$, with an osmolarity between about 1000 and $1200 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. Drinking 1 liter of seawater with a concentration of $1200 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ would provide a total sodium chloride intake of 1200 milliosmoles. If the maximal urine concentrating ability is $1200 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, the amount of urine volume needed to excrete 1200 milliosmoles would be 1.0 liter. Why then does drinking seawater cause dehydration? The answer is that the kidney must also excrete other solutes, especially urea, which contribute about $600 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ when the urine is maximally concentrated. Therefore, the
maximum concentration of sodium chloride that can be excreted by the kidneys is about $600 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. Thus, for every liter of seawater ingested, 1.5 liters of urine volume would be required to rid the body of 1200 milliosmoles of sodium chloride ingested in addition to 600 milliosmoles of other solutes, such as urea. This would result in a net fluid loss of 0.5 liter for every liter of seawater, explaining the rapid dehydration that occurs in shipwreck victims who drink seawater. However, a shipwreck victim's pet Australian hopping mouse could drink seawater with impunity.

## Urine Specific Gravity

Urine specific gravity is often used in clinical settings to provide a rapid estimate of urine solute concentration. The more concentrated the urine, the higher the urine specific gravity. In most cases, urine specific gravity increases linearly with increasing urine osmolarity (Figure 29-3). Urine specific gravity, however, is a measure of the weight of solutes in a given volume of urine and is therefore determined by the number and size of the solute molecules. In contrast, osmolarity is determined only by the number of solute molecules in a given volume.

Urine specific gravity is generally expressed in grams per milliliter $(\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{ml})$ and, in humans, normally ranges from 1.002 to $1.028 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{ml}$, rising by 0.001 for every 35 - to $40-\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ increase in urine osmolarity. This relationship between specific gravity and osmolarity is altered when there are significant amounts of large molecules in the urine, such as glucose, radiocontrast media used for diagnostic purposes, or some antibiotics. In these cases, urine specific gravity measurements may falsely suggest a highly concentrated urine, despite a normal urine osmolality.

Dipsticks are available that measure approximate urine specific gravity, but most laboratories measure specific gravity with a refractometer.

## EXCRETING CONCENTRATED URINE REQUIRES HIGH ADH LEVELS AND HYPEROSMOTIC RENAL MEDULLA

The basic requirements for forming a concentrated urine are (1) a high level of $A D H$, which increases the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water, thereby allowing these tubular segments to avidly reabsorb water; and (2) a high osmolarity of the renal medullary interstitial fluid, which provides the osmotic gradient necessary for water reabsorption to occur in the presence of high levels of ADH.

The renal medullary interstitium surrounding the collecting ducts is normally hyperosmotic, so when ADH levels are high, water moves through the tubular membrane by osmosis into the renal interstitium; from there it is carried away by the vasa recta back into the blood. Thus, the urine-concentrating ability is limited by the level of ADH and by the degree of hyperosmolarity of the renal medulla. We discuss the factors that control ADH secretion later, but for now, what is the process whereby renal medullary interstitial fluid becomes hyperosmotic? This process involves the operation of the countercurrent multiplier mechanism.

The countercurrent multiplier mechanism depends on the special anatomical arrangement of the loops of Henle and vasa recta, the specialized peritubular capillaries of the renal medulla. In humans, about $25 \%$ of the nephrons are juxtamedullary nephrons, with loops of Henle and vasa recta that go deeply into the medulla before returning to the cortex. Some of the loops of Henle dip all the way to the tips of the renal papillae that project from the medulla into the renal pelvis. Paralleling the long loops of Henle are the vasa recta, which also loop down into the medulla before returning to the renal cortex. And finally, the collecting ducts, which carry urine through the hyperosmotic renal medulla before it is excreted, also play a critical role in the countercurrent mechanism.

## COUNTERCURRENT MULTIPLIER MECHANISM PRODUCES HYPEROSMOTIC RENAL MEDULLARY INTERSTITIUM

The osmolarity of interstitial fluid in almost all parts of the body is about $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, which is similar to the plasma osmolarity. (As discussed in Chapter 25, the corrected osmolar activity, which accounts for intermolecular attraction, is about $282 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$.) The osmolarity of the interstitial fluid in the medulla of the kidney is much higher and may increase progressively to about 1200 to $1400 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ in the pelvic tip of the medulla. This means that the renal medullary interstitium has accumulated solutes in great excess of water. Once the high solute concentration in the medulla is achieved, it is maintained by a balanced inflow and outflow of solutes and water in the medulla.

The major factors that contribute to the buildup of solute concentration into the renal medulla are as follows:

1. Active transport of sodium ions and co-transport of potassium, chloride, and other ions out of the thick portion of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle into the medullary interstitium
2. Active transport of ions from the collecting ducts into the medullary interstitium
3. Facilitated diffusion of urea from the inner medullary collecting ducts into the medullary interstitium
4. Diffusion of only small amounts of water from the medullary tubules into the medullary interstitiumfar less than the reabsorption of solutes into the medullary interstitium

## LOOP OF HENLE CHARACTERISTICS THAT CAUSE SOLUTES TO BE TRAPPED IN THE RENAL MEDULLA

The transport characteristics of the loops of Henle are summarized in Table 29-1, along with the properties of the proximal tubules, distal tubules, cortical collecting tubules, and inner medullary collecting ducts.

A major reason for the high medullary osmolarity is active transport of sodium and co-transport of potassium, chloride, and other ions from the thick ascending loop of Henle into the interstitium. This pump is capable of establishing about a $200-\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration gradient between the tubular lumen and interstitial fluid. Because the thick ascending limb is virtually impermeable to water, the solutes pumped out are not followed by osmotic flow of water into the interstitium. Thus, the active transport of sodium and other ions out of the thick ascending loop adds solutes in excess of water to the renal

medullary interstitium. There is some passive reabsorption of sodium chloride from the thin ascending limb of Henle's loop, which is also essentially impermeable to water, adding further to the high solute concentration of the renal medullary interstitium.

The descending limb of Henle's loop, in contrast to the ascending limb, is very permeable to water, and the tubular fluid osmolarity quickly becomes equal to the renal medullary osmolarity. Therefore, water diffuses out of the descending limb of Henle's loop into the interstitium, and the tubular fluid osmolarity gradually rises as it flows toward the tip of the loop of Henle.

## Steps Involved in Causing Hyperosmotic Renal Medul-

lary Interstitium. Keeping in mind these characteristics of the loop of Henle, let us now discuss how the renal medulla becomes hyperosmotic (Video 29-1). First, assume that the loop of Henle is filled with fluid having a concentration of $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, the same as that leaving the proximal tubule (Figure 29-4, step 1). Next, the active ion pump of the thick ascending limb on the loop of Henle reduces the concentration inside the tubule and raises the interstitial concentration; this pump establishes a $200-\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration gradient between the tubular fluid and interstitial fluid (Figure 29-4, step 2). The limit to the gradient is about $200 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ because paracellular diffusion of ions back into the tubule eventually counterbalances the transport of ions out of the lumen when the $200-\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration gradient is achieved.

Step 3 is that the tubular fluid in the descending limb of the loop of Henle and interstitial fluid quickly reaches osmotic equilibrium due to osmosis of water out of the descending limb. The interstitial osmolarity is maintained at $400 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ because of continued transport of ions out of the thick ascending loop of Henle. Thus, by itself, active transport of sodium chloride out of the thick ascending limb is capable of establishing only a $200-\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration gradient, which is much less than that achieved by the countercurrent multiplier system.

Step 4 is the additional flow of fluid into the loop of Henle from the proximal tubule, which causes the hyperosmotic fluid previously formed in the descending limb to flow into the ascending limb. Once this fluid is in the ascending limb, additional ions are pumped into the interstitium and water remains in the tubular fluid until a $200-\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ osmotic gradient is established, and the interstitial fluid osmolarity rises to $500 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ (step 5). Then, once again, fluid in the descending limb reaches equilibrium with the hyperosmotic medullary interstitial fluid (step 6) and, as the hyperosmotic tubular fluid from the descending limb of the loop of Henle flows into the ascending limb, still more solute is continuously pumped out of the tubules and deposited into the medullary interstitium.

These steps are repeated over and over, with the net effect of adding more and more solute to the medulla in excess of water. With sufficient time, this process gradually traps solutes in the medulla and multiplies the concentration gradient established by the active pumping of ions out of the thick ascending loop of Henle, eventually raising the interstitial fluid osmolarity to 1200 to 1400 $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, as shown in step 7.

Thus, the repetitive reabsorption of sodium chloride by the thick ascending loop of Henle and continued inflow of new sodium chloride from the proximal tubule into the loop of Henle is called the countercurrent multiplier. The sodium chloride reabsorbed from the ascending loop of Henle keeps adding to the newly arrived sodium chloride, thus "multiplying" its concentration in the medullary interstitium.

## ROLE OF DISTAL TUBULE AND COLLECTING DUCTS IN EXCRETING CONCENTRATED URINE

When the tubular fluid leaves the loop of Henle and flows into the distal convoluted tubule in the renal cortex, the fluid is dilute, with an osmolarity of only about 100 to
![gu567762836d](gu567762836d.jpg)

![gu577762836d](gu577762836d.jpg)

Figure 29-5. Formation of a concentrated urine when antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels are high. Note that the fluid leaving the loop of Henle is dilute but becomes concentrated as water is absorbed from the distal tubules and collecting tubules. With high ADH levels, the osmolarity of the urine is about the same as the osmolarity of the renal medullary interstitial fluid in the papilla, which is about 1200 $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. (Numerical values are in milliosmoles per liter.)

140 mOsm/L (Figure 29-5). The early distal tubule further dilutes the tubular fluid because this segment, like the ascending loop of Henle, actively transports sodium chloride out of the tubule but is relatively impermeable to water.

As fluid flows into the cortical collecting tubule, the amount of water reabsorbed is critically dependent on the plasma concentration of ADH . In the absence of ADH , this segment is almost impermeable to water and fails to reabsorb water but continues to reabsorb solutes and further dilutes the urine. When there is a high concentration of ADH , the cortical collecting tubule becomes highly permeable to water, so large amounts of water are now reabsorbed from the tubule into the cortex interstitium, where it is swept away by the rapidly flowing peritubular capillaries. Because large amounts of water are reabsorbed into the cortex, rather than into the renal medulla, this helps preserve the high medullary interstitial fluid osmolarity.

As the tubular fluid flows along the medullary collecting ducts, there is further water reabsorption from the tubular fluid into the interstitium, but the total amount of water is relatively small compared with that added to the cortex interstitium. The reabsorbed water is carried away by the vasa recta into the venous blood. When high levels of ADH are present, the collecting ducts become permeable to water, so the fluid at the end of the collecting ducts has essentially the same osmolarity as the interstitial fluid of the renal medulla-about $1200 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ (see Figure 29-4). Thus, by reabsorbing as much water as possible, the kidneys form highly concentrated urine, excreting normal amounts of solutes in the urine while adding water back to the extracellular fluid and compensating for deficits of body water.

## UREA CONTRIBUTES TO HYPEROSMOTIC RENAL MEDULLARY INTERSTITIUM AND FORMATION OF CONCENTRATED URINE

Urea contributes about $40 \%$ to $50 \%$ of the osmolarity ( $500-600 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ ) of the renal medullary interstitium when the kidney is forming a maximally concentrated urine. Unlike sodium chloride, urea is passively reabsorbed from the tubule. When there is a water deficit and blood concentration of ADH is high, large amounts of urea are passively reabsorbed from the inner medullary collecting ducts into the interstitium.

The mechanism for reabsorption of urea into the renal medulla is as follows. As water flows up the ascending loop of Henle and into the distal and cortical collecting tubules, little urea is reabsorbed because these segments are impermeable to urea (see Table 29-1). In the presence of high concentrations of ADH , water is reabsorbed rapidly from the cortical collecting tubule, and the urea concentration increases rapidly because urea is not very permeant in this part of the tubule.

As the tubular fluid flows into the inner medullary collecting ducts, still more water reabsorption takes place, resulting in an even higher concentration of urea in the fluid. This high concentration of urea in the tubular fluid of the inner medullary collecting duct causes urea to diffuse out of the tubule into the renal interstitial fluid. This diffusion is greatly facilitated by specific urea transporters, $U T-A 1$ and $U T-A 3$. These urea transporters are activated by ADH , increasing transport of urea out of the inner medullary collecting duct even more when ADH levels are elevated. The simultaneous movement of water and urea out of the inner medullary collecting ducts maintains a high concentration of urea in the tubular fluid and, eventually, in the urine, even though urea is being reabsorbed.

The fundamental role of urea in contributing to urineconcentrating ability is evidenced by the fact that people who ingest a high-protein diet, yielding large amounts of urea as a nitrogenous waste product, can concentrate their urine much better than people whose protein intake and urea production are low. Malnutrition is associated with a low urea concentration in the medullary interstitium and considerable impairment of urine-concentrating ability.

## Recirculation of Urea from Collecting Duct to Loop of Henle Contributes to Hyperosmotic Renal Medulla.

A healthy person usually excretes about $20 \%$ to $60 \%$ of the filtered load of urea, depending on urine flow rate and state of hydration. In general, the rate of urea excretion is determined mainly by the following: (1) concentration of urea in the plasma; (2) glomerular filtration rate (GFR); and (3) renal tubular urea reabsorption. In patients with renal disease who have large reductions in GFR, the plasma urea concentration increases markedly, returning the filtered urea load and urea excretion rate to the normal level (equal to the rate of urea production), despite the reduced GFR.

![gu587762836d](gu587762836d.jpg)

Figure 29-6. Recirculation of urea absorbed from the medullary collecting duct into the interstitial fluid. This urea diffuses into the thin loop of Henle, then passes through the distal tubules, and finally passes back into the collecting duct. The recirculation of urea helps trap urea in the renal medulla and contributes to the hyperosmolarity of the renal medulla. The heavy lines, from the thick ascending loop of Henle to the medullary collecting ducts, indicate that these segments are not very permeable to urea. The urea transporters UT-A1 and UT-A3 facilitate diffusion of urea out of the medullary collecting ducts while UT-A2 facilitates urea diffusion into the thin descending loop of Henle. (Numerical values are in milliosmoles per liter of urea during antidiuresis, when large amounts of antidiuretic hormone are present. Percentages of the filtered load of urea that remain in the tubules are indicated in the boxes.)

In the proximal tubule, $40 \%$ to $50 \%$ of the filtered urea is reabsorbed but, even so, the tubular fluid urea concentration increases because urea is not nearly as permeant as water. The concentration of urea continues to rise as the tubular fluid flows into the thin segments of the loop of Henle, partly because of water reabsorption out of the descending loop of Henle but also because of some secretion of urea into the thin loop of Henle from the medullary interstitium (Figure 29-6). The passive secretion of urea into the thin loops of Henle is facilitated by the urea transporter UT-A2.

The thick limb of the loop of Henle, distal tubule, and cortical collecting tubule are all less permeable to urea, and only small amounts of urea reabsorption normally occur in these tubular segments. When the kidney is forming concentrated urine, and high levels of ADH are present, reabsorption of water from the distal tubule and cortical collecting tubule further raises the tubular fluid concentration of urea. As this urea flows into the inner medullary collecting duct, the high tubular fluid concentration of urea and urea transporters UT-A1 and UT-A3 cause urea to diffuse into the medullary interstitium. A moderate share of the urea that moves into the medullary interstitium eventually diffuses into the thin loop of Henle and then passes upward through the ascending loop of

Henle, distal tubule, and cortical collecting tubule and back down into the medullary collecting duct again. In this way, urea can recirculate through these terminal parts of the tubular system several times before it is excreted. Each time around the circuit contributes to a higher concentration of urea.

This urea recirculation provides an additional mechanism for forming a hyperosmotic renal medulla. Because urea is one of the most abundant waste products that must be excreted by the kidneys, this mechanism for concentrating urea before it is excreted is essential to the economy of the body fluid when water is in short supply.

When there is excess water in the body, urine flow rate increases, and therefore the concentration of urea in the inner medullary collecting ducts decreases, causing less diffusion of urea into the renal medullary interstitium. ADH levels are also reduced when there is excess body water, and this reduction, in turn, decreases the permeability of the inner medullary collecting ducts to both water and urea, and more urea is excreted in the urine.

## COUNTERCURRENT EXCHANGE IN VASA RECTA PRESERVES HYPEROSMOLARITY OF RENAL MEDULLA

Blood flow must be provided to the renal medulla to supply the metabolic needs of the cells in this part of the kidney. Without a special medullary blood flow system, the solutes pumped into the renal medulla by the countercurrent multiplier system would be rapidly dissipated.

Two special features of the renal medullary blood flow contribute to the preservation of the high solute concentrations:

1. The medullary blood flow is low, accounting for less than $5 \%$ of the total renal blood flow. This sluggish blood flow is sufficient to supply the metabolic needs of the tissues but helps minimize solute loss from the medullary interstitium.
2. The vasa recta serve as countercurrent exchangers, minimizing the washout of solutes from the medullary interstitium.
The countercurrent exchange mechanism operates as follows (Figure 29-7). Blood enters and leaves the medulla via the vasa recta at the boundary of the cortex and renal medulla. The vasa recta, like other capillaries, are highly permeable to solutes in the blood, except for the plasma proteins. As blood descends into the medulla toward the papillae, it becomes progressively more concentrated, partly by solute entry from the interstitium and partly by loss of water into the interstitium. By the time the blood reaches the tips of the vasa recta, it has a concentration of about $1200 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, the same as that of the medullary interstitium. As blood ascends back toward the cortex, it becomes progressively less concentrated as solutes diffuse back out into the medullary interstitium and as water moves into the vasa recta.

Although large amounts of fluid and solute are exchanged across the vasa recta, there is little net dilution of the concentration of the interstitial fluid at each level of the renal medulla because of the $U$ shape of the vasa recta capillaries, which act as countercurrent exchangers. Thus, the vasa recta do not create the medullary hyperosmolarity, but they do prevent it from being dissipated.

The U-shaped structure of the vessels minimizes loss of solute from the interstitium but does not prevent bulk flow of fluid and solutes into the blood through the usual colloid osmotic and hydrostatic pressures that favor reabsorption in these capillaries. Under steady-state conditions, the vasa recta carry away only as much solute and water as is absorbed from the medullary tubules, and the
![gu597762836d](gu597762836d.jpg)

Figure 29-7. Countercurrent exchange in the vasa recta. Plasma flowing down the descending limb of the vasa recta becomes more hyperosmotic because of diffusion of water out of the blood and diffusion of solutes from the renal interstitial fluid into the blood. In the ascending limb of the vasa recta, solutes diffuse back into the interstitial fluid, and water diffuses back into the vasa recta. Large amounts of solutes would be lost from the renal medulla without the $U$ shape of the vasa recta capillaries. (Numerical values are in milliosmoles per liter.)
high concentration of solutes established by the countercurrent mechanism is preserved.

Increased Medullary Blood Flow Reduces UrineConcentrating Ability. Certain vasodilators can markedly increase renal medullary blood flow, thereby washing out some of the solutes from the renal medulla and reducing the maximum urine-concentrating ability. Large increases in arterial pressure may also increase the blood flow of the renal medulla to a greater extent than in other regions of the kidney and tend to wash out the hyperosmotic interstitium, thereby reducing urine-concentrating ability. As discussed earlier, maximum concentrating ability of the kidney is determined not only by the level of ADH but also by the osmolarity of the renal medulla interstitial fluid. Even with maximal ADH levels, the urineconcentrating ability will be reduced if medullary blood flow increases enough to reduce the hyperosmolarity in the renal medulla.

## SUMMARY OF URINE-CONCENTRATING MECHANISM AND CHANGES IN OSMOLARITY IN DIFFERENT TUBULAR SEGMENTS

The changes in osmolarity and volume of the tubular fluid as it passes through the different parts of the nephron are shown in Figure 29-8.

Proximal Tubule. About 65\% of most filtered electrolytes is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. However, the proximal tubular membranes are highly permeable to water so, whenever solutes are reabsorbed, water also diffuses through the tubular membrane by osmosis. Water diffusion across the proximal tubular epithelium is aided by the water channel aquaporin 1 (AQP-1). Therefore, the osmolarity of the fluid remains about the same as the glomerular filtrate- $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$.

Figure 29-8. Changes in osmolarity of the tubular fluid as it passes through the different tubular segments in the presence of high levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and absence of ADH. (Numerical values indicate the approximate volumes in milliliters per minute or in osmolarities in milliosmoles per liter of fluid flowing along the different tubular segments.)
![gu607762836d](gu607762836d.jpg)

Descending Loop of Henle. As fluid flows down the descending loop of Henle, water is absorbed into the medulla. The descending limb also contains AQP-1 and is highly permeable to water but much less permeable to sodium chloride and urea. Therefore, the osmolarity of the fluid flowing through the descending loop gradually increases until it is nearly equal to that of the surrounding interstitial fluid, which is about $1200 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ when the blood concentration of ADH is high.

When dilute urine is being formed, as a result of low ADH concentrations, the medullary interstitial osmolarity is less than $1200 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$; consequently, the descending loop tubular fluid osmolarity also becomes less concentrated. This decrease in concentration is due partly to the fact that less urea is absorbed into the medullary interstitium from the collecting ducts when ADH levels are low, and the kidney is forming a large volume of dilute urine.

Thin Ascending Loop of Henle. The thin ascending limb is essentially impermeable to water but reabsorbs some sodium chloride. Because of the high concentration of sodium chloride in the tubular fluid as a result of water removal from the descending loop of Henle, there is some passive diffusion of sodium chloride from the thin ascending limb into the medullary interstitium. Thus, the tubular fluid becomes more dilute as the sodium chloride diffuses out of the tubule and water remains in the tubule.

Some of the urea absorbed into the medullary interstitium from the collecting ducts also diffuses into the ascending limb, thereby returning the urea to the tubular system and helping prevent its washout from the renal medulla. This urea recycling is an additional mechanism that contributes to the hyperosmotic renal medulla.

Thick Ascending Loop of Henle. The thick part of the ascending loop of Henle is also virtually impermeable to water, but large amounts of sodium, chloride, potassium, and other ions are actively transported from the tubule into the medullary interstitium. Therefore, fluid in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle becomes very dilute, falling to a concentration of about $140 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$.

Early Distal Tubule. The early distal tubule has properties similar to those of the thick ascending loop of Henle, so further dilution of the tubular fluid to about $100 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ occurs as solutes are reabsorbed while water remains in the tubule.

## Late Distal Tubule and Cortical Collecting Tubules.

In the late distal tubule and cortical collecting tubules, the osmolarity of the fluid depends on the level of ADH. With high ADH levels, these tubules are highly permeable to water, and significant amounts of water are reabsorbed. Urea, however, is not very permeant in this part of the nephron, resulting in increased urea concentration as water is reabsorbed. This process allows most of the urea delivered to the distal tubule and collecting
tubule to pass into the inner medullary collecting ducts, from which it is eventually reabsorbed or excreted in the urine. In the absence of ADH , little water is reabsorbed in the late distal tubule and cortical collecting tubule; therefore, osmolarity decreases even further because of continued active reabsorption of ions from these segments.

Inner Medullary Collecting Ducts. The concentration of fluid in the inner medullary collecting ducts also depends on the following: (1) ADH ; and (2) the surrounding medullary interstitium osmolarity established by the countercurrent mechanism. In the presence of large amounts of ADH , these ducts are highly permeable to water, and water diffuses from the tubule into the interstitial fluid until osmotic equilibrium is reached, with the tubular fluid having about the same concentration as the renal medullary interstitium (1200-1400 mOsm/L). Thus, a small volume of concentrated urine is produced when ADH levels are high. Because water reabsorption increases urea concentration in the tubular fluid, and because the inner medullary collecting ducts have specific urea transporters that greatly facilitate diffusion, much of the highly concentrated urea in the ducts diffuses out of the tubular lumen into the medullary interstitium. This absorption of the urea into the renal medulla contributes to the high osmolarity of the medullary interstitium and high concentrating ability of the kidney.

Several important points to consider may not be obvious from this discussion. First, although sodium chloride is one of the principal solutes that contribute to the hyperosmolarity of the medullary interstitium, the kidney can, when needed, excrete a highly concentrated urine that contains little sodium chloride. The hyperosmolarity of the urine in these circumstances is due to high concentrations of other solutes, especially of waste products such as urea. One condition in which this occurs is dehydration accompanied by low sodium intake. As discussed in Chapter 30, a low sodium intake stimulates formation of the hormones angiotensin II and aldosterone, which together cause avid sodium reabsorption from the tubules while leaving the urea and other solutes to maintain the highly concentrated urine.

Second, large quantities of dilute urine can be excreted without increasing sodium excretion. This feat is accomplished by decreasing ADH secretion, which reduces water reabsorption in the more distal tubular segments without significantly altering sodium reabsorption.

Finally, there is an obligatory urine volume dictated by the maximum concentrating ability of the kidney and amount of solute that must be excreted. Therefore, if large amounts of solute must be excreted, they must be accompanied by the minimal amount of water necessary to excrete them. For example, if 600 milliosmoles of solute must be excreted each day, this requires at least 0.5 liter of urine if the maximal urine concentrating ability is 1200 $\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$.

## Quantifying Renal Urine Concentration and Dilution: Free Water and Osmolar Clearances

The process of concentrating or diluting the urine requires the kidneys to excrete water and solutes somewhat independently. When the urine is dilute, water is excreted in excess of solutes. Conversely, when the urine is concentrated, solutes are excreted in excess of water.

The total clearance of solutes from the blood can be expressed as the osmolar clearance $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\text {osm }}\right)$. This is the volume of plasma cleared of solutes each minute, in the same way that clearance of a single substance is calculated:

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\text {osm }}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\text {osm }} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\text {osm }}}
$$

where $U_{\text {osm }}$ is the urine osmolarity, $\dot{V}$ is the urine flow rate, and $\mathrm{P}_{\text {osm }}$ is plasma osmolarity. For example, if the plasma osmolarity is $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, urine osmolarity is $600 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, and urine flow rate is $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}(0.001 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})$, the rate of osmolar excretion is $0.6 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{min}(600 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L} \times 0.001 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})$, and osmolar clearance is $0.6 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{min}$ divided by $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$, or $0.002 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}(2.0 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min})$. This means that 2 milliliters of plasma are being cleared of solute each minute.

## Free Water Clearance-Relative Rates at Which Solutes and Water Are Excreted

Free water clearance $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H} 2 \mathrm{O}}\right)$ is calculated as the difference between water excretion (urine flow rate) and osmolar clearance:

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}=\mathrm{V}-\mathrm{C}_{\text {osm }}=\mathrm{V}-\frac{\left(\mathrm{U}_{\text {osm }} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right)}{\mathrm{P}_{\text {osm }}}
$$

Thus, the rate of free water clearance represents the rate at which solute-free water is excreted by the kidneys. When free water clearance is positive, excess water is being excreted by the kidneys; when free water clearance is negative, excess solutes are being removed from the blood by the kidneys, and water is being conserved.

Using the example discussed earlier, if urine flow rate is $1$ $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ and osmolar clearance is $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, free water clearance would be $\sim 1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. This means that instead of water being cleared from the kidneys in excess of solutes, the kidneys are actually returning water to the systemic circulation, as occurs during water deficits. Thus, whenever urine osmolarity is greater than plasma osmolarity, free water clearance is negative, indicating water conservation.

When the kidneys are forming a dilute urine (i.e., urine osmolarity < plasma osmolarity), free water clearance will be a positive value, denoting that water is being removed from the plasma by the kidneys in excess of solutes. Thus, water free of solutes, called free water, is being lost from the body, and the plasma is being concentrated when free water clearance is positive.

## Disorders of Urinary Concentrating Ability

Impairment in the ability of the kidneys to concentrate or dilute the urine appropriately can occur with one or more of the following abnormalities:

1. Inappropriate secretion of ADH. Either too much or too little ADH secretion results in abnormal water excretion by the kidneys.
2. Impairment of the countercurrent mechanism. A hyperosmotic medullary interstitium is required for maximal
urine-concentrating ability. No matter how much ADH is present, maximal urine concentration is limited by the degree of hyperosmolarity of the medullary interstitium.
3. Inability of the distal tubules, collecting tubules, and collecting ducts to respond to ADH.
Failure to Produce ADH: Central Diabetes Insipidus. An inability to produce or release ADH from the posterior pituitary can be caused by head injuries or infections, or it can be congenital. Because the distal tubular segments cannot reabsorb water in the absence of ADH , this condition, called central diabetes insipidus, results in the formation of a large volume of dilute urine, with urine volumes that can exceed $15 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. The thirst mechanisms, discussed later in this chapter, are activated when excessive water is lost from the body; therefore, as long as the person drinks enough water, large decreases in body fluid water do not occur. The primary abnormality observed clinically in people with this condition is the large volume of dilute urine. However, if water intake is restricted, as can occur in a hospital setting when fluid intake is restricted or the patient is unconscious (e.g., because of a head injury), severe dehydration can rapidly occur.

The treatment for central diabetes insipidus is administration of a synthetic analogue of ADH, desmopressin, which acts selectively on $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ receptors to increase water permeability in the late distal and collecting tubules. Desmopressin can be given by injection, as a nasal spray, or orally, and it rapidly restores urine output toward normal.

Inability of Kidneys to Respond to ADH: Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus. In some circumstances, normal or elevated levels of ADH are present but the renal tubular segments cannot respond appropriately. This condition is referred to as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus because the abnormality resides in the kidneys. This abnormality can be due to failure of the countercurrent mechanism to form a hyperosmotic renal medullary interstitium or failure of the distal and collecting tubules and collecting ducts to respond to ADH. In either case, large volumes of dilute urine are formed, which causes dehydration unless fluid intake is increased by the same amount as urine volume is increased.

Many types of renal diseases can impair the concentrating mechanism, especially those that damage the renal medulla (see Chapter 32 for further discussion). Also, impairment of the function of the loop of Henle, as occurs with diuretics that inhibit electrolyte reabsorption by this segment, such as furosemide, can compromise urineconcentrating ability. Furthermore, certain drugs such as lithium (used to treat manic-depressive disorders) and tetracyclines (used as antibiotics) can impair the ability of the distal nephron segments to respond to ADH.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be distinguished from central diabetes insipidus by administration of desmopressin, the synthetic analogue of ADH. Lack of a prompt decrease in urine volume and an increase in urine osmolarity within 2 hours after injection of desmopressin is strongly suggestive of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The appropriate treatment for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is to correct, if possible, the underlying renal disorder. The hypernatremia can also be attenuated by a low-sodium diet and administration of a diuretic that enhances renal sodium excretion, such as a thiazide diuretic.

## CONTROL OF EXTRACELLULAR FLUID OSMOLARITY AND SODIUM CONCENTRATION

Regulation of extracellular fluid osmolarity and sodium concentration are closely linked because sodium is the most abundant ion in the extracellular compartment. Plasma sodium concentration is normally regulated within close limits of 140 to $145 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, with an average concentration of about $142 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. Osmolarity averages about $300 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}(\approx 282 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$ when corrected for interionic attraction) and seldom changes more than $\pm 2 \%$ to $3 \%$. As discussed in Chapter 25, these variables must be precisely controlled because they determine the distribution of fluid between the intracellular and extracellular compartments.

## Estimating Plasma Osmolarity From Plasma Sodium Concentration

In most clinical laboratories, plasma osmolarity is not routinely measured. However, because sodium and its associated anions account for about $94 \%$ of the solute in the extracellular compartment, plasma osmolarity ( $\mathrm{P}_{\text {osm }}$ ) can be roughly estimated from the plasma sodium concentration $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}\right)$as follows:

$$
\mathrm{P}_{\text {osm }}=2.1 \times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}(\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})
$$

For example, with a plasma sodium concentration of $142 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, the plasma osmolarity would be estimated from this formula to be about $298 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{L}$. To be more exact, especially in conditions associated with renal disease, the contribution of the plasma concentrations (in units of $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) of two other solutes, glucose and urea, are usually included:
$\mathrm{P}_{\text {osm }}=2 \times\left[\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}, \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}\right]+\left[\mathrm{P}_{\text {glucose }}, \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}\right]+\left[\mathrm{P}_{\text {urea }}, \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}\right]$
Such estimates of plasma osmolarity are usually accurate within a few percentage points of those measured directly.

Normally, sodium ions and associated anions (primarily bicarbonate and chloride) represent about $94 \%$ of the extracellular osmoles, with glucose and urea contributing about $3 \%$ to $5 \%$ of the total osmoles. However, because urea easily permeates most cell membranes, it exerts little effective osmotic pressure under steady-state conditions. Therefore, the sodium ions in the extracellular fluid and associated anions are the principal determinants of fluid movement across the cell membrane. Consequently, we can discuss the control of osmolarity and control of sodium ion concentration at the same time.

Although multiple mechanisms control the amount of sodium and water excretion by the kidneys, two primary systems are especially involved in regulating the concentration of sodium and osmolarity of extracellular fluid: (1) the osmoreceptor-ADH system; and (2) the thirst mechanism.
![gu617762836d](gu617762836d.jpg)

Figure 29-9. Osmoreceptor-antidiuretic hormone (ADH) feedback mechanism for regulating extracellular fluid osmolarity in response to a water deficit.

## OSMORECEPTOR-ADH FEEDBACK SYSTEM

Figure 29-9 shows the basic components of the osmoreceptor-ADH feedback system for control of extracellular fluid sodium concentration and osmolarity. When osmolarity increases above normal because of water deficit, for example, this feedback system operates as follows:

1. An increase in extracellular fluid osmolarity (which in practical terms means an increase in plasma sodium concentration) causes the special nerve cells called osmoreceptor cells, located in the anterior hypothalamus near the supraoptic nuclei, to shrink.
2. Shrinkage of the osmoreceptor cells causes them to fire, sending nerve signals to additional nerve cells in the supraoptic nuclei, which then relay these signals down the stalk of the pituitary gland to the posterior pituitary.
3. These action potentials conducted to the posterior pituitary stimulate release of ADH , which is stored in secretory granules (or vesicles) in the nerve endings.
4. ADH enters the blood stream and is transported to the kidneys, where it increases the water permeability of the late distal tubules, cortical collecting tubules, and medullary collecting ducts.

5. The increased water permeability in the distal nephron segments causes increased water reabsorption and excretion of a small volume of concentrated urine.
Thus, water is conserved while sodium and other solutes continue to be excreted in the urine. This causes dilution of the solutes in the extracellular fluid, thereby correcting the initial excessively concentrated extracellular fluid.

The opposite sequence of events occurs when the extracellular fluid becomes too dilute (hypo-osmotic). For example, with excess water ingestion and a decrease in extracellular fluid osmolarity, less ADH is formed, the renal tubules decrease their permeability for water, less water is reabsorbed, and a large volume of dilute urine is formed. This in turn concentrates the body fluids and returns plasma osmolarity toward normal.

## ADH SYNTHESIS IN SUPRAOPTIC AND PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEI OF HYPOTHALAMUS AND ADH RELEASE FROM POSTERIOR PITUITARY

Figure 29-10 shows the neuroanatomy of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, where ADH is synthesized and released. The hypothalamus contains two types of magnocellular (large) neurons that synthesize ADH in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothala$m u s$, about five-sixths in the supraoptic nuclei and about one-sixth in the paraventricular nuclei. Both of these nuclei have axonal extensions to the posterior pituitary. Once ADH is synthesized, it is transported down the axons of the neurons to their tips, terminating in the posterior pituitary gland. When the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei are stimulated by increased osmolarity or other factors, nerve impulses pass down these nerve endings, changing their membrane permeability and increasing calcium entry. ADH stored in the secretory granules (also called vesicles) of the nerve endings is released in response to increased calcium entry. The released ADH is then carried away in the capillary blood of the posterior pituitary into the systemic circulation. The secretion of ADH in response to an osmotic stimulus is rapid, so plasma ADH levels can increase several-fold within minutes, thereby providing a rapid means for altering renal excretion of water.

A second neuronal area important in controlling osmolarity and ADH secretion is located along the anteroventral region of the third ventricle, called the AV3V region. At the upper part of this region is a structure called the subfornical organ and, at the inferior part, is another structure called the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. Between these two organs is the median preoptic nucleus, which has multiple nerve connections with the two organs, as well as with the supraoptic nuclei and blood pressure control centers in the medulla of the brain. Lesions of the AV3V

region cause multiple deficits in the control of ADH secretion, thirst, sodium appetite, and blood pressure. Electrical stimulation of this region or stimulation by angiotensin II can increase ADH secretion, thirst, and sodium appetite.

In the vicinity of the AV3V region and supraoptic nuclei are neuronal cells that are excited by small increases in extracellular fluid osmolarity-hence, the term osmoreceptors has been used to describe these neurons. These cells send nerve signals to the supraoptic nuclei to control their firing and secretion of ADH . It is also likely that they induce thirst in response to increased extracellular fluid osmolarity.

Both the subfornical organ and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis have vascular supplies that lack the typical blood-brain barrier that impedes the diffusion of most ions from the blood into brain tissue. This characteristic makes it possible for ions and other solutes to cross between the blood and local interstitial fluid in this region. As a result, the osmoreceptors rapidly respond to changes in osmolarity of the extracellular fluid, exerting powerful control over the secretion of ADH and over thirst, as discussed later.

Figure 29-11. Effect of increased plasma osmolarity or decreased blood volume on the level of plasma $(P)$ antidiuretic hormone $(A D H)$, also called arginine vasopressin ( $A V P$ ). (Modified from Dunn FL, Brennan TJ, Nelson AE, et al: The role of blood osmolality and volume in regulating vasopressin secretion in the rat. J Clin Invest 52[12]:3212, 1973.)

## STIMULATION OF ADH RELEASE BY DECREASED ARTERIAL PRESSURE AND/ OR DECREASED BLOOD VOLUME

ADH release is also controlled by cardiovascular reflexes that respond to decreases in blood pressure and/or blood volume, including the following: (1) the arterial baroreceptor reflexes; and (2) the cardiopulmonary reflexes, both of which are discussed in Chapter 18. These reflex pathways originate in high-pressure regions of the circulation, such as the aortic arch and carotid sinus, and in low-pressure regions, especially in the cardiac atria. Afferent stimuli are carried by the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, with synapses in the nuclei of the tractus solitarius. Projections from these nuclei relay signals to the hypothalamic nuclei that control ADH synthesis and secretion.

Thus, in addition to increased osmolarity, two other stimuli increase ADH secretion: (1) decreased arterial pressure; and (2) decreased blood volume. Whenever blood pressure and blood volume are reduced, such as during hemorrhage, increased ADH secretion causes increased fluid reabsorption by the kidneys, helping restore blood pressure and blood volume toward normal.

## Quantitative Importance of Osmolarity and Cardiovascular Reflexes in Stimulating ADH Secretion

As shown in Figure 29-11, a decrease in effective blood volume or an increase in extracellular fluid osmolarity stimulates ADH secretion. However, ADH is considerably

Table 29-2 Control of Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion

| Increase ADH | Decrease ADH |
| :--: | :--: |
| $\uparrow$ Plasma osmolarity | $\downarrow$ Plasma osmolarity |
| $\downarrow$ Blood volume | $\uparrow$ Blood volume |
| $\downarrow$ Blood pressure | $\uparrow$ Blood pressure |
| Nausea |  |
| Hypoxia |  |
| Drugs | Drugs |
| Morphine | Alcohol |
| Nicotine | Clonidine (antihypertensive) |
| Cyclophosphamide | Haloperidol (dopamine blocker) |

more sensitive to small changes in osmolarity than to similar percentage changes in blood volume. For example, a change in plasma osmolarity of only $1 \%$ is sufficient to increase ADH levels. By contrast, after blood loss, plasma ADH levels do not change appreciably until blood volume is reduced by about $10 \%$. With further decreases in blood volume, ADH levels rapidly increase. Thus, with severe decreases in blood volume, the cardiovascular reflexes play a major role in stimulating ADH secretion. The usual daily regulation of ADH secretion during simple dehydration is effected mainly by changes in plasma osmolarity. Decreases in blood volume and blood pressure, however, greatly enhance the ADH response to increased osmolarity.

## OTHER STIMULI FOR ADH SECRETION

ADH secretion can also be increased or decreased by other stimuli to the central nervous system, as well as by various drugs and hormones, as shown in Table 29-2. For example, nausea is a potent stimulus for ADH release, which may increase to as much as 100 times normal after vomiting. Also, drugs such as nicotine and morphine stimulate ADH release, whereas some drugs, such as alcohol, inhibit ADH release. The marked diuresis that occurs after ingestion of alcohol is due in part to the inhibition of ADH release.

## IMPORTANCE OF THIRST IN CONTROLLING EXTRACELLULAR FLUID OSMOLARITY AND SODIUM CONCENTRATION

The kidneys minimize fluid loss during water deficits through the osmoreceptor-ADH feedback system. Adequate fluid intake, however, is necessary to counterbalance whatever fluid loss does occur through sweating and breathing and through the gastrointestinal tract. Fluid intake is regulated by the thirst mechanism, which, together with the osmoreceptor-ADH mechanism, maintains precise control of extracellular fluid osmolarity and sodium concentration.

Table 29-3 Control of Thirst

| Increase Thirst | Decrease Thirst |
| :-- | :-- |
| $\uparrow$ Plasma osmolarity | $\downarrow$ Plasma osmolarity |
| $\downarrow$ Blood volume | $\uparrow$ Blood volume |
| $\downarrow$ Blood pressure | $\uparrow$ Blood pressure |
| $\uparrow$ Angiotensin II | $\downarrow$ Angiotensin II |
| Dry mouth | Gastric distention |

Many of the same factors that stimulate ADH secretion also increase thirst, which is defined as the conscious desire for water.

## CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM CENTERS FOR THIRST

Referring again to Figure 29-10, the same area along the anteroventral wall of the third ventricle that promotes ADH release also stimulates thirst. Located anterolaterally in the preoptic nucleus is another small area that when stimulated electrically, causes immediate drinking that continues as long as the stimulation lasts. All these areas together are called the thirst center.

The neurons of the thirst center respond to injections of hypertonic salt solutions by stimulating drinking behavior. These cells almost certainly function as osmoreceptors to activate the thirst mechanism in the same way that the osmoreceptors stimulate ADH release.

Increased osmolarity of the cerebrospinal fluid in the third ventricle has essentially the same effect to promote drinking. It is likely that the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, which lies immediately beneath the ventricular surface at the inferior end of the AV3V region, is intimately involved in mediating this response.

## STIMULI FOR THIRST

Table 29-3 summarizes some of the known stimuli for thirst.

1. One of the most important is increased extracellular fluid osmolarity, which causes intracellular dehydration in the thirst centers, thereby stimulating the sensation of thirst.
The value of this response is obvious: it helps dilute extracellular fluids and returns osmolarity toward normal.
2. Decreases in extracellular fluid volume and arterial pressure also stimulate thirst by a pathway that is independent of the one stimulated by increased plasma osmolarity.
Thus, blood volume loss by hemorrhage stimulates thirst, even though there might be no change in plasma osmolarity. This stimulation probably occurs because of neural input from cardiopulmonary and systemic arterial baroreceptors in the circulation.
3. A third important stimulus for thirst is angiotensin II.

Studies in animals have shown that angiotensin II acts on the subfornical organ and on the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. These regions are outside the blood-brain barrier, and peptides such as angiotensin II diffuse into the tissues. Because angiotensin II is also stimulated by factors associated with hypovolemia and low blood pressure, its effect on thirst helps restore blood volume and blood pressure toward normal along with the other actions of angiotensin II on the kidneys to decrease fluid excretion.
4. Dryness of the mouth and mucous membranes of the esophagus can elicit the sensation of thirst.
As a result, a thirsty person may receive relief from thirst almost immediately after drinking water, even though the water has not been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has not yet had an effect on extracellular fluid osmolarity.
5. Gastrointestinal and pharyngeal stimuli influence thirst.
In animals that have an esophageal opening to the exterior so that water is never absorbed into the blood, partial relief of thirst occurs after drinking, although the relief is only temporary. Also, gastrointestinal distention may partially alleviate thirst; For example, simple inflation of a balloon in the stomach can relieve thirst. However, relief of thirst sensations through gastrointestinal or pharyngeal mechanisms is short-lived; the desire to drink is completely satisfied only when plasma osmolarity and/or blood volume returns to normal.

The ability of animals and humans to "meter" fluid intake is important because it prevents overhydration. After a person drinks water, 30 to 60 minutes may be required for the water to be reabsorbed and distributed throughout the body. If the thirst sensation were not temporarily relieved after drinking water, the person would continue to drink more and more, eventually leading to overhydration and excess dilution of the body fluids. Experimental studies have repeatedly shown that animals drink almost exactly the amount necessary to return plasma osmolarity and volume to normal.

## THRESHOLD FOR OSMOLAR STIMULUS OF DRINKING

The kidneys must continually excrete an obligatory amount of water, even in a dehydrated person, to rid the body of excess solutes that are ingested or produced by metabolism. Water is also lost by evaporation from the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract and by evaporation and sweating from the skin. Therefore, there is always a tendency for dehydration, with resultant increased extracellular fluid sodium concentration and osmolarity.

When the sodium concentration increases only about $2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ above normal, the thirst mechanism is activated, causing a desire to drink water. This is called the threshold for drinking. Thus, even small increases in plasma osmolarity are normally followed by water intake, which restores extracellular fluid osmolarity and volume toward

normal. In this way, the extracellular fluid osmolarity and sodium concentration are precisely controlled.

Disorders of Thirst and Water Intake. As discussed previously, increased thirst occurs in various medical disorders associated with increased urine volume and reductions in extracellular fluid volume, such as poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus. In these cases, increased water intake serves as a compensatory response for increased plasma osmolarity and/or extracellular fluid volume depletion. Polydipsia, or excessive thirst, occasionally occurs in the absence of known physiological stimuli for thirst. Psychogenic polydipsia, for example, may be caused by mental illnesses such as schizophrenia or obsessive-compulsive disorders and can lead to significant hyponatremia. In contrast, adipsia, the absence of thirst even in the presence of hypernatremia or volume depletion, is rare but usually results from lesions to the hypothalamic thirst centers caused by trauma, infection, or surgery. Partial deficiency of the thirst mechanism, causing inadequate water intake (hypodipsia), or an inability to access fluid may occur in patients who have suffered stroke, in older patients with dementia, or in critically ill patients. In the absence of adequate water intake, dehydration and hypernatremia occur, despite large increases in ADH levels.

## INTEGRATED RESPONSES OF OSMORECEPTOR-ADH AND THIRST MECHANISMS

In a healthy person, the osmoreceptor-ADH and thirst mechanisms work in parallel to regulate extracellular fluid osmolarity and sodium concentration precisely, despite the constant challenges of dehydration. Even with additional challenges, such as high salt intake, these feedback systems are usually able to keep plasma osmolarity reasonably constant. Figure 29-12 shows that an increase in sodium intake to as high as six times normal has only a small effect on plasma sodium concentration as long as the ADH and thirst mechanisms are both functioning normally.

When the ADH or thirst mechanism fails, ordinarily the other can still control extracellular osmolarity and sodium concentration with reasonable effectiveness as long as there is enough fluid intake to balance the daily obligatory urine volume and water losses caused by respiration, sweating, or gastrointestinal losses. However, if both the ADH and thirst mechanisms fail simultaneously, plasma sodium concentration and osmolarity are poorly controlled. Thus, when sodium intake is increased after blocking the total ADH-thirst system, relatively large changes in plasma sodium concentration occur. In the absence of the ADH-thirst mechanisms, no other feedback mechanism is capable of adequately regulating plasma sodium concentration and osmolarity.

## Role of Angiotensin II and Aldosterone in Controlling Extracellular Fluid Osmolarity and Sodium Concentration

As discussed in Chapter 28, both angiotensin II and aldosterone play an important role in regulating sodium reab-
![gu647762836d](gu647762836d.jpg)

Figure 29-12. Effect of large changes in sodium intake on extracellular fluid sodium concentration in dogs under normal conditions (red line) and after the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and thirst feedback systems were blocked (blue line).

sorption by the renal tubules. When sodium intake is low, increased levels of these hormones stimulate sodium reabsorption by the kidneys and prevent large sodium losses, even though sodium intake may be reduced to as low as $10 \%$ of normal. Conversely, with high sodium intake, decreased formation of these hormones permits the kidneys to excrete large amounts of sodium.

Because of the importance of angiotensin II and aldosterone in regulating sodium excretion by the kidneys, one might mistakenly infer that they also play a major role in regulating extracellular fluid sodium concentration. Although these hormones increase the amount of sodium in the extracellular fluid, they also increase the extracellular fluid volume by increasing reabsorption of water along with the sodium. Therefore, angiotensin II and aldosterone have little effect on sodium concentration, except under extreme conditions.

This relative unimportance of aldosterone in regulating extracellular fluid sodium concentration is shown by the experiment depicted in Figure 29-13. This figure shows the effect on plasma sodium concentration of changing sodium intake more than sixfold under two conditions: (1) under normal conditions; and (2) after the aldosterone feedback system was blocked by removing the adrenal glands and infusing the animals with aldosterone at a constant rate so that plasma levels could not increase or decrease. Note that when sodium intake was increased sixfold, plasma concentration changed only about $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ in either case. This finding indicates that even without a functional aldosterone feedback system, plasma sodium concentration can be well regulated. The same type of experiment has been conducted after blocking angiotensin II formation, with the same result.

![gu657762836d](gu657762836d.jpg)

Figure 29-13. Effect of large changes in sodium intake on extracellular fluid sodium concentration in dogs under normal conditions (red line) and after the aldosterone feedback system was blocked (blue line). Note that the sodium concentration was maintained relatively constant over this wide range of sodium intakes, with or without aldosterone feedback control. (Courtesy Dr. David B. Young.)

There are two primary reasons why changes in angiotensin II and aldosterone do not have a major effect on plasma sodium concentration. First, as discussed earlier, angiotensin II and aldosterone increase both sodium and water reabsorption by the renal tubules, leading to increases in extracellular fluid volume and sodium quantity but little change in sodium concentration. Second, as long as the ADH-thirst mechanism is functional, any tendency toward increased plasma sodium concentration is compensated for by increased water intake or increased plasma ADH secretion, which tends to dilute the extracellular fluid back toward normal. The ADH-thirst system far overshadows the angiotensin II and aldosterone systems for regulating sodium concentration under normal conditions. Even in patients with primary aldosteronism, who have extremely high levels of aldosterone, the plasma sodium concentration usually increases only about 3 to 5 $\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ above normal.

Under extreme conditions caused by complete loss of aldosterone secretion as a result of adrenalectomy or in patients with Addison disease (severely impaired secretion or total lack of aldosterone), there is tremendous loss of sodium by the kidneys, which can lead to a marked reduction in plasma sodium concentration. One reason for this is that large losses of sodium eventually cause severe volume depletion and decreased blood pressure, which can activate the thirst mechanism through the cardiovascular reflexes. This activation leads to a further dilution of the plasma sodium concentration, even though the increased water intake helps minimize the decrease in body fluid volumes under these conditions.

Thus, there are extreme situations in which the plasma sodium concentration may change significantly, even with a functional ADH-thirst mechanism. Even so, the ADHthirst mechanism is the most powerful feedback system in the body for controlling extracellular fluid osmolarity and sodium concentration.

## Salt-Appetite Mechanism for Controlling Extracellular Fluid Sodium Concentration and Volume

The maintenance of a normal extracellular fluid volume and sodium concentration requires a balance between sodium excretion and sodium intake. Currently, sodium intake is almost always greater than necessary for homeostasis. In fact, the average sodium intake for persons in industrialized cultures who eat processed foods usually ranges between 100 and $200 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day, even though humans can survive and function normally while ingesting only 10 to 20 $\mathrm{mEq} /$ day. Thus, most people eat far more sodium than is necessary for homeostasis, and evidence indicates that our usual high sodium intake may contribute to cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension.

Salt appetite is due in part to the fact that animals and humans like salt and eat it, regardless of whether they are salt-deficient. Salt appetite also has a regulatory component in which there is a behavioral drive to obtain salt when a sodium deficiency exists in the body. This behavioral drive is particularly important in herbivores, which naturally eat a low-sodium diet, but salt craving may also be important in humans, especially in those who have an extreme deficiency of sodium, such as occurs in Addison disease. In this case, there is a deficiency of aldosterone secretion, which causes excessive loss of sodium in the urine and leads to decreased extracellular fluid volume and decreased sodium concentration; both of these changes elicit the desire for salt.

In general, the primary stimuli that increase salt appetite are those associated with sodium deficits and decreased blood volume or decreased blood pressure associated with circulatory insufficiency.

The neuronal mechanism for salt appetite is analogous to that of the thirst mechanism. Some of the same neuronal centers in the AV3V region of the brain seem to be involved because lesions in this region frequently affect both thirst and salt appetite simultaneously in animals. Also, circulatory reflexes elicited by low blood pressure or decreased blood volume affect both thirst and salt appetite at the same time.

# Renal Regulation of Potassium, Calcium, Phosphate, and Magnesium; Integration of Renal Mechanisms for Control of Blood Volume and Extracellular Fluid Volume 

## REGULATION OF EXTRACELLULAR FLUID POTASSIUM CONCENTRATION AND POTASSIUM EXCRETION

The extracellular fluid potassium concentration normally is regulated at about $4.2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, seldom rising or falling more than $\pm 0.3 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. This precise control is necessary because many cell functions are sensitive to changes in extracellular fluid potassium concentration. For example, an increase in plasma potassium concentration of only 3 to $4 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ can cause cardiac arrhythmias, and higher concentrations can lead to cardiac arrest or fibrillation.

A special difficulty in regulating extracellular potassium concentration is the fact that more than $98 \%$ of the total body potassium is contained in the cells, and only $2 \%$ is contained in the extracellular fluid (Figure 30-1). For a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ adult, who has about 28 liters of intracellular fluid ( $40 \%$ of body weight) and 14 liters of extracellular fluid ( $20 \%$ of body weight), about 3920 mEq of potassium are inside the cells, and only about 59 mEq are in the extracellular fluid. Also, the potassium contained in a single meal may be as high as 50 mEq , and the daily intake usually ranges between 50 and $200 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day; therefore, failure to rapidly rid the extracellular fluid of the ingested potassium could cause life-threatening hyperkalemia (increased plasma potassium concentration). Likewise, a small loss of potassium from the extracellular fluid could cause severe hypokalemia (low plasma potassium concentration) in the absence of rapid and appropriate compensatory responses.

Maintenance of a balance between intake and output of potassium depends primarily on excretion by the kidneys because the amount excreted in the feces is only about $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the potassium intake. Thus, the maintenance of a normal potassium balance requires the kidneys to adjust their potassium excretion rapidly and precisely in response to wide variations in intake, as is also true for most other electrolytes.

Control of potassium distribution between the extracellular and intracellular compartments also plays an important role in potassium homeostasis. Because more
than $98 \%$ of the total body potassium is contained in the cells, they can serve as an overflow site for excess extracellular fluid potassium during hyperkalemia or as a source of potassium during hypokalemia. Thus, redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments provides a first line of defense against changes in extracellular fluid potassium concentration.

## REGULATION OF INTERNAL POTASSIUM DISTRIBUTION

After ingestion of a potassium-rich meal, extracellular fluid potassium concentration would rise to a dangerous level if the ingested potassium did not move into the cells rapidly. For example, absorption of 40 mEq of potassium (the amount contained in a meal rich in vegetables and fruit) into an extracellular fluid volume of 14 liters would raise plasma potassium concentration by about 2.9 $\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ if all the potassium remained in the extracellular compartment. Fortunately, most of the ingested potassium rapidly moves into the cells until the kidneys can eliminate the excess. Between meals, plasma potassium concentration also remains nearly constant as potassium

|  | Increased extracellular fluid osmolarity |

is released by the cells to balance the extracellular fluid potassium excreted by the kidneys. Table 30-1 summarizes some of the factors that can influence the distribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments.

Insulin Stimulates Potassium Uptake Into Cells. Insulin stimulates sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity in many tissues, including skeletal muscle, which in turn transports potassium into the cells. Insulin is important for increasing cell potassium uptake after a meal. In people who have insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus, the rise in plasma potassium concentration after eating a meal is much greater than normal. Injections of insulin, however, can help correct the hyperkalemia.

Aldosterone Increases Potassium Uptake Into Cells. Increased potassium intake also stimulates secretion of aldosterone, which increases cell potassium uptake. Excess aldosterone secretion (Conn syndrome) is almost invariably associated with hypokalemia, due in part to movement of extracellular potassium into the cells. Conversely, patients with deficient aldosterone production (Addison disease) often have clinically significant hyperkalemia due to accumulation of potassium in the extracellular space, as well as renal retention of potassium.
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$-Adrenergic Stimulation Increases Cellular Uptake of Potassium. Increased secretion of catecholamines, especially epinephrine, can cause movement of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular fluid, mainly by activation of $\beta_{2}$-adrenergic receptors. Conversely, treatment of hypertension with $\beta$-adrenergic receptor blockers, such as propranolol, causes potassium to move out of the cells and creates a tendency toward hyperkalemia.

Acid-Base Abnormalities Can Cause Changes in Potassium Distribution. Metabolic acidosis increases extracellular potassium concentration, in part by causing loss of potassium from the cells, whereas metabolic alkalosis decreases extracellular fluid potassium concentration. Although the mechanisms responsible for the effect of hydrogen ion concentration on internal distribution of potassium are not completely understood, one effect of increased hydrogen ion concentration is to reduce activity of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump. This reduction, in turn, decreases cellular uptake of potassium and raises extracellular potassium concentration. Alkalosis has the opposite effect, shifting potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells and tending to cause hypokalemia.

Cell Lysis Causes Increased Extracellular Potassium Concentration. As cells are destroyed, the large amounts of potassium contained in the cells are released into the extracellular fluid. This release of potassium can cause significant hyperkalemia if large amounts of tissue are destroyed, as occurs with severe muscle injury or with red blood cell lysis.

Strenuous Exercise Can Cause Hyperkalemia by Releasing Potassium From Skeletal Muscle. During prolonged exercise, potassium is released from skeletal muscle into the extracellular fluid. Usually the hyperkalemia is mild, but it may be clinically significant after heavy exercise, especially in patients treated with $\beta$-adrenergic blockers or in individuals with insulin deficiency. In rare cases, hyperkalemia after exercise may be severe enough to cause cardiac toxicity.

Increased Extracellular Fluid Osmolarity Causes Redistribution of Potassium From Cells to Extracellular Fluid. Increased extracellular fluid osmolarity causes osmotic flow of water out of the cells. The cellular dehydration increases intracellular potassium concentration, thereby promoting diffusion of potassium out of the cells and increasing extracellular fluid potassium concentration. Decreased extracellular fluid osmolarity has the opposite effect.

## OVERVIEW OF RENAL POTASSIUM EXCRETION

Renal potassium excretion is determined by the sum of three processes: (1) the rate of potassium filtration (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] multiplied by the plasma potassium concentration); (2) the rate of potassium reabsorption by the tubules; and (3) the rate of potassium secretion by the tubules. The normal rate of potassium filtration by the glomerular capillaries is about $756 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day (GFR, $180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, multiplied by plasma potassium concentration, $4.2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ). This rate of filtration is relatively

![gu677762836d](gu677762836d.jpg)

Figure 30-2. Renal tubular sites of potassium reabsorption and secretion. Potassium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and ascending loop of Henle, so only about $8 \%$ of the filtered load is delivered to the distal tubule. Secretion of potassium by the principal cells of the late distal tubules and collecting ducts adds to the amount delivered, but there is some additional reabsorption by the intercalated cells; therefore, the daily excretion is about $12 \%$ of the potassium filtered at the glomerular capillaries. The percentages indicate how much of the filtered load is reabsorbed or secreted into the different tubular segments.
constant in healthy persons because of the autoregulatory mechanisms for GFR discussed previously and the precision with which plasma potassium concentration is regulated. Severe decreases in GFR in certain renal diseases, however, can cause serious potassium accumulation and hyperkalemia.

Figure 30-2 summarizes the tubular handling of potassium under normal conditions. About $65 \%$ of the filtered potassium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Another $25 \%$ to $30 \%$ of the filtered potassium is reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, especially in the thick ascending part, where potassium is actively co-transported along with sodium and chloride. In the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, a relatively constant fraction of the filtered potassium load is reabsorbed. Changes in potassium reabsorption in these segments can influence potassium excretion, but most of the daily variation of potassium excretion is not due to changes in reabsorption in the proximal tubule or loop of Henle. The collecting tubules and collecting ducts reabsorb potassium at variable rates, depending on the potassium intake.

## Variable Potassium Secretion in Distal and Collecting Tubules Mediates Most Daily Changes in Potassium

Excretion. The most important sites for regulating potassium excretion are the principal cells of the late distal tubules and cortical collecting tubules. In these tubular segments, potassium can at times be reabsorbed or at

Figure 30-3. Mechanisms of potassium secretion and sodium reabsorption by the principal cells of the late distal and collecting tubules. BK, "big" potassium channel; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; ROMK, renal outer medullary potassium channel.
other times can be secreted, depending on the needs of the body. With a normal potassium intake of $100 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day, the kidneys must excrete about $92 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day (the remaining 8 mEq are lost in the feces). About $60 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day of potassium are secreted into the distal and collecting tubules, accounting for most of the excreted potassium.

With a high potassium intake, the required extra excretion of potassium is achieved almost entirely by increasing the secretion of potassium into the distal and collecting tubules. In fact, in those who consume extremely highpotassium diets, the rate of potassium excretion can exceed the amount of potassium in the glomerular filtrate, indicating a powerful mechanism for secreting potassium.

When potassium intake is low, secretion of potassium in the distal and collecting tubules decreases, causing a reduction in urinary potassium excretion. There is also increased reabsorption of potassium by the intercalated cells in the distal segments of the nephron, and potassium excretion can fall to less than $1 \%$ of the potassium in the glomerular filtrate (to $<10 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day). With potassium intakes below this level, severe hypokalemia can develop.

Thus, most of the daily regulation of potassium excretion occurs in the late distal and cortical collecting tubules, where potassium can be reabsorbed or secreted, depending on the needs of the body. In the next section, we consider the basic mechanisms of potassium secretion and the factors that regulate this process.

## PRINCIPAL CELLS OF LATE DISTAL AND CORTICAL COLLECTING TUBULES SECRETE POTASSIUM

The cells in the late distal and cortical collecting tubules that secrete potassium are called principal cells and make up most of the epithelial cells in these regions. Figure 30-3 shows the basic cellular mechanisms of potassium secretion by the principal cells.

Secretion of potassium from the blood into the tubular lumen is a two-step process, beginning with uptake from the interstitium into the cell by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump in the basolateral cell membrane. This pump moves sodium out of the cell into the interstitium and, at the same time, moves potassium to the interior of the cell.

The second step of the process is passive diffusion of potassium from the interior of the cell into the tubular fluid. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump creates a high intracellular potassium concentration, which provides the driving force for passive diffusion of potassium from the cell into the tubular lumen. The luminal membrane of the principal cells is highly permeable to potassium because there are two types of special channels that allow potassium ions to diffuse across the membrane rapidly: (1) the renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channels, and (2) high-conductance, "big" potassium (BK) channels. Both types of potassium channels are required for efficient renal potassium excretion, and their abundance in the luminal membrane is increased during high potassium intake.

Control of Potassium Secretion by Principal Cells. The primary factors that control potassium secretion by the principal cells of the late distal and cortical collecting tubules are the following: (1) the activity of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase pump; (2) the electrochemical gradient for potassium secretion from the blood to the tubular lumen; and (3) the permeability of the luminal membrane for potassium. These three determinants of potassium secretion are, in turn, regulated by several factors, discussed later.

## Intercalated Cells Can Reabsorb or Secrete Potassium.

In circumstances associated with severe potassium depletion, there is a cessation of potassium secretion and a net reabsorption of potassium in the late distal and collecting tubules. This reabsorption occurs through the type $A$ intercalated cells. Although this reabsorptive process is not completely understood, one mechanism believed to contribute is a hydrogen-potassium ATPase transport mechanism located in the luminal membrane (see Chapter 28, Figure 28-13). This transporter reabsorbs potassium in exchange for hydrogen ions secreted into the tubular lumen, and the potassium then diffuses through basolateral membrane potassium channels into the interstitial fluid. This abundance of intercalated cell hydrogen-potassium ATPase transporters is enhanced with potassium depletion and hypokalemia, causing increased hydrogen ion secretion and alkalosis. Under normal conditions, however, potassium reabsorption by intercalated cells plays only a small role in controlling potassium excretion.

When there is excess potassium in the body fluids, type $B$ intercalated cells in the late distal tubules and collecting tubules actively secrete potassium into the tubular lumen and have functions that are opposite to those of type A cells (see Chapter 28, Figure 28-13). Potassium is

pumped into the type B intercalated cell by a hydrogenpotassium ATPase transporter on the basolateral membrane, and it then diffuses into the tubular lumen through potassium channels.

## SUMMARY OF MAJOR FACTORS THAT REGULATE POTASSIUM SECRETION

Because the normal regulation of potassium excretion occurs mainly as a result of changes in potassium secretion by the principal cells of the late distal and collecting tubules, in this chapter we discuss the primary factors that influence secretion by these cells. The most important factors that stimulate potassium secretion by the principal cells include the following: (1) increased extracellular fluid potassium concentration; (2) increased aldosterone; and (3) increased tubular flow rate.

One factor that decreases potassium secretion is an increased hydrogen ion concentration (acidosis).

Increased Extracellular Fluid Potassium Concentration Stimulates Potassium Secretion. The rate of potassium secretion in the late distal and cortical collecting tubules is directly stimulated by increased extracellular fluid potassium concentration, leading to increases in potassium excretion, as shown in Figure 30-4. This effect is especially pronounced when extracellular fluid potassium concentration rises above about $4.1 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, slightly less than the normal concentration. Increased plasma potassium concentration, therefore, serves as one of the most important mechanisms for increasing potassium secretion and regulating extracellular fluid potassium ion concentration.

Increased dietary potassium intake and increased extracellular fluid potassium concentration stimulate potassium secretion by at least four mechanisms:

1. Increased extracellular fluid potassium concentration stimulates the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump, thereby increasing potassium uptake across the basolateral membrane. This increased potassium uptake in turn increases intracellular potassium ion concentration, causing potassium to diffuse across the luminal membrane into the tubule.
2. Increased extracellular potassium concentration increases the potassium gradient from the renal interstitial fluid to the interior of the epithelial cell, which reduces backleakage of potassium ions from inside the cells through the basolateral membrane.
3. Increased potassium intake stimulates synthesis of potassium channels and their translocation from the cytosol to the luminal membrane, which, in turn, increases the ease of potassium diffusion through the membrane.
4. Increased potassium concentration stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, which further stimulates potassium secretion, as discussed next.

Aldosterone Stimulates Potassium Secretion. Aldosterone stimulates active reabsorption of sodium ions by the principal cells of the late distal tubules and collecting ducts (see Chapter 28). This effect is mediated through a $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump that transports sodium outward through the basolateral membrane of the cell and into the renal interstitial fluid at the same time that it pumps potassium into the cell. Thus, aldosterone also has a powerful effect on controlling the rate at which the principal cells secrete potassium and reabsorb sodium.

A second effect of aldosterone is to increase the number of potassium channels in the luminal membrane and therefore its permeability for potassium, further adding to the effectiveness of aldosterone in stimulating potassium secretion. Therefore, aldosterone has a powerful effect to increase potassium excretion, as shown in Figure 30-4.

Increased Extracellular Potassium Ion Concentration Stimulates Aldosterone Secretion. In negative feedback control systems, the factor that is controlled usually has a feedback effect on the controller. In the case of the aldosterone-potassium control system, the rate of aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland is controlled strongly by extracellular fluid potassium ion concentration. Figure 30-5 shows that an increase in plasma potassium concentration of about $3 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ can increase the plasma aldosterone concentration from nearly 0 to as high as 60 $\mathrm{ng} / 100 \mathrm{ml}$, a concentration almost 10 times normal.

The effect of potassium ion concentration to stimulate aldosterone secretion is part of a powerful feedback system for regulating potassium excretion, as shown
![gu707762836d](gu707762836d.jpg)

Figure 30-5. Effect of extracellular fluid potassium ion concentration on plasma aldosterone concentration. Note that small changes in potassium concentration cause large changes in aldosterone concentration.
![gu717762836d](gu717762836d.jpg)

Figure 30-6. Basic feedback mechanism for control of extracellular fluid potassium concentration by aldosterone (Ald).
in Figure 30-6. In this feedback system, an increase in plasma potassium concentration stimulates aldosterone secretion and, therefore, increases plasma aldosterone concentration (block 1). The increase in plasma aldosterone then causes a marked increase in potassium excretion by the kidneys (block 2). The increased potassium excretion then reduces the extracellular fluid potassium concentration back toward normal (circle 3 and block 4). Thus, this feedback mechanism acts synergistically, with the direct effect of increased extracellular potassium concentration to elevate potassium excretion when potassium intake is raised (Figure 30-7).

Blockade of Aldosterone Feedback System Greatly Impairs Potassium Regulation. In the absence of aldosterone secretion, as occurs in patients with Addison disease, renal secretion of potassium is impaired, thus causing the extracellular fluid potassium concentration to rise to dangerously high levels. Conversely, with excess aldosterone secretion (primary aldosteronism), potassium secretion becomes greatly increased, causing potassium loss by the kidneys, thus leading to hypokalemia.

![gu727762836d](gu727762836d.jpg)

Figure 30-7. Primary mechanisms whereby high potassium intake raises potassium excretion. Note that increased plasma potassium concentration directly raises potassium secretion by the cortical collecting tubules and indirectly increases potassium secretion by raising plasma aldosterone concentration.
![gu737762836d](gu737762836d.jpg)

Figure 30-8. Effect of large changes in potassium intake on plasma potassium concentration under normal conditions (red line) and after the aldosterone feedback was blocked (blue line). Note that after blockade of the aldosterone system, regulation of potassium concentration was greatly impaired. (Courtesy Dr. David B. Young.)

In addition to its stimulatory effect on renal secretion of potassium, aldosterone also increases cellular uptake of potassium. This contributes to the powerful aldosteronepotassium feedback system, as discussed previously.

The special quantitative importance of the aldosterone feedback system in controlling potassium concentration is shown in Figure 30-8. In this experiment, potassium intake was increased almost sevenfold in dogs under two conditions: (1) under normal conditions; and (2) after the aldosterone feedback system had been blocked by removing the adrenal glands and placing the animals on a fixed rate of aldosterone infusion, so that plasma aldosterone concentration was maintained at a normal level but could neither increase nor decrease as potassium intake was altered.
![gu747762836d](gu747762836d.jpg)

Figure 30-9. Relationship between flow rate in the cortical collecting tubules and potassium secretion and the effect of changes in potassium intake. Note that a high dietary potassium intake greatly enhances the effect of increased tubular flow rate to increase potassium secretion. The shaded bar shows the approximate normal tubular flow rate under most physiological conditions. (Data from Malnic G, Berliner RW, Giebisch G: Flow dependence of $K^{+}$secretion in cortical distal tubes of the rat. Am J Physiol 256:F932, 1989.)

Note that in the normal animals, a sevenfold increase in potassium intake caused only a slight increase in plasma potassium concentration, from 4.2 to $4.3 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. Thus, when the aldosterone feedback system is functioning normally, potassium concentration is precisely controlled, despite large changes in potassium intake.

When the aldosterone feedback system was blocked, the same increases in potassium intake caused a much larger increase in plasma potassium concentration, from 3.8 to almost $4.7 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. Thus, control of potassium concentration is greatly impaired when the aldosterone feedback system is blocked. A similar impairment of potassium regulation is observed in people with poorly functioning aldosterone feedback systems, such as occurs in patients with primary aldosteronism (too much aldosterone) or Addison disease (too little aldosterone).

Increased Distal Tubular Flow Rate Stimulates Potassium Secretion. A rise in distal tubular flow rate, as occurs with volume expansion, high sodium intake, or treatment with some diuretics, stimulates potassium secretion (Figure 30-9). Conversely, a decrease in distal tubular flow rate, as caused by sodium depletion, reduces potassium secretion.

The effect of the tubular flow rate on potassium secretion in the distal and collecting tubules is strongly influenced by potassium intake. When potassium intake is high, increased tubular flow rate has a much greater effect to stimulate potassium secretion than when potassium intake is low (see Figure 30-9).

There are two main effects of a high-volume flow rate that increase potassium secretion:

1. When potassium is secreted into the tubular fluid, the luminal concentration of potassium increases,

![gu757762836d](gu757762836d.jpg)

Figure 30-10. Effect of high sodium intake on renal excretion of potassium. Note that a high-sodium diet decreases plasma aldosterone, which tends to decrease potassium secretion by the cortical collecting tubules. However, the high-sodium diet simultaneously increases fluid delivery to the cortical collecting duct, which tends to increase potassium secretion. The opposing effects of a high-sodium diet counterbalance each other, so there is little change in potassium excretion. GFR, Glomerular filtration rate.
thereby reducing the driving force for potassium diffusion across the luminal membrane. With increased tubular flow rate, the secreted potassium is continuously flushed down the tubule, minimizing the rise in tubular potassium concentration and increasing net potassium secretion.
2. A high tubular flow rate also increases the number of high-conductance BK channels in the luminal membrane. Although the BK channels are normally quiescent, they become active in response to increases in flow rate, thereby greatly increasing potassium conductance across the luminal membrane.
The effect of increased tubular flow rate is especially important in helping preserve normal potassium excretion during changes in sodium intake. For example, with a high sodium intake, there is decreased aldosterone secretion, which by itself would tend to decrease the rate of potassium secretion and, therefore, reduce urinary excretion of potassium. However, the high distal tubular flow rate that occurs with a high sodium intake tends to increase potassium secretion (Figure 30-10). Therefore, the two effects of a high sodium intake-decreased aldosterone secretion and high tubular flow ratecounterbalance each other, so there is little change in potassium excretion. Likewise, with a low sodium intake, there is little change in potassium excretion because of the counterbalancing effects of increased aldosterone secretion and decreased tubular flow rate on potassium secretion.

Acute Acidosis Decreases Potassium Secretion. Acute increases in extracellular fluid hydrogen ion concentration (acidosis) reduce potassium secretion, whereas decreased hydrogen ion concentration (alkalosis) increases potassium secretion. The primary mechanism whereby increased hydrogen ion concentration inhibits potassium secretion is by reducing activity of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump. This reduction in turn decreases intracellular potassium concentration and subsequent passive diffusion of potassium across the luminal membrane into the tubule. Acidosis may also reduce the number of potassium channels in the luminal membrane.

With more prolonged acidosis, lasting over a period of several days, there is an increase in urinary potassium excretion. The mechanism for this effect is due in part to an effect of chronic acidosis to inhibit proximal tubular sodium chloride and water reabsorption, which increases distal volume delivery, thereby stimulating potassium secretion. This effect overrides the inhibitory effect of hydrogen ions on the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump. Thus, chronic acidosis leads to a loss of potassium, whereas acute acidosis leads to decreased potassium excretion.

## Beneficial Effects of Diet High in Potassium and Low in Sodium Content

For most of human history, the typical diet has been one that is low in sodium and high in potassium content, compared with the typical modern diet. In isolated populations that have not experienced industrialization, such as the Yanomamo tribe living in the Amazon region of Northern Brazil, sodium intake may be as low as 10 to $20 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day, and potassium intake may be as high as $200 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day. This intake is due to their consumption of a diet containing large amounts of fruits and vegetables and no processed foods. Populations consuming this type of diet typically do not experience age-related increases in blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases.

With industrialization and increased consumption of processed foods, which often have high sodium and low potassium content, there have been dramatic increases in sodium intake and decreases in potassium intake. In most industrialized countries, potassium consumption averages only 30 to $70 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day, and sodium intake averages 140 to $180 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day.

Experimental and clinical studies have shown that the combination of a high-sodium and low-potassium diet increases the risk for hypertension and associated cardiovascular and kidney diseases. A diet rich in potassium, however, seems to protect against the adverse effects of a high-sodium diet, reducing blood pressure and the risk for stroke, coronary artery disease, and kidney disease. The beneficial effects of increasing potassium intake are especially apparent when combined with a low-sodium diet.

Dietary guidelines published by various organizations have recommended reducing the dietary intake of sodium chloride to about 65 to $100 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day (corresponding to $1.5-2.3 \mathrm{~g} /$ day of sodium or $3.8-5.8 \mathrm{~g} /$ day sodium chloride) while increasing potassium intake to $120 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day ( $4.7 \mathrm{~g} /$ day) for healthy adults.

## REGULATION OF RENAL CALCIUM EXCRETION AND EXTRACELLULAR CALCIUM ION CONCENTRATION

The mechanisms for regulating calcium ion concentration are discussed in detail in Chapter 80, along with the endocrinology of the calcium-regulating hormones, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcitonin. Therefore, calcium ion regulation is discussed only briefly in this chapter.

The extracellular fluid calcium ion concentration normally remains tightly controlled within a few percentage points of its normal level, $2.4 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. When the calcium ion concentration falls to low levels (hypocalcemia), the excitability of nerve and muscle cells increases markedly and can, in extreme cases, result in hypocalcemic tetany. This condition is characterized by spastic skeletal muscle contractions. Hypercalcemia (increased calcium concentration) depresses neuromuscular excitability and can lead to cardiac arrhythmias.

About 50\% of the total calcium in the plasma ( $5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) exists in the ionized form, which is the form that has biological activity at cell membranes. The remainder is bound to plasma proteins ( $\approx 40 \%$ ) or complexed in the nonionized form with anions such as phosphate and citrate ( $\approx 10 \%$ ).

Changes in plasma hydrogen ion concentration influence calcium binding to plasma proteins. With acidosis, less calcium is bound to the plasma proteins. Conversely, with alkalosis, a greater amount of calcium is bound to the plasma proteins. Therefore, patients with alkalosis are more susceptible to hypocalcemic tetany.

As with other substances in the body, calcium intake must be balanced with the net loss of calcium over the long term. Unlike ions such as sodium and chloride, however, much of the calcium excretion occurs in the feces. The usual rate of dietary calcium intake is about $1000 \mathrm{mg} /$ day, with about $900 \mathrm{mg} /$ day of calcium excreted in the feces. Under certain conditions, fecal calcium excretion can exceed calcium ingestion because calcium can also be secreted into the intestinal lumen. Therefore, the gastrointestinal tract and regulatory mechanisms that influence intestinal calcium absorption and secretion play a major role in calcium homeostasis, as discussed in Chapter 80.

Almost all the calcium in the body ( $99 \%$ ) is stored in the bone, with only about $0.1 \%$ in the extracellular fluid and $1.0 \%$ in the intracellular fluid and cell organelles. The bone, therefore, acts as a large reservoir for calcium and as a source of calcium when extracellular fluid calcium concentration tends to decrease.

One of the most important regulators of bone uptake and release of calcium is PTH. When extracellular fluid calcium concentration falls below normal, activity of calcium-sensing receptors (CSRs) on the cell membrane of the parathyroid glands is reduced, promoting increased secretion of PTH. This hormone then acts directly on the bones to increase resorption of bone salts (release of salts from the bones) and release large amounts of calcium into the extracellular fluid, thereby returning calcium

levels back toward normal. When the calcium ion concentration is elevated, CSR activity of the parathyroid cells is stimulated, causing a reduction in PTH secretion, so almost no bone resorption occurs; instead, excess calcium is deposited in the bones. Thus, the daily regulation of calcium ion concentration is mediated in large part by the effects of PTH on bone resorption.

The bones, however, do not have an inexhaustible supply of calcium. Therefore, over the long term, intake of calcium must be balanced with calcium excretion by the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. The most important regulator of calcium reabsorption at both these sites is PTH, which regulates the plasma calcium concentration through three main effects: (1) by stimulating bone resorption; (2) by stimulating activation of vitamin D, which then increases intestinal reabsorption of calcium; and (3) by increasing renal tubular calcium reabsorption (Figure 3011). The control of gastrointestinal calcium reabsorption and calcium exchange in the bones is discussed elsewhere; the remainder of this section focuses on the mechanisms that control renal calcium excretion.

## CONTROL OF CALCIUM EXCRETION BY THE KIDNEYS

Calcium is filtered and reabsorbed in the kidneys but is not secreted. Therefore, the rate of renal calcium excretion is calculated as follows:

Renal calcium excretion $=$ Calcium filtered

- Calcium reabsorbed

Only about $60 \%$ of the plasma calcium is ionized, with $40 \%$ being bound to the plasma proteins and $10 \%$ complexed with anions such as phosphate. Therefore, only about $60 \%$ of the plasma calcium is filtered at the glomerulus. Normally, about $99 \%$ of the filtered calcium is reabsorbed by the tubules, with only about $1 \%$ of the filtered calcium being excreted. About $65 \%$ of the filtered calcium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, $25 \%$ to $30 \%$ is reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, and $4 \%$ to $9 \%$ is reabsorbed in the distal and collecting tubules. This pattern of reabsorption is similar to that for sodium.

![gu777762836d](gu777762836d.jpg)

Figure 30-12. Mechanisms of calcium reabsorption by paracellular and transcellular pathways in the proximal tubular cells.

As is true with the other ions, calcium excretion is adjusted to meet the body's needs. With an increase in calcium intake, there is also increased renal calcium excretion, although much of the increase of calcium intake is eliminated in the feces. With calcium depletion, calcium excretion by the kidneys decreases as a result of enhanced tubular reabsorption.

Proximal Tubular Calcium Reabsorption. Most of the calcium reabsorption in the proximal tubule occurs through the paracellular pathway; it is dissolved in water and carried with the reabsorbed fluid as it flows between the cells. Only about $20 \%$ of proximal tubular calcium reabsorption occurs through the transcellular pathway in two steps;

1. Calcium diffuses from the tubular lumen into the cell down an electrochemical gradient due to the much higher concentration of calcium in the tubular lumen, compared with the epithelial cell cytoplasm, and because the cell interior has a negative charge relative to the tubular lumen.
2. Calcium exits the cell across the basolateral membrane by a calcium-ATPase pump and by the sodiumcalcium counter-transporter (Figure 30-12).

Loop of Henle and Distal Tubule Calcium Reabsorption. In the loop of Henle, calcium reabsorption is restricted to the thick ascending limb. Approximately 50\% of calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb occurs through the paracellular route by passive diffusion due to the slight positive charge of the tubular lumen relative to the interstitial fluid. The remaining $50 \%$ of calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb occurs through the transcellular pathway, a process that is stimulated by PTH.

In the distal tubule, calcium reabsorption occurs almost entirely by active transport through the cell
membrane. The mechanism for this active transport is similar to that in the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb. It involves diffusion across the luminal membrane through calcium channels and exit across the basolateral membrane by a calcium-ATPase pump, as well as a sodium-calcium counter-transport mechanism. In this segment, as well as in the loops of Henle, PTH stimulates calcium reabsorption. Vitamin D (calcitriol) and calcitonin also stimulate calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and in the distal tubule, although these hormones are not as important quantitatively as PTH in reducing renal calcium excretion.

Regulation of Tubular Calcium Reabsorption. One of the primary controllers of renal tubular calcium reabsorption is PTH. Increased levels of PTH stimulate calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending loops of Henle and distal tubules, which reduces urinary excretion of calcium. Conversely, reduction of PTH promotes calcium excretion by decreasing reabsorption in the loops of Henle and distal tubules.

Increased extracellular fluid calcium ion concentration also directly stimulates CSRs, which inhibit calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending loops of Henle. Conversely, reductions in calcium concentration decrease CSR activity and increase calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle.

In the proximal tubule, calcium reabsorption usually parallels sodium and water reabsorption and is independent of PTH. Therefore, in cases of extracellular volume expansion or increased arterial pressure-both of which decrease proximal sodium and water reabsorption-there is also reduction in calcium reabsorption and, consequently, increased urinary calcium excretion. Conversely, with reduced extracellular volume or decreased blood pressure, calcium excretion decreases primarily because of increased proximal tubular reabsorption.

Another factor that influences calcium reabsorption is the plasma concentration of phosphate. Increased plasma phosphate stimulates PTH, which increases calcium reabsorption by the renal tubules, thereby reducing calcium excretion. The opposite occurs with a reduction in plasma phosphate concentration.

Calcium reabsorption is also stimulated by metabolic alkalosis and inhibited by metabolic acidosis. Thus, acidosis tends to increase calcium excretion, whereas alkalosis tends to reduce calcium excretion. Most of the effect of hydrogen ion concentration on calcium excretion results from changes in calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule.

A summary of the factors known to influence calcium excretion is shown in Table 30-2.

## REGULATION OF RENAL PHOSPHATE EXCRETION

Phosphate excretion by the kidneys is controlled primarily by an overflow mechanism that can be explained as follows. The

Table 30-2 Factors That Alter Renal Calcium Excretion

| :-- | :-- |
| $\uparrow$ Parathyroid hormone | $\downarrow$ Parathyroid hormone |

renal tubules have a normal transport maximum for reabsorbing phosphate of about $0.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{min}$. When less than this amount of phosphate is present in the glomerular filtrate, essentially all the filtered phosphate is reabsorbed. When more than this amount is present, the excess is excreted. Therefore, phosphate normally begins to spill into the urine when its concentration in the extracellular fluid rises above a threshold of about $0.8 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{L}$, which gives a tubular load of phosphate of about $0.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{min}$, assuming a GFR of $125 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. Because most people ingest large quantities of phosphate in milk products and meat, the concentration of phosphate is usually maintained above $1 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{L}$; at this level, there is continual excretion of phosphate into the urine.

The proximal tubule normally reabsorbs $75 \%$ to $80 \%$ of the filtered phosphate. The distal tubule reabsorbs about $10 \%$ of the filtered load, and only small amounts are reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, collecting tubules, and collecting ducts. Approximately $10 \%$ of the filtered phosphate is excreted in the urine.

In the proximal tubule, phosphate reabsorption occurs mainly through the transcellular pathway. Phosphate enters the cell from the lumen by a sodium-phosphate cotransporter and exits the cell across the basolateral membrane by a process that is not well understood but may involve a counter-transport mechanism in which phosphate is exchanged for an anion.

Changes in tubular phosphate reabsorptive capability can also occur in different conditions and influence phosphate excretion. For example, a diet low in phosphate can, over time, increase the reabsorptive transport maximum for phosphate, thereby reducing the tendency for phosphate to spill over into the urine.

PTH can play a significant role in regulating phosphate concentration through two effects: (1) PTH promotes bone resorption, thereby releasing large amounts of phosphate into the extracellular fluid from the bone salts; and (2) PTH decreases the abundance of sodium-phosphate co-transporters in the apical membrane, which in turn reduces phosphate reabsorption by the renal tubules. Thus, whenever plasma PTH is increased, tubular phosphate reabsorption is decreased, and more phosphate is excreted. These interrelationships among phosphate, PTH, and calcium are discussed in more detail in Chapter 80.

Table 30-3 summarizes some of the factors that influence renal phosphate excretion.

## REGULATION OF RENAL MAGNESIUM EXCRETION AND EXTRACELLULAR MAGNESIUM ION CONCENTRATION

More than half of the body's magnesium is stored in the bones. Most of the rest is within the cells, with less than $1 \%$ located in the extracellular fluid. Although the total plasma magnesium concentration is about $1.8 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, more than half of this is bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the free ionized concentration of magnesium is only about $0.8 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$.

The normal daily intake of magnesium is about 250 to $300 \mathrm{mg} /$ day, but only about half of this intake is absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. To maintain magnesium balance, the kidneys must excrete this absorbed magnesium, about half the daily intake of magnesium, or 125 to 150 $\mathrm{mg} /$ day. The kidneys normally excrete about $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of the magnesium in the glomerular filtrate.

Renal excretion of magnesium can increase markedly during magnesium excess or decrease to almost zero during magnesium depletion. Because magnesium is involved in many biochemical processes in the body, including activation of many enzymes, its concentration must be closely regulated.

Regulation of magnesium excretion is achieved mainly by changing tubular reabsorption. The proximal tubule usually reabsorbs only about $25 \%$ of the filtered magnesium. The primary site of reabsorption is the loop of Henle, where about $65 \%$ of the filtered load of magnesium is reabsorbed. Only a small amount (usually <5\%) of filtered magnesium is reabsorbed in the distal and collecting tubules.

The mechanisms that regulate magnesium reabsorption are not well understood, but Table 30-4 summarizes some of the factors that influence renal magnesium excretion. Note that several factors that alter renal calcium excretion have similar effects on magnesium excretion.

## INTEGRATION OF RENAL MECHANISMS FOR CONTROL OF EXTRACELLULAR FLUID

Extracellular fluid volume is determined mainly by the balance between intake and output of water and salt. In

Table 30-4 Factors That Alter Renal Magnesium Excretion

| $\downarrow$ Magnesium Excretion | $\uparrow$ Magnesium Excretion |
| :--: | :--: |
| $\downarrow$ Extracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ concentration | $\uparrow$ Extracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ concentration |

| $\uparrow$ Parathyroid hormone | $\downarrow$ Parathyroid hormone |
| $\downarrow$ Extracellular fluid volume | $\uparrow$ Extracellular fluid volume |
| Metabolic alkalosis | Metabolic acidosis |

many cases, salt and fluid intakes are dictated by a person's habits rather than by physiological control mechanisms. Therefore, the burden of extracellular volume regulation is often placed on the kidneys, which must adapt their excretion of salt and water to match intake under steadystate conditions.

In discussing the regulation of extracellular fluid volume, we consider the factors that control the amount of sodium chloride in the extracellular fluid because changes in extracellular fluid sodium chloride content usually cause parallel changes in extracellular fluid volume, provided the antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-thirst mechanisms are operative. When the ADH-thirst mechanisms are functioning normally, a change in extracellular fluid sodium chloride content is usually matched by a similar change in the amount of extracellular water, and thus maintenance of osmolality and sodium concentration is relatively constant.

## SODIUM INTAKE AND EXCRETION ARE BALANCED UNDER STEADY-STATE CONDITIONS

An important consideration in overall control of sodium excretion-or excretion of most electrolytes, for that mat-ter-is that under steady-state conditions, excretion by the kidneys is determined by intake. To maintain life, a person must, over the long term, excrete almost precisely the amount of sodium ingested. Therefore, even with disturbances that cause major changes in kidney function, balance between intake and output of sodium usually is restored within a few days.

If disturbances of kidney function are not too severe, sodium balance may be achieved mainly by intrarenal adjustments, with minimal changes in the extracellular fluid volume or other systemic adjustments. However, when perturbations to the kidneys are severe, and intrarenal compensations are exhausted, systemic adjustments are often invoked, such as changes in blood pressure, circulating hormones, and sympathetic nervous system activity.

These adjustments can be costly in terms of overall homeostasis because they cause other changes throughout the body that may, in the long run, be damaging. For example, impaired kidney function may lead to increased
blood pressure that, in turn, helps maintain normal sodium excretion. Over the long term, the high blood pressure may injure the blood vessels, heart, and other organs. These compensations, however, are necessary because a sustained imbalance between fluid and electrolyte intake and excretion would quickly lead to accumulation or loss of electrolytes and fluid, causing severe cardiovascular consequences within a few days. Thus, one can view the systemic adjustments that occur in response to abnormalities of kidney function as a necessary tradeoff that brings electrolyte and fluid excretion back into balance with intake.

## SODIUM EXCRETION IS CONTROLLED BY ALTERING GLOMERULAR FILTRATION OR TUBULAR SODIUM REABSORPTION RATES

The two variables that influence sodium and water excretion are the rates of glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption:

## Excretion $=$ Glomerular filtration - Tubular reabsorption

The GFR normally is about $180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, tubular reabsorption is $178.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, and urine excretion is $1.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. Thus, small changes in GFR or tubular reabsorption potentially can cause large changes in renal excretion. For example, a $5 \%$ increase in GFR (to $189 \mathrm{~L} /$ day) would cause a $9-\mathrm{L} /$ day increase in urine volume if tubular compensations did not occur; this increase would quickly cause catastrophic changes in body fluid volumes. Similarly, small changes in tubular reabsorption, in the absence of compensatory adjustments of GFR, would also lead to dramatic changes in urine volume and sodium excretion. Tubular reabsorption and the GFR usually are regulated precisely in parallel, so that excretion by the kidneys can be exactly matched to the intake of water and electrolytes.

Even with disturbances that alter GFR or tubular reabsorption, changes in urinary excretion are minimized by various buffering mechanisms. For example, if the kidneys become greatly vasodilated, and GFR increases (as can occur with certain drugs or high fever), this condition raises sodium chloride delivery to the tubules, which in turn leads to at least two intrarenal compensations: (1) increased tubular reabsorption of much of the extra sodium chloride filtered, called glomerulotubular balance; and (2) macula densa feedback, in which increased sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule causes afferent arteriolar constriction and return of GFR toward normal. Likewise, abnormalities of tubular reabsorption in the proximal tubule or loop of Henle are partially compensated for by these same intrarenal feedbacks, as discussed in Chapter 27.

Because neither of these two mechanisms operates perfectly to restore distal sodium chloride delivery all the way back to normal, changes in GFR or tubular reabsorption can lead to significant changes in urine sodium and

water excretion. When this occurs, other feedback mechanisms may come into play, such as changes in blood pressure and various hormones; these mechanisms eventually return sodium excretion to equal sodium intake. In the next few sections, we review how these mechanisms operate together to control sodium and water balance and, in so doing, also act to control extracellular fluid volume. All these feedback mechanisms control renal excretion of sodium and water by altering GFR or tubular reabsorption.

## IMPORTANCE OF PRESSURE NATRIURESIS AND PRESSURE DIURESIS IN MAINTAINING BODY SODIUM AND FLUID BALANCE

One of the most basic and powerful mechanisms for maintaining sodium and fluid balance, as well as for controlling blood volume and extracellular fluid volume, is the effect of blood pressure on sodium and water excretion-the pressure natriuresis and pressure diuresis mechanisms, respectively. As discussed in Chapter 19, this feedback also plays a dominant role in long-term blood pressure regulation.

Figure 30-13 shows the effect of arterial pressure on urinary sodium output. Note that acute increases in blood pressure of 30 to 50 mm Hg cause a twofold to threefold increase in urinary sodium output. This effect is independent of changes in activity of the sympathetic nervous system or of various hormones, such as angiotensin II (Ang II), ADH, or aldosterone, because pressure natriuresis can be demonstrated in an isolated kidney that has been removed from the influence of these factors. With chronic increases in blood pressure, the effectiveness of pressure natriuresis is greatly enhanced because the increased blood pressure also, after a short time delay, suppresses renin release and, therefore, decreases the formation of Ang II and aldosterone. As discussed previously, decreased levels of Ang II and aldosterone inhibit renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, thereby amplifying the direct effects of increased blood pressure to increase sodium and water excretion.

## PRESSURE NATRIURESIS AND DIURESIS: KEY COMPONENTS OF A RENAL-BODY FLUID FEEDBACK FOR REGULATING BODY FLUID VOLUMES AND ARTERIAL PRESSURE

The effect of increased blood pressure to raise urine output is part of a powerful feedback system that operates to maintain balance between fluid intake and output, as shown in Figure 30-14. This mechanism is the same mechanism discussed in Chapter 19 for arterial pressure control. The extracellular fluid volume, blood volume, cardiac output, arterial pressure, and urine output are all controlled at the same time as separate parts of this basic feedback mechanism.

During changes in sodium and fluid intake, this feedback mechanism helps maintain fluid balance and minimizes changes in blood volume, extracellular fluid volume, and arterial pressure as follows:

1. An increase in fluid intake (assuming that sodium accompanies the fluid intake) above the level of urine output causes a temporary accumulation of fluid in the body.
2. As long as fluid intake exceeds urine output, fluid accumulates in the blood and interstitial spaces, causing parallel increases in blood volume and extracellular fluid volume. As discussed later, the actual increases in these variables are usually small because of the effectiveness of this feedback.
3. An increase in blood volume raises mean circulatory filling pressure.
4. An increase in mean circulatory filling pressure raises the pressure gradient for venous return.
5. An increased pressure gradient for venous return elevates cardiac output.
6. An increased cardiac output raises arterial pressure.
7. An increased arterial pressure increases urine output by way of pressure diuresis. The steepness of the normal pressure natriuresis relationship indicates that only a slight increase in blood pressure is required to raise urinary excretion severalfold.
8. The increased fluid excretion balances the increased intake, and further accumulation of fluid is prevented.
Thus, the renal-body fluid feedback mechanism operates to prevent continuous accumulation of salt and water in the body during increased salt and water intake. As long as the kidneys and various nervous and hormonal mechanisms are operating effectively, large changes in salt and water intake can be accommodated with minimal changes in blood volume, extracellular fluid volume, cardiac output, and arterial pressure.

Figure 30-15. Approximate effect of changes in daily fluid intake on blood volume. Note that blood volume remains relatively constant in the normal range of daily fluid intakes.

The opposite sequence of events occurs when fluid intake falls below normal. In this case, there is a tendency toward decreased blood volume and extracellular fluid volume, as well as reduced arterial pressure. Even a small decrease in blood pressure causes a large decrease in urine output, thereby allowing fluid balance to be maintained, with minimal changes in blood pressure, blood volume, or extracellular fluid volume. The effectiveness of this mechanism in preventing large changes in blood volume is demonstrated in Figure 30-15, which shows that changes in blood volume are almost imperceptible, despite large variations in daily intake of water and electrolytes, except when intake becomes so low that it is not sufficient to make up for fluid losses caused by evaporation or other inescapable losses.

As discussed later, there are nervous and hormonal systems, in addition to intrarenal mechanisms, that can
raise sodium excretion to match increased sodium intake, even without measurable increases in cardiac output or arterial pressure in many persons. Other individuals who are more "salt-sensitive" have significant increases in arterial pressure with even moderate increases in sodium intake. With prolonged high-sodium intake, lasting over several years, high blood pressure may occur, even in persons who are not initially salt-sensitive. When blood pressure does rise, pressure natriuresis provides a critical means of maintaining balance between sodium intake and urinary sodium excretion.

## EFFECTIVENESS OF BLOOD VOLUME AND EXTRACELLULAR FLUID VOLUME REGULATION

By studying Figure 30-14, one can see the main reasons that blood volume remains almost exactly constant, despite extreme changes in daily fluid intake: (1) a slight change in blood volume causes a marked change in cardiac output; (2) a slight change in cardiac output causes a large change in blood pressure; and (3) a slight change in blood pressure causes a large change in urine output. These factors work together to provide effective feedback control of blood volume.

The same control mechanisms operate whenever there is blood loss because of hemorrhage. In this case, a fall in blood pressure along with nervous and hormonal factors (discussed later) cause fluid retention by the kidneys. Other parallel processes occur to reconstitute the red blood cells and plasma proteins in the blood. If abnormalities of red blood cell volume remain, such as when there is deficiency of erythropoietin or other factors needed to stimulate red blood cell production, the plasma volume

When this condition occurs, the additional extracellular fluid volume resides in the interstitial spaces, and edema results.
will usually make up the difference, and the overall blood volume will return essentially to normal, despite the low red blood cell mass.

## DISTRIBUTION OF EXTRACELLULAR FLUID BETWEEN INTERSTITIAL SPACES AND VASCULAR SYSTEM

From Figure 30-14 it is apparent that blood volume and extracellular fluid volume are usually controlled in parallel with each other. Ingested fluid initially goes into the blood, but it rapidly becomes distributed between the interstitial spaces and the plasma. Therefore, blood volume and extracellular fluid volume usually are controlled simultaneously.

There are circumstances, however, in which the distribution of extracellular fluid between the interstitial spaces and blood can vary greatly. As discussed in Chapter 25, the principal factors that can cause accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces include the following: (1) increased capillary hydrostatic pressure; (2) decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure; (3) increased permeability of the capillaries; and (4) obstruction of lymphatic vessels. In all these conditions, an unusually high proportion of the extracellular fluid becomes distributed to the interstitial spaces.

Figure 30-16 shows the normal distribution of fluid between the interstitial spaces and vascular system and the distribution that occurs in edema states. When small amounts of fluid accumulate in the blood as a result of too much fluid intake or a decrease in renal output of fluid, about $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ of it stays in the blood and increases the blood volume. The remainder is distributed to the interstitial spaces. When the extracellular fluid volume rises more than $30 \%$ to $50 \%$ above normal, almost all the additional fluid goes into the interstitial spaces, and little remains in the blood. Once the interstitial fluid pressure rises from its normally negative value to become positive,
the tissue interstitial spaces become compliant, and large amounts of fluid then pour into the tissues without the interstitial fluid pressure rising much more. In other words, the safety factor against edema, owing to a rising interstitial fluid pressure that counteracts fluid accumulation in the tissues, is lost once the tissues become highly compliant.

Thus, under normal conditions, the interstitial spaces act as an overflow reservoir for excess fluid, sometimes increasing in volume 10 to 30 liters. This situation causes edema, as explained in Chapter 25, but it also acts as an important overflow release valve for the circulation, protecting the cardiovascular system against a dangerous overload that could lead to pulmonary edema and cardiac failure.

To summarize, extracellular fluid volume and blood volume are often controlled simultaneously, but the quantitative amounts of fluid distribution between the interstitium and the blood depend on the physical properties of the circulation and the interstitial spaces, as well as on the dynamics of fluid exchange through the capillary membranes.

## NERVOUS AND HORMONAL FACTORS INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS OF RENALBODY FLUID FEEDBACK CONTROL

In Chapters 27 and 28, we discuss the nervous and hormonal factors that influence GFR and tubular reabsorption and, therefore, renal excretion of salt and water. These nervous and hormonal mechanisms usually act together with the pressure natriuresis and pressure diuresis mechanisms, making them more effective in minimizing the changes in blood volume, extracellular fluid volume, and arterial pressure that occur in response to daily challenges. In many cases, nervous and hormonal mechanisms can regulate renal sodium and water excretion and maintain balance between intake and output without significant changes in blood pressure. However, abnormalities of kidney function or of the various nervous and hormonal factors that influence the kidneys can lead to serious changes in blood pressure and body fluid volumes, as discussed later.

## SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM CONTROL OF RENAL EXCRETION: ARTERIAL BARORECEPTOR AND LOWPRESSURE STRETCH RECEPTOR REFLEXES

Because the kidneys receive extensive sympathetic innervation, changes in sympathetic activity can alter renal sodium and water excretion, as well as regulation of extracellular fluid volume under some conditions. For example, when blood volume is reduced by hemorrhage, pressures in the pulmonary blood vessels and other low-pressure regions of the thorax decrease, causing reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This, in turn, increases

renal sympathetic nerve activity, which has several effects to decrease sodium and water excretion: (1) constriction of the renal arterioles, which decreases GFR if the sympathetic activation is severe; (2) increased tubular reabsorption of salt and water; and (3) stimulation of renin release and increased Ang II and aldosterone formation, both of which further increase tubular reabsorption. If the reduction in blood volume is great enough to lower systemic arterial pressure, further activation of the sympathetic nervous system occurs because of decreased stretch of the arterial baroreceptors located in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. All these reflexes together play an important role in the rapid restitution of blood volume that occurs in acute conditions such as hemorrhage. Also, reflex inhibition of renal sympathetic activity may contribute to the rapid elimination of excess fluid in the circulation that occurs after eating a meal that contains large amounts of salt and water.

Excessive and inappropriate activation of the sympathetic nervous system, however, can lead to a cascade of effects, including increases in renin secretion, Ang II formation, and renal sodium reabsorption that elevate blood pressure. In fact, ablation of the renal sympathetic nerves often lowers arterial pressure in hypertension, especially when associated with obesity.

## ROLE OF ANGIOTENSIN II IN CONTROLLING RENAL EXCRETION

One of the body's most powerful controllers of sodium excretion is Ang II. Changes in sodium intake are associated with reciprocal changes in Ang II formation, and this in turn contributes greatly to the maintenance of body sodium balances. When sodium intake is elevated above normal, renin secretion and Ang II formation decrease. Because Ang II has several important effects to increase tubular reabsorption of sodium, as explained in Chapter 28, a reduced level of Ang II decreases tubular reabsorption of sodium and water, thus increasing renal excretion of sodium and water. The net result is to minimize the rise in extracellular fluid volume and arterial pressure that would otherwise occur when sodium intake increases.

Conversely, when sodium intake decreases below normal, increased levels of Ang II cause sodium and water retention and oppose reductions in arterial blood pressure that would otherwise occur. Thus, changes in activity of the renin-angiotensin system act as a powerful regulator of sodium excretion and as an amplifier of the pressure natriuresis mechanism for maintaining stable blood pressures and body fluid volumes.

## Importance of Changes in Angiotensin II in Regulating Sodium Balance and Altering Pressure

Natriuresis. The importance of Ang II in regulating sodium balance and making the pressure natriuresis mechanism more effective is shown in Figure 19-13
![gu827762836d](gu827762836d.jpg)

Figure 30-17. Effects of excessive angiotensin II (Ang II) formation or blocking Ang II formation on the renal-pressure natriuresis curve. Note that high levels of Ang II formation decrease the slope of pressure natriuresis, making blood pressure very sensitive to changes in sodium intake. Blockade of Ang II formation shifts pressure natriuresis to lower blood pressures.
and Figure 30-17. Note that when the angiotensin control of natriuresis is fully functional, the pressure natriuresis curve is steep (normal curve), indicating that increases in sodium excretion can be achieved when the sodium intake is raised with minimal changes in arterial pressure.

In contrast, when Ang II levels cannot be suppressed in response to increased sodium intake (high angiotensin II curve), as occurs in some hypertensive patients who have an impaired ability to decrease renin secretion and Ang II formation, the pressure natriuresis curve is not nearly as steep. Therefore, when sodium intake is raised, much greater increases in arterial pressure are necessary to increase sodium excretion and maintain sodium balance. For example, in most people, a 10 -fold increase in sodium intake causes an increase of only a few mm of Hg in arterial pressure, whereas in subjects who cannot suppress Ang II formation appropriately in response to excess sodium, the same rise in sodium intake causes blood pressure to rise by as much as 50 mm Hg . Thus, the inability to suppress Ang II formation when there is excess sodium reduces the slope of pressure natriuresis and makes arterial pressure very salt-sensitive, as discussed in Chapter 19.

The use of drugs to block the effects of Ang II has proved to be important clinically for improving the kidneys' ability to excrete salt and water. When Ang II formation is blocked with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (see Figures 19-13 and 3017) or an Ang II receptor antagonist, the renal-pressure natriuresis curve is shifted to lower pressures, which indicates an enhanced ability of the kidneys to excrete sodium because normal levels of sodium excretion can now be maintained at reduced arterial pressures. This shift of pressure natriuresis provides the basis for the chronic blood pressure-lowering effects of the ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists in hypertensive patients.

Excessive Angiotensin II Does Not Usually Cause Large Increases in Extracellular Fluid Volume Because Increased Arterial Pressure Counterbalances Angiotensin II-Mediated Sodium Retention. Although Ang II is one of the most powerful sodium- and water-retaining hormones in the body, neither a decrease nor increase in circulating Ang II has a large effect on extracellular fluid volume or blood volume as long as heart failure or kidney failure does not occur. The reason for this phenomenon is that with large increases in Ang II levels, as occurs with a renin-secreting tumor of the kidney, the high Ang II levels initially cause sodium and water retention by the kidneys and a small increase in extracellular fluid volume. This also initiates a rise in arterial pressure that quickly increases kidney output of sodium and water, thereby overcoming the sodium- and water-retaining effects of the Ang II and re-establishing a balance between the intake and output of sodium at a higher blood pressure. Conversely, after blockade of Ang II formation with an ACE inhibitor or an Ang II receptor antagonist, there is initial loss of sodium and water, but the fall in blood pressure rapidly offsets this effect, and sodium excretion is once again restored to normal.

If the heart is weakened, or there is underlying heart disease, cardiac pumping ability may not be great enough to raise arterial pressure enough to overcome the sodiumretaining effects of high levels of Ang II; in these cases, Ang II may cause large amounts of sodium and water retention that may progress to congestive heart failure. Blockade of Ang II formation may, in these cases, relieve some of the sodium and water retention and attenuate the large expansion of extracellular fluid volume associated with heart failure.

## ROLE OF ALDOSTERONE IN CONTROLLING RENAL EXCRETION

Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption, especially in the collecting tubules and collecting ducts. The increased sodium reabsorption is also associated with increased water reabsorption and potassium secretion. Therefore, the net effect of aldosterone is to make the kidneys retain sodium and water and increase potassium excretion in the urine.

The function of aldosterone in regulating sodium balance is closely related to that described for Ang II. That is, with a reduction in sodium intake, increased Ang II levels stimulate secretion of aldosterone, which in turn contributes to the reduction in urinary sodium excretion and, therefore, to maintenance of sodium balance. Conversely, with high sodium intake, suppression of aldosterone formation decreases tubular reabsorption, allowing the kidneys to excrete larger amounts of sodium. Thus, changes in aldosterone formation also aid the pressure natriuresis mechanism in maintaining sodium balance during variations in salt intake.

During Chronic Oversecretion of Aldosterone, the Kidneys Escape From Sodium Retention as Arterial Pressure Rises. Although aldosterone has powerful effects on sodium reabsorption, when there is excessive formation of aldosterone, as occurs in patients with tumors of the adrenal gland (Conn syndrome), the increased sodium reabsorption and decreased sodium excretion by the kidneys are transient. After 1 to 3 days of sodium and water retention, the extracellular fluid volume rises by about $10 \%$ to $15 \%$, and there is a simultaneous increase in arterial blood pressure. When the arterial pressure rises sufficiently, the kidneys "escape" from the sodium and water retention and thereafter excrete amounts of sodium equal to the daily intake, despite the continued presence of high levels of aldosterone. The primary reason for this escape is the pressure natriuresis and diuresis that occur when the arterial pressure rises (see Chapter 78, Figure 78-3).

In patients with adrenal insufficiency who do not secrete enough aldosterone (Addison disease), there is increased excretion of sodium and water, reduction in extracellular fluid volume, and a tendency toward low blood pressure. In the complete absence of aldosterone, the volume depletion may be severe unless the person is allowed to eat large amounts of salt and drink large amounts of water to balance the increased urine output of salt and water.

## ROLE OF ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE IN CONTROLLING RENAL WATER EXCRETION

As discussed in Chapter 29, ADH plays an important role in allowing the kidneys to form a small volume of concentrated urine while excreting normal amounts of salt. This effect is especially important during water deprivation, which strongly elevates plasma levels of ADH that, in turn, increase water reabsorption by the kidneys and help minimize the decreases in extracellular fluid volume and arterial pressure that would otherwise occur. Water deprivation for 24 to 48 hours normally causes only a small decrease in extracellular fluid volume and arterial pressure. However, if the effects of ADH are blocked with a drug that antagonizes the action of ADH to promote water reabsorption in the distal and collecting tubules, the same period of water deprivation causes a substantial fall in extracellular fluid volume and arterial pressure. Conversely, when there is excess extracellular volume, decreased ADH levels reduce the reabsorption of water by the kidneys, thus helping rid the body of the excess volume.

Excess Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion Usually Causes Only Small Increases in Extracellular Fluid Volume but Large Decreases in Sodium Concentration. Although ADH is important in regulating extracellular fluid volume, excessive levels of ADH seldom cause large increases in arterial pressure or extracellular fluid volume. Infusion of large amounts of ADH into animals initially causes renal

retention of water and a $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ increase in extracellular fluid volume. As the arterial pressure rises in response to this increased volume, much of the excess volume is excreted because of the pressure diuresis mechanism. Also, the rise in blood pressure causes pressure natriuresis and loss of sodium from the extracellular fluid. After several days of ADH infusion, the blood volume and extracellular fluid volume are elevated by no more than $5 \%$ to $10 \%$, and the arterial pressure is also elevated by less than 10 mm Hg . The same is true for patients with inappropriate ADH syndrome, in which ADH levels may be elevated severalfold.

Thus, high levels of ADH do not cause major increases of body fluid volume or arterial pressure, although high ADH levels can cause severe reductions in extracellular sodium ion concentration. The reason for this is that increased water reabsorption by the kidneys dilutes the extracellular sodium and, at the same time, the small increase in blood pressure that does occur causes loss of sodium from the extracellular fluid in the urine through pressure natriuresis.

In patients who have lost their ability to secrete ADH because of destruction of the supraoptic nuclei, the urine volume may become 5 to 10 times normal. This increase in volume is almost always compensated for by ingestion of enough water to maintain fluid balance. If free access to water is prevented, the inability to secrete ADH may lead to marked reductions in blood volume and arterial pressure.

## ROLE OF ATRIAL NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE IN CONTROLLING RENAL EXCRETION

Thus far, we have discussed mainly the role of sodiumand water-retaining hormones in controlling extracellular fluid volume. However, several different natriuretic hormones may also contribute to volume regulation. One of the most important of these is a peptide referred to as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), released by the cardiac atrial muscle fibers. A major stimulus for release of this peptide is increased stretch of the atria, which can result from excess blood volume. Once released by the cardiac atria, ANP enters the circulation and acts on the kidneys to cause small increases in GFR, decreases in renin secretion and Ang II formation, and reductions in sodium reabsorption by the collecting ducts. These combined actions of ANP lead to increased excretion of salt and water, which helps compensate for the excess blood volume.

Changes in ANP levels help minimize changes in blood volume during various disturbances, such as increased salt and water intake. However, excessive production of ANP or even complete lack of ANP does not cause major changes in blood volume because these effects can be overcome by small changes in blood pressure, acting through pressure natriuresis. For example, infusions of large amounts of ANP initially raise urine output of salt and water and cause slight decreases in blood volume. In less than 24 hours, this effect is overcome by a slight decrease in blood pressure that returns urine output toward normal, despite continued excess of ANP.

## INTEGRATED RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN SODIUM INTAKE

The integration of different control systems that regulate sodium and fluid excretion under normal conditions can be summarized by examining the homeostatic responses to progressive increases in dietary sodium intake. As noted previously, the kidneys have an amazing capability to match their excretion of salt and water to intakes, which can range from as low as one tenth of normal to as high as 10 times normal.

High Sodium Intake Suppresses Antinatriuretic Systems and Activates Natriuretic Systems. As sodium intake is increased, sodium output initially lags slightly behind intake. The time delay results in a small increase in the cumulative sodium balance, which causes a slight increase in extracellular fluid volume. It is mainly this small increase in extracellular fluid volume that triggers various mechanisms in the body to increase sodium excretion. These mechanisms include the following:

1. Activation of low-pressure receptor reflexes that originate from the stretch receptors of the right atrium and the pulmonary blood vessels. Signals from the stretch receptors go to the brain stem and there inhibit sympathetic nerve activity to the kidneys to decrease tubular sodium reabsorption. This mechanism is most important in the first few hours-or perhaps the first day-after a large increase in salt and water intake.
2. Suppression of Ang II and aldosterone formation, caused by increased arterial pressure and extracellular fluid volume expansion, decreases tubular sodium reabsorption by eliminating the normal effect of Ang II and aldosterone to increase sodium reabsorption.
3. Stimulation of natriuretic systems, especially ANP, contributes further to increased sodium excretion. Thus, the combined activation of natriuretic systems and suppression of sodium- and waterretaining systems leads to an increase in sodium excretion when sodium intake is increased. The opposite changes take place when sodium intake is reduced below normal levels.
4. Small increases in arterial pressure, caused by volume expansion, may occur with large increases in sodium intake, especially in salt-sensitive individuals; this mechanism raises sodium excretion through pressure natriuresis. As discussed previously, if the nervous, hormonal, and intrarenal mechanisms are operating effectively, measurable increases in blood pressure may not occur, even with large increases in sodium intake over several days. However, when high sodium intake is sustained for months or years, the kidneys may become damaged and less effective in excreting sodium, necessitating increased blood pressure to maintain sodium balance through the pressure natriuresis mechanism.

## CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE LARGE INCREASES IN BLOOD VOLUME AND EXTRACELLULAR FLUID VOLUME

Despite the powerful regulatory mechanisms that maintain blood volume and extracellular fluid volume reasonably constant, there are abnormal conditions that can cause large increases in both these variables. Almost all these conditions result from circulatory abnormalities.

## INCREASED BLOOD VOLUME AND EXTRACELLULAR FLUID VOLUME CAUSED BY HEART DISEASES

In persons with congestive heart failure, blood volume may increase by $15 \%$ to $20 \%$, and the extracellular fluid volume sometimes increases by $200 \%$ or more. The reason for these increases can be understood by re-examination of Figure 30-14. Initially, heart failure reduces cardiac output and, consequently, decreases arterial pressure. This effect in turn activates multiple sodium-retaining systems, especially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous systems. In addition, the low blood pressure itself causes the kidneys to retain salt and water. Therefore, the kidneys retain volume in an attempt to return the arterial pressure and cardiac output toward normal.

If the heart failure is not too severe, the rise in blood volume can often return cardiac output and arterial pressure virtually all the way to normal, and sodium excretion will eventually increase back to normal, although increased extracellular fluid volume and blood volume will remain to keep the weakened heart pumping adequately. However, if the heart is greatly weakened, arterial pressure may not be able to increase enough to restore urine output to normal. When this situation occurs, the kidneys continue to retain volume until severe circulatory congestion develops, and the person may eventually die of pulmonary edema unless corrective measures are taken.

In myocardial failure, heart valvular disease, and congenital abnormalities of the heart, increased blood volume serves as an important circulatory compensation that helps return cardiac output and blood pressure toward normal. This compensation allows even the weakened heart to maintain a life-sustaining level of cardiac output.

## INCREASED BLOOD VOLUME CAUSED BY INCREASED VASCULAR CAPACITY

Any condition that increases vascular capacity will also cause the blood volume to increase to fill this extra capacity. An increase in vascular capacity initially reduces mean circulatory filling pressure (see Figure 30-14), which leads to decreased cardiac output and decreased arterial pressure. The fall in pressure causes salt and water retention by the kidneys until blood volume increases sufficiently to fill the extra capacity.

During pregnancy, increased vascular capacity of the uterus, placenta, and other enlarged organs of the woman's body generally increases blood volume by $15 \%$ to $25 \%$. Similarly, in patients who have large varicose veins of the legs, which in rare cases may hold up to an extra liter of blood, the blood volume increases to fill the extra vascular capacity. In these cases, salt and water are retained by the kidneys until the total vascular bed is filled enough to raise blood pressure to the level required to balance renal output of fluid with daily intake of fluid.

## CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE LARGE INCREASES IN EXTRACELLULAR FLUID VOLUME WITH NORMAL OR REDUCED BLOOD VOLUME

In several conditions, extracellular fluid volume becomes markedly increased, but blood volume remains normal or even slightly reduced. These conditions are usually initiated by leakage of fluid and protein into the interstitium, which tends to decrease the blood volume. The kidneys' response to these conditions is similar to the response after hemorrhage-that is, the kidneys retain salt and water in an attempt to restore blood volume toward normal. Much of the extra fluid, however, leaks into the interstitium, causing further edema.

## NEPHROTIC SYNDROME—LOSS OF PLASMA PROTEINS IN URINE AND SODIUM RETENTION BY THE KIDNEYS

The general mechanisms that lead to extracellular edema are reviewed in Chapter 25. An important clinical cause of edema is nephrotic syndrome. In nephrotic syndrome, the glomerular capillaries leak large amounts of protein into the filtrate and urine because of increased glomerular capillary permeability. Thirty to 50 grams of plasma protein may be lost in the urine each day, sometimes causing the plasma protein concentration to fall to less than one-third normal and reducing plasma colloid osmotic pressure to low levels. This effect causes the capillaries all over the body to filter large amounts of fluid into the various tissues, which in turn causes edema and decreases the plasma volume.

Renal sodium retention in nephrotic syndrome occurs through multiple mechanisms activated by leakage of protein and fluid from the plasma into the interstitial fluid, including stimulation of various sodium-retaining systems, such as the RAAS and sympathetic nervous system. The kidneys continue to retain sodium and water until plasma volume is restored nearly to normal. However, because of the large amount of sodium and water retention, the plasma protein concentration becomes further diluted, causing still more fluid to leak into the tissues of the body. The net result is massive fluid retention by the kidneys until tremendous extracellular edema occurs, unless treatment is instituted to restore the plasma proteins.

## LIVER CIRRHOSIS—DECREASED SYNTHESIS OF PLASMA PROTEINS BY THE LIVER AND SODIUM RETENTION BY THE KIDNEYS

In liver cirrhosis, a reduction in plasma protein concentration results from destruction of liver cells, thus reducing the ability of the liver to synthesize enough plasma proteins. Cirrhosis is also associated with large amounts of fibrous tissue in the liver structure, which greatly impedes the flow of portal blood through the liver. This impedance in turn raises capillary pressure throughout the portal vascular bed, which also contributes to the leakage of fluid and proteins into the peritoneal cavity, a condition called ascites.

Once fluid and protein are lost from the circulation, the renal responses are similar to those observed in other conditions associated with decreased plasma volume. That is, the kidneys continue to retain salt and water until plasma volume and arterial pressure are restored to normal. In some cases, plasma volume may actually increase above normal because of increased vascular capacity in cirrhosis; the high pressures in the portal circulation can greatly distend veins and therefore increase vascular capacity.

# Acid-Base Regulation 

The regulation of hydrogen ion $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$balance is similar in some ways to the regulation of other ions in the body. For example, there must be a balance between the intake or production of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and the net removal of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the body to achieve homeostasis. And, as is true for other ions, the kidneys play a key role in regulating $\mathrm{H}^{+}$removal from the body. However, precise control of extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ concentration involves much more than the simple elimination of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$by the kidneys. Multiple acid-base buffering mechanisms involving the blood, cells, and lungs also are essential in maintaining normal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentrations in extracellular and intracellular fluids.

In this chapter, we consider the mechanisms that regulate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration, with special emphasis on renal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion and renal reabsorption, production, and excretion of bicarbonate ions $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$, one of the key components of acid-base control systems in the body fluids.

## HYDROGEN ION CONCENTRATION IS PRECISELY REGULATED

Precise $\mathrm{H}^{+}$regulation is essential because the activities of almost all enzyme systems in the body are influenced by $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration. Therefore, changes in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration alter virtually all cell and body functions.

Compared with other ions, the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration of the body fluids normally is kept at a low level. For example, the concentration of sodium in extracellular fluid ( $142 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) is about 3.5 million times as great as the normal concentration of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, which averages only $0.00004 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. Equally important, the normal variation in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration in extracellular fluid is only about one millionth as great as the normal variation in sodium ion $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$concentration. Thus, the precision with which $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is regulated emphasizes its importance to the various cell functions.

## ACIDS AND BASES—DEFINITIONS AND MEANINGS

A hydrogen ion is a single free proton released from a hydrogen atom. Molecules containing hydrogen atoms that can release hydrogen ions in a solution are referred
to as acids. An example is hydrochloric acid $(\mathrm{HCl})$, which ionizes in water to form hydrogen ions $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$and chloride ions $\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$. Likewise, carbonic acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)$ ionizes in water to form $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and bicarbonate ions $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$.

A base is an ion or a molecule that can accept an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. For example, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is a base because it can combine with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$. Likewise, $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{\ominus}$ is a base because it can accept an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{-}$. The proteins in the body also function as bases because some of the amino acids that make up proteins have net negative charges that readily accept $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The protein hemoglobin in the red blood cells and proteins in the other cells of the body are among the most important of the body's bases.

The terms base and alkali are often used synonymously. An alkali is a molecule formed by the combination of one or more of the alkaline metals-such as sodium, potassium, and lithium-with a highly basic ion such as a hydroxyl ion $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)$. The base portion of these molecules reacts quickly with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to remove it from solution and are, therefore, typical bases. For similar reasons, the term alkalosis refers to the excess removal of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the body fluids, in contrast to the excess addition of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, which is referred to as acidosis.

Strong and Weak Acids and Bases. A strong acid, such as HCl , rapidly dissociates and releases especially large amounts of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in solution. Weak acids such as $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ are less likely to dissociate their ions and, therefore, release $\mathrm{H}^{+}$with less vigor. A strong base is one that reacts rapidly and strongly with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and, therefore, quickly removes $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from a solution. A typical example is $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, which reacts with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to form water $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$. A typical weak base is $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$because it binds with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$much more weakly than $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$. Most acids and bases in the extracellular fluid that are involved in normal acid-base regulation are weak acids and bases. The most important ones that we discuss are carbonic acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$base.

Normal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Concentration and pH of Body Fluids and Changes That Occur in Acidosis and Alkalosis. The blood $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration is normally maintained within tight limits around a normal value of about 0.00004

$\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}(40 \mathrm{nEq} / \mathrm{L})$. Normal variations are only about 3 to $5 \mathrm{nEq} / \mathrm{L}$ but, under extreme conditions, the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration can vary from as low as $10 \mathrm{nEq} / \mathrm{L}$ to as high as 160 $\mathrm{nEq} / \mathrm{L}$ without resulting in death.

Because $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration normally is low, and because these small numbers are cumbersome, it is customary to express $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration on a logarithm scale using pH units. pH is related to the actual $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration by the following formula ( $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is expressed in equivalents per liter):

$$
\mathrm{pH}=\log \frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]
$$

For example, normal $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is $40 \mathrm{nEq} / \mathrm{L}(0.00000004$ $\mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L})$. Therefore, the normal pH is as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{pH}=-\log [0.00000004] \\
& \mathrm{pH}=7.4
\end{aligned}
$$

From this formula, one can see that pH is inversely related to the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration; therefore, a low pH corresponds to a high $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration, and a high pH corresponds to a low $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration.

The normal pH of arterial blood is 7.4 , whereas the pH of venous blood and interstitial fluids is about 7.35 because of the extra amounts of carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ released from the tissues to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ in these fluids (Table 31-1). Because the normal pH of arterial blood is 7.4, a person is considered to have acidemia when the pH falls significantly below this value and alkalemia when the pH rises above 7.4. The lower limit of pH at which a person can live more than a few hours is about 6.8 , and the upper limit is about 8.0 .

Intracellular pH usually is slightly lower than plasma pH because cell metabolism produces acid, especially $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$. Depending on the type of cells, the pH of intracellular fluid has been estimated to range between 6.0 and 7.4. Hypoxia of the tissues and poor blood flow to the tissues can cause acid accumulation and decreased intracellular pH . The terms acidosis and alkalosis describe the processes that lead to acidemia and alkalemia, respectively.

The pH of urine can range from 4.5 to 8.0 , depending on the acid-base status of the extracellular fluid. As discussed later, the kidneys play a major role in correcting abnormalities of extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration by excreting acids or bases at variable rates.

Table 31-1 pH and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Concentration of Body Fluids

|  | $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Concentration (mEq/L) | pH |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Extracellular Fluid | $\cdot$ |  |
| - Arterial blood | $\cdot 4.0 \times 10^{-5}$ | $\cdot 7.40$ |
| - Venous blood | $\cdot 4.5 \times 10^{-5}$ | $\cdot 7.35$ |
| - Interstitial fluid | $\cdot 4.5 \times 10^{-5}$ | $\cdot 7.35$ |
| Intracellular fluid | $1 \times 10^{-3}$ to $4 \times 10^{-5}$ | $6.0-7.4$ |
| Urine | $3 \times 10^{-2}$ to $1 \times 10^{-5}$ | $4.5-8.0$ |
| Gastric HCl | 160 | 0.8 |

An extreme example of an acidic body fluid is the HCl secreted into the stomach by the oxyntic (parietal) cells of the stomach mucosa, as discussed in Chapter 65. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration in these cells is about 4 million times greater than the hydrogen concentration in blood, with a pH of 0.8 . In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss the regulation of extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration.

## DEFENDING AGAINST CHANGES IN $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ CONCENTRATION: BUFFERS, LUNGS, AND KIDNEYS

Three primary systems regulate the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration in the body fluids: (1) the chemical acid-base buffer systems of the body fluids, which immediately combine with an acid or a base to prevent excessive changes in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration; (2) the respiratory center, which regulates the removal of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (and, therefore, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ) from the extracellular fluid; and (3) the kidneys, which can excrete acidic or alkaline urine, thereby readjusting the extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration toward normal during acidosis or alkalosis.

When there is a change in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration, the buffer systems of the body fluids react within seconds to minimize these changes. Buffer systems do not eliminate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ from or add $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to the body but only keep them tied up until balance can be re-established.

The second line of defense, the respiratory system, acts within a few minutes to eliminate $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and, therefore, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ from the body.

These first two lines of defense keep the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration from changing too much until the more slowly responding third line of defense, the kidneys, can eliminate the excess acid or base from the body. Although the kidneys are relatively slow to respond compared with the other defenses, over a period of hours to several days, they are by far the most powerful of the acid-base regulatory systems.

## BUFFERING OF H+ IN THE BODY FLUIDS

A buffer is any substance that can reversibly bind $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The general form of the buffering reaction is as follows:

$$
\text { Buffer }+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{HBuffer}
$$

In this example, a free $\mathrm{H}^{+}$combines with the buffer to form a weak acid (H buffer) that can either remain as an unassociated molecule or dissociate back to the buffer and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. When the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration increases, the reaction is forced to the right, and more $\mathrm{H}^{+}$binds to the buffer, as long as buffer is available. Conversely, when the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration decreases, the reaction shifts toward the left, and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is released from the buffer. In this way, changes in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration are minimized.

The importance of the body fluid buffers can be quickly realized if one considers the low concentration of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the body fluids and the relatively large amounts

of acids produced by the body each day. About 80 milliequivalents of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is ingested or produced each day by metabolism, whereas the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration of the body fluids normally is only about $0.00004 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. Without buffering, the daily production and ingestion of acids would cause lethal changes in the body fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ concentration.

The action of acid-base buffers can perhaps best be explained by considering the buffer system that is quantitatively the most important in the extracellular fluid-the bicarbonate buffer system.

## BICARBONATE BUFFER SYSTEM

The bicarbonate buffer system consists of a water solution that contains two ingredients: (1) a weak acid, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$; and (2) a bicarbonate salt, such as sodium bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}\right)$.
$\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is formed in the body by the reaction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ :

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \underset{\substack{\text { Carbonic anhydrase } \\ \mathrm{H}^{+}} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}}
$$

This reaction is slow, and exceedingly small amounts of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ are formed unless the enzyme carbonic anhydrase is present. This enzyme is especially abundant in the walls of the lung alveoli, where $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is released; carbonic anhydrase is also present in the epithelial cells of the renal tubules, where $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reacts with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$.
$\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ionizes weakly to form small amounts of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$:

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}
$$

The second component of the system, bicarbonate salt, occurs predominantly as $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ in the extracellular fluid. $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ ionizes almost completely to form $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, as follows:

$$
\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}
$$

Now, putting the entire system together, we have the following:

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}
$$

Because of the weak dissociation of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ concentration is extremely low.

When a strong acid such as HCl is added to the bicarbonate buffer solution, the increased $\mathrm{H}^{+}$released from the $\operatorname{acid}\left(\mathrm{HCl} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$is buffered by $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$:

$$
\uparrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

As a result, more $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is formed, causing increased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ production. From these reactions, one can see that $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the strong acid HCl reacts with $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$to form the very weak acid $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which in turn forms $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The excess $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ greatly stimulates respiration, which eliminates the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the extracellular fluid.

The opposite reactions take place when a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide $(\mathrm{NaOH})$, is added to the bicarbonate buffer solution.

$$
\mathrm{NaOH}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

In this case, the $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$from the NaOH combines with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ to form additional $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$. Thus, the weak base $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ replaces the strong base NaOH . At the same time, the concentration of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ decreases (because it reacts with NaOH ), causing more $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to combine with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to replace the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \longrightarrow \begin{array}{l}
\uparrow \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \\
+ \\
+\mathrm{NaOH}
\end{array} \\
& \text { Naa }
\end{aligned}
$$

The net result, therefore, is a tendency for the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ levels in the blood to decrease, but the decreased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the blood inhibits respiration and decreases the rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ expiration. The rise in blood $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration that occurs is compensated for by increased renal excretion of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$.

## Quantitative Dynamics of the Bicarbonate Buffer System

All acids, including $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, are ionized to some extent. From mass balance considerations, the concentrations of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$are proportional to the concentration of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ :

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}
$$

For any acid, the concentration of the acid relative to its dissociated ions is defined by the dissociation constant, $K^{\prime}$.

$$
\mathrm{K}^{\prime}=\frac{\mathrm{H}^{+} \times \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}}
$$

This equation indicates that in an $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ solution, the amount of free $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is equal to

$$
\mathrm{H}^{+}=\mathrm{K}^{\prime} \times \frac{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}}{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}
$$

The concentration of undissociated $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ cannot be measured in solution because it rapidly dissociates into $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ or into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$. However, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissolved in the blood is directly proportional to the amount of undissociated $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$. Therefore, Equation 2 can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\mathrm{H}^{+}=\mathrm{K} \times \frac{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}
$$

The dissociation constant (K) for Equation 3 is only about $1 / 400$ of the dissociation constant $\left(\mathrm{K}^{\prime}\right)$ of Equation 2 because the proportionality ratio between $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is $1: 400$.

Equation 3 is written in terms of the total amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissolved in solution. However, most clinical laboratories measure the blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ tension $\left(\mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)$ rather than the actual amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Fortunately, the amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the blood is a linear function of $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ multiplied by the solubility coefficient for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$; under physiological conditions, the solubility coefficient for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is $0.03 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at body temperature. This means that 0.03 millimole of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is present in the blood for each $\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg} \mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ measured. Therefore, Equation 3 can be rewritten as

$$
\mathrm{H}^{+}=\mathrm{K} \times \frac{\left(0.03 \times \mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)}{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}
$$

Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation. As discussed earlier, it is customary to express the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration in pH units rather than in actual concentrations. Recall that $\mathrm{pH}=-\log \mathrm{H}^{+}$.

The dissociation constant ( pK ) can be expressed in a similar manner.

$$
\mathrm{pK}=-\log \mathrm{K}
$$

Therefore, we can express the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration in Equation 4 in pH units by taking the negative logarithm of that equation, which yields the following:

$$
-\log \mathrm{H}^{+}=-\log \mathrm{pK}-\log \frac{\left(0.03 \times \mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)}{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{pK}-\log \frac{\left(0.03 \times \mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)}{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}
$$

Rather than work with a negative logarithm, we can change the sign of the logarithm and invert the numerator and denominator in the last term, using the law of logarithms, to yield the following:

$$
\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{pK}+\log \frac{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}{\left(0.03 \times \mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)}
$$

For the bicarbonate buffer system, the pK is 6.1, and Equation 7 can be written as follows:

$$
\mathrm{pH}=6.1+\log \frac{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}{0.03 \times \mathrm{PCO}_{2}}
$$

Equation 8 is the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and, with it, one can calculate the pH of a solution if the molar concentration of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$and the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ are known.

From the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, it is apparent that an increase in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration causes the pH to rise, shifting the acid-base balance toward alkalosis. An increase in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ causes the pH to decrease, shifting the acid-base balance toward acidosis.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, in addition to defining the determinants of normal pH regulation and acid-base balance in the extracellular fluid, provides insight into the physiological control of the acid and base composition of the extracellular fluid. As discussed later, the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration is regulated mainly by the
kidneys, whereas the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in extracellular fluid is controlled by the rate of respiration. By increasing the rate of respiration, the lungs remove $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the plasma and, by decreasing respiration, the lungs elevate $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$. Normal physiological acid-base homeostasis results from the coordinated efforts of both the lungs and kidneys, and acid-base disorders occur when one or both of these control mechanisms are impaired, thus altering either the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration or $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of extracellular fluid.

When disturbances of acid-base balance result from a primary change in extracellular fluid $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration, they are referred to as metabolic acid-base disorders. Therefore, acidosis caused by a primary decrease in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ concentration is termed metabolic acidosis, whereas alkalosis caused by a primary increase in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration is called metabolic alkalosis. Acidosis caused by an increase in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is called respiratory acidosis, whereas alkalosis caused by a decrease in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is termed respiratory alkalosis.

Bicarbonate Buffer System Titration Curve. Figure $31-1$ shows the changes in pH of the extracellular fluid when the ratio of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in extracellular fluid is altered. When the concentrations of these two components are equal, the right-hand portion of Equation 8 becomes the $\log$ of 1 , which is equal to 0 . Therefore, when the two components of the buffer system are equal, the pH of the solution is the same as the pK (6.1) of the bicarbonate buffer system. When base is added to the system, part of the dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is converted into $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, causing an increase in the ratio of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and increasing the pH , as is evident from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. When acid is added, it is buffered by $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, which is then converted into dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, decreasing the ratio of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and decreasing the pH of the extracellular fluid.

Buffer Power Determined by Amount and Relative Concentrations of Buffer Components. From the titration curve in Figure 31-1, several points are apparent. First, the pH of the system is the same as the pK when each of the components $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}\right.$and $\left.\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ constitutes $50 \%$ of the total concentration of the buffer system. Second, the buffer system is most effective in the central part of
![gu837762836d](gu837762836d.jpg)

Figure 31-1. Titration curve for bicarbonate buffer system showing the pH of extracellular fluid when the percentages of buffer in the form of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ) are altered.

the curve, where the pH is near the pK of the system. This phenomenon means that the change in pH for any given amount of acid or base added to the system is least when the pH is near the pK of the system. The buffer system is still reasonably effective for 1.0 pH unit on either side of the pK , which, for the bicarbonate buffer system, extends from a pH of about 5.1 to 7.1 units. Beyond these limits, the buffering power rapidly diminishes. And, when all the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ has been converted into $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, or when all the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$has been converted into $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, the system has no more buffering power.

The absolute concentration of the buffers is also an important factor in determining the buffer power of a system. With low concentrations of the buffers, only a small amount of acid or base added to the solution changes the pH considerably.

Bicarbonate Buffer System Is the Most Important Extracellular Buffer. From the titration curve shown in Figure 31-1, one would not expect the bicarbonate buffer system to be powerful, for two reasons. First, the pH of the extracellular fluid is about 7.4 , whereas the pK of the bicarbonate buffer system is 6.1 , which means that there is about 20 times as much of the bicarbonate buffer system in the form of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$as in the form of dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. For this reason, this system operates on the portion of the buffering curve where the slope is low, and the buffering power is poor. Second, the concentrations of the two elements of the bicarbonate system, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, are not high.

Despite these characteristics, the bicarbonate buffer system is the most powerful extracellular buffer in the body. This apparent paradox is due mainly to the fact that the two elements of the buffer system, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, are regulated, respectively, by the kidneys and lungs, as discussed later. As a result of this regulation, the pH of the extracellular fluid can be precisely controlled by the relative rate of removal and addition of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$by the kidneys and rate of removal of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by the lungs.

## PHOSPHATE BUFFER SYSTEM

Although the phosphate buffer system is not a major extracellular fluid buffer, it plays an important role in buffering renal tubular fluid and intracellular fluids.

The main elements of the phosphate buffer system are $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{-}$and $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{\circ}$. When a strong acid such as HCl is added to a mixture of these two substances, the hydrogen is accepted by the base $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{-}$and converted to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{-}$:

$$
\mathrm{HCl}+\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4} \rightarrow \mathrm{NaH}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}+\mathrm{NaCl}
$$

The result of this reaction is that the strong acid, HCl , is replaced by an additional amount of a weak acid, $\mathrm{NaH}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}$, and the decrease in pH is minimized.

When a strong base, such as NaOH , is added to the buffer system, the $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$is buffered by the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{-}$to form additional amounts of $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{\circ}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ :

$$
\mathrm{NaOH}+\mathrm{NaH}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

In this case, a strong base, NaOH , is traded for a weak base, $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}$, causing only a slight increase in pH .

The phosphate buffer system has a pK of 6.8 , which is not far from the normal pH of 7.4 in the body fluids, allows the system to operate near its maximum buffering power. However, its concentration in the extracellular fluid is low, at only about $8 \%$ of the concentration of the bicarbonate buffer. Therefore, the total buffering power of the phosphate system in the extracellular fluid is much less than that of the bicarbonate buffering system.

In contrast to its minor role as an extracellular buffer, the phosphate buffer is especially important in the tubular fluids of the kidneys for two reasons: (1) phosphate usually becomes greatly concentrated in the tubules, thereby increasing the buffering power of the phosphate system; and (2) the tubular fluid usually has a considerably lower pH than the extracellular fluid, bringing the operating range of the buffer closer to the $\mathrm{pK}(6.8)$ of the system.

The phosphate buffer system is also important in buffering intracellular fluid because the concentration of phosphate in this fluid is many times higher than in the extracellular fluid. Also, the pH of intracellular fluid is lower than that of extracellular fluid and, therefore, is usually closer to the pK of the phosphate buffer system compared with the extracellular fluid.

## PROTEINS ARE IMPORTANT INTRACELLULAR BUFFERS

Proteins are among the most plentiful buffers in the body because of their high concentrations, especially in the cells. The pH of the cells, although slightly lower than in the extracellular fluid, nevertheless changes approximately in proportion to extracellular fluid pH changes. There is a slight diffusion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$through the cell membrane, although these ions require several hours to reach equilibrium with the extracellular fluid, except for the rapid equilibrium that occurs in the red blood cells. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, however, can rapidly diffuse through all the cell membranes. This diffusion of the elements of the bicarbonate buffer system causes the pH in intracellular fluid to change when there are changes in extracellular pH . For this reason, the buffer systems in the cells help prevent changes in the pH of the extracellular fluid but may take several hours to become maximally effective.

In the red blood cell, hemoglobin $(\mathrm{Hb})$ is an important buffer, as follows:

$$
\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{Hb} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{HHb}
$$

Approximately $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ of the total chemical buffering of the body fluids is inside the cells, and most of this buffering results from the intracellular proteins. However, except for the red blood cells, the slow rate at which $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$move through the cell membranes often delays the maximum ability of the intracellular proteins to buffer extracellular acid-base abnormalities for several hours.

In addition to the high concentration of proteins in the cells, another factor that contributes to their buffering power is the fact that the pKs of many of these protein systems are fairly close to intracellular pH .

## Isohydric Principle: All Buffers in a Common Solution Are in Equilibrium With the Same $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Concentration

We have been discussing buffer systems as though they operate individually in the body fluids. However, they all work together because $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is common to the reactions of all these systems. Therefore, whenever there is a change in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration in the extracellular fluid, the balance of all the buffer systems changes at the same time. This phenomenon is called the isohydric principle and is illustrated by the following formula:

$$
\mathrm{H}^{+}=\mathrm{K}_{1} \times \frac{\mathrm{HA}_{1}}{\mathrm{~A}_{1}}=\mathrm{K}_{2} \times \frac{\mathrm{HA}_{2}}{\mathrm{~A}_{2}}=\mathrm{K}_{3} \times \frac{\mathrm{HA}_{3}}{\mathrm{~A}_{3}}
$$

$\mathrm{K}_{1}, \mathrm{~K}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{K}_{3}$ are the dissociation constants of three respective acids- $\mathrm{HA}_{1}, \mathrm{HA}_{2}, \mathrm{HA}_{3}$-and $\mathrm{A}_{1}, \mathrm{~A}_{2}, \mathrm{~A}_{3}$ are the concentrations of the free negative ions that constitute the bases of the three buffer systems.

The implication of this principle is that any condition that changes the balance of one of the buffer systems also changes the balance of all the others because the buffer systems actually buffer one another by shifting $\mathrm{H}^{+}$back and forth between them.

## RESPIRATORY REGULATION OF ACIDBASE BALANCE

The second line of defense against acid-base disturbances is control of extracellular fluid $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration by the lungs. An increase in ventilation eliminates $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from extracellular fluid, which, by mass action, reduces the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration. Conversely, decreased ventilation increases $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentrations in the extracellular fluid.

## PULMONARY EXPIRATION OF CO2 BALANCES METABOLIC FORMATION OF CO2

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is formed continually in the body by intracellular metabolic processes. After it is formed, it diffuses from the cells into the interstitial fluids and blood, and the flowing blood transports it to the lungs, where it diffuses into the alveoli and then is transferred to the atmosphere by pulmonary ventilation. About $1.2 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ of dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is normally in the extracellular fluid, corresponding to a $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of 40 mm Hg .

If the rate of metabolic formation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ increases, the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of the extracellular fluid is likewise increased. Conversely, a decreased metabolic rate lowers the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$. If the rate of pulmonary ventilation is increased, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is blown off from the lungs, and the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in the extracellular fluid decreases. Therefore, changes in pulmonary ventilation or the rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ formation by the tissues can change the extracellular fluid $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$.
![gu847762836d](gu847762836d.jpg)

Figure 31-2. Change in extracellular fluid pH caused by an increased or decreased rate of alveolar ventilation, expressed as times normal.

## INCREASING ALVEOLAR VENTILATION DECREASES EXTRACELLULAR FLUID H+ CONCENTRATION AND RAISES PH

If the metabolic formation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ remains constant, the only other factor that affects $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in extracellular fluid is the rate of alveolar ventilation. The higher the alveolar ventilation, the lower the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$. As discussed previously, when $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration increases, the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration also increase, thereby lowering extracellular fluid pH .

Figure 31-2 shows the approximate changes in blood pH that are caused by increasing or decreasing the alveolar ventilation rate. Note that increasing alveolar ventilation to about twice normal raises extracellular fluid pH by about 0.23 . If the pH of the body fluids is 7.40 with normal alveolar ventilation, doubling the ventilation rate raises the pH to about 7.63 . Conversely, a decrease in alveolar ventilation to one-fourth normal reduces the pH by 0.45 . That is, if the pH is 7.4 at a normal alveolar ventilation, reducing the ventilation to one-fourth normal reduces the pH to 6.95 . Because the alveolar ventilation rate can change markedly, from as low as 0 to as high as 15 times normal, one can easily understand how much the pH of the body fluids can be changed by the respiratory system.

## INCREASED H+ CONCENTRATION STIMULATES ALVEOLAR VENTILATION

Not only does the alveolar ventilation rate influence $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ concentration by changing $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of the body fluids, but the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration affects the rate of alveolar ventilation. Thus, Figure 31-3 shows that alveolar ventilation rate increases four to five times normal as pH decreases from the normal value of 7.4 to the strongly acidic value of 7.0 . Conversely, a rise in plasma pH above 7.4 causes a decrease in the ventilation rate. The change in ventilation rate per unit pH change is much greater at reduced levels of pH (corresponding to elevated $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration) compared with increased levels of pH . The reason for this is that as the

![gu857762836d](gu857762836d.jpg)

Figure 31-3. Effect of blood pH on the alveolar ventilation rate.
alveolar ventilation rate decreases, as a result of an increase in pH (decreased $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration), the amount of oxygen added to the blood decreases, and the partial pressure of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}\right)$ in the blood also decreases, which stimulates the ventilation rate. Therefore, the respiratory compensation for an increase in pH is not nearly as effective as the response to a marked reduction in pH .

Feedback Control of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Concentration by the Respiratory System. Because increased $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration stimulates respiration and because increased alveolar ventilation decreases $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration, the respiratory system acts as a typical negative feedback controller of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ concentration:
![gu867762836d](gu867762836d.jpg)

That is, whenever $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration increases above normal, the respiratory system is stimulated, and alveolar ventilation increases. This mechanism decreases the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in extracellular fluid and reduces $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration back toward normal. Conversely, if $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration falls below normal, the respiratory center becomes depressed, alveolar ventilation decreases, and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration increases back toward normal. Although alkalosis tends to depress the respiratory centers, the response is generally less robust and less predictable than the response to metabolic acidosis; the hypoxemia associated with reduced alveolar ventilation eventually activates oxygensensitive chemoreceptors that tend to stimulate ventilation and limit the respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis.

Efficiency of Respiratory Control of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Concentration. Respiratory control cannot return the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration all the way back to normal when a disturbance outside the respiratory system has altered the pH . Ordinarily, the respiratory mechanism for controlling $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration is approximately $50 \%$ to $75 \%$ effective, corresponding to a feedback gain of 1 to 3 for metabolic acidosis. That is, if the pH is suddenly decreased by adding acid to the ex-
tracellular fluid, and the pH falls from 7.4 to 7.0 , the respiratory system can return the pH to a value of about 7.2 to 7.3. This response occurs within 3 to 12 minutes. As discussed previously, the respiratory responses to metabolic alkalosis are limited by hypoxemia associated with reduced alveolar ventilation.

Buffering Power of the Respiratory System. Respiratory regulation of acid-base balance is a physiological type of buffer system because it acts rapidly and keeps the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration from changing too much until the slowly responding kidneys can eliminate the imbalance. In general, the overall buffering power of the respiratory system is one to two times as great as the buffering power of all other chemical buffers in the extracellular fluid combined. That is, one to two times as much acid or base can normally be buffered by this mechanism as by the chemical buffers.

Impairment of Lung Function Can Cause Respiratory Acidosis. We have discussed thus far the role of the normal respiratory mechanism as a means of buffering changes in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration. However, abnormalities of respiration can also cause changes in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration. For example, an impairment of lung function, such as severe emphysema, decreases the ability of the lungs to eliminate $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which causes a buildup of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the extracellular fluid and a tendency toward respiratory acidosis. Also, the ability to respond to metabolic acidosis is impaired because the compensatory reductions in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ that would normally occur by means of increased ventilation are blunted. In these circumstances, the kidneys represent the sole remaining physiological mechanism for returning pH toward normal after the initial chemical buffering in the extracellular fluid has occurred.

## RENAL CONTROL OF ACID-BASE BALANCE

The kidneys control acid-base balance by excreting acidic or basic urine. Excreting acidic urine reduces the amount of acid in extracellular fluid, whereas excreting basic urine removes base from the extracellular fluid.

The overall mechanism whereby the kidneys excrete acidic or basic urine is as follows. Large amounts of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$are filtered continuously into the tubules and, if excreted into the urine, remove base from the blood. Large numbers of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$are also secreted into the tubular lumen by the tubular epithelial cells, thus removing acid from the blood. If more $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is secreted than $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is filtered, there will be a net loss of acid from the extracellular fluid. Conversely, if more $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is filtered than $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is secreted, there will be a net loss of base.

Each day, the body produces about 80 mEq of nonvolatile acids, mainly from metabolism of proteins. These acids are called nonvolatile because they are not $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and,

therefore, cannot be excreted by the lungs. The primary mechanism for removal of these acids from the body is renal excretion. The kidneys must also prevent the loss of bicarbonate in the urine, a task that is quantitatively more important than the excretion of nonvolatile acids. Each day, the kidneys filter about 4320 mEq of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}(180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day $\times 24 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ); under normal conditions, almost all of this is reabsorbed from the tubules, thereby conserving the primary buffer system of the extracellular fluid.

As discussed later, both the reabsorption of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ and excretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$are accomplished through the process of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion by the tubules. Because $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$must react with a secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ before it can be reabsorbed, 4320 mEq of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$must be secreted each day just to reabsorb the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Then, an additional 80 mEq of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$must be secreted to rid the body of the nonvolatile acids produced each day for a total of 4400 mEq of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted into the tubular fluid each day.

When there is a reduction in the extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ concentration (alkalosis), the kidneys usually secrete less $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and fail to reabsorb all the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, thereby increasing the excretion of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Because $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$normally buffers $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the extracellular fluid, this loss of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is the same as adding an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to the extracellular fluid. Therefore, in alkalosis, the removal of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$raises the extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration back toward normal.

In acidosis, the kidneys secrete additional $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and do not excrete $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the urine but reabsorb all the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and produce new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, which is added back to the extracellular fluid. This action reduces the extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration back toward normal.

Thus, the kidneys regulate extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration through three fundamental mechanisms: (1) secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$; (2) reabsorption of filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$; and (3) production of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. All these processes are accomplished through the same basic mechanisms, as discussed in the next few sections.

## SECRETION OF H+ AND REABSORPTION OF $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$BY THE RENAL TUBULES

Hydrogen ion secretion and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption occur in virtually all parts of the tubules except the descending and ascending thin limbs of the loop of Henle. Figure 31-4 summarizes $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption along the tubule. Keep in mind that for each $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorbed, an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$must be secreted.

About $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption (and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion) occurs in the proximal tubule, so only a small amount of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$flows into the distal tubules and collecting ducts. In the thick ascending loop of Henle, another $10 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is reabsorbed, and the remainder of the reabsorption takes place in the distal tubules and collecting ducts. As discussed previously, the mechanism whereby $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is reabsorbed also involves tubular secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, but different tubular segments accomplish this task differently.
![gu877762836d](gu877762836d.jpg)

Figure 31-4. Reabsorption of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in different segments of the renal tubule. The percentages of the filtered load of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$absorbed by the various tubular segments are shown, as well as the number of milliequivalents reabsorbed per day under normal conditions.

## $\mathrm{H}^{+}$SECRETED BY SECONDARY ACTIVE TRANSPORT IN EARLY TUBULAR SEGMENTS

The epithelial cells of the proximal tubule, the thick segment of the ascending loop of Henle, and the early distal tubule all secrete $\mathrm{H}^{+}$into the tubular fluid by sodiumhydrogen counter-transport, as shown in Figure 31-5. This secondary active secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is coupled with the transport of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$into the cell at the luminal membrane by the sodium-hydrogen exchanger protein, and the energy for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion against a concentration gradient is derived from the sodium gradient favoring $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ movement into the cell. This gradient is established by the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}\right.$ ATPase) pump in the basolateral membrane. About $95 \%$ of the bicarbonate is reabsorbed in this manner, requiring about 4000 mEq of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to be secreted each day by the tubules. This mechanism, however, can establish a minimum pH of only about 6.7; the tubular fluid becomes very acidic only in the collecting tubules and collecting ducts, which can establish a urine pH as low as about 4.5 .

Figure 31-5 shows how the process of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion achieves $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption. The secretory process begins when $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ either diffuses into the tubular cells or is formed by metabolism in the tubular epithelial cells. Under the influence of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, combines with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which dissociates into $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is secreted from the cell into the tubular lumen by sodium-hydrogen countertransport. That is, when $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$moves from the lumen of the tubule to the interior of the cell, it first combines with a

Figure 31-5. Shown are the cellular mechanisms for the following: (1) active secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$into the renal tubule; (2) tubular reabsorption of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$by combination with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which dissociates to form $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$; and (3) $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in exchange for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secreted. This pattern of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion occurs in the proximal tubule, thick ascending segment of the loop of Henle, and early distal tubule.
carrier protein in the luminal border of the cell membrane; at the same time, a $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the interior of the cells combines with the carrier protein. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$moves into the cell down a concentration gradient that has been established by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump in the basolateral membrane. The gradient for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$movement into the cell then provides the energy for moving $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the opposite direction from the interior of the cell to the tubular lumen.

The $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$generated in the cell (when $\mathrm{H}^{+}$dissociates from $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ) then moves downhill across the basolateral membrane, into the renal interstitial fluid and peritubular capillary blood. The net result is that for every $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted into the tubular lumen, an $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$enters the blood.

## FILTERED HCO3 ${ }^{-}$IS REABSORBED BY INTERACTION WITH H+ IN THE TUBULES

Bicarbonate ions do not readily permeate the luminal membranes of the renal tubular cells; therefore, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$that is filtered by the glomerulus cannot be directly reabsorbed. Instead, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is reabsorbed by a special process in which it first combines with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which eventually becomes $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, as shown in Figure 31-5.

This reabsorption of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is initiated by a reaction in the tubules between $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$filtered at the glomerulus and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted by the tubular cells. The $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ formed then dissociates into $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can move easily across the tubular membrane; therefore, it instantly diffuses into the tubular cell, where it recombines with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, under the influence of carbonic anhydrase, to generate a new $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ molecule. This $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ dissociates to form $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$; the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$then diffuses through the basolateral membrane into the interstitial fluid and is taken up into the peritubular capillary blood. The transport of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ across the basolateral membrane is facilitated by two mechanisms: (1) $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$co-transport in the proximal tubules; and (2) $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$exchange in
the late segments of the proximal tubule, thick ascending loop of Henle, and collecting tubules and ducts.

Thus, each time a $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is formed in the tubular epithelial cells, an $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is also formed and released back into the blood. The net effect of these reactions is "reabsorption" of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$from the tubules, although the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$that actually enters the extracellular fluid is not the same as that filtered into the tubules. The reabsorption of filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$does not result in net secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$because the secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$combines with the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$and is therefore not excreted.
$\mathbf{H C O}_{3}{ }^{-}$Is Titrated Against $\mathbf{H}^{+}$in the Tubules. Under normal conditions, the rate of tubular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion is about $4400 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day, and the rate of filtration by $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is about $4320 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day. Thus, the quantities of these two ions entering the tubules are almost equal, and they combine with each other to form $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Therefore, it is said that $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$normally "titrate" each other in the tubules.

The titration process is not quite exact because there is usually a slight excess of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the tubules to be excreted in the urine. This excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}\left(\approx 80 \mathrm{mEq} /\right.$ day) rids the body of nonvolatile acids produced by metabolism. As discussed later, most of this $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is not excreted as free $\mathrm{H}^{+}$but is in combination with other urinary buffers, especially phosphate and ammonia.

When there is an excess of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$over $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the urine, as occurs in metabolic alkalosis, the excess $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$cannot be reabsorbed. Therefore, the excess $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is left in the tubules and eventually excreted into the urine, which helps correct the metabolic alkalosis.

In acidosis, there is excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$relative to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, causing complete reabsorption of the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$; the excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ passes into the urine in combination with urinary buffers, especially phosphate and ammonia, and eventually is excreted as salts. Thus, the basic mechanism whereby the kidneys correct acidosis or alkalosis is incomplete titration of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$against $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, leaving one or the other to pass into the urine and be removed from the extracellular fluid.

## PRIMARY ACTIVE SECRETION OF $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ IN THE INTERCALATED CELLS OF LATE DISTAL AND COLLECTING TUBULES

Beginning in the late distal tubules and continuing through the remainder of the tubular system, the tubular epithelium secretes $\mathrm{H}^{+}$by primary active transport. The characteristics of this transport are different from those discussed for the proximal tubule, loop of Henle, and early distal tubule.

The mechanism for primary active $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion was discussed in Chapter 28 and is shown in Figure 316. It occurs at the luminal membrane of the tubular cell, where $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is transported directly by specific proteins, a hydrogen-transporting ATPase and a hydrogen-potassiumATPase transporter. The energy required for pumping the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is derived from the breakdown of ATP to adenosine diphosphate.

![gu897762836d](gu897762836d.jpg)

Figure 31-6. Active secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$through the luminal membrane of the type A intercalated epithelial cells of the late distal and collecting tubules. Type A cells contain hydrogen-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and hydrogen-potassium-ATPase in the luminal membrane and secrete $\mathrm{H}^{+}$while reabsorbing $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in acidosis. Note that one $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is reabsorbed for each $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted, and one $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is passively secreted along with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

Primary active secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$occurs in special types of cells called the type $A$ intercalated cells of the late distal tubule and in the collecting tubules. Hydrogen ion secretion in these cells is accomplished in two steps: (1) the dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in this cell combines with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$; and (2) the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ then dissociates into $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, which is reabsorbed into the blood, plus $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, which is secreted into the tubule by means of the hydrogen-ATPase and the hydrogen-potassium-ATPase transporters. For each $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted, a $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is reabsorbed, similar to the process in the proximal tubules. The main difference is that $\mathrm{H}^{+}$moves across the luminal membrane by an active $\mathrm{H}^{+}$pump instead of by counter-transport, as occurs in the early parts of the nephron.

Although secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the late distal tubule and collecting tubules accounts for only about $5 \%$ of the total $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted, this mechanism is important in forming maximally acidic urine. In the proximal tubules, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ concentration can be increased only about threefold to fourfold and the tubular fluid pH can be reduced to only about 6.7, although large amounts of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$are secreted by this nephron segment. However, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration can be increased as much as 900 -fold in the collecting tubules. This mechanism decreases the pH of the tubular fluid to about 4.5 , which is the lower limit of pH that can be achieved in normal kidneys.

## COMBINATION OF EXCESS H+ WITH PHOSPHATE AND AMMONIA BUFFERS IN THE TUBULE GENERATES "NEW" $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$

When $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is secreted in excess of the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$filtered into the tubular fluid, only a small part of the excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$can be excreted in the ionic form $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$in the urine.

This is because the minimal urine pH is about 4.5 , corresponding to an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration of $10^{-4.5} \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, or $0.03 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. Thus, for each liter of urine formed, a maximum of only about 0.03 mEq of free $\mathrm{H}^{+}$can be excreted. To excrete the 80 mEq of nonvolatile acid formed by metabolism each day, about 2667 liters of urine would have to be excreted if the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$remained free in solution.

The excretion of large amounts of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(on occasion as much as $500 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day) in the urine is accomplished primarily by combining the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$with buffers in the tubular fluid. The most important buffers are phosphate buffer and ammonia buffer. Other weak buffer systems, such as urate and citrate, are much less important.

When $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is titrated in the tubular fluid with $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, this leads to reabsorption of one $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$for each $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secreted, as discussed earlier. However, when there is excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the tubular fluid, it combines with buffers other than $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and this leads to generation of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that can also enter the blood. Thus, when there is excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the extracellular fluid, the kidneys not only reabsorb all the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$but also generate new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, thereby helping replenish the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$lost from the extracellular fluid in acidosis. In the next two sections, we discuss the mechanisms whereby phosphate and ammonia buffers contribute to generation of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

## PHOSPHATE BUFFER SYSTEM CARRIES EXCESS H+ INTO THE URINE AND GENERATES NEW $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$

The phosphate buffer system is composed of $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{\circ}$. Both become concentrated in the tubular fluid because water is normally reabsorbed to a greater extent than phosphate by the renal tubules. Therefore, although phosphate is not an important extracellular fluid buffer, it is much more effective as a buffer in the tubular fluid.

Another factor that makes phosphate important as a tubular buffer is the fact that the pK of this system is about 6.8. Under normal conditions, the urine is slightly acidic, and the urine pH is near the pK of the phosphate buffer system. Therefore, in the tubules, the phosphate buffer system normally functions near its most effective pH range.

Figure 31-7 shows the sequence of events whereby $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ is excreted in combination with phosphate buffer and the mechanism whereby new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is added to the blood. The process of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion into the tubules is the same as described earlier. As long as there is excess $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in the tubular fluid, most of the secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$combines with $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. However, once all the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$has been reabsorbed and is no longer available to combine with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, any excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$can combine with $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{\circ}$ and other tubular buffers. After the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$combines with $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{\circ}$ to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{-}$, it can be excreted as a sodium salt $\left(\mathrm{NaH}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)$, carrying with it the excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

![gu907762836d](gu907762836d.jpg)

Figure 31-7. Buffering of secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$by filtered phosphate $\left(\mathrm{NaH}\right.$ $\mathrm{PO}_{4}$ ). Note that a new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is returned to the blood for each $\mathrm{NaH}-$ $\mathrm{PO}_{4}$ that reacts with a secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

There is one important difference in this sequence of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$excretion from that discussed previously. In this case, the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that is generated in the tubular cell and enters the peritubular blood represents a net gain of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$by the blood, rather than merely a replacement of filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Therefore, whenever an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted into the tubular lumen combines with a buffer other than $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, the net effect is the addition of a new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to the blood. This process demonstrates one of the mechanisms whereby the kidneys can replenish the extracellular fluid stores of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

Under normal conditions, much of the filtered phosphate is reabsorbed, and only 30 to $40 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day are available for buffering $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Therefore, much of the buffering of excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the tubular fluid in acidosis occurs through the ammonia buffer system.

## EXCRETION OF EXCESS $\mathrm{H}^{+}$AND GENERATION OF NEW $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$BY AMMONIA BUFFER SYSTEM

A second buffer system in the tubular fluid that is even more important quantitatively than the phosphate buffer system is composed of ammonia $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$ and the ammonium ion $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right)$. Ammonium ion is synthesized from glutamine, which comes mainly from metabolism of amino acids in the liver. The glutamine delivered to the kidneys is transported into epithelial cells of the proximal tubules, thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and distal tubules (Figure 31-8). Once inside the cell, each molecule of glutamine is metabolized in a series of reactions to ultimately form two $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and two $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$. The $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$is secreted into the tubular lumen by a countertransport mechanism in exchange for sodium, which is reabsorbed. The $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is transported across the basolateral membrane, along with the reabsorbed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, into the interstitial fluid and is taken up by the peritubular capillaries. Thus, for each molecule of glutamine metabolized in the proximal tubules, two $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$are secreted into the

Figure 31-8. Production and secretion of ammonium ion $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}\right)$by proximal tubular cells. Glutamine is metabolized in the cell, yielding $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$. The $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$is secreted into the lumen by a $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$ exchanger. For each glutamine molecule metabolized, two $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$are produced and secreted, and two $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$are returned to the blood.

Figure 31-9. Buffering of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion by ammonia $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$ in the collecting tubules. $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ diffuses into the tubular lumen, where it reacts with secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to form $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, which is then excreted. For each $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$ excreted, a new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is formed in the tubular cells and returned to the blood.
urine and two $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$are reabsorbed into the blood. The $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$generated by this process constitutes new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$.

In the collecting tubules, the addition of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$to the tubular fluids occurs through a different mechanism (Figure 31-9). Here, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is actively secreted by the tubular membrane into the lumen, where it combines with $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ to form $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, which is then excreted. The collecting ducts are permeable to $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, which can easily diffuse into the tubular lumen. However, the luminal membrane of this part of the tubules is much less permeable to $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$; therefore, once the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$has reacted with $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ to form $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$is trapped in the tubular lumen and eliminated in the urine. For each $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$excreted, a new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is generated and added to the blood.

Chronic Acidosis Increases $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$Excretion. One of the most important features of the renal ammoniumammonia buffer system is that it is subject to physiological

control. An increase in extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration stimulates renal glutamine metabolism and, therefore, increases formation of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to be used in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$buffering; a decrease in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration has the opposite effect.

Under normal conditions, the amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$eliminated by the ammonia buffer system accounts for about $50 \%$ of the acid excreted and $50 \%$ of the new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$generated by the kidneys. However, with chronic acidosis, the rate of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$excretion can increase to as much as $500 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day. Therefore, with chronic acidosis, the dominant mechanism for acid elimination is excretion of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$. This process also provides the most important mechanism for generating new bicarbonate during chronic acidosis.

## QUANTIFYING RENAL ACID-BASE EXCRETION

Based on the principles discussed earlier, we can quantify the kidneys' net excretion of acid or net addition or elimination of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$from the blood as follows.

Bicarbonate excretion is calculated as urine flow rate multiplied by the urinary $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration and indicates how rapidly the kidneys are removing $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$from the blood, which is the same as adding an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to the blood. In alkalosis, the loss of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$helps return the plasma pH toward normal.

The amount of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$contributed to the blood at any given time is equal to the amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted that ends up in the tubular lumen with non-bicarbonate urinary buffers. As discussed previously, the primary sources of nonbicarbonate urinary buffers are $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and phosphate. Therefore, part of the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$added to the blood (and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$excreted by $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$) is calculated by measuring $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$excretion (urine flow rate multiplied by urinary $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$concentration).

The rest of the non-bicarbonate, non- $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$buffer excreted in the urine is measured by determining a value known as titratable acid. The amount of titratable acid in the urine is measured by titrating the urine with a strong base, such as NaOH , to a pH of 7.4 , the pH of normal plasma and the pH of the glomerular filtrate. This titration reverses the events that occurred in the tubular lumen when the tubular fluid was titrated by secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Therefore, the number of milliequivalents of NaOH required to return the urinary pH to 7.4 equals the number of milliequivalents of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$added to the tubular fluid that combined with phosphate and other organic buffers. The titratable acid measurement does not include $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in association with $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$because the pK of the ammoniaammonium reaction is 9.2 , and titration with NaOH to a pH of 7.4 does not remove the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$.

Thus, the net acid excretion by the kidneys can be assessed as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Net acid excretion } & =\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+} \text { excretion }+ \text { Urinary } \\
& \text { titratable acid }-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \text {excretion }
\end{aligned}
$$

The reason we subtract $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$excretion is that the loss of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is the same as the addition of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to the blood. To maintain acid-base balance, the net acid excretion must equal the nonvolatile acid production in the body.

In acidosis, the net acid excretion increases markedly, especially because of increased $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$excretion, thereby removing acid from the blood. The net acid excretion also equals the rate of net $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$addition to the blood. Therefore, in acidosis, there is a net addition of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$back to the blood as more $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and urinary titratable acid are excreted.

In alkalosis, titratable acid and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$excretion drop to 0 , whereas $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$excretion increases. Therefore, in alkalosis, there is a negative net acid secretion, which means that there is a net loss of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$from the blood, which is the same as adding $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to the blood, and that no new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is generated by the kidneys.

## REGULATION OF RENAL TUBULAR $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ SECRETION

As discussed earlier, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion by the tubular epithelium is necessary for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$reabsorption and generation of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$associated with titratable acid formation. Therefore, the rate of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion must be carefully regulated if the kidneys are to perform their functions in acid-base homeostasis effectively. Under normal conditions, the kidney tubules must secrete at least enough $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ to reabsorb almost all the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$that is filtered, and there must be enough $\mathrm{H}^{+}$left over to be excreted as titratable acid or $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$to rid the body of the nonvolatile acids produced each day from metabolism.

In alkalosis, the tubular secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is reduced to a level that is too low to achieve complete $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$reabsorption, enabling the kidneys to increase $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$excretion. Titratable acid and ammonia are not excreted in alkalosis because there is no excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$available to combine with nonbicarbonate buffers; therefore, no new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is added to the blood in alkalosis.

During acidosis, the tubular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion is increased sufficiently to reabsorb all the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, with enough $\mathrm{H}^{+}$left over to excrete large amounts of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$ and titratable acid, thereby contributing large amounts of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$to the total body extracellular fluid. The most important stimuli for increasing $H^{+}$secretion by the tubules in acidosis are as follows: (1) an increase in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of the extracellular fluid in respiratory acidosis; and (2) an increase in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration of the extracellular fluid (decreased pH ) in respiratory or metabolic acidosis.

The tubular cells respond directly to an increase in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of the blood, as in respiratory acidosis, with an increase in the rate of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion, as follows. The increased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ raises the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of the tubular cells, causing increased formation of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the tubular cells, which in turn stimulates secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The second factor that stimulates $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion is an increase in extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration (decreased pH ).

Table 31-2 Plasma or Extracellular Fluid Factors That Increase or Decrease $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Secretion and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ Reabsorption by the Renal Tubules

| Increase $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Secretion and <br> $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$Reabsorption | Decrease $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Secretion and <br> $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$Reabsorption |
| :-- | :-- |
| $\uparrow \mathrm{PcO}_{2}$ | $\downarrow \mathrm{PcO}_{2}$ |
| $\uparrow \mathrm{H}^{+}, \downarrow \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ | $\downarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}, \uparrow \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ |
| $\downarrow$ Extracellular fluid volume | $\uparrow$ Extracellular fluid volume |
| $\uparrow$ Angiotensin II | $\downarrow$ Angiotensin II |
| $\uparrow$ Aldosterone | $\downarrow$ Aldosterone |
| Hypokalemia | Hyperkalemia |

A special factor that can increase $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion under some pathophysiological conditions is excessive aldosterone secretion. Aldosterone stimulates secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$by type A intercalated cells of the collecting tubules and ducts. Therefore, excessive secretion of aldosterone, as in persons with Conn syndrome, increases secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$into the tubular fluid and, consequently, increases the amount of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$added back to the blood. This action usually causes alkalosis in patients with excessive aldosterone secretion.

The tubular cells usually respond to a decrease in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ concentration (alkalosis) by reducing $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion. The decreased $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion results from decreased extracellular $\mathrm{PcO}_{2}$, as in respiratory alkalosis, or from a decrease in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration, as in both respiratory and metabolic alkalosis.

Table 31-2 summarizes the major factors that influence $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$reabsorption. Some of these factors are not directly related to the regulation of acid-base balance. For example, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion is coupled to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{H}^{+}$exchanger in the proximal tubule and the thick ascending loop of Henle. Therefore, factors that stimulate $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, such as decreased extracellular fluid volume and increased angiotensin II (Ang II), may also secondarily increase $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$reabsorption.

Extracellular fluid volume depletion stimulates sodium reabsorption by the renal tubules and increases $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption through multiple mechanisms, including the following: (1) increased Ang II levels, which directly stimulate activity of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ $\mathrm{H}^{+}$exchanger in the renal tubules; and (2) increased aldosterone levels, which stimulate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion by the intercalated cells of the cortical collecting tubules. Therefore, extracellular fluid volume depletion tends to cause alkalosis due to excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption.

Changes in plasma potassium concentration can also influence $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion, with hypokalemia stimulating and hyperkalemia inhibiting $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion in the proximal tubule. Decreased plasma potassium concentration tends to increase $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration in the renal tubular cells. This, in turn, stimulates $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion and
$\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption and leads to alkalosis. Hyperkalemia decreases $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption and tends to cause acidosis.

## RENAL CORRECTION OF ACIDOSISINCREASED EXCRETION OF H+ AND ADDITION OF $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$TO THE EXTRACELLULAR FLUID

Now that we have described the mechanisms whereby the kidneys secrete $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and reabsorb $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, we can explain how the kidneys readjust the pH of the extracellular fluid when it becomes abnormal.

Referring to Equation 8, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we can see that acidosis occurs when the ratio of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the extracellular fluid decreases, thereby decreasing the pH . If this ratio decreases because of a fall in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, the acidosis is referred to as metabolic acidosis. If the pH falls because of an increase in $\mathrm{PcO}_{2}$, the acidosis is referred to as respiratory acidosis.

## ACIDOSIS DECREASES $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$RATIO IN RENAL TUBULAR FLUID

Respiratory and metabolic acidosis both cause a decrease in the ratio of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$in the renal tubular fluid. As a result, there is excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the renal tubules, causing complete reabsorption of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and still leaving additional $\mathrm{H}^{+}$available to combine with the urinary buffers $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{-}$. Thus, in acidosis, the kidneys reabsorb all the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and contribute new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$through formation of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and titratable acid.

In metabolic acidosis, an excess of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$over $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ occurs in the tubular fluid, primarily because of decreased extracellular fluid concentration of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and therefore decreased glomerular filtration of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

In respiratory acidosis, the excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the tubular fluid is due mainly to the rise in extracellular fluid $\mathrm{PcO}_{2}$, which stimulates $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion.

As discussed previously, with chronic acidosis, regardless of whether it is respiratory or metabolic, there is increased production of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, which further contributes to excretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and addition of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to the extracellular fluid. With severe chronic acidosis, as much as $500 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$can be excreted in the urine, mainly in the form of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$; this excretion, in turn, contributes up to $500 \mathrm{mEq} /$ day of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that is added to the blood.

Thus, with chronic acidosis, increased secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ by the tubules helps eliminate excess $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the body and increases the quantity of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in the extracellular fluid. This process increases the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$part of the bicarbonate buffer system, which, in accordance with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, helps raise the extracellular pH and corrects the acidosis. If the acidosis is metabolically mediated, additional compensation by the lungs causes a reduction in $\mathrm{PcO}_{2}$, also helping correct the acidosis.

${ }^{a}$ The primary event is indicated by the double arrows ( $\uparrow \uparrow$ or $\downarrow \downarrow$ ). Note that respiratory acid-base disorders are initiated by an increase or decrease in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, whereas metabolic disorders are initiated by an increase or decrease in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$.

Table 31-3 summarizes the extracellular fluid characteristics associated with respiratory and metabolic acidosis, as well as respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, discussed in the next section. Note that in respiratory acidosis, there is a reduction in pH , an increase in extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration, and an increase in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, which is the initial cause of the acidosis. The compensatory response is increase in plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, caused by the addition of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$to the extracellular fluid by the kidneys. The rise in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$helps offset the increase in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, thereby returning the plasma pH toward normal.

In metabolic acidosis, there is also a decrease in pH and a rise in the extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration. However, in this case, the primary abnormality is a decrease in plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$. The primary compensations include increased ventilation rate, which reduces $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, and renal compensation, which, by adding new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to the extracellular fluid, helps minimize the initial fall in extracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration.

## RENAL CORRECTION OF ALKALOSISDECREASED TUBULAR SECRETION OF H ${ }^{+}$ AND INCREASED EXCRETION OF $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$

The compensatory responses to alkalosis are basically opposite to those that occur in acidosis. In alkalosis, the ratio of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the extracellular fluid increases, causing a rise in pH (a decrease in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration), as evident from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

## ALKALOSIS INCREASES $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$RATIO IN RENAL TUBULAR FLUID

Regardless of whether alkalosis is caused by metabolic or respiratory abnormalities, there is still an increase in the ratio of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$in the renal tubular fluid. The net effect of this is an excess of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that cannot be reabsorbed from the tubules and is, therefore, excreted
in the urine. Thus, in alkalosis, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is removed from the extracellular fluid by renal excretion, which has the same effect as adding an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to the extracellular fluid. This process helps return the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration and pH toward normal.

Table 31-3 shows the overall extracellular fluid characteristics of respiratory and metabolic alkalosis. In respiratory alkalosis, there is an increase in extracellular fluid pH and a decrease in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration. The cause of the alkalosis is decreased plasma $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, caused by hyperventilation. Reduction in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ then leads to decreased renal tubular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion. Consequently, there is not enough $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the renal tubular fluid to react with all the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that is filtered. Therefore, the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that cannot react with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is not reabsorbed and is excreted in the urine. This results in a decreased plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$concentration and correction of the alkalosis. Therefore, the compensatory response to a primary reduction in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ in respiratory alkalosis is a reduction in plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ concentration, caused by increased renal excretion of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

In metabolic alkalosis, there is also decreased plasma $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration and increased pH . The cause of metabolic alkalosis, however, is a rise in the extracellular fluid $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration. This rise is partly compensated for by a reduction in the respiration rate, which increases $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and helps return the extracellular fluid pH toward normal. In addition, increased $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$concentration in the extracellular fluid increases the filtered load of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, which, in turn, causes excess $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$over $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted in the renal tubular fluid. The excess $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in the tubular fluid fails to be reabsorbed because there is no $\mathrm{H}^{+}$with which it can react, and it is excreted in the urine. In metabolic alkalosis, the primary compensations are decreased ventilation, which raises $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, and increases renal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$excretion, which helps compensate for the initial rise in extracellular fluid $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration.

## Clinical Causes of Acid-Base Disorders

## Respiratory Acidosis Results From Decreased Ventilation and Increased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$

From the previous discussion, it is obvious that any factor that decreases the rate of pulmonary ventilation also increases the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of extracellular fluid. This causes an increase in $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentrations, thus resulting in acidosis. Because the acidosis is caused by an abnormality in respiration, it is called respiratory acidosis.

Respiratory acidosis can occur from pathological conditions that damage the respiratory centers or that decrease the ability of the lungs to eliminate $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. For example, damage to the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata can lead to respiratory acidosis. Also, obstruction of the passageways of the respiratory tract, pneumonia, emphysema, or decreased pulmonary membrane surface area, as well as any factor that interferes with exchange of gases between the blood and alveolar air, can cause respiratory acidosis.

In respiratory acidosis, the compensatory responses available are as follows: (1) the buffers of the body fluids; and (2) the kidneys, which require several days to compensate for the disorder.

## Respiratory Alkalosis Results From Increased Ventilation and Decreased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$

Respiratory alkalosis is caused by excessive ventilation by the lungs. Rarely does this occur because of physical pathological conditions. However, a psychoneurosis can occasionally increase breathing to the extent that a person becomes alkalotic.

A physiological type of respiratory alkalosis occurs when a person ascends to a high altitude. The low oxygen content of the air stimulates respiration, which causes loss of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and development of mild respiratory alkalosis. Again, the major means for compensation are the chemical buffers of the body fluids and ability of the kidneys to increase $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$excretion.

## Metabolic Acidosis Results From Decreased Extracellular Fluid $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$Concentration

The term metabolic acidosis refers to all other types of acidosis besides those caused by excess $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the body fluids. Metabolic acidosis can result from several general causes: (1) failure of the kidneys to excrete metabolic acids normally formed in the body; (2) formation of excess quantities of metabolic acids in the body; (3) addition of metabolic acids to the body by ingestion or infusion of acids; and (4) loss of base from the body fluids, which has the same effect as adding an acid to the body fluids. Some specific conditions that cause metabolic acidosis are described in the following sections.

Renal Tubular Acidosis. Renal tubular acidosis results from a defect in renal secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, reabsorption of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, or both. These disorders are generally of two types: (1) impairment of renal tubular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$reabsorption, causing loss of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$in the urine; or (2) inability of the renal tubular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretory mechanism to establish normal acidic urine, causing the excretion of alkaline urine. In these cases, inadequate amounts of titratable acid and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$are excreted, so there is net accumulation of acid in the body fluids. Some causes of renal tubular acidosis include chronic renal failure, insufficient aldosterone secretion (Addison disease), and several hereditary and acquired disorders that impair tubular function, such as Fanconi syndrome (see Chapter 32).

Diarrhea. Severe diarrhea is probably the most frequent cause of metabolic acidosis. The cause of this acidosis is the loss of large amounts of sodium bicarbonate into the feces. The gastrointestinal secretions normally contain large amounts of bicarbonate, and diarrhea results in the loss of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$from the body, which has the same effect as losing large amounts of bicarbonate in the urine. This form of metabolic acidosis can be serious and can cause death, especially in young children.

Vomiting of Intestinal Contents. Vomiting of gastric contents alone would cause a loss of acid and a tendency toward alkalosis because the stomach secretions are highly acidic. However, vomiting large amounts from deeper in the gastrointestinal tract causes loss of bicarbonate and results in metabolic acidosis in the same way that diarrhea causes acidosis.

Diabetes Mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is caused by lack of insulin secretion by the pancreas (type 1 diabetes) or by insufficient insulin secretion to compensate for decreased sensitivity to the effects of insulin (type 2 diabetes). In the absence of sufficient insulin, the normal metabolism of glucose is prevented. Instead, some of the fats are split into acetoacetic acid, and this acid is metabolized by the tissues for energy in place of glucose. With severe diabetes mellitus, blood acetoacetic acid levels can rise very high, causing severe metabolic acidosis. In an attempt to compensate for this acidosis, large amounts of acid are excreted in the urine-sometimes as much as $500 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day.

Ingestion of Acids. Rarely are large amounts of acids ingested in normal foods. However, severe metabolic acidosis occasionally results from the ingestion of certain acidic poisons. Some of these substances include some acetylsalicylic compounds (e.g., aspirin) and methyl alcohol, which forms formic acid when it is metabolized.

Chronic Renal Failure. When kidney function declines markedly, there is a buildup in the body fluids of the anions of weak acids that are not being excreted by the kidneys. In addition, the decreased glomerular filtration rate reduces excretion of phosphates and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, which reduces the amount of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$added back to the body fluids. Thus, chronic renal failure can be associated with severe metabolic acidosis.

## Metabolic Alkalosis Results From Increased Extracellular Fluid $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$Concentration

Excess retention of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$or loss of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the body causes metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis is not nearly as common as metabolic acidosis, but some of the causes of metabolic alkalosis are described in the following sections.

Administration of Diuretics (Except Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors). All diuretics cause increased flow of fluid along the tubules, usually increasing flow in the distal and collecting tubules. This effect leads to increased reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from these parts of the nephrons. Because the sodium reabsorption here is coupled with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion, the enhanced sodium reabsorption also leads to an increase in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion and increase in bicarbonate reabsorption. Reductions in extracellular fluid volume associated with the use of diuretics is also generally associated with increased formation of Ang II and aldosterone, which both stimulate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption. These changes lead to the development of alkalosis, characterized by increased extracellular fluid bicarbonate concentration.

Excess Aldosterone. When large amounts of aldosterone are secreted by the adrenal glands, a mild metabolic alkalosis develops. As discussed previously, aldosterone promotes extensive reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from the distal and collecting tubules and, at the same time, stimulates secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption by the intercalated cells of the collecting tubules. This increased secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption leads to metabolic alkalosis.

Vomiting of Gastric Contents. Vomiting of the gastric contents alone, without vomiting of the lower gastrointestinal contents, causes loss of the HCl secreted by the stomach mucosa. The net result is loss of acid from the extracellular fluid and development of metabolic alkalosis. This type of alkalosis occurs especially in neonates who have pyloric stenosis caused by hypertrophied pyloric sphincter muscles.

Ingestion of Alkaline Drugs. A common cause of metabolic alkalosis is ingestion of alkaline drugs, such as sodium bicarbonate, for the treatment of gastritis or peptic ulcer.

## Treatment of Acidosis or Alkalosis

The best treatment for acidosis or alkalosis is to correct the condition that caused the abnormality. This is often difficult, especially in chronic diseases that cause impaired lung function or kidney failure. In these circumstances, various agents can be used to neutralize the excess acid or base in the extracellular fluid.

To neutralize excess acid, large amounts of sodium bicarbonate can be ingested by mouth. The sodium bicarbonate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood and increases the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$portion of the bicarbonate buffer system, thereby increasing pH toward normal. Sodium bicarbonate can also be infused intravenously but, because of the potentially dangerous physiological effects of such treatment, other substances are often used instead, such as sodium lactate and sodium gluconate. The lactate and gluconate portions of the molecules are metabolized in the body, leaving the sodium in the extracellular fluid in the form of sodium bicarbonate and thereby increasing the pH of the fluid toward normal.

For the treatment of alkalosis, ammonium chloride can be administered by mouth. When ammonium chloride is absorbed into the blood, the ammonia portion is converted by the liver into urea. This reaction liberates HCl , which immediately reacts with the buffers of the body fluids to shift the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration in the acidic direction. Ammonium chloride occasionally is infused intravenously, but $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$is highly toxic, and this procedure can be dangerous. The most appropriate treatment is to reverse the underlying cause of the alkalosis. For example, if metabolic alkalosis is associated with extracellular fluid volume depletion, but not heart failure, appropriate repletion of volume by infusion of isotonic saline solution is often beneficial in correcting the alkalosis.

## Clinical Measurements and Analysis of Acid-Base Disorders

The appropriate therapy of acid-base disorders requires proper diagnosis. The simple acid-base disorders described previously can be diagnosed by analyzing three measurements from an arterial blood sample: pH , plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration, and $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$.

The diagnosis of simple acid-base disorders involves several steps, as shown in Figure 31-10. By examining the pH , one can determine whether the disorder is acidosis or alkalosis. A pH less than 7.4 indicates acidosis, whereas a pH greater than 7.4 indicates alkalosis.

The second step is to examine the plasma $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentrations. The normal value for $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is about 40 mm Hg , and for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$it is $24 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. If the disorder has been characterized as acidosis and the plasma $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is increased, there must be a respiratory component to the acidosis. After renal compensation, the plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ concentration in respiratory acidosis would tend to increase above normal. Therefore, the expected values for a simple respiratory acidosis would be reduced plasma pH , increased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, and increased plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration after partial renal compensation.
![gu937762836d](gu937762836d.jpg)

Figure 31-10. Analysis of simple acid-base disorders. If the compensatory responses are markedly different from those shown at the bottom of the figure, one should suspect a mixed acid-base disorder.

For metabolic acidosis, there would also be a decrease in plasma pH . However, with metabolic acidosis, the primary abnormality is a decrease in plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration. Therefore, if a low pH is associated with a low $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration, there must be a metabolic component to the acidosis. In simple metabolic acidosis, the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is reduced because of partial respiratory compensation, in contrast to respiratory acidosis, in which $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is increased. Therefore, in simple metabolic acidosis, one would expect to find a low pH, a low plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$concentration, and a reduction in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ after partial respiratory compensation.

The procedures for categorizing the types of alkalosis involve the same basic steps. First, alkalosis implies that there is an increase in plasma pH . If the increase in pH is associated with decreased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, there must be a respiratory component to the alkalosis. If the rise in pH is associated with increased $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, there must be a metabolic component to the alkalosis. Therefore, in simple respiratory alkalosis, one would expect to find increased pH, decreased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, and decreased $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$concentration in the plasma. In simple metabolic alkalosis, one would expect to find increased pH , increased plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and increased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$.

## Complex Acid-Base Disorders and Use of Acid-Base Nomogram for Diagnosis

In some cases, acid-base disorders are not accompanied by appropriate compensatory responses. When this situation occurs, the abnormality is referred to as a mixed acid-base disorder, which means that there are two or more underlying causes for the acid-base disturbance. For example, a patient with a low pH would be categorized as acidotic. If the disorder was metabolically mediated, this would also be accompanied by a low plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ concentration and, after appropriate respiratory compensation, a low $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$. However, if the low plasma pH and low $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$concentration are associated with an elevated $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, one would suspect a respiratory component to the acidosis, as well as a metabolic component. Therefore, this disorder would be categorized as a mixed acidosis. This disorder could occur, for example, in a patient with acute

Figure 31-11. Acid-base nomogram showing arterial blood pH , arterial plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, and $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ values. The central open circle shows the approximate limits for acidbase status in normal people. The shaded areas in the nomogram show the approximate limits for the normal compensations caused by simple metabolic and respiratory disorders. For values lying outside the shaded areas, one should suspect a mixed acid-base disorder. (Modified from Cogan MG, Rector FC Jr: Acid-Base Disorders in the Kidney, 3rd ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1986.)
$\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$loss from the gastrointestinal tract because of diarrhea (metabolic acidosis) and emphysema (respiratory acidosis).

A convenient way to diagnose acid-base disorders is to use an acid-base nomogram, as shown in Figure 31-11. This diagram can be used to determine the type of acidosis or alkalosis, as well as its severity. In this acid-base diagram, $\mathrm{pH}, \mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration, and $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ values intersect according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The central open circle shows normal values and the deviations that can still be considered within the normal range. The shaded areas of the diagram show the $95 \%$ confidence limits for the normal compensations to simple metabolic and respiratory disorders.

When using this diagram, one must assume that sufficient time has elapsed for a full compensatory response, which is 6 to 12 hours for the ventilatory compensations in primary metabolic disorders and 3 to 5 days for the metabolic compensations in primary respiratory disorders. If a value is within the shaded area, this suggests that there is a simple acid-base disturbance. Conversely, if the values for pH , bicarbonate, or $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ lie outside the shaded area, this suggests that the patient may have a mixed acid-base disorder.

It is important to recognize that an acid-base value within the shaded area does not always mean that a simple acid-base disorder is present. With this reservation in mind, the acid-base diagrams can be used as a quick means of determining the specific type and severity of an acidbase disorder.

For example, assume that the arterial plasma from a patient yields the following values: $\mathrm{pH}, 7.30$; plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ concentration, $12.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$; and plasma $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}, 25 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. With these values, one can look at the diagram and find that this represents a simple metabolic acidosis, with appropriate respiratory compensation that reduces the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ from its normal value of 40 mm Hg to 25 mm Hg .

A second example would be a patient with the following values: $\mathrm{pH}, 7.15$; plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration, $17 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$; and plasma $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}, 50 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. In this example, the patient is acidotic, and there appears to be a metabolic component because the plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration is lower than the normal value of $24 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$. However, the respiratory compensation that would normally reduce $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is absent and $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is slightly increased above the normal value of 40 mm Hg . This finding is consistent with a mixed acid-base disturbance consisting of metabolic acidosis, as well as a respiratory component.

The acid-base nomogram serves as a quick way to assess the type and severity of disorders that may be contributing to abnormal $\mathrm{pH}, \mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, and plasma bicarbonate concentrations. In a clinical setting, the patient's history and other physical findings also provide important clues concerning the causes and treatment of the acid-base disorders.

## Use of Anion Gap to Diagnose Acid-Base Disorders

The concentrations of anions and cations in plasma must be equal to maintain electrical neutrality. Therefore, there is no real anion gap in the plasma. However, only certain cations and anions are routinely measured in the clinical laboratory. The cation normally measured is $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and the anions are usually $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$. The anion gap-which is only a diagnostic concept - is the difference between unmeasured anions and unmeasured cations and is estimated as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Plasma anion gap } & =\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]-\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]-\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right] \\
& =144-24-108=12 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}
\end{aligned}
$$

The anion gap will increase if unmeasured anions rise or if unmeasured cations fall. The most important unmeasured cations include calcium, magnesium, and potassium, and the major unmeasured anions are albumin, phosphate, sulfate, and other organic anions. Usually, the unmeasured anions exceed the unmeasured cations, and the anion gap ranges between 8 and $16 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$.

Table 31-4 Metabolic Acidosis Associated With Normal or Increased Plasma Anion Gap

| Increased Anion Gap <br> (Normochloremia) | Normal Anion Gap <br> (Hyperchloremia) |
| :-- | :-- |
| Diabetes mellitus (ketoacidosis) | Diarrhea |
| Lactic acidosis | Renal tubular acidosis |
| Chronic renal failure | Carbonic anhydrase <br> inhibitors |
| Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) <br> poisoning | Addison disease |
| Methanol poisoning |  |
| Ethylene glycol poisoning |  |
| Starvation |  |

The plasma anion gap is used mainly in diagnosing different causes of metabolic acidosis. In metabolic acidosis, plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$concentration is reduced. If plasma sodium concentration is unchanged, the concentration of anions $\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right.$or an unmeasured anion) increases to maintain electroneutrality. If plasma $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$increases in proportion to the fall in plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, the anion gap will remain normal. This is often referred to as hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

If the decrease in plasma $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is not accompanied by increased $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, there must be increased levels of unmeasured anions and therefore an increase in the calculated anion gap. Metabolic acidosis caused by excess nonvolatile acids (besides HCl ), such as lactic acid or ketoacids, is associated with an increased plasma anion gap because the fall in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is not matched by an equal increase in $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Some examples of metabolic acidosis associated with a normal or increased anion gap are shown in Table 31-4. By calculating the anion gap, one can narrow some of the potential causes of metabolic acidosis.

# Diuretics and Kidney Diseases 

## DIURETICS AND THEIR MECHANISMS OF ACTION

Diuretics increase the rate of urine volume output, as the name implies. Most diuretics also increase the urinary excretion of solutes, especially sodium and chloride. In fact, most diuretics that are used clinically act by decreasing renal tubular sodium reabsorption, which causes natriuresis (increased sodium output), in turn causing diuresis (increased water output). That is, in most cases, increased water excretion occurs secondary to inhibition of tubular sodium reabsorption because sodium remaining in the tubules acts osmotically to decrease water reabsorption. Because renal tubular reabsorption of many solutes, such as potassium, chloride, magnesium, and calcium, is also influenced secondarily by sodium reabsorption, many diuretics raise the renal excretion of these solutes as well.

The most common clinical use of diuretics is to reduce extracellular fluid volume, especially in diseases associated with edema and in hypertension. As discussed in Chapter 25, loss of sodium from the body mainly decreases extracellular fluid volume; therefore, diuretics are usually administered in clinical conditions in which extracellular fluid volume is expanded.

Some diuretics can increase urine output more than 20 -fold within a few minutes after they are administered. However, the effect of most diuretics on renal output of salt and water subsides within a few days due to activation of compensatory mechanisms initiated by decreased extracellular fluid volume (Figure 32-1). For example, a decrease in extracellular fluid volume may reduce arterial pressure and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increase renin secretion and angiotensin II (Ang II) formation; all these responses together eventually override the chronic effects of the diuretic on urine output. Thus, in the steady state, urine output becomes equal to intake, but only after reductions in arterial pressure and extracellular fluid volume have occurred, relieving the hypertension or edema that prompted the use of diuretics in the first place.

The many diuretics available for clinical use have different mechanisms of action and, therefore, inhibit tubular reabsorption at different sites along the renal nephron.

The general classes of diuretics, their mechanisms of action, and their tubular sites of action are shown in Table 32-1.

## Osmotic Diuretics Decrease Water Reabsorption by Increasing Osmotic Pressure of Tubular Fluid

Injection of substances into the blood stream that are filtered by the glomerular capillaries but are not easily reabsorbed by the renal tubules, such as urea, mannitol, and sucrose, causes a marked increase in the concentration of osmotically active molecules in the tubules. The osmotic pressure of these solutes then reduces water reabsorption, flushing large amounts of tubular fluid into the urine.

Large volumes of urine are also formed in certain diseases associated with excess solutes that fail to be reabsorbed from the tubular fluid. For example, when blood glucose concentration rises to high levels in diabetes mellitus, the increased filtered load of glucose into the tubules exceeds their capacity to reabsorb glucose (i.e., exceeds their transport maximum for glucose). Above a plasma glucose concentration of about $250 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$, little of the extra glucose is reabsorbed by the tubules; instead, the excess glucose remains in the tubules, acts as an osmotic diuretic, and increases urine flow rate. Therefore, one of the hallmarks of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is polyuria (frequent urination), which is balanced by a high level of fluid intake (polydipsia) secondary to dehydration, increased extracellular fluid osmolarity, and activation of the thirst mechanism.

## Loop Diuretics Decrease Sodium-ChloridePotassium Reabsorption in the Thick Ascending Loop of Henle

Furosemide, ethacrynic acid, and bumetanide are powerful diuretics that decrease reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle by blocking the 1 -sodium, 2 -chloride, 1-potassium co-transporter located in the luminal membrane of the epithelial cells (see Figure 289). These loop diuretics are among the most powerful of the clinically used diuretics.

By blocking sodium-chloride-potassium co-transport in the luminal membrane of the loop of Henle, the loop diuretics increase urine output of sodium, chloride, potassium, and other electrolytes, as well as water, for two reasons: (1) they greatly increase the quantities of solutes delivered to the distal parts of the nephrons, and these solutes act as osmotic agents to prevent water reabsorption; and (2) they disrupt the countercurrent multiplier system by decreasing absorption of ions from the loop of Henle into the medullary interstitium, thereby decreasing the osmolarity of the medullary interstitial fluid. Therefore, loop diuretics impair the ability of

If sodium intake is held constant, compensatory mechanisms will eventually return sodium excretion to equal sodium intake, thus re-establishing sodium balance.
the kidneys to concentrate or dilute the urine. Urinary dilution is impaired because the inhibition of sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle causes more of these ions to be excreted, along with increased water excretion. Urine concentrating ability is impaired because the renal medullary interstitial fluid concentration of these ions, and therefore renal medullary osmolarity, is reduced. Consequently, reabsorption of fluid from the collecting ducts is decreased, so the maximal concentrating ability of the kidneys is also greatly reduced. In addition, decreased renal medullary interstitial fluid osmolarity reduces reabsorption of water from the descending loop of Henle. Because of these multiple effects, $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ of the glomerular filtrate may be delivered into the urine, causing urine output, under acute conditions, to be as great as 25 times normal for at least a few minutes.

## Thiazide Diuretics Inhibit SodiumChloride Reabsorption in the Early Distal Tubule

The thiazide derivatives, such as chlorothiazide, act mainly on the early distal tubules to block the sodiumchloride co-transporter in the luminal membrane of the tubular cells (see Figure 28-10). Under favorable conditions, these agents may cause a maximum of $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the glomerular filtrate to pass into the urine, which is about the same amount of sodium normally reabsorbed by the distal tubules.

## Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Block Sodium Bicarbonate Reabsorption

Acetazolamide inhibits the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which is critical for reabsorption of bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$in the renal tubules, as discussed in Chapter 31. Carbonic anhydrase is especially abundant in the proximal tubule, the primary site of action of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Some carbonic anhydrase is also present in other tubular cells, such as in the intercalated cells of the collecting tubule.

Table 32-1 Classes of Diuretics, Their Mechanisms of Action, and Tubular Sites of Action

| Class of Diuretic (examples) | Mechanism of Action | Tubular Site of Action |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Osmotic diuretics (mannitol) | Inhibit water and solute reabsorption by increasing osmolarity of tubular fluid | Mainly proximal tubules |
| Loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide) | Inhibit $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}-\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$co-transport in luminal membrane | Thick ascending loop of Henle |
| Thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone) | Inhibit $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$co-transport in luminal membrane | Early distal tubules |
| Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide) | Inhibit $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$reabsorption, which reduces $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption | Mainly proximal tubules |
| Aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone) | Inhibit action of aldosterone on tubular receptor, decrease $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, decrease $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion | Collecting tubules |
| Sodium channel blockers (triamterene, amiloride) | Block entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$into $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels of luminal membrane, decrease $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption, decrease $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion | Collecting tubules |

Because hydrogen ion $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$secretion and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ reabsorption in the proximal tubules are coupled to sodium reabsorption through the sodium-hydrogen ion counter-transport mechanism in the luminal membrane, decreasing $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$reabsorption also reduces sodium reabsorption. The blockage of sodium and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$reabsorption from the tubular fluid causes these ions to remain in the tubules and act as an osmotic diuretic. Predictably, a disadvantage of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is that they cause some degree of acidosis because of the excessive loss of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in the urine.

## Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists Decrease Sodium Reabsorption From and Potassium Secretion Into the Collecting Tubules

Spironolactone and eplerenone are mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists that compete with aldosterone for receptor-binding sites in the collecting tubule and collecting duct epithelial cells and, therefore, can decrease the reabsorption of sodium and secretion of potassium in these tubular segments (see Figure 28-12). As a consequence, sodium remains in the tubules and acts as an osmotic diuretic, causing increased excretion of water, as well as sodium. Because these drugs also block the effect of aldosterone to promote potassium secretion in the tubules, they decrease the excretion of potassium.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists also cause movement of potassium from the cells to the extracellular fluid. In some cases, this movement causes extracellular fluid potassium concentration to increase excessively. For this reason, spironolactone and other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are referred to as potassium-sparing diuretics. Many of the other diuretics cause loss of potassium in the urine, in contrast to the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which spare the loss of potassium.

## Sodium Channel Blockers Decrease Sodium Reabsorption in the Collecting Tubules

Amiloride and triamterene also inhibit sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion in the collecting tubules, similar to the effects of spironolactone. However, at the cellular level, these drugs act directly to block the entry of sodium into the sodium channels of the luminal membrane of the collecting tubule epithelial cells (see Figure 28-12). Because of this decreased sodium entry into the epithelial cells, there is also decreased sodium transport across the cells' basolateral membranes and, therefore, decreased activity of the sodium-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase pump ( $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump). This decreased activity reduces the transport of potassium into the cells and ultimately decreases the secretion of potassium into the tubular fluid. For this reason, the sodium channel blockers are also potassium-sparing diuretics and decrease the urinary excretion rate of potassium.

## KIDNEY DISEASES

Diseases of the kidneys are among the most important causes of death and disability in many countries throughout the world. For example, in 2018, more than $14 \%$ of adults in the United States, or more than 30 million people, were estimated to have chronic kidney disease, and many more millions have acute renal injury or less severe forms of kidney dysfunction.

Severe kidney diseases can be divided into two main categories:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI), in which there is an abrupt loss of kidney function within a few days. The term acute renal failure is usually reserved for severe acute kidney injury, in which the kidneys may abruptly stop working entirely or almost entirely, necessitating renal replacement therapy such as dialysis, as discussed later in this chapter. In some cases, patients with AKI may eventually recover nearly normal kidney function.
2. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), in which there is progressive loss of function of more and more nephrons that gradually decreases overall kidney function.
Within these two general categories, there are many specific kidney diseases that can affect the kidney blood vessels, glomeruli, tubules, renal interstitium, and parts of the urinary tract outside the kidney, including the ureters and bladder. In this chapter, we discuss specific physiologic abnormalities that occur in a few of the more important types of kidney diseases.

## ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY

The causes of AKI are often divided into three main categories:

1. AKI resulting from decreased blood supply to the kidneys. This condition is often referred to as prerenal $A K I$ to reflect an abnormality originating outside the kidneys. For example, prerenal AKI can be a consequence of heart failure with reduced cardiac output and low blood pressure or conditions associated with diminished blood volume and low blood pressure, such as severe hemorrhage.
2. Intrarenal AKI resulting from abnormalities within the kidney itself, including those that affect the blood vessels, glomeruli, or tubules.
3. Postrenal AKI, resulting from obstruction of the urinary collecting system anywhere from the calyces to the outflow from the bladder. The most common causes of obstruction of the urinary tract outside the kidney are kidney stones, caused by precipitation of calcium, urate, or cystine.
In some important causes of AKI, such as sepsis, prerenal (e.g., reduced blood pressure) and intrarenal (endothelial and tubular injury) abnormalities may occur simultaneously.

## PRERENAL ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY CAUSED BY DECREASED BLOOD FLOW TO THE KIDNEY

The kidneys normally receive an abundant blood supply of about $1100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, or about $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of the cardiac output. The main purpose of this high blood flow to the kidneys is to provide enough plasma for the high rates of glomerular filtration needed for effective regulation of body fluid volumes and solute concentrations. Therefore, decreased renal blood flow is usually accompanied by decreased GFR and decreased urine output of water and solutes. Consequently, conditions that acutely diminish blood flow to the kidneys usually cause oliguria, which refers to diminished urine output below the level of intake of water and solutes. This condition causes accumulation of water and solutes in the body fluids. If renal blood flow is markedly reduced, total cessation of urine output can occur, a condition referred to as anuria.

As long as renal blood flow does not fall below about $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of normal, AKI can usually be reversed if the cause of the ischemia is corrected before damage to the renal cells has occurred. Unlike some tissues, the kidney can endure a relatively large reduction in blood flow before there is major damage to the renal cells. The reason for this phenomenon is that as renal blood flow is reduced, the GFR and amount of sodium chloride filtered by the glomeruli (as well as the filtration rate of water and other electrolytes) are reduced. This decreases the amount of sodium chloride that must be reabsorbed by the tubules, which use most of the energy and oxygen consumed by the normal kidney. Therefore, as renal blood flow and GFR fall, renal oxygen consumption is also reduced. As the GFR approaches zero, oxygen consumption of the kidney approaches the rate that is required to keep the renal tubular cells alive when they are not reabsorbing sodium. When blood flow is reduced below this basal requirement, which is usually less than $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of the normal renal blood flow, the renal cells become hypoxic, and further decreases in renal blood flow, if prolonged, will cause damage or even death of the renal cells, especially the tubular epithelial cells.

If the cause of prerenal AKI is not corrected, and ischemia of the kidney persists longer than a few hours, this type of renal failure can evolve into intrarenal AKI, as discussed later. Acute reduction of renal blood flow is a common cause of AKI in hospitalized patients, especially those who have sustained severe injuries. Table 322 shows some of the common causes of decreased renal blood flow and prerenal AKI.

## INTRARENAL ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY CAUSED BY ABNORMALITIES IN THE KIDNEY

Abnormalities that originate in the kidney and that abruptly diminish urine output fall into the general category of intrarenal AKI. This category of AKI can be

```

further divided into the following: (1) conditions that injure the glomerular capillaries or other small renal vessels; (2) conditions that damage the renal tubular epithelium; and (3) conditions that cause damage to the renal interstitium. This type of classification refers to the primary site of injury, but because the renal vasculature and tubular system are functionally interdependent, damage to the renal blood vessels can lead to tubular damage, and primary tubular damage can lead to damage of the renal blood vessels. Some causes of intrarenal acute kidney injury are listed in Table 32-3.

## Acute Kidney Injury Caused by Glomerulonephritis

Acute glomerulonephritis is a type of intrarenal AKI usually caused by an abnormal immune reaction that damages the glomeruli. In about $95 \%$ of patients with this disease, damage to the glomeruli occurs 1 to 3 weeks after an infection elsewhere in the body, often caused by

certain types of group A beta streptococci. The infection may have been a streptococcal sore throat, streptococcal tonsillitis, or even streptococcal infection of the skin. It is not the infection itself that damages the kidneys. Instead, over a few weeks, as antibodies develop against the streptococcal antigen, the antibodies and antigen react with each other to form an insoluble immune complex that becomes entrapped in the glomeruli, especially in the basement membrane portion of the glomeruli.

Once the immune complex has been deposited in the glomeruli, many of the glomerular cells begin to proliferate, but mainly the mesangial cells that lie between the endothelium and epithelium. In addition, large numbers of white blood cells become entrapped in the glomeruli. Many of the glomeruli become blocked by this inflammatory reaction, and those that are not blocked usually become excessively permeable, allowing protein and red blood cells to leak from the blood of the glomerular capillaries into the glomerular filtrate. In severe cases, total or almost complete renal shutdown occurs.

The acute inflammation of the glomeruli usually subsides in about 2 weeks and, in most patients, the kidneys return to almost normal function within the next few weeks to few months. Sometimes, however, many of the glomeruli are destroyed beyond repair and, in a small percentage of patients, progressive renal deterioration continues indefinitely, leading to CKD, as described in a subsequent section of this chapter.

## Tubular Necrosis as a Cause of Acute Kidney Injury

Another cause of intrarenal acute renal failure is tubular necrosis, which means destruction of epithelial cells in the tubules. Some common causes of tubular necrosis are as follows: (1) severe ischemia and inadequate supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tubular epithelial cells; and (2) poisons, toxins, or medications that destroy the tubular epithelial cells.

Acute Tubular Necrosis Caused by Severe Renal Ischemia. Severe ischemia of the kidney can result from circulatory shock or other disturbances that severely impair the blood supply to the kidneys. If the ischemia is severe enough to seriously impair the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the renal tubular epithelial cells, and if the insult is prolonged, damage or eventual destruction of the epithelial cells can occur. When this damage occurs, tubular cells slough off and plug many of the nephrons so that there is no urine output from the blocked nephrons; the affected nephrons often fail to excrete urine, even when renal blood flow is restored to normal, as long as the tubules remain plugged. The most common causes of ischemic damage to the tubular epithelium are the prerenal causes of AKI associated with circulatory shock, as discussed earlier in this chapter.

Acute Tubular Necrosis Caused by Toxins or Medications. There is a long list of renal poisons and medications that can damage the tubular epithelium and cause AKI.

Some of these substances are carbon tetrachloride, heavy metals (e.g., mercury and lead), ethylene glycol (which is a major component in antifreeze), various insecticides, some medications (e.g., tetracyclines) used as antibiotics, and cis-platinum, used in treating certain cancers. Each of these substances has a specific toxic action on the renal tubular epithelial cells, causing death of many of them. As a result, the epithelial cells slough away from the basement membrane and plug the tubules. In some cases, the basement membrane also is destroyed. If the basement membrane remains intact, new tubular epithelial cells can grow along the surface of the membrane, so the tubule may repair itself within 10 to 20 days.

## POSTRENAL ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY CAUSED BY ABNORMALITIES OF THE LOWER URINARY TRACT

Multiple abnormalities in the lower urinary tract can block or partially block urine flow and therefore lead to AKI, even when the kidneys' blood supply and other functions are initially normal. If the urine output of only one kidney is diminished, no major change in body fluid composition will occur because the contralateral kidney can increase its urine output sufficiently to maintain relatively normal levels of extracellular electrolytes and solutes, as well as normal extracellular fluid volume. With this type of renal injury, normal kidney function can be restored if the basic cause of the problem is corrected within a few hours. However, chronic obstruction of the urinary tract that lasts for several days or weeks can lead to irreversible kidney damage. Some of the causes of postrenal AKI include the following: (1) bilateral obstruction of the ureters or renal pelvises caused by large stones or blood clots; (2) bladder obstruction; and (3) obstruction of the urethra.

## PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY

A major physiological effect of AKI is the retention of water, waste products of metabolism, and electrolytes in the blood and extracellular fluid. This can lead to water and salt overload, which, in turn, can lead to edema and hypertension. Excessive retention of potassium, however, is often a more serious threat to patients with AKI because increases in the plasma potassium concentration (hyperkalemia) above $8 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ (only twice normal) can be fatal. Because the kidneys are also unable to excrete sufficient hydrogen ions, patients with AKI may experience metabolic acidosis, which in itself can be lethal or can aggravate the hyperkalemia.

In the most severe cases of AKI, complete anuria occurs. The patient will die in 8 to 14 days unless kidney function is restored or unless an artificial kidney is used to rid the body of the excessive retained water, electrolytes, and waste products of metabolism. Other effects of diminished urine output, as well as treatment with an artificial kidney, are discussed in the next section in relation to CKD.

## CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH IRREVERSIBLE LOSS OF FUNCTIONAL NEPHRONS

CKD is usually defined as the presence of kidney damage or decreased kidney function that persists for at least 3 months. CKD is often associated with progressive and irreversible loss of large numbers of functioning nephrons. Serious clinical symptoms usually do not occur until the number of functional nephrons falls to at least $70 \%$ to $75 \%$ below normal. In fact, relatively normal blood concentrations of most electrolytes and normal body fluid volumes can still be maintained until the number of functioning nephrons decreases below $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of normal.

Table 32-4 lists some of the most important causes of CKD. In general, CKD, like AKI, can occur because of disorders of the blood vessels, glomeruli, tubules, renal interstitium, and lower urinary tract. Despite the wide variety of diseases that can lead to CKD, the end result is essentially the same-a decrease in the number of functional nephrons.

## VICIOUS CYCLE OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE LEADING TO END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE

In some cases, an initial insult to the kidney leads to progressive deterioration of kidney function and further loss of nephrons to the point where the person must
![gu967762836d](gu967762836d.jpg)

Figure 32-2. Shown is the vicious cycle that can occur with primary kidney disease. Loss of nephrons because of disease may increase pressure and flow in the surviving glomerular capillaries, which in turn may eventually injure these normal capillaries as well, thus causing progressive sclerosis and eventual loss of these glomeruli.
undergo dialysis treatment or transplantation with a functional kidney to survive. This condition is referred to as end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Experimental studies have shown that surgical removal of large portions of the kidney initially causes adaptive changes in the remaining nephrons, which lead to increased blood flow, increased GFR, and increased urine output in the surviving nephrons. The exact mechanisms responsible for these changes are not well understood but involve hypertrophy (growth of the various structures of the surviving nephrons), as well as functional changes that decrease vascular resistance and tubular reabsorption in the surviving nephrons. These adaptive changes permit a person to excrete normal amounts of water and solutes, even when kidney mass is reduced to $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of normal. Over a period of several years, however, these renal adaptive changes may lead to further injury of the remaining nephrons, particularly to the glomeruli of these nephrons.

This progressive injury may be related in part to increased pressure or stretch of the remaining glomeruli, which occurs as a result of functional vasodilation of afferent arterioles or increased blood pressure. The chronic increase in pressure and stretch of the small arterioles and glomeruli are believed to cause injury and sclerosis of these vessels (replacement of normal tissue with connective tissue). These sclerotic lesions can eventually obliterate the glomerulus, leading to further reduction in kidney function, further adaptive changes in the remaining nephrons, and a slowly progressing vicious cycle that eventually terminates in ESRD (Figure 32-2). The most effective method of slowing down this progressive loss of kidney function is to lower arterial pressure and glomerular

hydrostatic pressure, especially by using drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or Ang II receptor antagonists.

Table 32-5 lists the most common causes of ESRD. In the early 1980s, glomerulonephritis in all its various forms was believed to be the most common initiating cause of ESRD. More recently, diabetes mellitus and hypertension have become recognized as the leading causes of ESRD, together accounting for more than $70 \%$ of all ESRD.

Excessive weight gain (obesity) appears to be the most important risk factor for the two main causes of ESRDdiabetes and hypertension. As discussed in Chapter 79, type 2 diabetes, which is closely linked to obesity, accounts for more than $90 \%$ of all cases of diabetes mellitus. Excess weight gain is also a major cause of essential hypertension, accounting for $65 \%$ to $75 \%$ of the risk for developing hypertension in adults. In addition to causing renal injury through diabetes and hypertension, obesity may have additive or synergistic effects to worsen renal function in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.

## INJURY TO RENAL BLOOD VESSELS AS A CAUSE OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Many types of vascular lesions can lead to renal ischemia and death of kidney tissue. The most common of these lesions are the following: (1) atherosclerosis of the larger renal arteries, with progressive sclerotic constriction of the vessels; (2) fibromuscular hyperplasia of one or more of the large arteries, which also causes occlusion of the vessels; and (3) nephrosclerosis, caused by sclerotic lesions of the smaller arteries, arterioles, and glomeruli.

Atherosclerotic or hyperplastic lesions of the large arteries frequently affect one kidney more than the other and, therefore, cause unilaterally diminished kidney function. As discussed in Chapter 19, hypertension often occurs when the artery of one kidney is constricted while the artery of the other kidney is still normal, a condition analogous to so-called two-kidney Goldblatt hypertension.

Benign nephrosclerosis, the most common form of kidney disease, is seen to at least some extent in about $70 \%$ of postmortem examinations in people who die after the age of 60 years. This type of vascular lesion occurs in the smaller interlobular arteries and in the afferent arterioles of the kidney. It is believed to begin with leakage of plasma
![gu977762836d](gu977762836d.jpg)

Figure 32-3. Effect of aging on the number of functional glomeruli.
through the intimal membrane of these vessels. This leakage causes fibrinoid deposits to develop in the medial layers of these vessels, followed by progressive thickening of the vessel wall that eventually constricts the vessels and, in some cases, occludes them. Because there is essentially no collateral circulation among the smaller renal arteries, occlusion of one or more of them causes destruction of a comparable number of nephrons. Therefore, much of the kidney tissue becomes replaced by small amounts of fibrous tissue. When sclerosis occurs in the glomeruli, the injury is referred to as glomerulosclerosis.

Nephrosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis occur to some extent in most people after the fourth decade of life, causing about a $10 \%$ decrease in the number of functional nephrons for every 10 years after the age of 40 years (Figure 32-3). This loss of glomeruli and overall nephron function is reflected by a progressive decrease in renal blood flow and GFR. Even in healthy people without underlying hypertension or diabetes, renal plasma flow and GFR may decrease by $40 \%$ to $50 \%$ by the age of 80 years.

The frequency and severity of nephrosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis are greatly increased by concurrent hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Thus, benign nephrosclerosis in association with severe hypertension can lead to a rapidly progressing malignant nephrosclerosis. The characteristic histological features of malignant nephrosclerosis include large amounts of fibrinoid deposits in the arterioles and progressive thickening of the vessels, with severe ischemia occurring in the affected nephrons. For unknown reasons, the incidence of malignant nephrosclerosis and severe glomerulosclerosis is significantly higher in blacks than in whites of similar ages who have similar degrees of severity of hypertension or diabetes.

## INJURY TO THE GLOMERULI AS A CAUSE OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE—GLOMERULONEPHRITIS

Chronic glomerulonephritis can be caused by several diseases that cause inflammation and damage to the glomerular capillary loops of the kidneys. In contrast to the acute form of this disease, chronic glomerulonephritis is a

slowly progressive disease that often leads to irreversible renal failure. It may be a primary kidney disease, following acute glomerulonephritis, or it may be secondary to a systemic disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

In most cases, chronic glomerulonephritis begins with accumulation of precipitated antigen-antibody complexes in the glomerular membrane. In contrast to acute glomerulonephritis, streptococcal infections account for only a small percentage of patients with the chronic form of glomerulonephritis. Accumulation of antigenantibody complex in the glomerular membranes causes inflammation, progressive thickening of the membranes, and eventual invasion of the glomeruli by fibrous tissue. In later stages of the disease, the glomerular capillary filtration coefficient becomes greatly reduced because of decreased numbers of filtering capillaries in the glomerular tufts and because of thickened glomerular membranes. In the final stages of the disease, many glomeruli are replaced by fibrous tissue and are unable to filter fluid.

## INJURY TO THE RENAL INTERSTITIUM AS A CAUSE OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASEINTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS

Primary or secondary disease of the renal interstitium is referred to as interstitial nephritis. In general, this condition can result from vascular, glomerular, or tubular damage that destroys individual nephrons, or it can involve primary damage to the renal interstitium by poisons, drugs, and bacterial infections.

Renal interstitial injury caused by bacterial infection is called pyelonephritis. The infection can result from different types of bacteria but especially from Escherichia coli, which originate from fecal contamination of the urinary tract. These bacteria reach the kidneys either by way of the blood stream or, more commonly, by ascension from the lower urinary tract via the ureters to the kidneys.

Although the normal bladder is able to clear bacteria readily, there are two general clinical conditions that may interfere with the normal flushing of bacteria from the bladder: (1) the inability of the bladder to empty completely, leaving residual urine in the bladder; and (2) obstruction of urine outflow. With impaired ability to flush bacteria from the bladder, the bacteria multiply, and the bladder becomes inflamed, a condition termed cystitis. Once cystitis occurs, it may remain localized without ascending to the kidney or, in some people, bacteria may reach the renal pelvis because of a pathological condition in which urine is propelled up one or both of the ureters during micturition. This condition is called vesicoureteral reflux and is due to failure of the bladder wall to occlude the ureter during micturition; as a result, some of the urine is propelled upward toward the kidney, carrying with it bacteria that can reach the renal pelvis and renal medulla, where they can initiate infection and inflammation associated with pyelonephritis.

Pyelonephritis begins in the renal medulla and therefore usually affects the function of the medulla more than it affects the cortex, at least in the initial stages. Because
one of the primary functions of the medulla is to provide the countercurrent mechanism for concentrating urine, patients with pyelonephritis frequently have markedly impaired ability to concentrate the urine.

With long-standing pyelonephritis, invasion of the kidneys by bacteria not only causes damage to the renal medulla interstitium but also progressive damage of renal tubules, glomeruli, and other structures throughout the kidney. Consequently, large parts of functional renal tissue are lost, and CKD can develop.

## NEPHROTIC SYNDROME-EXCRETION OF PROTEIN IN THE URINE

Nephrotic syndrome, characterized by the loss of large quantities of plasma proteins into the urine, develops in many patients with kidney disease. In some cases, this syndrome occurs without evidence of other major abnormalities of kidney function, but it is usually associated with some degree of CKD.

The cause of the protein loss in the urine is usually increased permeability of the glomerular membrane. Therefore, any disease that increases the permeability of this membrane can cause the nephrotic syndrome. Such diseases include the following: (1) chronic glomerulonephritis, which affects primarily the glomeruli and often causes greatly increased permeability of the glomerular membrane; (2) amyloidosis, which results from deposition of an abnormal proteinoid substance in the walls of the blood vessels and seriously damages the basement membrane of the glomeruli; and (3) minimal-change nephrotic syndrome, which is associated with no major abnormality in the glomerular capillary membrane that can be detected with light microscopy. As discussed in Chapter 27, minimalchange nephropathy has been associated with an abnormal immune response and increased T-cell secretion of cytokines that cause podocyte injury and increased permeability to lower molecular weight proteins, such as albumin.

Minimal-change nephropathy can occur in adults, but more frequently it occurs in children between the ages of 2 and 6 years. Increased permeability of the glomerular capillary membrane occasionally allows as much as 40 grams of plasma protein loss into the urine each day, which is an extreme amount for a young child. Therefore, the child's plasma protein concentration often falls below $2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$, and the colloid osmotic pressure falls from a normal value of 28 mm Hg to less than 10 mm Hg . As a consequence of this low colloid osmotic pressure in the plasma, large amounts of fluid leak from the capillaries all over the body into most of the tissues, causing severe edema, as discussed in Chapter 25.

## NEPHRON FUNCTION IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Loss of Functional Nephrons Requires Surviving Nephrons to Excrete More Water and Solutes. It would be reasonable to suspect that decreasing the number of

![gu987762836d](gu987762836d.jpg)

Figure 32-4. Effect of reducing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by $50 \%$ on the serum creatinine concentration and creatinine excretion rate when the production rate of creatinine remains constant.
functional nephrons, which reduces the GFR, would also cause major decreases in renal excretion of water and solutes. Yet, patients who have lost up to $75 \%$ to $80 \%$ of their nephrons are able to excrete normal amounts of water and electrolytes without serious accumulation of fluid or most electrolytes in the body fluids. Further reduction in the number of nephrons, however, leads to electrolyte and fluid retention, and death usually ensues when the number of nephrons falls below $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of normal.

In contrast to the electrolytes, many of the waste products of metabolism, such as urea and creatinine, accumulate almost in proportion to the number of nephrons that have been destroyed. The reason for this is that substances such as creatinine and urea depend largely on glomerular filtration for their excretion, and they are not reabsorbed as avidly as the electrolytes. Creatinine, for example, is not reabsorbed at all, and the excretion rate is approximately equal to the rate at which it is filtered (neglecting the small amount that is secreted):

## Creatinine filtration rate <br> $=$ GFR $\times$ Plasma creatinine concentration <br> $=$ Creatinine excretion rate

Therefore, if GFR decreases, creatinine excretion rate also transiently decreases, causing accumulation of creatinine in the body fluids and raising plasma concentration
![gu997762836d](gu997762836d.jpg)

Figure 32-5. Representative patterns of adaptation for different types of solutes in chronic renal failure. Curve $A$ shows the approximate changes in the plasma concentrations of solutes such as creatinine and urea that are filtered and poorly reabsorbed. Curve $B$ shows the approximate concentrations for solutes such as phosphate, urate, and hydrogen ion. Curve $C$ shows the approximate concentrations for solutes such as sodium and chloride.
until excretion rate of creatinine returns to normalthe same rate at which creatinine is produced in the body (Figure 32-4). Thus, under steady-state conditions, creatinine excretion rate equals the rate of creatinine production, despite reductions in GFR; however, this normal rate of creatinine excretion occurs at the expense of an elevated plasma creatinine concentration, as shown in curve A of Figure 32-4.

Some solutes, such as phosphate, urate, and hydrogen ions, are often maintained near the normal range until GFR falls below $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ of normal. Thereafter, the plasma concentrations of these substances rise, but not in proportion to the fall in GFR, as shown in curve B of Figure 32-5. Maintenance of relatively constant plasma concentrations of these solutes as GFR declines is accomplished by excreting progressively larger fractions of the amounts of these solutes that are filtered at the glomerular capillaries; this occurs by decreasing the rate of tubular reabsorption or, in some cases, by increasing tubular secretion rates.

In the case of sodium and chloride ions, their plasma concentrations are maintained virtually constant, even with severe decreases in GFR (see curve C of Figure 32-5). This maintenance is accomplished by greatly decreasing tubular reabsorption of these electrolytes.

For example, with a $75 \%$ loss of functional nephrons, each surviving nephron must excrete four times as much sodium and four times as much volume as under normal conditions (Table 32-6). Part of this adaptation occurs because of increased blood flow and increased GFR in each of the surviving nephrons due to hypertrophy of the

blood vessels and glomeruli, as well as functional changes that cause the blood vessels to dilate. Even with large decreases in the total GFR, normal rates of renal excretion can still be maintained by decreasing the rate at which the tubules reabsorb water and solutes.

Isosthenuria-Inability of the Kidney to Concentrate or Dilute the Urine. One important effect of the rapid rate of tubular flow that occurs in the remaining nephrons of diseased kidneys is that the renal tubules lose their ability to concentrate or dilute the urine fully. The concentrating ability of the kidney is impaired mainly because of the following: (1) the rapid flow of tubular fluid through the collecting ducts prevents adequate water reabsorption; and (2) the rapid flow through both the loop of Henle and collecting ducts prevents the countercurrent mechanism from operating effectively to concentrate the medullary interstitial fluid solutes. Therefore, as progressively more nephrons are destroyed, the maximum concentrating ability of the kidney declines, and urine osmolarity and specific gravity approach the osmolarity and specific gravity of the glomerular filtrate, as shown in Figure 32-6.

The diluting mechanism in the kidney is also impaired when the number of nephrons decreases markedly because the rapid flushing of fluid through the loops of Henle and high load of solutes such as urea cause a relatively high solute concentration in the tubular fluid of this part of the nephron. As a consequence, the diluting capacity of the

kidney is impaired, and the minimal urine osmolality and specific gravity approach those of the glomerular filtrate. Because the concentrating mechanism becomes impaired to a greater extent than the diluting mechanism in CKD, an important clinical test of renal function is to determine how well the kidneys can concentrate urine when a person's water intake is restricted for 12 or more hours.

## Effects of Renal Failure on the Body Fluids-Uremia

The effect of CKD on the body fluids depends on the following: (1) water and food intake; and (2) the degree of impairment of renal function. Assuming that a person with complete renal failure continues to ingest the same amounts of water and food, the concentrations of different substances in the extracellular fluid would change, as shown in Figure 32-7. Important effects include: (1) generalized edema resulting from water and salt retention; (2) acidosis resulting from failure of the kidneys to rid the body of normal acidic products; (3) high concentration of the nonprotein nitrogens-especially urea, creatinine, and uric acid-resulting from failure of the body to excrete the metabolic end products of proteins; and (4) high concentrations of other substances excreted by the kidney, including phenols, sulfates, phosphates, potassium, and guanidine bases. This total condition is called uremia because of the high concentration of urea in the body fluids.

Water Retention and Development of Edema in Chronic Kidney Disease. If water intake is restricted immediately after acute kidney injury begins, the total body fluid content may become only slightly increased. If fluid intake is not limited, and the patient drinks in response to the normal thirst mechanisms, the body fluids begin to increase rapidly.

As long as salt and fluid intake are not excessive, accumulation of fluid in CKD may not be severe until kidney function falls to $25 \%$ of normal or lower. The reason for this, as discussed previously, is that the surviving nephrons excrete larger amounts of salt and water. Even the small fluid retention that does occur, along with increased secretion of renin and Ang II formation that usually occurs in ischemic kidney disease, often causes severe hypertension. When kidney function so reduced that dialysis is required to preserve life, hypertension almost invariably develops.

In many of these patients, severe reduction of salt intake or removal of extracellular fluid by dialysis can control the hypertension. Some patients continue to have hypertension, even after excess sodium has been removed by dialysis. In this group, removal of the ischemic kidneys usually corrects the hypertension (as long as fluid retention is prevented by dialysis) because it removes the source of excessive renin secretion and subsequent increased Ang II formation.

Increase in Urea and Other Nonprotein Nitrogens (Azotemia). The nonprotein nitrogens include urea, uric acid, creatinine, and a few less important compounds. These nonprotein nitrogens, in general, are the end products of protein metabolism and must be removed from the body to ensure continued normal protein metabolism in the cells. The concentrations of these nonprotein nitrogens, particularly of urea, can rise to as high as 10 times normal during 1 to 2 weeks of total renal failure. With CKD, the concentrations rise approximately in proportion to the degree of reduction of GFR. For this reason, measuring the concentrations of these substances, especially of urea and creatinine, provides an important means for assessing the severity of CKD.

Acidosis in CKD. Each day, the body normally produces about 50 to 80 millimoles more metabolic acid than metabolic alkali. Therefore, when the kidneys fail to function, acid accumulates in the body fluids. The buffers of the body fluids normally can buffer 500 to 1000 millimoles of acid without lethal increases in extracellular fluid $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration, and the phosphate compounds in the bones can buffer an additional few thousand millimoles of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. However, when this buffering power is exhausted, the blood pH falls drastically, and the patient will become comatose and die if the pH falls below about 6.8.

Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease Caused by Decreased Erythropoietin Secretion. Anemia almost always develops in patients with severe CKD. The most important cause of this anemia is decreased renal secretion of erythropoietin, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. If the kidneys are seriously damaged, they are unable to form adequate quantities of erythropoietin, which leads to diminished red blood cell production and consequent anemia.

The availability since 1989 of recombinant erythropoietin, however, has provided a means of treating anemia in patients with chronic renal failure.

Osteomalacia in Chronic Kidney Disease Caused by Decreased Production of Active Vitamin D and by Phosphate Retention by the Kidneys. Prolonged CKD also causes osteomalacia, a condition in which the bones are partially absorbed and, therefore, become greatly weakened. An important cause of osteomalacia is that vitamin D must be converted by a two-stage process, first in the liver and then in the kidneys, into 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol before it is able to promote calcium absorption from the intestine. Therefore, serious damage to the kidney greatly reduces the blood concentration of active vitamin D, which in turn decreases intestinal absorption of calcium and availability of calcium to the bones.

Another important cause of demineralization of the skeleton in CKD is the rise in serum phosphate concentration that occurs as a result of decreased GFR. This rise in serum phosphate level increases binding of phosphate with calcium in the plasma, thus decreasing plasma serum
ionized calcium concentration, which, in turn, stimulates parathyroid hormone secretion. This secondary hyperparathyroidism then stimulates the release of calcium from bones, causing further bone demineralization.

## Hypertension and Kidney Disease

As discussed earlier in this chapter, hypertension can exacerbate injury to the glomeruli and blood vessels of the kidneys and is a major cause of ESRD. Abnormalities of kidney function can also cause hypertension, as discussed in Chapter 19. Thus, the relationship between hypertension and kidney disease can, in some cases, propagate a vicious cycle-primary kidney damage leads to increased blood pressure, which causes further damage to the kidneys and further increases in blood pressure, until ESRD develops.

Not all types of kidney disease cause hypertension because damage to certain portions of the kidney causes uremia without hypertension. Nevertheless, some types of renal damage are particularly prone to cause hypertension. A classification of kidney disease relative to hypertensive or nonhypertensive effects is provided in the following sections.

Renal Lesions That Reduce the Ability of the Kidneys to Excrete Sodium and Water Promote Hypertension. Renal lesions that decrease the ability of the kidneys to excrete sodium and water almost invariably cause hypertension. Therefore, lesions that decrease GFR or increase tubular reabsorption usually lead to hypertension of varying degrees. Some specific types of renal abnormalities that can cause hypertension are as follows:

1. Increased renal vascular resistance, which reduces renal blood flow and GFR. An example is hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis.
2. Decreased glomerular capillary filtration coefficient, which reduces GFR. An example is chronic glomerulonephritis, which causes inflammation and thickening of the glomerular capillary membranes, thereby reducing the glomerular capillary filtration coefficient.
3. Excessive tubular sodium reabsorption. An example is hypertension caused by excessive aldosterone secretion, which increases sodium reabsorption mainly in the cortical collecting tubules.
Once hypertension has developed, renal excretion of sodium and water returns to normal because the high arterial pressure causes pressure natriuresis and pressure diuresis, so intake and output of sodium and water become balanced once again. Even when there are large increases in renal vascular resistance or decreases in the glomerular capillary coefficient, GFR may still return to nearly normal levels after the arterial blood pressure rises. Likewise, when tubular reabsorption is increased, as occurs with excessive aldosterone secretion, the urinary excretion rate is initially reduced but then returns to normal as arterial pressure rises. Thus, after hypertension develops, there may be no obvious sign of impaired excretion of sodium and water other than the hypertension. As explained in Chapter 19, normal excretion of sodium and water at an elevated arterial pressure means that pressure natriuresis and pressure diuresis have been reset to a higher arterial pressure.

Hypertension Caused by Patchy Renal Damage and Increased Renal Secretion of Renin. If one part of the kidney is ischemic, and the remainder is not ischemic, such as when one renal artery is severely constricted, the ischemic

renal tissue secretes large quantities of renin. This secretion leads to increased formation of Ang II, which can cause hypertension. The most likely sequence of events in causing this hypertension, as discussed in Chapter 19, is as follows: (1) the ischemic kidney tissue excretes less than normal amounts of water and salt; (2) the renin secreted by the ischemic kidney, as well as the subsequent increased Ang II formation, affects the nonischemic kidney tissue, causing it also to retain salt and water; and (3) excess salt and water cause hypertension in the usual manner.

A similar type of hypertension can result when patchy areas of one or both kidneys become ischemic as a result of arteriosclerosis or vascular injury in specific portions of the kidneys. When this occurs, the ischemic nephrons excrete less salt and water but secrete greater amounts of renin, which causes increased Ang II formation. The high levels of Ang II then impair the ability of the surrounding, otherwise normal nephrons to excrete sodium and water. As a result, hypertension develops, which restores the overall excretion of sodium and water by the kidney, so balance between intake and output of salt and water is maintained, but at the expense of high blood pressure.

## Kidney Diseases That Cause Loss of Entire Nephrons Lead to Chronic Kidney Disease but May Not Cause Hypertension

Loss of large numbers of whole nephrons, such as occurs with the loss of one kidney and part of another kidney, almost always leads to CKD if the loss of kidney tissue is great enough. If the remaining nephrons are normal, and salt intake is not excessive, this condition might not cause clinically significant hypertension. This is because even a slight rise in blood pressure will raise GFR and decrease tubular sodium reabsorption in the surviving nephrons sufficiently to promote enough water and salt excretion in the urine, even with the few nephrons that remain intact. However, a patient with this type of abnormality may become severely hypertensive if additional stresses are imposed, such as eating a large amount of salt. In this case, the kidneys simply cannot clear adequate quantities of salt at a normal blood pressure with the small number of functioning nephrons that remain. Increased blood pressure restores excretion of salt and water to match intake of salt and water under steady-state conditions.

Effective treatment of hypertension requires enhancing the kidneys' capability to excrete salt and water by increasing GFR or by decreasing tubular reabsorption, so that balance between intake and renal excretion of salt and water excretion can be maintained at a lower blood pressure. This effect can be achieved by drugs that block the effects of nervous and hormonal signals that cause the kidneys to retain salt and water (e.g., with $\beta$-adrenergic blockers, Ang II receptor antagonists, or ACE inhibitors), with drugs that vasodilate the kidneys and increase GFR (e.g., calcium channel blockers), or with diuretic drugs that directly inhibit renal tubular reabsorption of salt and water.

## Specific Tubular Disorders

In Chapter 28, we discussed several mechanisms responsible for transporting different individual substances across the tubular epithelial membranes. In Chapter 3, we also pointed out that each cellular enzyme and each carrier
protein is formed in response to a respective gene in the nucleus. If any required gene happens to be absent or abnormal, the tubules may be deficient in one of the appropriate carrier proteins or one of the enzymes needed for solute transport by the renal tubular epithelial cells. In other cases, too much of the enzyme or carrier protein is produced. Thus, many hereditary tubular disorders occur because of abnormal transport of individual substances or groups of substances through the tubular membrane. In addition, damage to the tubular epithelial membrane by toxins or ischemia can cause important renal tubular disorders.

Renal Glycosuria-Failure of the Kidneys to Reabsorb Glucose. In renal glycosuria, the blood glucose concentration may be normal, but the transport mechanism for tubular reabsorption of glucose is greatly limited or absent. Consequently, despite a normal blood glucose level, large amounts of glucose pass into the urine each day. Because diabetes mellitus is also associated with the presence of glucose in the urine, renal glycosuria, which is a relatively benign condition, must be ruled out before making the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

Aminoaciduria-Failure of the Kidneys to Reabsorb Amino Acids. Some amino acids share mutual transport systems for reabsorption, whereas other amino acids have their own distinct transport systems. Rarely, a condition called generalized aminoaciduria results from deficient reabsorption of all amino acids. More frequently, deficiencies of specific carrier systems may result in the following: (1) essential cystinuria, in which large amounts of cystine fail to be reabsorbed and often crystallize in the urine to form renal stones; (2) simple glycinuria, in which glycine fails to be reabsorbed; or (3) beta-aminoisobutyricaciduria, which occurs in about $5 \%$ of the population but apparently has no major clinical significance.

Renal Hypophosphatemia-Failure of the Kidneys to Reabsorb Phosphate. In renal hypophosphatemia, the renal tubules fail to reabsorb large enough phosphate ions when the phosphate concentration of the body fluids falls very low. This condition usually does not cause serious immediate abnormalities because the phosphate concentration of the extracellular fluid can vary widely without causing major cellular dysfunction. Over a long period, however, a low phosphate level causes diminished calcification of the bones, causing rickets to develop. This type of rickets is refractory to vitamin D therapy, in contrast to the rapid response of the usual type of rickets, as discussed in Chapter 80.

Renal Tubular Acidosis-Reduced Tubular Secretion of Hydrogen Ions. In renal tubular acidosis, the renal tubules are unable to secrete adequate amounts of hydrogen ions. As a result, large amounts of sodium bicarbonate are continually lost in the urine. This loss causes a continued state of metabolic acidosis, as discussed in Chapter 31. This type of renal abnormality can be caused by hereditary disorders or can occur as a result of widespread injury to the renal tubules.

Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus-Failure of the Kidneys to Respond to Antidiuretic Hormone. Occasionally, the renal tubules do not respond to antidiuretic hormone, causing large quantities of dilute urine to be excreted. As long as the person is supplied with plenty of water, this condition seldom causes severe difficulty. However, when adequate quantities of water are not available, the person rapidly becomes dehydrated.

Fanconi Syndrome-Generalized Reabsorptive Defect of the Renal Tubules. Fanconi syndrome is usually associated with increased urinary excretion of virtually all amino acids, glucose, and phosphate. In severe cases, other manifestations are also observed, such as (1) failure to reabsorb sodium bicarbonate, which results in metabolic acidosis; (2) increased excretion of potassium and sometimes calcium; and (3) nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

There are multiple causes of Fanconi syndrome, which results from a generalized inability of the renal tubular cells to transport various substances. Some of these include the following: (1) hereditary defects in cell transport mechanisms; (2) toxins or drugs that injure the renal tubular epithelial cells; and (3) injury to the renal tubular cells as a result of ischemia. The proximal tubular cells are especially affected in Fanconi syndrome caused by tubular injury because these cells reabsorb and secrete many of the drugs and toxins that can cause damage.

Bartter Syndrome-Decreased Sodium, Chloride, and Potassium Reabsorption in the Loops of Henle. Bartter syndrome is a rare group of kidney disorders caused by mutations that impair function of the 1-sodium, 2-chloride, 1-potassium co-transporter or by defects in potassium channels in the luminal membrane or chloride channels in the basolateral membrane of the thick ascending loop of Henle. At least five mutations, usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, have been found to cause Bartter syndrome. These disorders result in increased excretion of water, sodium, chloride, potassium, and calcium by the kidneys. The salt and water loss leads to mild volume depletion, resulting in activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The increased aldosterone and high distal tubular flow, due to impaired loop of Henle reabsorption, stimulate potassium and hydrogen secretion in the collecting tubules, leading to hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

Gitelman Syndrome-Decreased Sodium Chloride Reabsorption in the Distal Tubules. Gitelman syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disorder of the thiazide-sensitive sodiumchloride co-transporter in the distal tubules. Patients with Gitelman syndrome have some of the same characteristics as patients with Bartter syndrome-salt and water loss, mild water volume depletion, and activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system-although these abnormalities are usually less severe in persons with Gitelman syndrome.

Because the tubular defects in Bartter or Gitelman syndrome cannot currently be corrected, treatment is usually focused on replacing the losses of sodium chloride and potassium. Some studies have suggested that blockade of prostaglandin synthesis with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and administration of aldosterone antagonists, such as spironolactone, may be useful in correcting the hypokalemia.

Liddle Syndrome-Increased Sodium Reabsorption. Liddle syndrome is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder resulting from various mutations in the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the distal and collecting tubules. These mutations cause excessive activity of ENaC , resulting in increased reabsorption of sodium and water, hypertension, and metabolic alkalosis similar to the changes that occur with oversecretion of aldosterone (primary aldosteronism).

Patients with Liddle syndrome, however, have sodium retention and decreased renin secretion and Ang II levels,
which, in turn, decrease adrenal secretion of aldosterone. Fortunately, Liddle syndrome can be treated with the diuretic amiloride, which blocks the excessive ENaC activity.

## Treatment of Renal Failure by Transplantation or Dialysis With an Artificial Kidney

Severe loss of kidney function, acutely or chronically, is life-threatening and requires removal of toxic waste products and restoration of body fluid volume and composition toward normal. This can be accomplished by kidney transplantation or by dialysis with an artificial kidney. Over 700,000 patients in the United States are currently receiving some form of ESRD therapy.

Successful transplantation of a single donor kidney to a patient with ESRD can restore kidney function to a level sufficient to maintain essentially normal homeostasis of body fluids and electrolytes. Approximately 19,000 kidney transplantations are performed each year in the United States, but over 100,000 patients await kidney transplantation. Patients who receive kidney transplants typically live longer and have fewer health problems than those who are maintained with dialysis. Maintenance of immunosuppressive therapy is required for almost all patients to help prevent acute rejection and loss of the transplanted kidney. The side effects of drugs that suppress the immune system include increased risk for infections and some cancers, although the amount of immunosuppressive therapy can usually be reduced over time to reduce these risks greatly.

Over 475,000 people in the United States who have irreversible renal failure or total kidney removal are being maintained chronically by dialysis with artificial kidneys. Dialysis is also used in certain types of AKI to tide the patient over until the kidneys resume their function. If the loss of kidney function is irreversible, it is necessary to perform dialysis chronically to maintain life. Because dialysis cannot maintain completely normal body fluid composition and cannot replace all the multiple functions performed by the kidneys, the health of patients maintained with the use of artificial kidneys usually remains significantly impaired.

## Basic Principles of Dialysis

The basic principle of the artificial kidney is to pass blood through minute blood channels bounded by a thin membrane. On the other side of the membrane is a dialyzing fluid into which unwanted substances in the blood pass by diffusion.

Figure 32-8 shows the components of one type of artificial kidney in which blood flows continually between two thin membranes of cellophane; outside the membrane is a dialyzing fluid. The cellophane is porous enough to allow the constituents of the plasma, except the plasma proteins, to diffuse in both directions-from plasma into the dialyzing fluid or from the dialyzing fluid back into the plasma. If the concentration of a substance is higher in the plasma than in the dialyzing fluid, there will be a net transfer of the substance from the plasma into the dialyzing fluid.

The rate of movement of solute across the dialyzing membrane depends on the following: (1) the concentration gradient of the solute between the two solutions; (2) the permeability of the membrane to the solute; (3) the surface area of the membrane; and (4) the length of time that the blood and fluid remain in contact with the membrane.

Table 32-7 Comparison of Dialyzing Fluid With Normal and Uremic Plasma

| Constituent | Normal <br> Plasma | Dialyzing <br> Fluid | Uremic <br> Plasma |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Electrolytes (mEq/L) |  |  |  |
| $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ | 142 | 133 | 142 |
| $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ | 5 | 1.0 | 7 |
| $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ | 3 | 3.0 | 2 |
| $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ | 1.5 | 1.5 | 1.5 |
| $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ | 107 | 105 | 107 |
| $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ | 24 | 35.7 | 14 |
| Lactate $^{-}$ | 1.2 | 1.2 | 1.2 |
| $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$ | 3 | 0 | 9 |
| Urate $^{-}$ | 0.3 | 0 | 2 |
| Sulfate $^{+}$ | 0.5 | 0 | 3 |
| Nonelectrolytes | 100 | 125 | 100 |
| Glucose | 26 | 0 | 200 |
| Urea | 1 | 0 | 6 |
| Creatinine |  |  |  |

Thus, the maximum rate of solute transfer occurs initially when the concentration gradient is greatest (when dialysis is begun) and slows down as the concentration gradient is dissipated. In a flowing system, as is the case with hemodialysis, in which blood and dialysate fluid flow through the artificial kidney, the dissipation of the concentration gradient can be reduced, and diffusion of solute across the membrane can be optimized, by increasing the flow rate of the blood, dialyzing fluid, or both.

In normal operation of the artificial kidney, blood flows continually or intermittently back into the vein. The total amount of blood in the artificial kidney at any one time is usually less than 500 milliliters, the rate of flow may be several hundred milliliters per minute, and the total diffusion surface area is between 0.6 and $2.5 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. To prevent coagulation of the blood in the artificial kidney, a small amount of heparin is infused into the blood as it enters the artificial kidney. In addition to the diffusion of solutes, mass transfer of solutes and water can be produced by applying a hydrostatic pressure to force the fluid and solutes across the membranes of the dialyzer; this type of filtration is called bulk flow or hemofiltration.

## Dialyzing Fluid

Table 32-7 compares the constituents in a typical dialyzing fluid with those in normal plasma and uremic plasma. Note that the concentrations of ions and other substances in dialyzing fluid are not the same as the concentrations in normal plasma or in uremic plasma. Instead, they are adjusted to levels needed to cause the appropriate movement of water and solutes through the membrane during dialysis.

Note that there is no phosphate, urea, urate, sulfate, or creatinine in the dialyzing fluid; however, these substances are present in high concentrations in the uremic blood. Therefore, when a uremic patient undergoes dialysis, these substances are lost in large quantities into the dialyzing fluid.
![gu1027762836d](gu1027762836d.jpg)

Figure 32-8. Principles of dialysis with an artificial kidney.
The effectiveness of the artificial kidney can be expressed in terms of the amount of plasma that is cleared of different substances each minute, which, as discussed in Chapter 28, is the primary means for expressing the functional effectiveness of the kidneys themselves to rid the body of unwanted substances. Most artificial kidneys can clear urea from the plasma at a rate of 100 to $225 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, which shows that at least for the excretion of urea, the artificial kidney can function about twice as rapidly as two normal kidneys together, whose urea clearance is only $70 \mathrm{ml} /$ min. Yet, the artificial kidney is used only for 4 to 6 hours/ day, three times a week. Therefore, the overall plasma clearance is still considerably limited when the artificial kidney replaces the normal kidneys. Also, it is important to keep in mind that the artificial kidney cannot replace some of the other functions of the kidneys, such as secretion of erythropoietin, which is necessary for red blood cell production.

# Red Blood Cells, Anemia, and Polycythemia 

In this chapter, we begin discussing the blood cells and cells of the macrophage system and lymphatic system. We first present the functions of red blood cells (RBCs), which are the most abundant cells of the blood and are necessary for the delivery of oxygen to the tissues.

## RED BLOOD CELLS (ERYTHROCYTES)

A major function of RBCs, also known as erythrocytes, is to transport hemoglobin, which, in turn, carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. In some animals, including many invertebrates, hemoglobin circulates as free protein in the circulatory fluids and is not enclosed in RBCs. When it is free in human plasma, about $3 \%$ of it leaks through the capillary membrane into the tissue spaces or through the glomerular membrane of the kidney into the glomerular filtrate each time the blood passes through the capillaries. Therefore, hemoglobin must remain inside RBCs to perform its functions in humans effectively.

The RBCs have other functions besides transport of hemoglobin. For example, they contain a large quantity of carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reaction between carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ and water to form carbonic acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$, increasing the rate of this reaction several thousandfold. The rapidity of this reaction makes it possible for the water of the blood to transport enormous quantities of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the form of bicarbonate ion $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$from the tissues to the lungs, where it is reconverted to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and expelled into the atmosphere as a body waste product. The hemoglobin in the cells is an excellent acid-base buffer (as is true of most proteins), so the RBCs are responsible for most of the acid-base buffering power of whole blood.

Shape and Size of Red Blood Cells. Normal RBCs, shown in Figure 33-3, are biconcave discs having a mean diameter of about 7.8 micrometers and a thickness of 2.5 micrometers at the thickest point and 1 micrometer or less in the center. The average volume of the RBC is 90 to 95 cubic micrometers.

The shapes of RBCs can change remarkably as the cells squeeze through capillaries. Actually, the RBC resembles a bag that can be deformed into almost any shape.

Furthermore, because the normal cell has a great excess of cell membrane for the quantity of material inside, deformation does not stretch the membrane greatly and, consequently, does not rupture the cell, as would be the case with many other cells.

Concentration of Red Blood Cells in the Blood. In healthy men, the average number of RBCs per cubic millimeter is $5,200,000( \pm 300,000)$; in healthy women, it is $4,700,000( \pm 300,000)$. Persons living at high altitudes have greater numbers of RBCs, as discussed later.

Quantity of Hemoglobin in the Cells. RBCs can concentrate hemoglobin in the cell fluid up to about 34 $\mathrm{g} / 100 \mathrm{ml}$ of cells. The concentration does not rise above this value because this is the metabolic limit of the cell's hemoglobin-forming mechanism. Furthermore, in normal people, the percentage of hemoglobin is almost always near the maximum in each cell. However, when hemoglobin formation is deficient, the percentage of hemoglobin in the cells may fall considerably below this value, and the volume of the RBC may also decrease because of diminished hemoglobin to fill the cell.

When the hematocrit (the percentage of blood that is comprised of cells-normally, $40 \%$ to $45 \%$ ) and the quantity of hemoglobin in each respective cell are normal, the whole blood of men contains an average of 15 g hemoglobin $/ 100 \mathrm{ml}$; for women, it contains an average of 14 g hemoglobin/ 100 ml .

As discussed in connection with blood transport of oxygen in Chapter 41, each gram of hemoglobin can combine with 1.34 ml of oxygen if the hemoglobin is $100 \%$ saturated. Therefore, in the average man, a maximum of about 20 milliliters of oxygen can be carried in combination with hemoglobin in each 100 milliliters of blood, and in woman 19 milliliters of oxygen can be carried.

## PRODUCTION OF RED BLOOD CELLS

Areas of the Body That Produce Red Blood Cells. In the early weeks of embryonic life, primitive nucleated RBCs are produced in the yolk sac. During the middle trimester of gestation, the liver is the main organ for RBC production but reasonable numbers are also produced in
