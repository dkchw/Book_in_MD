# Transport of Substances Through Cell Membranes 

Figure 4-1 lists the approximate concentrations of important electrolytes and other substances in the extracellular fluid and intracellular fluid. Note that the extracellular fluid contains a large amount of sodium but only a small amount of potassium. The opposite is true of the intracellular fluid. Also, the extracellular fluid contains a large amount of chloride ions, whereas the intracellular fluid contains very little of these ions. However, the concentrations of phosphates and proteins in the intracellular fluid are considerably greater than those in the extracellular fluid. These differences are extremely important to the life of the cell. The purpose of this chapter is to explain how the differences are brought about by the cell membrane transport mechanisms.

## THE CELL MEMBRANE IS A LIPID BILAYER WITH CELL MEMBRANE TRANSPORT PROTEINS

The structure of the membrane covering the outside of every cell of the body is discussed in Chapter 2 and illustrated in Figure 2-3 and Figure 4-2. This membrane consists almost entirely of a lipid bilayer with large numbers of protein molecules in the lipid, many of which penetrate all the way through the membrane.

The lipid bilayer is not miscible with the extracellular fluid or the intracellular fluid. Therefore, it constitutes a barrier against movement of water molecules and watersoluble substances between the extracellular and intracellular fluid compartments. However, as shown in Figure $4-2$ by the leftmost arrow, lipid-soluble substances can diffuse directly through the lipid substance.

The membrane protein molecules interrupt the continuity of the lipid bilayer, constituting an alternative pathway through the cell membrane. Many of these penetrating proteins can function as transport proteins. Some proteins have watery spaces all the way through the molecule and allow free movement of water, as well as selected ions or molecules; these proteins are called channel proteins. Other proteins, called carrier proteins, bind with molecules or ions that are to be transported, and conformational changes in the protein molecules then move the substances through the interstices of the protein to the

other side of the membrane. Channel proteins and carrier proteins are usually selective for the types of molecules or ions that are allowed to cross the membrane.
"Diffusion" Versus "Active Transport." Transport through the cell membrane, either directly through the lipid bilayer or through the proteins, occurs via one of two basic processes, diffusion or active transport.

Although many variations of these basic mechanisms exist, diffusion means random molecular movement of substances molecule by molecule, either through intermolecular spaces in the membrane or in combination with a carrier protein. The energy that causes diffusion is the energy of the normal kinetic motion of matter.

In contrast, active transport means movement of ions or other substances across the membrane in combination with a carrier protein in such a way that the carrier protein causes the substance to move against an energy gradient, such as from a low-concentration state to a highconcentration state. This movement requires an additional source of energy besides kinetic energy. A more detailed explanation of the basic physics and physical chemistry of these two processes is provided later in this chapter.

## DIFFUSION

All molecules and ions in the body fluids, including water molecules and dissolved substances, are in constant motion, with each particle moving in its separate way. The motion of these particles is what physicists call "heat"the greater the motion, the higher the temperature-and the motion never ceases, except at absolute zero temperature. When a moving molecule, A, approaches a stationary molecule, B, the electrostatic and other nuclear forces of molecule A repel molecule B, transferring some of the energy of motion of molecule A to molecule B. Consequently, molecule B gains kinetic energy of motion, whereas molecule A slows down, losing some of its kinetic energy. As shown in Figure 4-3, a single molecule in a solution bounces among the other molecules-first in one direction, then another, then another, and so forthrandomly bouncing thousands of times each second. This continual movement of molecules among one another in liquids or gases is called diffusion.

Ions diffuse in the same manner as whole molecules, and even suspended colloid particles diffuse in a similar manner, except that the colloids diffuse far less rapidly than molecular substances because of their large size.

## DIFFUSION THROUGH THE CELL MEMBRANE

Diffusion through the cell membrane is divided into two subtypes, called simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion. Simple diffusion means that kinetic movement of molecules or ions occurs through a membrane opening or through intermolecular spaces without interaction with carrier proteins in the membrane. The rate of diffusion is determined by the amount of substance available, the velocity of kinetic motion, and the number and sizes of openings in the membrane through which the molecules or ions can move.

Facilitated diffusion requires interaction of a carrier protein. The carrier protein aids passage of molecules or ions through the membrane by binding chemically with them and shuttling them through the membrane in this form.

Simple diffusion can occur through the cell membrane by two pathways: (1) through the interstices of the lipid bilayer if the diffusing substance is lipid-soluble; and (2) through watery channels that penetrate all the way through some of the large transport proteins, as shown to the left in Figure 4-2.

Diffusion of Lipid-Soluble Substances Through the Lipid Bilayer. The lipid solubility of a substance is an important factor for determining how rapidly it diffuses through the lipid bilayer. For example, the lipid solubilities of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and alcohols are high, and all these substances can dissolve directly in the lipid bilayer and diffuse through the cell membrane in the same manner that diffusion of water solutes occurs in a watery solution. The rate of diffusion of each of these substances through the membrane is directly proportional to its lipid solubility. Especially large amounts of oxygen can be transported in this way; therefore, oxygen can be delivered to the interior of the cell almost as though the cell membrane did not exist.

Diffusion of Water and Other Lipid-Insoluble Molecules Through Protein Channels. Even though water is highly insoluble in the membrane lipids, it readily passes through channels in protein molecules that penetrate all the way through the membrane. Many of the body's cell membranes contain protein "pores" called aquaporins that selectively permit rapid passage of water through the membrane. The aquaporins are highly specialized, and there are at least 13 different types in various cells of mammals.

The rapidity with which water molecules can diffuse through most cell membranes is astounding. For example, the total amount of water that diffuses in each direction

through the red blood cell membrane during each second is about 100 times as great as the volume of the red blood cell.

Other lipid-insoluble molecules can pass through the protein pore channels in the same way as water molecules if they are water-soluble and small enough. However, as they become larger, their penetration falls off rapidly. For example, the diameter of the urea molecule is only $20 \%$ greater than that of water, yet its penetration through the cell membrane pores is about 1000 times less than that of water. Even so, given the astonishing rate of water penetration, this amount of urea penetration still allows rapid transport of urea through the membrane within minutes.

## DIFFUSION THROUGH PROTEIN PORES AND CHANNELSâ€”SELECTIVE PERMEABILITY AND "GATING" OF CHANNELS

Computerized three-dimensional reconstructions of protein pores and channels have demonstrated tubular pathways all the way from the extracellular to the intracellular fluid. Therefore, substances can move by simple diffusion directly along these pores and channels from one side of the membrane to the other.

Pores are composed of integral cell membrane proteins that form open tubes through the membrane and are always open. However, the diameter of a pore and its electrical charges provide selectivity that permits only certain molecules to pass through. For example, aquaporins permit rapid passage of water through cell membranes but exclude other molecules. Aquaporins have a narrow pore that permits water molecules to diffuse through the membrane in single file. The pore is too narrow to permit passage of any hydrated ions. As discussed in Chapters 28 and 76, the density of some aquaporins (e.g., aquaporin-2) in cell membranes is not static but is altered in different physiological conditions.

The protein channels are distinguished by two important characteristics: (1) they are often selectively permeable to certain substances; and (2) many of the channels can be opened or closed by gates that are regulated by electrical signals (voltage-gated channels) or chemicals that bind to the channel proteins (ligand-gated channels). Thus, ion channels are flexible dynamic structures, and subtle conformational changes influence gating and ion selectivity.

Selective Permeability of Protein Channels. Many protein channels are highly selective for transport of one or more specific ions or molecules. This selectivity results from specific characteristics of the channel, such as its diameter, shape, and the nature of the electrical charges and chemical bonds along its inside surfaces.

Potassium channels permit passage of potassium ions across the cell membrane about 1000 times more readily than they permit passage of sodium ions. This high degree of selectivity cannot be explained entirely by the
![gu042415823e](gu042415823e.jpg)

Figure 4-4. The structure of a potassium channel. The channel is composed of four subunits (only two of which are shown), each with two transmembrane helices. A narrow selectivity filter is formed from the pore loops, and carbonyl oxygens line the walls of the selectivity filter, forming sites for transiently binding dehydrated potassium ions. The interaction of the potassium ions with carbonyl oxygens causes the potassium ions to shed their bound water molecules, permitting the dehydrated potassium ions to pass through the pore.
molecular diameters of the ions because potassium ions are slightly larger than sodium ions. Using x-ray crystallography, potassium channels were found to have a tetrameric structure consisting of four identical protein subunits surrounding a central pore (Figure 4-4). At the top of the channel pore are pore loops that form a narrow selectivity filter. Lining the selectivity filter are carbonyl oxygens. When hydrated potassium ions enter the selectivity filter, they interact with the carbonyl oxygens and shed most of their bound water molecules, permitting the dehydrated potassium ions to pass through the channel. The carbonyl oxygens are too far apart, however, to enable them to interact closely with the smaller sodium ions, which are therefore effectively excluded by the selectivity filter from passing through the pore.

Different selectivity filters for the various ion channels are believed to determine, in large part, the specificity of various channels for cations or anions or for particular ions, such as sodium $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$, potassium $\left(\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)$, and calcium $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right)$, that gain access to the channels.

One of the most important of the protein channels, the sodium channel, is only 0.3 to 0.5 nanometer in diameter, but the ability of sodium channels to discriminate sodium ions among other competing ions in the surrounding fluids is crucial for proper cellular function.

![gu052415823e](gu052415823e.jpg)

Figure 4-5. Transport of sodium and potassium ions through protein channels. Also shown are conformational changes in the protein molecules to open or close the "gates" guarding the channels.

The narrowest part of the sodium channel's open pore, the selectivity filter, is lined with strongly negatively charged amino acid residues, as shown in the top panel of Figure 4-5. These strong negative charges can pull small dehydrated sodium ions away from their hydrating water molecules into these channels, although the ions do not need to be fully dehydrated to pass through the channels. Once in the channel, the sodium ions diffuse in either direction according to the usual laws of diffusion. Thus, the sodium channel is highly selective for passage of sodium ions.

Gating of Protein Channels. Gating of protein channels provides a means of controlling ion permeability of the channels. This mechanism is shown in both panels of Figure 4-5 for selective gating of sodium and potassium ions. Some of the gates are thought to be gatelike extensions of the transport protein molecule, which can close the opening of the channel or can be lifted away from the opening by a conformational change in the shape of the protein molecule.

The opening and closing of gates are controlled in two principal ways:

1. Voltage gating. In the case of voltage gating, the molecular conformation of the gate or its chemical bonds responds to the electrical potential across the cell membrane. For example, in the top panel of Figure 4-5, a strong negative charge on the inside of the cell membrane may cause the outside sodium gates to remain tightly closed. Conversely, when the inside of the membrane loses its negative charge, these gates open suddenly and allow sodium to pass inward through the sodium pores. This process is the basic mechanism for eliciting action potentials in nerves that are responsible for nerve signals. In
the bottom panel of Figure 4-5, the potassium gates are on the intracellular ends of the potassium channels, and they open when the inside of the cell membrane becomes positively charged. The opening of these gates is partly responsible for terminating the action potential, a process discussed in Chapter 5.
2. Chemical (ligand) gating. Some protein channel gates are opened by the binding of a chemical substance (a ligand) with the protein, which causes a conformational or chemical bonding change in the protein molecule that opens or closes the gate. One of the most important instances of chemical gating is the effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine on the acetylcholine receptor which serves as a ligand-gated ion channel. Acetylcholine opens the gate of this channel, providing a negatively charged pore about 0.65 nanometer in diameter that allows uncharged molecules or positive ions smaller than this diameter to pass through. This gate is exceedingly important for the transmission of nerve signals from one nerve cell to another (see Chapter 46) and from nerve cells to muscle cells to cause muscle contraction (see Chapter 7).

## Open-State Versus Closed-State of Gated Channels.

Figure 4-6A shows two recordings of electrical current flowing through a single sodium channel when there was an approximately 25 -millivolt potential gradient across the membrane. Note that the channel conducts current in an all-or-none fashion. That is, the gate of the channel snaps open and then snaps closed, with each open state lasting for only a fraction of a millisecond, up to several milliseconds, demonstrating the rapidity with which changes can occur during the opening and closing of the protein gates. At one voltage potential, the channel may remain closed all the time or almost all the time, whereas at another voltage, it may remain open either all or most of the time. At in-between voltages, as shown in the figure, the gates tend to snap open and closed intermittently, resulting in an average current flow somewhere between the minimum and maximum.

Patch Clamp Method for Recording Ion Current Flow Through Single Channels. The patch clamp method for recording ion current flow through single protein channels is illustrated in Figure 4-6B. A micropipette with a tip diameter of only 1 or 2 micrometers is abutted against the outside of a cell membrane. Suction is then applied inside the pipette to pull the membrane against the tip of the pipette, which creates a seal where the edges of the pipette touch the cell membrane. The result is a minute membrane "patch" at the tip of the pipette through which electrical current flow can be recorded.

Alternatively, as shown at the bottom right in Figure $4-6 B$, the small cell membrane patch at the end of the pipette can be torn away from the cell. The pipette with its sealed patch is then inserted into a free solution, which

B, Patch clamp method for recording current flow through a single protein channel. To the left, the recording is performed from a "patch" of a living cell membrane. To the right, the recording is from a membrane patch that has been torn away from the cell.
allows the concentrations of ions both inside the micropipette and in the outside solution to be altered as desired. Also, the voltage between the two sides of the membrane can be set, or "clamped," to a given voltage.

It has been possible to make such patches small enough so that only a single channel protein is found in the membrane patch being studied. By varying the concentrations of different ions, as well as the voltage across the membrane, one can determine the transport characteristics of the single channel, along with its gating properties.

Figure 4-7. Effect of concentration of a substance on the rate of diffusion through a membrane by simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion. This graph shows that facilitated diffusion approaches a maximum rate, called the $V_{\max }$.

## FACILITATED DIFFUSION REQUIRES MEMBRANE CARRIER PROTEINS

Facilitated diffusion is also called carrier-mediated diffusion because a substance transported in this manner diffuses through the membrane with the help of a specific carrier protein. That is, the carrier facilitates diffusion of the substance to the other side.

Facilitated diffusion differs from simple diffusion in the following important way. Although the rate of simple diffusion through an open channel increases proportionately with the concentration of the diffusing substance, in facilitated diffusion the rate of diffusion approaches a maximum, called $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$, as the concentration of the diffusing substance increases. This difference between simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion is demonstrated in Figure 4-7. The figure shows that as the concentration of the diffusing substance increases, the rate of simple diffusion continues to increase proportionately but, in the case of facilitated diffusion, the rate of diffusion cannot rise higher than the $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$ level.

What is it that limits the rate of facilitated diffusion? A probable answer is the mechanism illustrated in Figure 4-8. This Figure shows a carrier protein with a pore large enough to transport a specific molecule partway through. It also shows a binding receptor on the inside of the protein carrier. The molecule to be transported enters the pore and becomes bound. Then, in a fraction of a second, a conformational or chemical change occurs in the carrier protein, so that the pore now opens to the opposite side of the membrane. Because the binding force of the receptor is weak, the thermal motion of the attached molecule causes it to break away and be released on the opposite side of the membrane. The rate at which molecules can be transported by this mechanism can never be greater than the rate at which the carrier protein molecule can undergo change back and forth between its two states. Note specifically, though, that this mechanism allows the transported molecule to move-that is, diffuse-in either direction through the membrane.

![gu082415823e](gu082415823e.jpg)

Figure 4-8. Postulated mechanism for facilitated diffusion.
Among the many substances that cross cell membranes by facilitated diffusion are glucose and most of the amino acids. In the case of glucose, at least 14 members of a family of membrane proteins (called GLUT) that transport glucose molecules have been discovered in various tissues. Some of these GLUT proteins transport other monosaccharides that have structures similar to that of glucose, including galactose and fructose. One of these, glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), is activated by insulin, which can increase the rate of facilitated diffusion of glucose as much as 10 - to 20 -fold in insulin-sensitive tissues. This is the principal mechanism whereby insulin controls glucose use in the body, as discussed in Chapter 79.

## FACTORS THAT AFFECT NET RATE OF DIFFUSION

By now, it is evident that many substances can diffuse through the cell membrane. What is usually important is the net rate of diffusion of a substance in the desired direction. This net rate is determined by several factors.

Net Diffusion Rate Is Proportional to the Concentration Difference Across a Membrane. Figure 4-9A shows a cell membrane with a high concentration of a substance on the outside and a low concentration of a substance on the inside. The rate at which the substance diffuses inward is proportional to the concentration of molecules on the outside because this concentration determines how many molecules strike the outside of the membrane each second. Conversely, the rate at which molecules diffuse outward is proportional to their concentration inside the membrane. Therefore, the rate of net diffusion into the cell is proportional to the concentration on the outside minus the concentration on the inside:

$$
\text { Net diffusion }=\left(C_{0}-C_{i}\right)
$$

![gu092415823e](gu092415823e.jpg)

Effect of concentration difference (A), electrical potential difference affecting negative ions (B), and pressure difference (C) to cause diffusion of molecules and ions through a cell membrane. $\mathrm{C}_{0}$, concentration outside the cell; $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$, concentration inside the cell; $P_{1}$ pressure $1 ; P_{2}$ pressure 2 .
in which $\mathrm{C}_{0}$ is the concentration outside and $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ is the concentration inside the cell.

Membrane Electrical Potential and Diffusion of Ions-The "Nernst Potential." If an electrical potential is applied across the membrane, as shown in Figure $4-9 B$, the electrical charges of the ions cause them to move through the membrane even though no concentration difference exists to cause movement. Thus, in the left panel of Figure 4-9B, the concentration of negative ions is the same on both sides of the membrane, but a positive charge has been applied to the right side of the membrane, and a negative charge has been applied to the left, creating an electrical gradient across the membrane. The positive charge attracts the negative ions, whereas the negative charge repels them. Therefore, net diffusion occurs from left to right. After some time, large quantities of negative ions have moved to the right, creating the condition shown in the right panel of Figure 4-9B, in which a concentration difference of the ions has developed in the direction opposite to the electrical potential difference. The concentration difference now tends to move the ions to the left, whereas the electrical difference tends to move them to the right. When the concentration difference rises high enough, the two effects balance each other. At normal body temperature $\left(98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F} ; 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, the electrical difference that will balance a given concentration difference

of univalent ions-such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions-can be determined from the following formula, called the Nernst equation:

$$
\text { EMF (in millivolts) }= \pm 61 \log \frac{C_{1}}{C_{2}}
$$

in which EMF is the electromotive force (voltage) between side 1 and side 2 of the membrane, $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ is the concentration on side 1 , and $\mathrm{C}_{2}$ is the concentration on side 2. This equation is extremely important in understanding the transmission of nerve impulses and is discussed in Chapter 5.

## Effect of a Pressure Difference Across the Membrane.

At times, a considerable pressure difference develops between the two sides of a diffusible membrane. This pressure difference occurs, for example, at the blood capillary membranes in all tissues of the body. The pressure in many capillaries is about 20 mm Hg greater inside than outside.

Pressure actually means the sum of all the forces of the different molecules striking a unit surface area at a given instant. Therefore, having a higher pressure on one side of a membrane than on the other side means that the sum of all the forces of the molecules striking the channels on that side of the membrane is greater than on the other side. In most cases, this situation is caused by greater numbers of molecules striking the membrane per second on one side than on the other side. The result is that increased amounts of energy are available to cause a net movement of molecules from the high-pressure side toward the low-pressure side. This effect is demonstrated in Figure 4-9C, which shows a piston developing high pressure on one side of a pore, thereby causing more molecules to strike the pore on this side and, therefore, more molecules to diffuse to the other side.

## OSMOSIS ACROSS SELECTIVELY PERMEABLE MEMBRANES-"NET DIFFUSION" OF WATER

By far, the most abundant substance that diffuses through the cell membrane is water. Enough water ordinarily diffuses in each direction through the red blood cell membrane per second to equal about 100 times the volume of the cell itself. Yet, the amount that normally diffuses in the two directions is balanced so precisely that zero net movement of water occurs. Therefore, the volume of the cell remains constant. However, under certain conditions, a concentration difference for water can develop across a membrane. When this concentration difference for water develops, net movement of water does occur across the cell membrane, causing the cell to swell or shrink, depending on the direction of the water movement. This process of net movement of water caused by a concentration difference of water is called osmosis.

To illustrate osmosis, let us assume the conditions shown in Figure 4-10, with pure water on one side of the cell membrane and a solution of sodium chloride on the
![gu102415823e](gu102415823e.jpg)

Figure 4-10. Osmosis at a cell membrane when a sodium chloride solution is placed on one side of the membrane and water is placed on the other side.
other side. Water molecules pass through the cell membrane with ease, whereas sodium and chloride ions pass through only with difficulty. Therefore, sodium chloride solution is actually a mixture of permeant water molecules and nonpermeant sodium and chloride ions, and the membrane is said to be selectively permeable to water but much less so to sodium and chloride ions. Yet, the presence of the sodium and chloride has displaced some of the water molecules on the side of the membrane where these ions are present and, therefore, has reduced the concentration of water molecules to less than that of pure water. As a result, in the example shown in Figure 4-10, more water molecules strike the channels on the left side, where there is pure water, than on the right side, where the water concentration has been reduced. Thus, net movement of water occurs from left to right-that is, osmosis occurs from the pure water into the sodium chloride solution.

## Osmotic Pressure

If in Figure 4-10 pressure were applied to the sodium chloride solution, osmosis of water into this solution would be slowed, stopped, or even reversed. The amount of pressure required to stop osmosis is called the osmotic pressure of the sodium chloride solution.

The principle of a pressure difference opposing osmosis is demonstrated in Figure 4-11, which shows a selectively permeable membrane separating two columns of fluid, one containing pure water and the other containing a solution of water and any solute that will not penetrate the membrane. Osmosis of water from chamber B into chamber A causes the levels of the fluid columns to become farther and farther apart, until eventually a pressure difference develops between the two sides of the membrane that is great enough to oppose the osmotic effect. The pressure difference across the membrane at this point is equal to the osmotic pressure of the solution that contains the nondiffusible solute.

![gu112415823e](gu112415823e.jpg)

Figure 4-11. Demonstration of osmotic pressure caused by osmosis at a semipermeable membrane.

## Importance of Number of Osmotic Particles (Molar Concentration) in Determining Osmotic Pressure.

The osmotic pressure exerted by particles in a solution, whether they are molecules or ions, is determined by the number of particles per unit volume of fluid, not by the mass of the particles. The reason for this is that each particle in a solution, regardless of its mass, exerts, on average, the same amount of pressure against the membrane. That is, large particles, which have greater mass (m) than small particles, move at a slower velocity (v). The small particles move at higher velocities in such a way that their average kinetic energies $(\mathrm{k})$, as determined by the following equation,

$$
\mathrm{k}=\frac{\mathrm{mv}^{2}}{2}
$$

are the same for each small particle as for each large particle. Consequently, the factor that determines the osmotic pressure of a solution is the concentration of the solution in terms of the number of particles (which is the same as its molar concentration if it is a nondissociated molecule), not in terms of mass of the solute.

Osmolality-The Osmole. To express the concentration of a solution in terms of numbers of particles, a unit called the osmole is used in place of grams.

One osmole is 1 gram molecular weight of osmotically active solute. Thus, 180 grams of glucose, which is 1 gram molecular weight of glucose, is equal to 1 osmole of glucose because glucose does not dissociate into ions. If a solute dissociates into two ions, 1 gram molecular weight of the solute will become 2 osmoles because the number of osmotically active particles is now twice as great as for the nondissociated solute. Therefore, when fully dissociated, 1 gram molecular weight of sodium chloride, 58.5 grams, is equal to 2 osmoles.

Thus, a solution that has 1 osmole of solute dissolved in each kilogram of water is said to have an osmolality of 1 osmole per kilogram, and a solution that has $1 / 1000$ osmole dissolved per kilogram has an osmolality of 1 milliosmole per kilogram. The normal osmolality of the extracellular and intracellular fluids is about 300 milliosmoles per kilogram of water.

Relationship of Osmolality to Osmotic Pressure. At normal body temperature, $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(98.6^{\prime} \mathrm{F}\right)$, a concentration of 1 osmole per liter will cause $19,300 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ osmotic pressure in the solution. Likewise, 1 milliosmole per liter concentration is equivalent to 19.3 mm Hg osmotic pressure. Multiplying this value by the 300-milliosmolar concentration of the body fluids gives a total calculated osmotic pressure of the body fluids of 5790 mm Hg . The measured value for this, however, averages only about 5500 mm Hg . The reason for this difference is that many ions in the body fluids, such as sodium and chloride ions, are highly attracted to one another; consequently, they cannot move entirely unrestrained in the fluids and create their full osmotic pressure potential. Therefore, on average, the actual osmotic pressure of the body fluids is about 0.93 times the calculated value.

The Term Osmolarity. Osmolarity is the osmolar concentration expressed as osmoles per liter of solution rather than osmoles per kilogram of water. Although, strictly speaking, it is osmoles per kilogram of water (osmolality) that determines osmotic pressure, the quantitative differences between osmolarity and osmolality are less than $1 \%$ for dilute solutions such as those in the body. Because it is far more practical to measure osmolarity than osmolality, measuring osmolarity is the usual practice in physiological studies.

## ACTIVE TRANSPORT OF SUBSTANCES THROUGH MEMBRANES

At times, a large concentration of a substance is required in the intracellular fluid, even though the extracellular fluid contains only a small concentration. This situation is true, for example, for potassium ions. Conversely, it is important to keep the concentrations of other ions very low inside the cell, even though their concentrations in the extracellular fluid are high. This situation is especially true for sodium ions. Neither of these two effects could occur by simple diffusion because simple diffusion eventually equilibrates concentrations on the two sides of the membrane. Instead, some energy source must cause excess movement of potassium ions to the inside of cells and excess movement of sodium ions to the outside of cells. When a cell membrane moves molecules or ions uphill against a concentration gradient (or uphill against an electrical or pressure gradient), the process is called active transport.

Some examples of substances that are actively transported through at least some cell membranes include

sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, hydrogen, chloride, iodide, and urate ions, several different sugars, and most of the amino acids.

Primary Active Transport and Secondary Active Transport. Active transport is divided into two types according to the source of the energy used to facilitate the transport, primary active transport and secondary active transport. In primary active transport, the energy is derived directly from the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or some other high-energy phosphate compound. In secondary active transport, the energy is derived secondarily from energy that has been stored in the form of ionic concentration differences of secondary molecular or ionic substances between the two sides of a cell membrane, created originally by primary active transport. In both cases, transport depends on carrier proteins that penetrate through the cell membrane, as is true for facilitated diffusion. However, in active transport, the carrier protein functions differently from the carrier in facilitated diffusion because it is capable of imparting energy to the transported substance to move it against the electrochemical gradient. The following sections provide some examples of primary active transport and secondary active transport, with more detailed explanations of their principles of function.

## PRIMARY ACTIVE TRANSPORT

## Sodium-Potassium Pump Transports Sodium Ions Out of Cells and Potassium Ions into Cells

Among the substances that are transported by primary active transport are sodium, potassium, calcium, hydrogen, chloride, and a few other ions. The active transport mechanism that has been studied in greatest detail is the sodium-potassium $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)$pump, a transporter that pumps sodium ions outward through the cell membrane of all cells and, at the same time, pumps potassium ions from the outside to the inside. This pump is responsible for maintaining the sodium and potassium concentration differences across the cell membrane, as well as for establishing a negative electrical voltage inside the cells. Indeed, Chapter 5 shows that this pump is also the basis of nerve function, transmitting nerve signals throughout the nervous system.

Figure 4-12 shows the basic physical components of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump. The carrier protein is a complex of two separate globular proteins-a larger one called the $\alpha$ subunit, with a molecular weight of about 100,000, and a smaller one called the $\beta$ subunit, with a molecular weight of about 55,000 . Although the function of the smaller protein is not known (except that it might anchor the protein complex in the lipid membrane), the larger protein has three specific features that are important for the functioning of the pump:

1. It has three binding sites for sodium ions on the portion of the protein that protrudes to the inside of the cell.
![gu122415823e](gu122415823e.jpg)

Figure 4-12. Postulated mechanism of the sodium-potassium pump. ADP, Adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; Pi, phosphate ion.
2. It has two binding sites for potassium ions on the outside.
3. The inside portion of this protein near the sodium binding sites has adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity.
When two potassium ions bind on the outside of the carrier protein and three sodium ions bind on the inside, the ATPase function of the protein becomes activated. Activation of the ATPase function leads to cleavage of one molecule of ATP, splitting it to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and liberating a high-energy phosphate bond of energy. This liberated energy is believed to cause a chemical and conformational change in the protein carrier molecule, extruding three sodium ions to the outside and two potassium ions to the inside.

As with other enzymes, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase pump can run in reverse. If the electrochemical gradients for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$are experimentally increased to the degree that the energy stored in their gradients is greater than the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis, these ions will move down their concentration gradients, and the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump will synthesize ATP from ADP and phosphate. The phosphorylated form of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump, therefore, can either donate its phosphate to ADP to produce ATP or use the energy to change its conformation and pump $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$out of the cell and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$into the cell. The relative concentrations of ATP, ADP, and phosphate, as well as the electrochemical gradients for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, determine the direction of the enzyme reaction. For some cells, such as electrically active nerve cells, $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ of the cell's energy requirement may be devoted to pumping $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$out of the cell and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ into the cell.

The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$Pump Is Important for Controlling Cell Volume. One of the most important functions of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump is to control the cell volume. Without function of this pump, most cells of the body would swell until they burst.

The mechanism for controlling the volume is as follows. Inside the cell are large numbers of proteins and other organic molecules that cannot escape from the cell. Most of these proteins and other organic molecules are negatively charged and, therefore, attract large numbers of potassium, sodium, and other positive ions. All these molecules and ions then cause osmosis of water to the interior of the cell. Unless this process is checked, the cell will swell indefinitely until it bursts. The normal mechanism for preventing this outcome is the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump. Note again that this mechanism pumps three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions to the outside of the cell for every two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions pumped to the interior. Also, the membrane is far less permeable to sodium ions than to potassium ions and, once the sodium ions are on the outside, they have a strong tendency to stay there. This process thus represents a net loss of ions out the cell, which also initiates osmosis of water out of the cell.

If a cell begins to swell for any reason, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ pump is automatically activated, moving still more ions to the exterior and carrying water with them. Therefore, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump performs a continual surveillance role in maintaining normal cell volume.

Electrogenic Nature of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$Pump. The fact that the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump moves three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions to the exterior for every two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions that are moved to the interior means that a net of one positive charge is moved from the interior of the cell to the exterior of the cell for each cycle of the pump. This action creates positivity outside the cell but results in a deficit of positive ions inside the cell; that is, it causes negativity on the inside. Therefore, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump is said to be electrogenic because it creates an electrical potential across the cell membrane. As discussed in Chapter 5, this electrical potential is a basic requirement in nerve and muscle fibers for transmitting nerve and muscle signals.

## Primary Active Transport of Calcium Ions

Another important primary active transport mechanism is the calcium pump. Calcium ions are normally maintained at an extremely low concentration in the intracellular cytosol of virtually all cells in the body, at a concentration about 10,000 times less than that in the extracellular fluid. This level of maintenance is achieved mainly by two primary active transport calcium pumps. One, which is in the cell membrane, pumps calcium to the outside of the cell. The other pumps calcium ions into one or more of the intracellular vesicular organelles of the cell, such as the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells and the mitochondria in all cells. In each of these cases, the carrier protein penetrates the membrane and functions as an enzyme ATPase, with the same capability to cleave ATP as the ATPase of the sodium carrier protein. The difference is that this protein has a highly specific binding site for calcium instead of for sodium.

## Primary Active Transport of Hydrogen Ions

Primary active transport of hydrogen ions is especially important at two places in the body: (1) in the gastric glands of the stomach; and (2) in the late distal tubules and cortical collecting ducts of the kidneys.

In the gastric glands, the deep-lying parietal cells have the most potent primary active mechanism for transporting hydrogen ions of any part of the body. This mechanism is the basis for secreting hydrochloric acid in stomach digestive secretions. At the secretory ends of the gastric gland parietal cells, the hydrogen ion concentration is increased as much as a million-fold and then is released into the stomach, along with chloride ions, to form hydrochloric acid.

In the renal tubules, special intercalated cells found in the late distal tubules and cortical collecting ducts also transport hydrogen ions by primary active transport. In this case, large amounts of hydrogen ions are secreted from the blood into the renal tubular fluid for the purpose of eliminating excess hydrogen ions from the body fluids. The hydrogen ions can be secreted into the renal tubular fluid against a concentration gradient of about 900 -fold. Yet, as discussed in Chapter 31, most of these hydrogen ions combine with tubular fluid buffers before they are eliminated in the urine

## Energetics of Primary Active Transport

The amount of energy required to transport a substance actively through a membrane is determined by how much the substance is concentrated during transport. Compared with the energy required to concentrate a substance 10 -fold, concentrating it 100 -fold requires twice as much energy, and concentrating it 1000 -fold requires three times as much energy. In other words, the energy required is proportional to the logarithm of the degree that the substance is concentrated, as expressed by the following formula:

$$
\text { Energy (in calories per osmole) }=1400 \log \frac{\mathrm{C}_{1}}{\mathrm{C}_{2}}
$$

Thus, in terms of calories, the amount of energy required to concentrate 1 osmole of a substance 10 -fold is about 1400 calories, whereas to concentrate it 100 -fold, 2800 calories are required. One can see that the energy expenditure for concentrating substances in cells or for removing substances from cells against a concentration gradient can be tremendous. Some cells, such as those lining the renal tubules and many glandular cells, expend as much as $90 \%$ of their energy for this purpose alone.

## SECONDARY ACTIVE TRANSPORT- CO-TRANSPORT AND COUNTER-TRANSPORT

When sodium ions are transported out of cells by primary active transport, a large concentration gradient of

sodium ions across the cell membrane usually develops, with a high concentration outside the cell and a low concentration inside. This gradient represents a storehouse of energy, because the excess sodium outside the cell membrane is always attempting to diffuse to the interior. Under appropriate conditions, this diffusion energy of sodium can pull other substances along with the sodium through the cell membrane. This phenomenon, called cotransport, is one form of secondary active transport.

For sodium to pull another substance along with it, a coupling mechanism is required; this is achieved by means of still another carrier protein in the cell membrane. The carrier in this case serves as an attachment point for both the sodium ion and the substance to be co-transported. Once they are both attached, the energy gradient of the sodium ion causes the sodium ion and the other substance to be transported together to the interior of the cell.

In counter-transport, sodium ions again attempt to diffuse to the interior of the cell because of their large concentration gradient. However, this time, the substance to be transported is on the inside of the cell and is transported to the outside. Therefore, the sodium ion binds to the carrier protein, where it projects to the exterior surface of the membrane, and the substance to be countertransported binds to the interior projection of the carrier protein. Once both have become bound, a conformational change occurs, and energy released by the action of the sodium ion moving to the interior causes the other substance to move to the exterior.

## Co-Transport of Glucose and Amino Acids Along with Sodium lons

Glucose and many amino acids are transported into most cells against large concentration gradients; the mechanism of this action is entirely by co-transport, as shown in Figure 4-13. Note that the transport carrier protein has two binding sites on its exterior side, one for sodium and one for glucose. Also, the concentration of sodium ions is high on the outside and low on the inside, which provides energy for the transport. A special property of the transport protein is that a conformational change to allow sodium movement to the interior will not occur until a glucose molecule also attaches. When they both become attached, the conformational change takes place, and the sodium and glucose are transported to the inside of the cell at the same time. Hence, this is a sodium-glucose co-transporter. Sodium-glucose cotransporters are especially important for transporting glucose across renal and intestinal epithelial cells, as discussed in Chapters 28 and 66.

Sodium co-transport of amino acids occurs in the same manner as for glucose, except that it uses a different set of transport proteins. At least five amino acid transport proteins have been identified, each of which is responsible for transporting one subset of amino acids with specific molecular characteristics.
![gu132415823e](gu132415823e.jpg)

Figure 4-13 Postulated mechanism for sodium co-transport of glucose.
![gu142415823e](gu142415823e.jpg)

Figure 4-14. Sodium counter-transport of calcium and hydrogen ions.
Sodium co-transport of glucose and amino acids occurs especially through the epithelial cells of the intestinal tract and the renal tubules of the kidneys to promote absorption of these substances into the blood. This process will be discussed in later chapters.

Other important co-transport mechanisms in at least some cells include co-transport of potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, phosphate, iodine, iron, and urate ions.

## Sodium Counter-Transport of Calcium and Hydrogen lons

Two especially important counter-transporters (i.e., transport in a direction opposite to the primary ion) are sodium-calcium counter-transport and sodium-hydrogen counter-transport (Figure 4-14).

Sodium-calcium counter-transport occurs through all or almost all cell membranes, with sodium ions moving to the interior and calcium ions to the exterior; both are bound to the same transport protein in a countertransport mode. This mechanism is in addition to the primary active transport of calcium that occurs in some cells.

Sodium-hydrogen counter-transport occurs in several tissues. An especially important example is in the proximal tubules of the kidneys, where sodium ions move from the lumen of the tubule to the interior of the tubular cell and hydrogen ions are counter-transported into the tubule lumen. As a mechanism for concentrating hydrogen ions, counter-transport is not nearly as powerful as the primary active transport of hydrogen ions that occurs in the more distal renal tubules, but it can transport extremely large numbers of hydrogen ions, thus making it a key to hydrogen ion control in the body fluids, as discussed in detail in Chapter 31.

![gu152415823e](gu152415823e.jpg)

Figure 4-15. Basic mechanism of active transport across a layer of cells.

## ACTIVE TRANSPORT THROUGH CELLULAR SHEETS

At many places in the body, substances must be transported all the way through a cellular sheet instead of simply through the cell membrane. Transport of this type occurs through the following: (1) intestinal epithelium; (2) epithelium of the renal tubules; (3) epithelium of all exocrine glands; (4) epithelium of the gallbladder; and (5) membrane of the choroid plexus of the brain, along with other membranes.

The basic mechanism for transport of a substance through a cellular sheet is as follows: (1) active transport through the cell membrane on one side of the transporting cells in the sheet; and then (2) either simple diffusion or facilitated diffusion through the membrane on the opposite side of the cell.

Figure 4-15 shows a mechanism for the transport of sodium ions through the epithelial sheet of the intestines, gallbladder, and renal tubules. This figure shows that the epithelial cells are connected together tightly at the luminal pole by means of junctions. The brush border on the luminal surfaces of the cells is permeable to both sodium ions and water. Therefore, sodium and water diffuse readily from the lumen into the interior of the cell. Then, at the basal and lateral membranes of the cells, sodium ions are actively transported into the extracellular fluid of the surrounding connective tissue and blood vessels. This action creates a high sodium ion concentration gradient across these membranes, which in turn causes osmosis of water. Thus, active transport of sodium ions at the basolateral sides of the epithelial cells results in the transport not only of sodium ions but also of water.

It is through these mechanisms that almost all nutrients, ions, and other substances are absorbed into the
blood from the intestine. These mechanisms are also how the same substances are reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate by the renal tubules.

Numerous examples of the different types of transport discussed in this chapter are provided throughout this text.

# Membrane Potentials and Action Potentials 

Electrical potentials exist across the membranes of virtually all cells of the body. Some cells, such as nerve and muscle cells, generate rapidly changing electrochemical impulses at their membranes, and these impulses are used to transmit signals along the nerve or muscle membranes. In other types of cells, such as glandular cells, macrophages, and ciliated cells, local changes in membrane potentials also activate many of the cell's functions. This chapter reviews the basic mechanisms whereby membrane potentials are generated at rest and during action by nerve and muscle cells. See Video 5-1.

## BASIC PHYSICS OF MEMBRANE POTENTIALS

## Membrane Potentials Caused by Ion Concentration Differences Across a Selectively Permeable Membrane

In Figure 5-1A, the potassium concentration is great inside a nerve fiber membrane but very low outside the membrane. Let us assume that the membrane in this case is permeable to the potassium ions but not to any other ions. Because of the large potassium concentration gradient from the inside toward the outside, there is a strong tendency for potassium ions to diffuse outward through the membrane. As they do so, they carry positive electrical charges to the outside, thus creating electropositivity outside the membrane and electronegativity inside the membrane because of negative anions that remain behind and do not diffuse outward with the potassium. Within about 1 millisecond, the potential difference between the inside and outside, called the diffusion potential, becomes great enough to block further net potassium diffusion to the exterior, despite the high potassium ion concentration gradient. In the normal mammalian nerve fiber, the potential difference is about 94 millivolts, with negativity inside the fiber membrane.

Figure 5-1B shows the same phenomenon as in Figure 5-1A, but this time with a high concentration of sodium ions outside the membrane and a low concentration of sodium ions inside. These ions are also positively charged. This time, the membrane is highly permeable to the sodium ions but is impermeable to all other ions. Diffusion of the positively charged sodium ions to the inside
creates a membrane potential of opposite polarity to that in Figure 5-1A, with negativity outside and positivity inside. Again, the membrane potential rises high enough within milliseconds to block further net diffusion of sodium ions to the inside; however, this time, in the mammalian nerve fiber, the potential is about 61 millivolts positive inside the fiber.

Thus, in both parts of Figure 5-1, we see that a concentration difference of ions across a selectively permeable membrane can, under appropriate conditions, create a membrane potential. Later in this chapter, we show that many of the rapid changes in membrane potentials observed during nerve and muscle impulse transmission result from such rapidly changing diffusion potentials.

The Nernst Equation Describes the Relationship of Diffusion Potential to the Ion Concentration Difference Across a Membrane. The diffusion potential across a membrane that exactly opposes the net diffusion of a particular ion through the membrane is called the Nernst potential for that ion, a term that was introduced in Chapter 4. The magnitude of the Nernst potential is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of that specific ion on the two sides of the membrane. The greater this ratio, the greater the tendency for the ion to diffuse in one direction and therefore the greater the Nernst potential required to prevent additional net diffusion. The following equation, called the Nernst equation, can be used to calculate the Nernst potential for any univalent ion at the normal body temperature of $98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ :

$$
\text { EMF (millivolts) }= \pm \frac{61}{z} \times \log \frac{\text { Concentration inside }}{\text { Concentration outside }}
$$

where EMF is the electromotive force and z is the electrical charge of the ion (e.g., +1 for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$).

When using this formula, it is usually assumed that the potential in the extracellular fluid outside the membrane remains at zero potential, and the Nernst potential is the potential inside the membrane. Also, the sign of the potential is positive $(+)$ if the ion diffusing from inside to outside is a negative ion, and it is negative $(-)$ if the ion is positive. Thus, when the concentration of positive potassium ions on the inside is 10 times that on the outside, the log of 10 is 1 , so the Nernst potential calculates to be -61 millivolts inside the membrane.

![gu162415823e](gu162415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-1 A, Establishment of a diffusion potential across a nerve fiber membrane, caused by diffusion of potassium ions from inside the cell to outside the cell through a membrane that is selectively permeable only to potassium. B, Establishment of a diffusion potential when the nerve fiber membrane is permeable only to sodium ions. Note that the internal membrane potential is negative when potassium ions diffuse and positive when sodium ions diffuse because of opposite concentration gradients of these two ions.

The Goldman Equation Is Used to Calculate the Diffusion Potential When the Membrane Is Permeable to Several Different Ions. When a membrane is permeable to several different ions, the diffusion potential that develops depends on three factors: (1) the polarity of the electrical charge of each ion; (2) the permeability of the membrane ( P ) to each ion; and (3) the concentration $(\mathrm{C})$ of the respective ions on the inside (i) and outside (o) of the membrane. Thus, the following formula, called the Goldman equation or the Goldman-HodgkinKatz equation, gives the calculated membrane potential on the inside of the membrane when two univalent positive ions, sodium $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$and potassium $\left(\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)$, and one univalent negative ion, chloride $\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$, are involved:

$$
\text { EMF (millivolts) }=-61 \times \log \frac{C_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} P_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}+C_{\mathrm{K}^{+}} P_{\mathrm{K}^{+}}+C_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} P_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}}{C_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} P_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}+C_{\mathrm{K}^{+}} P_{\mathrm{K}^{+}}+C_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} P_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}}
$$

Several key points become evident from the Goldman equation. First, sodium, potassium, and chloride ions are the most important ions involved in the development of membrane potentials in nerve and muscle fibers, as well as in the neuronal cells. The concentration gradient of each of these ions across the membrane helps determine the voltage of the membrane potential.

Second, the quantitative importance of each of the ions in determining the voltage is proportional to the membrane permeability for that particular ion. If the membrane has zero permeability to sodium and chloride ions, the membrane potential becomes entirely dominated by the concentration gradient of potassium ions alone, and the resulting potential will be equal to the Nernst potential for potassium. The same holds true for each of the other two ions if the membrane should become selectively permeable for either one of them alone.

Third, a positive ion concentration gradient from inside the membrane to the outside causes electronegativity

Table 5-1 Resting Membrane Potential in Different Cell Types

| Cell Type | Resting Potential (mV) |
| :-- | :-- |
| Neurons | -60 to -70 |
| Skeletal muscle | -85 to -95 |
| Smooth muscle | -50 to -60 |
| Cardiac muscle | -80 to -90 |
| Hair (cochlea) | -15 to -40 |
| Astrocyte | -80 to -90 |
| Erythrocyte | -8 to -12 |
| Photoreceptor | -40 (dark) to -70 (light) |

inside the membrane. The reason for this phenomenon is that excess positive ions diffuse to the outside when their concentration is higher inside than outside the membrane. This diffusion carries positive charges to the outside but leaves the nondiffusible negative anions on the inside, thus creating electronegativity on the inside. The opposite effect occurs when there is a gradient for a negative ion. That is, a chloride ion gradient from the outside to the inside causes negativity inside the cell because excess negatively charged chloride ions diffuse to the inside while leaving the nondiffusible positive ions on the outside.

Fourth, as explained later, the permeability of the sodium and potassium channels undergoes rapid changes during transmission of a nerve impulse, whereas the permeability of the chloride channels does not change greatly during this process. Therefore, rapid changes in sodium and potassium permeability are primarily responsible for signal transmission in neurons, which is the subject of most of the remainder of this chapter.

Resting Membrane Potential of Different Cell Types. In some cells, such as the cardiac pacemaker cells discussed in Chapter 10, the membrane potential is continuously changing, and the cells are never "resting". In many other cells, even excitable cells, there is a quiescent period in which a resting membrane potential can be measured. Table 5-1 shows the approximate resting membrane potentials of some different types of cells. The membrane potential is obviously very dynamic in excitable cells such as neurons, in which action potentials occur. However, even in nonexcitable cells, the membrane potential (voltage) also changes in response to various stimuli, which alter activities for the various ion transporters, ion channels, and membrane permeability for sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride ions. The resting membrane potential is, therefore, only a brief transient state for many cells.

Electrochemical Driving Force. When multiple ions contribute to the membrane potential, the equilibrium potential for any of the contributing ions will differ from the membrane potential, and there will be an electrochemical driving force $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{d}}\right)$ for each ion that tends to cause net

![gu172415823e](gu172415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-2 Measurement of the membrane potential of the nerve fiber using a microelectrode.
movement of the ion across the membrane. This driving force is equal to the difference between the membrane potential $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ and the equilibrium potential of the ion $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{eq}}\right)$ Thus, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{df}}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{m}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{eq}}$

The arithmetic sign of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{df}}$ (positive or negative) and the valence of the ion (cation or anion) can be used to predict the direction of ion flow across the membrane, into or out of the cell. For cations such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, a positive $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{df}}$ predicts ion movement out of the cell down its electrochemical gradient, and a negative $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{df}}$ predicts ion movement into the cell. For anions, such as $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, a positive $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{df}}$ predicts ion movement into the cell, and a negative $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{df}}$ predicts ion movement out of the cell. When $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{m}}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{eq}}$, there is no net movement of the ion into or out of the cell. Also, the direction of ion flux through the membrane reverses as $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{m}}$ becomes greater than or less than $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{eq}}$; hence, the equilibrium potential $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{eq}}\right)$ is also called the reversal potential.

## Measuring the Membrane Potential

The method for measuring the membrane potential is simple in theory but often difficult in practice because of the small size of most of the cells and fibers. Figure 5-2 shows a small micropipette filled with an electrolyte solution. The micropipette is impaled through the cell membrane to the interior of the fiber. Another electrode, called the indifferent electrode, is then placed in the extracellular fluid, and the potential difference between the inside and outside of the fiber is measured using an appropriate voltmeter. This voltmeter is a highly sophisticated electronic apparatus that is capable of measuring small voltages despite extremely high resistance to electrical flow through the tip of the micropipette, which has a lumen diameter usually less than 1 micrometer and a resistance of more than 1 million ohms. For recording rapid changes in the membrane potential during transmission of nerve impulses, the microelectrode is connected to an oscilloscope, as explained later in the chapter.

The lower part of Figure 5-3 shows the electrical potential that is measured at each point in or near the nerve fiber membrane, beginning at the left side of the figure and passing to the right. As long as the electrode is outside the neuronal membrane, the recorded potential
![gu182415823e](gu182415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-3 Distribution of positively and negatively charged ions in the extracellular fluid surrounding a nerve fiber and in the fluid inside the fiber. Note the alignment of negative charges along the inside surface of the membrane and positive charges along the outside surface. The lower panel displays the abrupt changes in membrane potential that occur at the membranes on the two sides of the fiber.
is zero, which is the potential of the extracellular fluid. Then, as the recording electrode passes through the voltage change area at the cell membrane (called the electrical dipole layer), the potential decreases abruptly to $\sim 70$ millivolts. Moving across the center of the fiber, the potential remains at a steady $\sim 70$-millivolt level but reverses back to zero the instant it passes through the membrane on the opposite side of the fiber.

To create a negative potential inside the membrane, only enough positive ions to develop the electrical dipole layer at the membrane itself must be transported outward. The remaining ions inside the nerve fiber can be both positive and negative, as shown in the upper panel of Figure 5-3. Therefore, transfer of an incredibly small number of ions through the membrane can establish the normal resting potential of -70 millivolts inside the nerve fiber, which means that only about $1 / 3,000,000$ to $1 / 100,000,000$ of the total positive charges inside the fiber must be transferred. Also, an equally small number of positive ions moving from outside to inside the fiber can reverse the potential from -70 millivolts to as much as +35 millivolts within as little as $1 / 10,000$ of a second. Rapid shifting of ions in this manner causes the nerve signals discussed in subsequent sections of this chapter.

## RESTING MEMBRANE POTENTIAL OF NEURONS

The resting membrane potential of large nerve fibers when they are not transmitting nerve signals is about -70 millivolts. That is, the potential inside the fiber is 70 millivolts more negative than the potential in the extracellular fluid on the outside of the fiber. In the next few paragraphs, the transport properties of the resting nerve membrane for

Figure 5-4 Functional characteristics of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump and the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ "leak" channels. The $\mathrm{K}^{+}$leak channels also leak $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions into the cell slightly but are much more permeable to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. ADP, Adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate.
sodium and potassium and the factors that determine the level of this resting potential are explained.

Active Transport of Sodium and Potassium Ions Through the Membrane-the Sodium-Potassium ( $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$) Pump. Recall from Chapter 4 that all cell membranes of the body have a powerful $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump that continually transports sodium ions to the outside of the cell and potassium ions to the inside, as illustrated on the left side in Figure 5-4. Note that this is an electrogenic pump because three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions are pumped to the outside for each two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions to the inside, leaving a net deficit of positive ions on the inside and causing a negative potential inside the cell membrane.

The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump also causes large concentration gradients for sodium and potassium across the resting nerve membrane. These gradients are as follows:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{Na}^{+} \text {(outside): } 142 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L} \\
\mathrm{Na}^{+}(\text {inside): } 14 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L} \\
\mathrm{~K}^{+} \text {(outside): } 4 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L} \\
\mathrm{~K}^{+} \text {(inside): } 140 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}
\end{gathered}
$$

The ratios of these two respective ions from the inside to the outside are as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Na}_{\text {inside }}^{+}{ }_{\text {iside }} / \mathrm{Na}_{\text {outside }}=0.1 \\
& \mathrm{~K}_{\text {inside }}^{+}{ }_{\text {iside }}=35.0
\end{aligned}
$$

Leakage of Potassium Through the Nerve Cell Membrane. The right side of Figure 5-4 shows a channel protein (sometimes called a tandem pore domain, potassium channel, or potassium $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$"leak" channel) in the nerve membrane through which potassium ions can leak, even in a resting cell. The basic structure of potassium channels was described in Chapter 4 (Figure 4-4). These $\mathrm{K}^{+}$leak

channels may also leak sodium ions slightly but are far more permeable to potassium than to sodium, normally about 100 times as permeable. As discussed later, this differential in permeability is a key factor in determining the level of the normal resting membrane potential.

## Origin of the Normal Resting Membrane Potential

Figure 5-5 shows the important factors in the establishment of the normal resting membrane potential. They are as follows.

## Contribution of the Potassium Diffusion Potential.

In Figure 5-5A, we assume that the only movement of ions through the membrane is diffusion of potassium ions, as demonstrated by the open channels between the potassium symbol $\left(\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)$inside and outside the mem-

brane. Because of the high ratio of potassium ions inside to outside, $35: 1$, the Nernst potential corresponding to this ratio is -94 millivolts because the logarithm of 35 is 1.54 , and this, multiplied by -61 millivolts, is -94 millivolts. Therefore, if potassium ions were the only factor causing the resting potential, the resting potential inside the fiber would be equal to -94 millivolts, as shown in the figure.

## Contribution of Sodium Diffusion Through the

Nerve Membrane. Figure 5-5B shows the addition of slight permeability of the nerve membrane to sodium ions, caused by the minute diffusion of sodium ions through the $\mathrm{K}^{+}-\mathrm{Na}^{+}$leak channels. The ratio of sodium ions from inside to outside the membrane is 0.1 , which gives a calculated Nernst potential for the inside of the membrane of +61 millivolts. Also shown in Figure 5-5B is the Nernst potential for potassium diffusion of -94 millivolts. How do these interact with each other, and what will be the summated potential? This question can be answered by using the Goldman equation described previously. Intuitively, one can see that if the membrane is highly permeable to potassium but only slightly permeable to sodium, the diffusion of potassium contributes far more to the membrane potential than the diffusion of sodium. In the normal nerve fiber, the permeability of the membrane to potassium is about 100 times as great as its permeability to sodium. Using this value in the Goldman equation, and considering only sodium and potassium, gives a potential inside the membrane of -86 millivolts, which is near the potassium potential shown in the figure.

Contribution of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$Pump. In Figure 5-5C, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump is shown to provide an additional contribution to the resting potential. This figure shows that continuous pumping of three sodium ions to the outside occurs for each two potassium ions pumped to the inside of the membrane. The pumping of more sodium ions to the outside than the potassium ions being pumped to the inside causes a continual loss of positive charges from inside the membrane, creating an additional degree of negativity (about -4 millivolts additional) on the inside, beyond that which can be accounted for by diffusion alone.

Therefore, as shown in Figure 5-5C, the net membrane potential when all these factors are operative at the same time is about -90 millivolts. However, additional ions, such as chloride, must also be considered in calculating the membrane potential.

In summary, the diffusion potentials alone caused by potassium and sodium diffusion would give a membrane potential of about -86 millivolts, with almost all of this being determined by potassium diffusion. An additional -4 millivolts is then contributed to the membrane potential by the continuously acting electrogenic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ $\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump, and there is a contribution of chloride ions. As mentioned previously, the resting membrane potential

varies in different cells from as low as around -10 millivolts in erythrocytes to as high as -90 millivolts in skeletal muscle cells.

## NEURON ACTION POTENTIAL

Nerve signals are transmitted by action potentials, which are rapid changes in the membrane potential that spread rapidly along the nerve fiber membrane. Each action potential begins with a sudden change from the normal resting negative membrane potential to a positive potential and ends with an almost equally rapid change back to the negative potential. To conduct a nerve signal, the action potential moves along the nerve fiber until it comes to the fiber's end.

The upper panel of Figure 5-6 shows the changes that occur at the membrane during the action potential, with the transfer of positive charges to the interior of the fiber at its onset and the return of positive charges to the exterior at its end. The lower panel shows graphically the successive changes in membrane potential over a few 10,000ths of a second, illustrating the explosive onset of the action potential and the almost equally rapid recovery.

The successive stages of the action potential are as follows.
Resting Stage. The resting stage is the resting membrane potential before the action potential begins. The membrane is said to be "polarized" during this stage because of the -70 millivolts negative membrane potential that is present.

Depolarization Stage. At this time, the membrane suddenly becomes permeable to sodium ions, allowing rapid diffusion of positively charged sodium ions to the interior of the axon. The normal polarized state of -70 millivolts is immediately neutralized by the inflowing, positively charged sodium ions, with the potential rising rapidly in the positive direction-a process called depolarization. In large nerve fibers, the great excess of positive sodium ions moving to the inside causes the membrane potential to actually overshoot beyond the zero level and to become somewhat positive. In some smaller fibers, as well as in many central nervous system neurons, the potential merely approaches the zero level and does not overshoot to the positive state.

Repolarization Stage. Within a few 10,000ths of a second after the membrane becomes highly permeable to sodium ions, the sodium channels begin to close, and the potassium channels open to a greater degree than normal. Then, rapid diffusion of potassium ions to the exterior reestablishes the normal negative resting membrane potential, which is called repolarization of the membrane.

To explain more fully the factors that cause both depolarization and repolarization, we will describe the special characteristics of two other types of transport channels through the nerve membrane, the voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels.

## VOLTAGE-GATED SODIUM AND POTASSIUM CHANNELS

The necessary factor in causing both depolarization and repolarization of the nerve membrane during the action potential is the voltage-gated sodium channel. A voltagegated potassium channel also plays an important role in increasing the rapidity of repolarization of the membrane. These two voltage-gated channels are in addition to the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump and the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$leak channels.

## Activation and Inactivation of the Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel

The upper panel of Figure 5-7 shows the voltage-gated sodium channel in three separate states. This channel has two gates-one near the outside of the channel called the activation gate, and another near the inside called the inactivation gate. The upper left of the figure depicts the state of these two gates in the normal resting membrane when the membrane potential is -70 millivolts. In this state, the activation gate is closed, which prevents any entry of sodium ions to the interior of the fiber through these sodium channels.

Activation of the Sodium Channel. When the membrane potential becomes less negative than during the resting state, rising from -70 millivolts toward zero, it finally reaches a voltage-usually somewhere around -55 millivolts-that causes a sudden conformational
![gu222415823e](gu222415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-7 Characteristics of the voltage-gated sodium (top) and potassium (bottom) channels, showing successive activation and inactivation of the sodium channels and delayed activation of the potassium channels when the membrane potential is changed from the normal resting negative value to a positive value.
change in the activation gate, flipping it all the way to the open position. During this activated state, sodium ions can pour inward through the channel, increasing the sodium permeability of the membrane as much as 500 - to 5000 -fold.

Inactivation of the Sodium Channel. The upper right panel of Figure 5-7 shows a third state of the sodium channel. The same increase in voltage that opens the activation gate also closes the inactivation gate. The inactivation gate, however, closes a few 10,000ths of a second after the activation gate opens. That is, the conformational change that flips the inactivation gate to the closed state is a slower process than the conformational change that opens the activation gate. Therefore, after the sodium channel has remained open for a few 10,000ths of a second, the inactivation gate closes, and sodium ions no longer can pour to the inside of the membrane. At this point, the membrane potential begins to return toward the resting membrane state, which is the repolarization process.

Another important characteristic of the sodium channel inactivation process is that the inactivation gate will not reopen until the membrane potential returns to or near the original resting membrane potential level. Therefore, it is usually not possible for the sodium channels to open again without first repolarizing the nerve fiber.

## Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel and Its Activation

The lower panel of Figure 5-7 shows the voltage-gated potassium channel in two states-during the resting state

![gu232415823e](gu232415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-8 Voltage clamp method for studying flow of ions through specific channels.
(left) and toward the end of the action potential (right). During the resting state, the gate of the potassium channel is closed, and potassium ions are prevented from passing through this channel to the exterior. When the membrane potential rises from -70 millivolts toward zero, this voltage change causes a conformational opening of the gate and allows increased potassium diffusion outward through the channel. However, because of the slight delay in opening of the potassium channels, they open, for the most part, at about the same time that the sodium channels are beginning to close because of inactivation. Thus, the decrease in sodium entry to the cell and the simultaneous increase in potassium exit from the cell combine to speed the repolarization process, leading to full recovery of the resting membrane potential within another few 10,000ths of a second.

The Voltage Clamp Method for Measuring the Effect of Voltage on Opening and Closing of Voltage-Gated Channels. The original research that led to quantitative understanding of the sodium and potassium channels was so ingenious that it led to Nobel Prizes for the scientists responsible, Hodgkin and Huxley, in 1963. The essence of these studies is shown in Figures. 5-8 and 5-9.

Figure 5-8 shows the voltage clamp method, which is used to measure the flow of ions through the different channels. In using this apparatus, two electrodes are inserted into the nerve fiber. One of these electrodes is used to measure the voltage of the membrane potential, and the other is used to conduct electrical current into or out of the nerve fiber.

This apparatus is used in the following way. The investigator decides which voltage to establish inside the nerve fiber. The electronic portion of the apparatus is then adjusted to the desired voltage, automatically injecting either positive or negative electricity through the current electrode at whatever rate is required to hold the voltage, as measured
![gu242415823e](gu242415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-9 Typical changes in conductance of sodium and potassium ion channels when the membrane potential is suddenly increased from the normal resting value of -70 millivolts to a positive value of +10 millivolts for 2 milliseconds. This figure shows that the sodium channels open (activate) and then close (inactivate) before the end of the 2 milliseconds, whereas the potassium channels only open (activate), and the rate of opening is much slower than that of the sodium channels.
by the voltage electrode, at the level set by the operator. When the membrane potential is suddenly increased by this voltage clamp from -70 millivolts to zero, the voltagegated sodium and potassium channels open, and sodium and potassium ions begin to pour through the channels. To counterbalance the effect of these ion movements on the desired setting of the intracellular voltage, electrical current is injected automatically through the current electrode of the voltage clamp to maintain the intracellular voltage at the required steady zero level. To achieve this level, the current injected must be equal to but of opposite polarity to the net current flow through the membrane channels. To measure how much current flow is occurring at each instant, the current electrode is connected to an ampere meter that records the current flow, as demonstrated in Figure 5-8.

Finally, the investigator adjusts the concentrations of the ions to other than normal levels both inside and outside the nerve fiber and repeats the study. This experiment can be performed easily when using large nerve fibers removed from some invertebrates, especially the giant squid axon, which in some cases is as large as 1 millimeter in diameter. When sodium is the only permeant ion in the solutions inside and outside the squid axon, the voltage clamp measures current flow only through the sodium channels. When potassium is the only permeant ion, current flow only through the potassium channels is measured.

Another means for studying the flow of ions through an individual type of channel is to block one type of channel at a time. For example, the sodium channels can be blocked by a toxin called tetrodotoxin when it is applied to the outside of the cell membrane where the sodium activation gates are located. Conversely, tetraethylammonium ion blocks the potassium channels when it is applied to the interior of the nerve fiber.

Figure 5-9 shows typical changes in conductance of the voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels when the membrane potential is suddenly changed through use of the voltage clamp, from -70 millivolts to +10 millivolts and then, 2 milliseconds later, back to -70 millivolts. Note

the sudden opening of the sodium channels (the activation stage) within a small fraction of a millisecond after the membrane potential is increased to the positive value. However, during the next millisecond or so, the sodium channels automatically close (the inactivation stage).

Note the opening (activation) of the potassium channels, which open less rapidly and reach their full open state only after the sodium channels have almost completely closed. Furthermore, once the potassium channels open, they remain open for the entire duration of the positive membrane potential and do not close again until after the membrane potential is decreased back to a negative value.

## SUMMARY OF EVENTS THAT CAUSE THE ACTION POTENTIAL

Figure 5-10 summarizes the sequential events that occur during and shortly after the action potential. The bottom of the figure shows the changes in membrane conductance for sodium and potassium ions. During the resting state, before the action potential begins, the conductance for potassium ions is 50 to 100 times as great as the conductance for sodium ions. This disparity is caused by much greater leakage of potassium ions than sodium ions through the leak channels. However, at the onset of the action potential, the sodium channels almost instantaneously become activated and allow up to a 5000 -fold increase in sodium conductance. The inactivation process then closes the sodium channels
![gu252415823e](gu252415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-10 Changes in sodium and potassium conductance during the course of the action potential. Sodium conductance increases several thousand-fold during the early stages of the action potential, whereas potassium conductance increases only about 30 -fold during the latter stages of the action potential and for a short period thereafter. (These curves were constructed from theory presented in papers by Hodgkin and Huxley but transposed from a squid axon to apply to the membrane potentials of large mammalian nerve fibers.)
within another fraction of a millisecond. The onset of the action potential also initiates voltage gating of the potassium channels, causing them to begin opening more slowly, a fraction of a millisecond after the sodium channels open. At the end of the action potential, the return of the membrane potential to the negative state causes the potassium channels to close back to their original status but, again, only after an additional millisecond or more delay.

The middle portion of Figure 5-10 shows the ratio of sodium to potassium conductance at each instant during the action potential, and above this depiction is the action potential itself. During the early portion of the action potential, the ratio of sodium to potassium conductance increases more than 1000 -fold. Therefore, far more sodium ions flow to the interior of the fiber than potassium ions to the exterior. This is what causes the membrane potential to become positive at the action potential onset. Then, the sodium channels begin to close, and the potassium channels begin to open; thus, the ratio of conductance shifts far in favor of high potassium conductance but low sodium conductance. This shift allows for a very rapid loss of potassium ions to the exterior but virtually zero flow of sodium ions to the interior. Consequently, the action potential quickly returns to its baseline level.

## Roles of Other Ions During the Action Potential

Thus far, we have considered only the roles of sodium and potassium ions in generating the action potential. At least two other types of ions must be considered, negative anions and calcium ions.

Impermeant Negatively Charged Ions (Anions) Inside the Nerve Axon. Inside the axon are many negatively charged ions that cannot go through the membrane channels. They include the anions of protein molecules and of many organic phosphate compounds and sulfate compounds, among others. Because these ions cannot leave the interior of the axon, any deficit of positive ions inside the membrane leaves an excess of these impermeant negative anions. Therefore, these impermeant negative ions are responsible for the negative charge inside the fiber when there is a net deficit of positively charged potassium ions and other positive ions.

Calcium Ions. The membranes of almost all cells of the body have a calcium pump similar to the sodium pump, and calcium serves along with (or instead of) sodium in some cells to cause most of the action potential. Like the sodium pump, the calcium pump transports calcium ions from the interior to the exterior of the cell membrane (or into the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell), creating a calcium ion gradient of about 10,000 -fold. This process leaves an internal cell concentration of calcium ions of about $10^{-7}$ molar, in contrast to an external concentration of about $10^{-3}$ molar.

In addition, there are voltage-gated calcium channels. Because the calcium ion concentration is more than 10,000 times greater in the extracellular fluid than in the intracellular fluid, there is a tremendous diffusion gradient and elec-

trochemical driving force for the passive flow of calcium ions into the cells. These channels are slightly permeable to sodium ions and calcium ions, but their permeability to calcium is about 1000 -fold greater than to sodium under normal physiological conditions. When the channels open in response to a stimulus that depolarizes the cell membrane, calcium ions flow to the interior of the cell.

A major function of the voltage-gated calcium ion channels is to contribute to the depolarizing phase on the action potential in some cells. The gating of calcium channels, however, is relatively slow, requiring 10 to 20 times as long for activation as for the sodium channels. For this reason, they are often called slow channels, in contrast to the sodium channels, which are called fast channels. Therefore, the opening of calcium channels provides a more sustained depolarization, whereas the sodium channels play a key role in initiating action potentials.

Calcium channels are numerous in cardiac muscle and smooth muscle. In fact, in some types of smooth muscle, the fast sodium channels are hardly present; therefore, the action potentials are caused almost entirely by the activation of slow calcium channels.

Increased Permeability of the Sodium Channels When There Is a Deficit of Calcium Ions. The concentration of calcium ions in the extracellular fluid also has a profound effect on the voltage level at which the sodium channels become activated. When there is a deficit of calcium ions, the sodium channels become activated (opened) by a small increase of the membrane potential from its normal, very negative level. Therefore, the nerve fiber becomes highly excitable, sometimes discharging repetitively without provocation, rather than remaining in the resting state. In fact, the calcium ion concentration needs to fall only $50 \%$ below normal before spontaneous discharge occurs in some peripheral nerves, often causing muscle "tetany." Muscle tetany is sometimes lethal because of tetanic contraction of the respiratory muscles.

The probable way in which calcium ions affect the sodium channels is as follows. These ions appear to bind to the exterior surfaces of the sodium channel protein. The positive charges of these calcium ions, in turn, alter the electrical state of the sodium channel protein, thus altering the voltage level required to open the sodium gate.

## INITIATION OF THE ACTION POTENTIAL

Thus far, we have explained the changing sodium and potassium permeability of the membrane, as well as the development of the action potential, but we have not explained what initiates the action potential.

## A Positive-Feedback Cycle Opens the Sodium Chan-

nels. As long as the membrane of the nerve fiber remains undisturbed, no action potential occurs in the normal nerve. However, if any event causes enough initial rise in the membrane potential from -70 millivolts toward the zero level, the rising voltage will cause many voltage-gated sodium channels to begin opening. This occurrence allows for the rapid inflow of sodium ions, which causes a further
rise in the membrane potential, thus opening still more voltage-gated sodium channels and allowing more streaming of sodium ions to the interior of the fiber. This process is a positive feedback cycle that, once the feedback is strong enough, continues until all the voltage-gated sodium channels have become activated (opened). Then, within another fraction of a millisecond, the rising membrane potential causes closure of the sodium channels and opening of potassium channels, and the action potential soon terminates.

## Initiation of the Action Potential Occurs Only After

the Threshold Potential is Reached. An action potential will not occur until the initial rise in membrane potential is great enough to create the positive feedback described in the preceding paragraph. This occurs when the number of sodium ions entering the fiber is greater than the number of potassium ions leaving the fiber. A sudden rise in membrane potential of 15 to 30 millivolts is usually required. Therefore, a sudden increase in the membrane potential in a large nerve fiber, from -70 millivolts up to about -55 millivolts, usually causes the explosive development of an action potential. This level of -55 millivolts is said to be the threshold for stimulation.

## PROPAGATION OF THE ACTION POTENTIAL

In the preceding paragraphs, we discussed the action potential as though it occurs at one spot on the membrane. However, an action potential elicited at any one point on an excitable membrane usually excites adjacent portions of the membrane, resulting in propagation of the action potential along the membrane. This mechanism is demonstrated in Figure 5-11.

Figure 5-11A shows a normal resting nerve fiber, and Figure 5-11B shows a nerve fiber that has been excited in its midportion, which suddenly develops increased permeability to sodium. The arrows show a local circuit of current flow from the depolarized areas of the membrane to the adjacent resting membrane areas. That is, positive electrical charges are carried by the inward-diffusing sodium ions through the depolarized membrane and then for several millimeters in both directions along the core of the axon. These positive charges increase the voltage for a distance of 1 to 3 millimeters inside the large myelinated fiber to above the threshold voltage value for initiating an action potential. Therefore, the sodium channels in these new areas immediately open, as shown in Figure 5-11C and $D$, and the explosive action potential spreads. These newly depolarized areas produce still more local circuits of current flow farther along the membrane, causing progressively more and more depolarization. Thus, the depolarization process travels along the entire length of the fiber. This transmission of the depolarization process along a nerve or muscle fiber is called a nerve or muscle impulse.

Direction of Propagation. As demonstrated in Figure 511, an excitable membrane has no single direction of propagation, but the action potential travels in all directions away from the stimulus-even along all branches of a nerve fiber-until the entire membrane has become depolarized.

All-or-Nothing Principle. Once an action potential has been elicited at any point on the membrane of a normal fiber, the depolarization process travels over the entire membrane if conditions are right, but it does not travel at all if conditions are not right. This principle is called the all-or-nothing principle, and it applies to all normal excitable tissues. Occasionally, the action potential reaches a point on the membrane at which it does not generate sufficient voltage to stimulate the next area of the membrane. When this situation occurs, the spread of depolarization stops. Therefore, for continued propagation of an impulse to occur, the ratio of action potential to threshold for excitation must at all times be greater than 1 . This "greater than 1" requirement is called the safety factor for propagation.

## RE-ESTABLISHING SODIUM AND POTASSIUM IONIC GRADIENTS AFTER ACTION POTENTIALS ARE COMPLETED-IMPORTANCE OF ENERGY METABOLISM

Transmission of each action potential along a nerve fiber slightly reduces the concentration differences of sodium and potassium inside and outside the membrane because sodium ions diffuse to the inside during depolarization, and potassium ions diffuse to the outside during
![gu262415823e](gu262415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-11 A-D, Propagation of action potentials in both directions along a conductive fiber.
repolarization. For a single action potential, this effect is so minute that it cannot be measured. Indeed, 100,000 to 50 million impulses can be transmitted by large nerve fibers before the concentration differences reach the point that action potential conduction ceases. With time, however, it becomes necessary to re-establish the sodium and potassium membrane concentration differences, which is achieved by action of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump in the same way as described previously for the original establishment of the resting potential. That is, sodium ions that have diffused to the interior of the cell during the action potentials and potassium ions that have diffused to the exterior must be returned to their original state by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ pump. Because this pump requires energy for operation, this "recharging" of the nerve fiber is an active metabolic process, using energy derived from the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) energy system of the cell. Figure 5-12 shows that the nerve fiber produces increased heat during recharging, which is a measure of energy expenditure when the nerve impulse frequency increases.

A special feature of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATP pump is that its degree of activity is strongly stimulated when excess sodium ions accumulate inside the cell membrane. In fact, the pumping activity increases approximately in proportion to the third power of this intracellular sodium concentration. As the internal sodium concentration rises from 10 to $20 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, the activity of the pump does not merely double but increases about eightfold. Therefore, it is easy to understand how the recharging process of the nerve fiber can be set rapidly into motion whenever the concentration differences of sodium and potassium ions across the membrane begin to run down.

## PLATEAU IN SOME ACTION POTENTIALS

In some cases, the excited membrane does not repolarize immediately after depolarization; instead, the potential remains on a plateau near the peak of the spike potential for many milliseconds before repolarization begin. Such a plateau is shown in Figure 5-13; one can readily see that
![gu272415823e](gu272415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-12 Heat production in a nerve fiber at rest and at progressively increasing rates of stimulation.

the plateau greatly prolongs the period of depolarization. This type of action potential occurs in heart muscle fibers, where the plateau lasts for as long as 0.2 to 0.3 second and causes contraction of heart muscle to last for this same long period.

The cause of the plateau is a combination of several factors. First, in heart muscle, two types of channels contribute to the depolarization process: (1) the usual voltage-activated sodium channels, called fast channels; and (2) voltageactivated calcium-sodium channels (L-type calcium channels), which are slow to open and therefore are called slow channels. Opening of fast channels causes the spike portion of the action potential, whereas the prolonged opening of the slow calcium-sodium channels mainly allows calcium ions to enter the fiber, which is largely responsible for the plateau portion of the action potential.

Another factor that may be partly responsible for the plateau is that the voltage-gated potassium channels are slower to open than usual, often not opening much until the end of the plateau. This factor delays the return of the membrane potential toward its normal negative value of -70 millivolts. The plateau ends when the calciumsodium channels close, and permeability to potassium ions increases.

## RHYTHMICITY OF SOME EXCITABLE TISSUES-REPETITIVE DISCHARGE

Repetitive self-induced discharges occur normally in the heart, in most smooth muscle, and in many of the neurons of the central nervous system. These rhythmical discharges cause the following: (1) rhythmical beat of the heart; (2) rhythmical peristalsis of the intestines; and (3) neuronal events such as the rhythmical control of breathing.

In addition, almost all other excitable tissues can discharge repetitively if the threshold for stimulation of the tissue cells is reduced to a low enough level. For example, even large nerve fibers and skeletal muscle fibers, which normally are highly stable, discharge repetitively when they

Figure 5-13 Action potential (in millivolts) from a Purkinje fiber of the heart, showing a plateau.
are placed in a solution that contains the drug veratridine, which activates sodium ion channels, or when the calcium ion concentration decreases below a critical value, which increases the sodium permeability of the membrane.

Re-Excitation Process Necessary for Spontaneous Rhythmicity. For spontaneous rhythmicity to occur, the membrane-even in its natural state-must be permeable enough to sodium ions (or to calcium and sodium ions through the slow calcium-sodium channels) to allow automatic membrane depolarization. Thus, Figure 5-14 shows that the resting membrane potential in the rhythmical control center of the heart is only -60 to -70 millivolts, which is not enough negative voltage to keep the sodium and calcium channels totally closed. Therefore, the following sequence occurs: (1) some sodium and calcium ions flow inward; (2) this activity increases the membrane voltage in the positive direction, which further increases membrane permeability; (3) still more ions flow inward; and (4) the permeability increases more, and so on, until an action potential is generated. Then, at the end of the action potential, the membrane repolarizes. After another delay of milliseconds or seconds, spontaneous excitability causes depolarization again, and a new action potential occurs spontaneously. This cycle continues over and over and causes self-induced rhythmical excitation of the excitable tissue.

Why does the membrane of the heart control center not depolarize immediately after it has become repolarized, rather than delaying for nearly 1 second before the onset of the next action potential? The answer can be found by observing the curve labeled "potassium conductance" in Figure 5-14. This curve shows that toward the end of each action potential, and continuing for a short period thereafter, the membrane becomes more permeable to potassium ions. The increased outflow of potassium ions carries tremendous numbers of positive charges to the outside of the membrane, leaving considerably more negativity inside the fiber than would otherwise occur. This continues for nearly 1 second after the preceding action potential is over, thus drawing the membrane potential
![gu292415823e](gu292415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-14 Rhythmical action potentials (in millivolts) similar to those recorded in the rhythmical control center of the heart. Note their relationship to potassium conductance and to the state of hyperpolarization.

nearer to the potassium Nernst potential. This state, called hyperpolarization, is also shown in Figure 5-14. As long as this state exists, self-re-excitation will not occur. However, the increased potassium conductance (and the state of hyperpolarization) gradually disappears, as shown after each action potential is completed in the figure, thereby again allowing the membrane potential to increase up to the threshold for excitation. Then, suddenly, a new action potential results and the process occurs again and again.

## SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SIGNAL TRANSMISSION IN NERVE TRUNKS

Myelinated and Unmyelinated Nerve Fibers. Figure 5-15 shows a cross section of a typical small nerve, revealing many large nerve fibers that constitute most of the cross-sectional area. However, a more careful look reveals many more small fibers lying between the large ones. The large fibers are myelinated, and the small ones are unmyelinated. The average nerve trunk contains about twice as many unmyelinated fibers as myelinated fibers.

Figure 5-16 illustrates schematically the features of a typical myelinated fiber. The central core of the fiber is the axon, and the membrane of the axon is the membrane that actually conducts the action potential. The axon is filled in its center with axoplasm, which is a viscid intracellular fluid. Surrounding the axon is a myelin sheath that is often much thicker than the axon itself. About once every 1 to 3 millimeters along the length of the myelin sheath is a node of Ranvier.

The myelin sheath is deposited around the axon by Schwann cells in the following manner. The membrane of a Schwann cell first envelops the axon. The Schwann cell then rotates around the axon many times, laying down multiple layers of Schwann cell membrane containing the lipid substance sphingomyelin. This substance is an excellent
![gu302415823e](gu302415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-15 Cross section of a small nerve trunk containing both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers.
electrical insulator that decreases ion flow through the membrane about 5000-fold. At the juncture between each two successive Schwann cells along the axon, a small uninsulated area only 2 to 3 micrometers in length remains where ions still can flow with ease through the axon membrane between the extracellular fluid and intracellular fluid inside the axon. This area is called the node of Ranvier.

Saltatory Conduction in Myelinated Fibers from Node to Node. Even though almost no ions can flow through the thick myelin sheaths of myelinated nerves, they can flow with ease through the nodes of Ranvier. Therefore, action potentials occur only at the nodes. Yet, the action potentials are conducted from node to node by saltatory conduction, as shown in Figure 5-17. That is, electrical current flows through the surrounding extracellular fluid outside the myelin sheath, as well as through the axoplasm inside the axon from node to node, exciting successive nodes one after another. Thus, the nerve impulse jumps along the fiber, which is the origin of the term saltatory.

Saltatory conduction is of value for two reasons:

1. First, by causing the depolarization process to jump long intervals along the axis of the nerve fiber, this mechanism increases the velocity of nerve transmission in myelinated fibers as much as 5 - to 50 -fold.

2. Second, saltatory conduction conserves energy for the axon because only the nodes depolarize, allowing perhaps 100 times less loss of ions than would otherwise be necessary, and therefore requiring much less energy expenditure for re-establishing the sodium and potassium concentration differences across the membrane after a series of nerve impulses.
The excellent insulation afforded by the myelin membrane and the 50 -fold decrease in membrane capacitance also allow repolarization to occur with little transfer of ions.

Velocity of Conduction in Nerve Fibers. The velocity of action potential conduction in nerve fibers varies from as little as $0.25 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$ in small unmyelinated fibers to as much as $100 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$-more than the length of a football field in 1 second-in large myelinated fibers.

## EXCITATION-THE PROCESS OF ELICITING THE ACTION POTENTIAL

Basically, any factor that causes sodium ions to begin to diffuse inward through the membrane in sufficient numbers can set off automatic regenerative opening of the sodium channels. This automatic regenerative opening can result from mechanical disturbance of the membrane, chemical effects on the membrane, or passage of electricity through the membrane. All these approaches are used at different points in the body to elicit nerve or muscle
action potentials: mechanical pressure to excite sensory nerve endings in the skin, chemical neurotransmitters to transmit signals from one neuron to the next in the brain, and electrical current to transmit signals between successive muscle cells in the heart and intestine.

Excitation of a Nerve Fiber by a Negatively Charged Metal Electrode. The usual means for exciting a nerve or muscle in the experimental laboratory is to apply electricity to the nerve or muscle surface through two small electrodes, one of which is negatively charged and the other positively charged. When electricity is applied in this manner, the excitable membrane becomes stimulated at the negative electrode.

Remember that the action potential is initiated by the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels. Furthermore, these channels are opened by a decrease in the normal resting electrical voltage across the membrane-that is, negative current from the electrode decreases the voltage on the outside of the membrane to a negative value nearer to the voltage of the negative potential inside the fiber. This effect decreases the electrical voltage across the membrane and allows the sodium channels to open, resulting in an action potential. Conversely, at the positive electrode, the injection of positive charges on the outside of the nerve membrane heightens the voltage difference across the membrane, rather than lessening it. This effect causes a state of hyperpolarization, which actually decreases the excitability of the fiber rather than causing an action potential.
![gu322415823e](gu322415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-17 Saltatory conduction along a myelinated axon. The flow of electrical current from node to node is illustrated by the arrows.

## Threshold for Excitation and Acute Local Potentials.

A weak negative electrical stimulus may not be able to excite a fiber. However, when the voltage of the stimulus is increased, there comes a point at which excitation does take place. Figure 5-18 shows the effects of successively applied stimuli of progressing strength. A weak stimulus at point A causes the membrane potential to change from -70 to -65 millivolts, but this change is not sufficient for the automatic regenerative processes of the action potential to develop. At point B, the stimulus is greater, but the intensity is still not enough. The stimulus does, however, disturb the membrane potential locally for as long as 1 millisecond or more after both of these weak stimuli. These local potential changes are called acute local potentials and, when they fail to elicit an action potential, they are called acute subthreshold potentials.

At point C in Figure 5-18, the stimulus is even stronger. Now, the local potential has barely reached the threshold level required to elicit an action potential, but this occurs only after a short "latent period." At point D, the stimulus is still stronger, the acute local potential is also stronger, and the action potential occurs after less of a latent period.

Thus, this figure shows that even a weak stimulus causes a local potential change at the membrane, but the intensity of the local potential must rise to a threshold level before the action potential is set off.

## REFRACTORY PERIOD AFTER AN ACTION POTENTIAL, DURING WHICH A NEW STIMULUS CANNOT BE ELICITED

A new action potential cannot occur in an excitable fiber as long as the membrane is still depolarized from the preceding action potential. The reason for this restriction is that shortly after the action potential is initiated, the sodium channels (or calcium channels, or both) become inactivated, and no amount of excitatory signal applied to these channels at this point will open the inactivation gates. The only condition that will allow them to reopen is for the membrane potential to return to or near the original
![gu332415823e](gu332415823e.jpg)

Figure 5-18 Effect of stimuli of increasing voltages to elicit an action potential. Note the development of acute subthreshold potentials when the stimuli are below the threshold value required for eliciting an action potential.
resting membrane potential level. Then, within another small fraction of a second, the inactivation gates of the channels open, and a new action potential can be initiated.

The period during which a second action potential cannot be elicited, even with a strong stimulus, is called the absolute refractory period. This period for large myelinated nerve fibers is about $1 / 2500$ second. Therefore, one can readily calculate that such a fiber can transmit a maximum of about 2500 impulses per second.

## Inhibition of Excitabilityâ€”Stabilizers and Local Anesthetics

In contrast to the factors that increase nerve excitability, membrane-stabilizing factors can decrease excitability. For example, a high extracellular fluid calcium ion concentration decreases membrane permeability to sodium ions and simultaneously reduces excitability. Therefore, calcium ions are said to be what is called a stabilizer.

Local Anesthetics. Among the most important stabilizers are the many substances used clinically as local anesthetics, including procaine and tetracaine. Most of these agents act directly on the activation gates of the sodium channels, making it much more difficult for these gates to open and thereby reducing membrane excitability. When excitability has been reduced so low that the ratio of action potential strength to excitability threshold (called the safety factor) is reduced below 1.0, nerve impulses fail to pass along the anesthetized nerves.

# Contraction of Skeletal Muscle 

About $40 \%$ of the body is skeletal muscle, and perhaps another $10 \%$ is smooth and cardiac muscle. Some of the same basic principles of contraction apply to all these muscle types. In this chapter, we mainly consider skeletal muscle function; the specialized functions of smooth muscle are discussed in Chapter 8, and cardiac muscle is discussed in Chapter 9.

## PHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY OF SKELETAL MUSCLE

Figure 6-1 shows that skeletal muscles are composed of numerous fibers ranging from 10 to 80 micrometers in diameter. Each of these fibers is made up of successively smaller subunits, also shown in Figure 6-1, and described in subsequent paragraphs.

In most skeletal muscles, each fiber extends the entire length of the muscle. Except for about $2 \%$ of the fibers, each fiber is usually innervated by only one nerve ending, located near the middle of the fiber.

The Sarcolemma Is a Thin Membrane Enclosing a Skeletal Muscle Fiber. The sarcolemma consists of a true cell membrane, called the plasma membrane, and an outer coat made up of a thin layer of polysaccharide material that contains numerous thin collagen fibrils. At each end of the muscle fiber, this surface layer of the sarcolemma fuses with a tendon fiber. The tendon fibers, in turn, collect into bundles to form the muscle tendons that then connect the muscles to the bones.

Myofibrils Are Composed of Actin and Myosin Filaments. Each muscle fiber contains several hundred to several thousand myofibrils, which are illustrated in the cross-sectional view of Figure 6-1C. Each myofibril (Figure 6-1D and E) is composed of about 1500 adjacent myosin filaments and 3000 actin filaments, which are large polymerized protein molecules that are responsible for the muscle contraction. These filaments can be seen in longitudinal view in the electron micrograph of Figure 6-2 and are represented diagrammatically in Figure 6-1E through $L$. The thick filaments in the diagrams are myosin, and the thin filaments are actin.

Note in Figure 6-1E that the myosin and actin filaments partially interdigitate and thus cause the myofibrils to have alternate light and dark bands, as illustrated in Figure 6-2. The light bands contain only actin filaments and are called I bands because they are isotropic to polarized light. The dark bands contain myosin filaments, as well as the ends of the actin filaments, where they overlap the myosin, and are called $A$ bands because they are anisotropic to polarized light. Note also the small projections from the sides of the myosin filaments in Figure $6-1 E$ and $L$. These projections are cross-bridges. It is the interaction between these cross-bridges and the actin filaments that causes contraction (Video 6-1).

Figure 6-1E also shows that the ends of the actin filaments are attached to a $Z$ disk. From this disk, these filaments extend in both directions to interdigitate with the myosin filaments. The Z disk, which is composed of filamentous proteins different from the actin and myosin filaments, passes crosswise across the myofibril and also crosswise from myofibril to myofibril, attaching the myofibrils to one another all the way across the muscle fiber. Therefore, the entire muscle fiber has light and dark bands, as do the individual myofibrils. These bands give skeletal and cardiac muscle their striated appearance.

The portion of the myofibril (or of the whole muscle fiber) that lies between two successive $Z$ disks is called a sarcomere. When the muscle fiber is contracted, as shown at the bottom of Figure 6-5, the length of the sarcomere is about 2 micrometers. At this length, the actin filaments completely overlap the myosin filaments, and the tips of the actin filaments are just beginning to overlap one another. As discussed later, at this length, the muscle is capable of generating its greatest force of contraction.

Titin Filamentous Molecules Keep the Myosin and Actin Filaments in Place. The side-by-side relationship between the myosin and actin filaments is maintained by a large number of filamentous molecules of a protein called titin (Figure 6-3). Each titin molecule has a molecular weight of about 3 million, which makes it one of the largest protein molecules in the body. Also, because it is filamentous, it is very springy. These springy titin molecules act as a framework that holds the myosin and actin filaments in place so that the contractile machinery of

the sarcomere will work. One end of the titin molecule is elastic and is attached to the $Z$ disk, acting as a spring and changing length as the sarcomere contracts and relaxes. The other part of the titin molecule tethers it to the myosin thick filament. The titin molecule may also act as a template for the initial formation of portions of the contractile filaments of the sarcomere, especially the myosin filaments.

Sarcoplasm Is the Intracellular Fluid Between Myofibrils. Many myofibrils are suspended side by side in each muscle fiber. The spaces between the myofibrils are filled with intracellular fluid called sarcoplasm, containing large quantities of potassium, magnesium, and phosphate, plus multiple protein enzymes. Also present are tremendous numbers of mitochondria that lie parallel to the myofibrils. These mitochondria supply the contracting myofibrils with large amounts of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formed by the mitochondria.

Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Is a Specialized Endoplasmic Reticulum of Skeletal Muscle. Also, in the sarcoplasm surrounding the myofibrils of each muscle fiber, is an extensive reticulum (Figure 6-4), called the sarcoplas-
![gu372415823e](gu372415823e.jpg)

Also shown in cross section are T tubules (arrows) that lead to the exterior of the fiber membrane and are important for conducting the electrical signal into the center of the muscle fiber. (From Fawcett DW: The Cell. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1981.)
mic reticulum. This reticulum has a special organization that is extremely important in regulating calcium storage, release, reuptake and therefore muscle contraction, as discussed in Chapter 7. The rapidly contracting types of muscle fibers have especially extensive sarcoplasmic reticula.

## GENERAL MECHANISM OF MUSCLE CONTRACTION

The initiation and execution of muscle contraction occur in the following sequential steps.

1. An action potential travels along a motor nerve to its endings on muscle fibers.
2. At each ending, the nerve secretes a small amount of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.
3. Acetylcholine acts on a local area of the muscle fiber membrane to open acetylcholine-gated cation channels through protein molecules floating in the membrane.
4. The opening of acetylcholine-gated channels allows large quantities of sodium ions to diffuse to the interior of the muscle fiber membrane. This action causes a local depolarization that in turn leads to the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, which initiates an action potential at the membrane.
5. The action potential travels along the muscle fiber membrane in the same way that action potentials travel along nerve fiber membranes.
6. The action potential depolarizes the muscle membrane, and much of the action potential electricity flows through the center of the muscle fiber. Here it causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release large quantities of calcium ions that have been stored within this reticulum.

![gu382415823e](gu382415823e.jpg)

Figure 6-5 Relaxed and contracted states of a myofibril showing (top) sliding of the actin filaments (pink) into the spaces between the myosin filaments (red) and (bottom) pulling of the Z membranes toward each other.
7. The calcium ions initiate attractive forces between the actin and myosin filaments, causing them to slide alongside each other, which is the contractile process.
8. After a fraction of a second, the calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ membrane pump and remain stored in the reticulum until a new muscle action potential comes along; this removal of calcium ions from the myofibrils causes the muscle contraction to cease.
We now describe the molecular machinery of the muscle contractile process.

## MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF MUSCLE CONTRACTION

Muscle Contraction Occurs by a Sliding Filament Mechanism. Figure 6-5 demonstrates the basic mechanism of muscle contraction. It shows the relaxed state of a sarcomere (top) and the contracted state (bottom). In the relaxed state, the ends of the actin filaments extending from two successive Z disks barely overlap one another. Conversely, in the contracted state, these actin filaments have been pulled inward among the myosin filaments, so their ends overlap one another to their maximum extent. Also, the Z disks have been pulled by the actin filaments up to the ends of the myosin filaments. Thus, muscle contraction occurs by a sliding filament mechanism.

But what causes the actin filaments to slide inward among the myosin filaments? This action is caused by forces generated by interaction of the cross-bridges from the myosin filaments with the actin filaments. Under resting conditions, these forces are inactive, but when an action potential travels along the muscle fiber, this causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release large quantities of calcium ions that rapidly surround the myofibrils. The

Figure 6-6 A, Myosin molecule. B, Combination of many myosin molecules to form a myosin filament. Also shown are thousands of myosin cross-bridges and interaction between the heads of the crossbridges with adjacent actin filaments.
calcium ions, in turn, activate the forces between the myosin and actin filaments, and contraction begins. However, energy is needed for the contractile process to proceed. This energy comes from high-energy bonds in the ATP molecule, which is degraded to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to liberate the energy. In the next few sections, we describe these molecular processes of contraction.

## Molecular Characteristics of the Contractile Filaments

Myosin Filaments Are Composed of Multiple Myosin Molecules. Each of the myosin molecules, shown in Figure 6-6A, has a molecular weight of about 480,000. Figure 6-6B shows the organization of many molecules to form a myosin filament, as well as interaction of this filament on one side with the ends of two actin filaments.

The myosin molecule (see Figure 6-6A) is composed of six polypeptide chains-two heavy chains, each with a molecular weight of about 200,000; and four light chains, with molecular weights of about 20,000 each. The two heavy chains wrap spirally around each other to form a double helix, which is called the tail of the myosin molecule. One end of each of these chains is folded bilaterally into a globular polypeptide structure called a myosin head. Thus, there are two free heads at one end of the doublehelix myosin molecule. The four light chains are also part of the myosin head, two to each head. These light chains help control the function of the head during muscle contraction.

The myosin filament is made up of 200 or more individual myosin molecules. The central portion of one of these filaments is shown in Figure 6-6B, displaying the tails of the myosin molecules bundled together to form the body of the filament, while many heads of the molecules hang outward to the sides of the body. Also, part of the body

![gu402415823e](gu402415823e.jpg)

Figure 6-7 Actin filament composed of two helical strands of F-actin molecules and two strands of tropomyosin molecules that fit in the grooves between the actin strands. Attached to one end of each tropomyosin molecule is a troponin complex that initiates contraction.
of each myosin molecule hangs to the side along with the head, thus providing an arm that extends the head outward from the body, as shown in the figure. The protruding arms and heads together are called cross-bridges. Each cross-bridge is flexible at two points called hinges-one where the arm leaves the body of the myosin filament and the other where the head attaches to the arm. The hinged arms allow the heads either to be extended far outward from the body of the myosin filament or brought close to the body. The hinged heads, in turn, participate in the contraction process, as discussed in the following sections.

The total length of each myosin filament is uniform, almost exactly 1.6 micrometers. Note, however, that there are no cross-bridge heads in the center of the myosin filament for a distance of about 0.2 micrometer because the hinged arms extend away from the center.

Now, to complete the picture, the myosin filament is twisted so that each successive pair of cross-bridges is axially displaced from the previous pair by 120 degrees. This twisting ensures that the cross-bridges extend in all directions around the filament.

Adenosine Triphosphatase Activity of the Myosin Head. Another feature of the myosin head that is essential for muscle contraction is that it functions as an adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzyme. As explained later, this property allows the head to cleave ATP and use the energy derived from the ATP's high-energy phosphate bond to energize the contraction process.

Actin Filaments Are Composed of Actin, Tropomyosin, and Troponin. The backbone of the actin filament is a double-stranded F-actin protein molecule, represented by the two lighter-colored strands in Figure 6-7. The two strands are wound in a helix in the same manner as the myosin molecule.

Each strand of the double F-actin helix is composed of polymerized G-actin molecules, each having a molecular weight of about 42,000 . Attached to each one of the G-actin molecules is one molecule of ADP. These ADP molecules are believed to be the active sites on the actin filaments with which the cross-bridges of the myosin filaments interact to cause muscle contraction. The active sites on the two F-actin strands of the double helix are staggered, giving one active site on the overall actin filament about every 2.7 nanometers.

Each actin filament is about 1 micrometer long. The bases of the actin filaments are inserted strongly into the Z disks; the ends of the filaments protrude in both directions to lie in the spaces between the myosin molecules, as shown in Figure 6-5.

Tropomyosin Molecules. The actin filament also contains another protein, tropomyosin. Each molecule of tropomyosin has a molecular weight of 70,000 and a length of 40 nanometers. These molecules are wrapped spirally around the sides of the F-actin helix. In the resting state, the tropomyosin molecules lie on top of the active sites of the actin strands so that attraction cannot occur between the actin and myosin filaments to cause contraction. Contraction occurs only when an appropriate signal causes a conformation change in tropomyosin that "uncovers" active sites on the actin molecule and initiates contraction, as explained later.

Troponin and Its Role in Muscle Contraction. Attached intermittently along the sides of the tropomyosin molecules are additional protein molecules called troponin. These protein molecules are actually complexes of three loosely bound protein subunits, each of which plays a specific role in controlling muscle contraction. One of the subunits (troponin I) has a strong affinity for actin, another (troponin T) for tropomyosin, and a third (troponin C) for calcium ions. This complex is believed to attach the tropomyosin to the actin. The strong affinity of the troponin for calcium ions is believed to initiate the contraction process, as explained in the next section.

## Interaction of One Myosin Filament, Two Actin Filaments, and Calcium lons to Cause Contraction

Inhibition of the Actin Filament by the TroponinTropomyosin Complex. A pure actin filament without the presence of the troponin-tropomyosin complex (but in the presence of magnesium ions and ATP) binds instantly and strongly with the heads of the myosin molecules. Then, if the troponin-tropomyosin complex is added to the actin filament, the binding between myosin and actin does not take place. Therefore, it is believed that the active sites on the normal actin filament of the relaxed muscle are inhibited or physically covered by the troponin-tropomyosin complex. Consequently, the sites cannot attach to the heads of the myosin filaments to cause contraction. Before contraction can take place, the inhibitory effect of the troponin-tropomyosin complex must itself be inhibited.

Activation of the Actin Filament by Calcium lons. In the presence of large amounts of calcium ions, the inhibitory effect of the troponin-tropomyosin on the actin filaments is itself inhibited. The mechanism of this inhibition is not known, but one suggestion has been presented. When calcium ions combine with

![gu412415823e](gu412415823e.jpg)

Figure 6-8 The walk-along mechanism for contraction of the muscle.
troponin C, each molecule of which can bind strongly with up to four calcium ions, the troponin complex then undergoes a conformational change that in some way tugs on the tropomyosin molecule and moves it deeper into the groove between the two actin strands. This action uncovers the active sites of the actin, thus allowing these active sites to attract the myosin crossbridge heads and allow contraction to proceed. Although this mechanism is hypothetical, it emphasizes that the normal relationship between the troponintropomyosin complex and actin is altered by calcium ions, producing a new condition that leads to contraction.

Interaction of the Activated Actin Filament and the Myosin Cross-Bridges-The Walk-Along Theory of Contraction. As soon as the actin filament is activated by the calcium ions, the heads of the cross-bridges from the myosin filaments become attracted to the active sites of the actin filament and initiate contraction. Although the precise manner in which this interaction between the cross-bridges and the actin causes contraction is still partly theoretical, one hypothesis for which considerable evidence exists is the walk-along (or ratchet) theory of contraction.

Figure 6-8 demonstrates this postulated walk-along mechanism for contraction. The figure shows the heads of two cross-bridges attaching to and disengaging from active sites of an actin filament. When a head attaches to an active site, this attachment simultaneously causes profound changes in the intramolecular forces between the head and arm of its cross-bridge. The new alignment of forces causes the head to tilt toward the arm and to drag the actin filament along with it. This tilt of the head is called the power stroke. Immediately after tilting, the head then automatically breaks away from the active site. Next, the head returns to its extended direction. In this position, it combines with a new active site farther down along the actin filament; the head then tilts again to cause a new power stroke, and the actin filament moves another step. Thus, the heads of the cross-bridges bend back and forth and, step by step, walk along the actin filament, pulling the ends of two successive actin filaments toward the center of the myosin filament.

Each of the cross-bridges is believed to operate independently of all the others, with each attaching and pulling in a continuous repeated cycle. Therefore, the greater the number of cross-bridges in contact with the actin filament at any given time, the greater the force of contraction.

ATP Is the Energy Source for Contraction-Chemical Events in the Motion of the Myosin Heads. When a muscle contracts, work is performed, and energy is required. Large amounts of ATP are cleaved to form ADP during the contraction process, and the more work performed by the muscle, the more ATP that is cleaved; this phenomenon is called the Fenn effect. The following sequence of events is believed to be the means whereby this effect occurs:

1. Before contraction begins, the heads of the crossbridges bind with ATP. The ATPase activity of the myosin head immediately cleaves the ATP but leaves the cleavage products, ADP plus phosphate ion, bound to the head. In this state, the conformation of the head is such that it extends perpendicularly toward the actin filament but is not yet attached to the actin.
2. When the troponin-tropomyosin complex binds with calcium ions, active sites on the actin filament are uncovered, and the myosin heads then bind with these sites, as shown in Figure 6-8.
3. The bond between the head of the cross-bridge and the active site of the actin filament causes a conformational change in the head, prompting the head to tilt toward the arm of the cross-bridge and providing the power stroke for pulling the actin filament. The energy that activates the power stroke is the energy already stored, like a cocked spring, by the conformational change that occurred in the head when the ATP molecule was cleaved earlier.
4. Once the head of the cross-bridge tilts, release of the ADP and phosphate ion that were previously attached to the head is allowed. At the site of release of the ADP, a new molecule of ATP binds. This binding of new ATP causes detachment of the head from the actin.
5. After the head has detached from the actin, the new molecule of ATP is cleaved to begin the next cycle, leading to a new power stroke. That is, the energy again cocks the head back to its perpendicular condition, ready to begin the new power stroke cycle.
6. When the cocked head (with its stored energy derived from the cleaved ATP) binds with a new active site on the actin filament, it becomes uncocked and once again provides a new power stroke.
Thus, the process proceeds again and again until the actin filaments pull the Z membrane up against the ends of the myosin filaments or until the load on the muscle becomes too great for further pulling to occur.

![gu422415823e](gu422415823e.jpg)

Figure 6-9 Length-tension diagram for a single fully contracted sarcomere showing the maximum strength of contraction when the sarcomere is 2.0 to 2.2 micrometers in length. At the upper right are the relative positions of the actin and myosin filaments at different sarcomere lengths from point A to point D. (Modified from Gordon AM, Huxley AF, Julian FJ: The length-tension diagram of single vertebrate striated muscle fibers. J Physiol 171:28P, 1964.)

## Amount of Actin and Myosin Filament Overlap Determines Tension Developed by the Contracting Muscle

Figure 6-9 shows the effect of sarcomere length and the amount of myosin-actin filament overlap on the active tension developed by a contracting muscle fiber. To the right are different degrees of overlap of the myosin and actin filaments at different sarcomere lengths. At point D on the diagram, the actin filament has pulled all the way out to the end of the myosin filament, with no actin-myosin overlap. At this point, the tension developed by the activated muscle is zero. Then, as the sarcomere shortens, and the actin filament begins to overlap the myosin filament, the tension increases progressively until the sarcomere length decreases to about 2.2 micrometers. At this point, the actin filament has already overlapped all the cross-bridges of the myosin filament but has not yet reached the center of the myosin filament. With further shortening, the sarcomere maintains full tension until point B is reached, at a sarcomere length of about 2 micrometers. At this point, the ends of the two actin filaments begin to overlap each other in addition to overlapping the myosin filaments. As the sarcomere length decreases from 2 micrometers to about 1.65 micrometers at point A , the strength of contraction decreases rapidly. At this point, the two Z disks of the sarcomere abut the ends of the myosin filaments. Then, as contraction proceeds to still shorter sarcomere lengths, the ends of the myosin filaments are crumpled and, as shown in the figure, the strength of contraction approaches zero, but the sarcomere has now contracted to its shortest length.

## Effect of Muscle Length on Force of Contraction in the Whole Intact Muscle. The top curve of Figure

6-10 is similar to that in Figure 6-9, but the curve in Figure 6-10 depicts tension of the intact whole muscle rather than of a single muscle fiber. The whole muscle
![gu432415823e](gu432415823e.jpg)

Figure 6-10 Relationship of muscle length to tension in the muscle both before and during muscle contraction.
has a large amount of connective tissue in it; in addition, the sarcomeres in different parts of the muscle do not always contract the same amount. Therefore, the curve has somewhat different dimensions from those shown for the individual muscle fiber, but it exhibits the same general form for the slope in the normal range of contraction, as shown in Figure 6-10.

Note in Figure 6-10 that when the muscle is at its normal resting length, which is at a sarcomere length of about 2 micrometers, it contracts on activation with the approximate maximum force of contraction. However, the increase in tension that occurs during contraction, called active tension, decreases as the muscle is stretched beyond its normal length-that is, to a sarcomere length greater than about 2.2 micrometers. This phenomenon is demonstrated by the decreased length of the arrow in the figure at greater than normal muscle length.

## Relation of Velocity of Contraction to Load

A skeletal muscle contracts rapidly when it contracts against no load to a state of full contraction in about 0.1 second for the average muscle. When loads are applied, the velocity of contraction decreases progressively as the load increases, as shown in Figure 6-11. When the load has been increased to equal the maximum force that the muscle can exert, the velocity of contraction becomes zero, and no contraction results, despite activation of the muscle fiber.

This decreasing velocity of contraction with load occurs because a load on a contracting muscle is a reverse force that opposes the contractile force caused by muscle contraction. Therefore, the net force that is available to cause the velocity of shortening is correspondingly reduced.

## ENERGETICS OF MUSCLE CONTRACTION

## Work Output During Muscle Contraction

When a muscle contracts against a load, it performs work. To perform work means that energy is transferred from

![gu442415823e](gu442415823e.jpg)

Figure 6-11 Relationship of load to velocity of contraction in a skeletal muscle with a cross section of 1 square centimeter and a length of 8 centimeters.
the muscle to the external load to lift an object to a greater height or to overcome resistance to movement.

In mathematical terms, work is defined by the following equation:

$$
\mathrm{W}=\mathrm{L} \times \mathrm{D}
$$

in which W is the work output, L is the load, and D is the distance of movement against the load. The energy required to perform the work is derived from the chemical reactions in the muscle cells during contraction, as described in the following sections.

## Three Sources of Energy for Muscle Contraction

Most of the energy required for muscle contraction is used to trigger the walk-along mechanism whereby the cross-bridges pull the actin filaments, but small amounts are required for the following: (1) pumping calcium ions from the sarcoplasm into the sarcoplasmic reticulum after the contraction is over; and (2) pumping sodium and potassium ions through the muscle fiber membrane to maintain an appropriate ionic environment for the propagation of muscle fiber action potentials.

The concentration of ATP in the muscle fiber, about 4 millimolar, is sufficient to maintain full contraction for only 1 to 2 seconds at most. The ATP is split to form ADP, which transfers energy from the ATP molecule to the contracting machinery of the muscle fiber. Then, as described in Chapter 2, the ADP is rephosphorylated to form new ATP within another fraction of a second, which allows the muscle to continue its contraction. There are three sources of the energy for this rephosphorylation.

The first source of energy that is used to reconstitute the ATP is the substance phosphocreatine, which carries a high-energy phosphate bond similar to the bonds of ATP. The high-energy phosphate bond of phosphocreatine has a slightly higher amount of free energy than that of each ATP bond, as discussed in more detail in Chapters 68 and 73. Therefore, phosphocreatine is instantly cleaved, and its released energy causes bonding of a new phosphate ion to

ADP to reconstitute the ATP. However, the total amount of phosphocreatine in the muscle fiber is also small, only about 5 times as great as the ATP. Therefore, the combined energy of both the stored ATP and the phosphocreatine in the muscle is capable of causing maximal muscle contraction for only 5 to 8 seconds.

The second important source of energy, which is used to reconstitute both ATP and phosphocreatine, is a process called glycolysis-the breakdown of glycogen previously stored in the muscle cells. Rapid enzymatic breakdown of the glycogen to pyruvic acid and lactic acid liberates energy that is used to convert ADP to ATP; the ATP can then be used directly to energize additional muscle contraction and also to re-form the stores of phosphocreatine.

The importance of this glycolysis mechanism is twofold. First, glycolytic reactions can occur even in the absence of oxygen, so muscle contraction can be sustained for many seconds and sometimes up to more than 1 minute, even when oxygen delivery from the blood is not available. Second, the rate of ATP formation by glycolysis is about 2.5 times as rapid as ATP formation in response to cellular foodstuffs reacting with oxygen. However, so many end products of glycolysis accumulate in the muscle cells that glycolysis also loses its capability to sustain maximum muscle contraction after about 1 minute.

The third and final source of energy is oxidative metabolism, which means combining oxygen with the end products of glycolysis and with various other cellular foodstuffs to liberate ATP. More than $95 \%$ of all energy used by the muscles for sustained long-term contraction is derived from oxidative metabolism. The foodstuffs that are consumed are carbohydrates, fats, and protein. For extremely long-term maximal muscle activity-over a period of many hours-the greatest proportion of energy comes from fats but, for periods of 2 to 4 hours, as much as one half of the energy can come from stored carbohydrates.

The detailed mechanisms of these energetic processes are discussed in Chapters 68 through 73. In addition, the importance of the different mechanisms of energy release during performance of different sports is discussed in Chapter 85.

Efficiency of Muscle Contraction. The efficiency of an engine or a motor is calculated as the percentage of energy input that is converted into work instead of heat. The percentage of the input energy to muscle (the chemical energy in nutrients) that can be converted into work, even under the best conditions, is less than $25 \%$, with the remainder becoming heat. The reason for this low efficiency is that about one-half of the energy in foodstuffs is lost during the formation of ATP and, even then, only $40 \%$ to $45 \%$ of the energy in ATP itself can later be converted into work.

Maximum efficiency can be realized only when the muscle contracts at a moderate velocity. If the muscle contracts slowly or without any movement, small amounts of maintenance heat are released during contraction, even though little or no work is performed, thereby decreasing

the conversion efficiency to as little as zero. Conversely, if contraction is too rapid, much of the energy is used to overcome viscous friction within the muscle itself, and this too reduces the efficiency of contraction. Ordinarily, maximum efficiency occurs when the velocity of contraction is about $30 \%$ of maximum.

## CHARACTERISTICS OF WHOLE MUSCLE CONTRACTION

Many features of muscle contraction can be demonstrated by eliciting single muscle twitches. This can be accomplished by electrical excitation of the nerve to a muscle or by passing a short electrical stimulus through the muscle itself, giving rise to a single sudden contraction lasting a fraction of a second.

Isometric Contractions Do Not Shorten Muscle, Whereas Isotonic Contractions Shorten Muscle at a Constant Tension. Muscle contraction is said to be isometric when the muscle does not shorten during contraction and isotonic when it shortens but the tension on the muscle remains constant throughout the contraction. Systems for recording the two types of muscle contraction are shown in Figure 6-12.

In the isometric system, the muscle contracts against a force transducer without decreasing the muscle length, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 6-12. In the isotonic system, the muscle shortens against a fixed load, which is illustrated in the top panel of the figure, showing a muscle lifting a weight. The characteristics of isotonic contraction depend on the load against which the muscle contracts, as well as the inertia of the load. However, the isometric system records changes in force of muscle contraction independently of load inertia. Therefore, the isometric system is often used when comparing the functional characteristics of different muscle types.

Characteristics of Isometric Twitches Recorded from Different Muscles. The human body has many sizes of skeletal muscles-from the small stapedius muscle in the middle ear, measuring only a few millimeters long and 1 millimeter or so in diameter, up to the large quadriceps muscle, a half-million times as large as the stapedius. Furthermore, the fibers may be as small as 10 micrometers in diameter or as large as 80 micrometers. Finally, the energetics of muscle contraction vary considerably from one muscle to another. Therefore, it is no wonder that the mechanical characteristics of muscle contraction differ among muscles.

Figure 6-13 shows records of isometric contractions of three types of skeletal muscle-an ocular muscle, which has a duration of isometric contraction of less than $1 / 50$ second; the gastrocnemius muscle, which has a duration of contraction of about $1 / 15$ second; and the soleus muscle, which has a duration of contraction of about $1 / 5$
![gu452415823e](gu452415823e.jpg)

Figure 6-12 Isotonic and isometric systems for recording muscle contractions. Isotonic contraction occurs when the force of the muscle contraction is greater than the load, and the tension on the muscle remains constant during the contraction. When the muscle contracts, it shortens and moves the load. Isometric contraction occurs when the load is greater than the force of the muscle contraction; the muscle creates tension when it contracts, but the overall length of the muscle does not change.

second. These durations of contraction are highly adapted to the functions of the respective muscles. Ocular movements must be extremely rapid to maintain fixation of the eyes on specific objects to provide accuracy of vision. The gastrocnemius muscle must contract moderately rapidly to provide sufficient velocity of limb movement for running and jumping, and the soleus muscle is concerned principally with slow contraction for continual, long-term support of the body against gravity.

Fast Versus Slow Muscle Fibers. As will be discussed more fully in Chapter 85 on sports physiology, every muscle of the body is composed of a mixture of so-called fast and slow muscle fibers, with still other fibers gradated between these two extremes. Muscles that react rapidly, including the anterior tibialis, are composed mainly of fast fibers, with only small numbers of the slow variety. Conversely, muscles such as soleus that respond slowly but with prolonged contraction are composed mainly of slow fibers. The differences between these two types of fibers are described in the following sections.

Slow Fibers (Type 1, Red Muscle). The following are characteristics of slow fibers:

1. Slow fibers are smaller than fast fibers.
2. Slow fibers are also innervated by smaller nerve fibers.
3. Slow fibers have a more extensive blood vessel system and more capillaries to supply extra amounts of oxygen compared with fast fibers,
4. Slow fibers have greatly increased numbers of mitochondria to support high levels of oxidative metabolism.
5. Slow fibers contain large amounts of myoglobin, an iron-containing protein similar to hemoglobin in red blood cells. Myoglobin combines with oxygen and stores it until needed, which also greatly speeds oxygen transport to the mitochondria. The myoglobin gives the slow muscle a reddish appearancehence, the name red muscle.

Fast Fibers (Type II, White Muscle). The following are characteristics of fast fibers:

1. Fast fibers are large for great strength of contraction.
2. Fast fibers have an extensive sarcoplasmic reticulum for rapid release of calcium ions to initiate contraction.
3. Large amounts of glycolytic enzymes are present in fast fibers for rapid release of energy by the glycolytic process.
4. Fast fibers have a less extensive blood supply than slow fibers because oxidative metabolism is of secondary importance.
5. Fast fibers have fewer mitochondria than slow fibers, also because oxidative metabolism is secondary. A deficit of red myoglobin in fast muscle gives it the name white muscle.

Figure 6-14 A motor unit consists of a motor neuron and the group of skeletal muscle fibers it innervates. A single motor axon may branch to innervate several muscle fibers that function together as a group. Although each muscle fiber is innervated by a single motor neuron, an entire muscle may receive input from hundreds of different motor neurons.

## MECHANICS OF SKELETAL MUSCLE CONTRACTION

Motor Unitâ€”All the Muscle Fibers Innervated by a Single Nerve Fiber. Each motoneuron that leaves the spinal cord innervates multiple muscle fibers, with the number of fibers innervated depending on the type of muscle. All the muscle fibers innervated by a single nerve fiber are called a motor unit (Figure 6-14). In general, small muscles that react rapidly and whose control must be exact have more nerve fibers for fewer muscle fibers (e.g., as few as two or three muscle fibers per motor unit in some of the laryngeal muscles). Conversely, large muscles that do not require fine control, such as the soleus muscle, may have several hundred muscle fibers in a motor unit. An average figure for all the muscles of the body is questionable, but a reasonable guess would be about 80 to 100 muscle fibers to a motor unit.

The muscle fibers in each motor unit are not all bunched together in the muscle but overlap other motor units in microbundles of 3 to 15 fibers. This interdigitation allows the separate motor units to contract in support of one another rather than entirely as individual segments.

Muscle Contractions of Different Force-Force Summation. Summation means the adding together of individual twitch contractions to increase the intensity

![gu482415823e](gu482415823e.jpg)

Figure 6-15 Frequency summation and tetanization.
of overall muscle contraction. Summation occurs in two ways: (1) by increasing the number of motor units contracting simultaneously, which is called multiple fiber summation; and (2) by increasing the frequency of contraction, which is called frequency summation and can lead to tetanization.

Multiple Fiber Summation. When the central nervous system sends a weak signal to contract a muscle, the smaller motor units of the muscle may be stimulated in preference to the larger motor units. Then, as the strength of the signal increases, larger and larger motor units begin to be excited, with the largest motor units often having as much as 50 times the contractile force of the smallest units. This phenomenon, called the size principle, is important because it allows the gradations of muscle force during weak contraction to occur in small steps, whereas the steps become progressively greater when large amounts of force are required. This size principle occurs because the smaller motor units are driven by small motor nerve fibers, and the small motoneurons in the spinal cord are more excitable than the larger ones, so naturally they are excited first.

Another important feature of multiple fiber summation is that the different motor units are driven asynchronously by the spinal cord; as a result, contraction alternates among motor units one after the other, thus providing smooth contraction, even at low frequencies of nerve signals.

Frequency Summation and Tetanization. Figure 6-15 shows the principles of frequency summation and tetanization. Individual twitch contractions occurring one after another at low frequency of stimulation are displayed on the left. Then, as the frequency increases, there comes a point when each new contraction occurs before the preceding one is over. As a result, the second contraction is added partially to the first, and thus the total strength of contraction rises progressively with increasing frequency. When the frequency reaches a critical level, the successive contractions eventually become so rapid that they fuse together, and the whole muscle contraction appears to be
completely smooth and continuous, as shown in the figure. This process is called tetanization. At a slightly higher frequency, the strength of contraction reaches its maximum, so any additional increase in frequency beyond that point has no further effect in increasing contractile force. Tetany occurs because enough calcium ions are maintained in the muscle sarcoplasm, even between action potentials, so that a full contractile state is sustained without allowing any relaxation between the action potentials.

Maximum Strength of Contraction. The maximum strength of tetanic contraction of a muscle operating at a normal muscle length averages between 3 and $4 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ of muscle, or 50 pounds/inch ${ }^{2}$. Because a quadriceps muscle can have up to 16 square inches of muscle belly, as much as 800 pounds of tension may be applied to the patellar tendon. Thus, one can readily understand how it is possible for muscles to pull their tendons out of their insertions in bone.

Changes in Muscle Strength at the Onset of Contraction-the Staircase Effect (Treppe). When a muscle begins to contract after a long period of rest, its initial strength of contraction may be as little as one-half its strength 10 to 50 muscle twitches later. That is, the strength of contraction increases to a plateau, a phenomenon called the staircase effect, or treppe.

Although all the possible causes of the staircase effect are not known, it is believed to be caused primarily by increasing calcium ions in the cytosol because of the release of more and more ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum with each successive muscle action potential and failure of the sarcoplasm to recapture the ions immediately.

Skeletal Muscle Tone. Even when muscles are at rest, a certain amount of tautness usually remains, called muscle tone. Because normal skeletal muscle fibers do not contract without an action potential to stimulate the fibers, skeletal muscle tone results entirely from a low rate of nerve impulses coming from the spinal cord. These nerve impulses, in turn, are controlled partly by signals transmitted from the brain to the appropriate spinal cord anterior motoneurons and partly by signals that originate in muscle spindles located in the muscle. Both these signals are discussed in relationship to muscle spindle and spinal cord function in Chapter 55.

Muscle Fatigue. Prolonged strong contraction of a muscle leads to the well-known state of muscle fatigue. Studies in athletes have shown that muscle fatigue increases in almost direct proportion to the rate of depletion of muscle glycogen. Therefore, fatigue results mainly from the inability of the contractile and metabolic processes of the muscle fibers to continue supplying the same work output. However, experiments have also shown that transmission of the nerve signal through the neuromuscular

![gu492415823e](gu492415823e.jpg)

Figure 6-16 Lever system activated by the biceps muscle.
junction, discussed in Chapter 7, can diminish at least a small amount after intense prolonged muscle activity, thus further diminishing muscle contraction. Interruption of blood flow through a contracting muscle leads to almost complete muscle fatigue within 1 or 2 minutes because of the loss of nutrient supply, especially the loss of oxygen.

Lever Systems of the Body. Muscles operate by applying tension to their points of insertion into bones, and the bones in turn form various types of lever systems. Figure 6-16 shows the lever system activated by the biceps muscle to lift the forearm against a load. If we assume that a large biceps muscle has a cross-sectional area of 6 square inches, the maximum force of contraction would be about 300 pounds. When the forearm is at right angles with the upper arm, the tendon attachment of the biceps is about 2 inches anterior to the fulcrum at the elbow, and the total length of the forearm lever is about 14 inches. Therefore, the amount of lifting power of the biceps at the hand would be only one-seventh of the 300 pounds of muscle force, or about 43 pounds. When the arm is fully extended, the attachment of the biceps is much less than 2 inches anterior to the fulcrum, and the force with which the hand can be brought forward is also much less than 43 pounds.

In short, an analysis of the lever systems of the body depends on knowledge of the following: (1) the point of muscle insertion; (2) its distance from the fulcrum of the lever; (3) the length of the lever arm; and (4) the position of the lever. Many types of movement are required in the body, some of which need great strength and others that need large distances of movement. For this reason, there are many different types of muscle; some are long and contract a long distance, and some are short but have large cross-sectional areas and can provide extreme strength of contraction over short distances. The study of different types of muscles, lever systems, and their movements is called kinesiology and is an important scientific component of human physiology.

Positioning of a Body Part by Contraction of Agonist and Antagonist Muscles on Opposite Sides of a Joint. Virtually all body movements are caused by simultaneous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles on opposite sides of joints. This process is called coactivation of the agonist and antagonist muscles, and it is controlled by the motor control centers of the brain and spinal cord.

The position of each separate part of the body, such as an arm or a leg, is determined by the relative degrees of contraction of the agonist and antagonist sets of muscles. For example, let us assume that an arm or a leg is to be placed in a midrange position. To achieve this position, agonist and antagonist muscles are excited to about an equal degree. Remember that an elongated muscle contracts with more force than does a shortened muscle, which was illustrated in Figure 6-10, showing maximum strength of contraction at full functional muscle length and almost no strength of contraction at half-normal length. Therefore, the elongated muscle on one side of a joint can contract with far greater force than the shorter muscle on the opposite side. As an arm or leg moves toward its midposition, the strength of the longer muscle decreases, but the strength of the shorter muscle increases until the two strengths equal each other. At this point, movement of the arm or leg stops. Thus, by varying the ratios of the degree of activation of the agonist and antagonist muscles, the nervous system directs the positioning of the arm or leg.

We discuss in Chapter 55 that the motor nervous system has additional important mechanisms to compensate for different muscle loads when directing this positioning process.

## REMODELING OF MUSCLE TO MATCH FUNCTION

The muscles of the body continually remodel to match the functions required of them. Their diameters, lengths, strengths, and vascular supplies are altered, and even the types of muscle fibers are altered, at least slightly. This remodeling process is often quite rapid, occurring within a few weeks. Experiments in animals have shown that muscle contractile proteins in some smaller, more active muscles can be replaced in as little as 2 weeks.

Muscle Hypertrophy and Muscle Atrophy. The increase of the total mass of a muscle is called muscle hypertrophy. When the total mass decreases, the process is called muscle atrophy.

Virtually all muscle hypertrophy results from an increase in the number of actin and myosin filaments in each muscle fiber, causing enlargement of the individual muscle fibers; this condition is called simply fiber hypertrophy. Hypertrophy occurs to a much greater extent when the muscle is loaded during the contractile process. Only a few strong contractions each day are required to cause significant hypertrophy within 6 to 10 weeks.

The manner in which forceful contraction leads to hypertrophy is poorly understood. It is known, however, that the rate of synthesis of muscle contractile proteins is

far greater when hypertrophy is developing, leading also to progressively greater numbers of both actin and myosin filaments in the myofibrils, often increasing as much as $50 \%$. Some of the myofibrils have been observed to split within hypertrophying muscle to form new myofibrils, but the importance of this process in the usual enlargement of skeletal muscle is still unknown.

Along with the increasing size of myofibrils, the enzyme systems that provide energy also increase, especially the enzymes for glycolysis, allowing for a rapid supply of energy during short-term forceful muscle contraction.

When a muscle remains unused for many weeks, the rate of degradation of the contractile proteins is more rapid than the rate of replacement. Therefore, muscle atrophy occurs. The pathway that appears to account for much of the protein degradation in a muscle undergoing atrophy is the ATP-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Proteasomes are large protein complexes that degrade damaged or unneeded proteins by proteolysis, a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds. Ubiquitin is a regulatory protein that basically labels which cells will be targeted for proteosomal degradation.

Adjustment of Muscle Length. Another type of hypertrophy occurs when muscles are stretched to greater than normal length. This stretching causes new sarcomeres to be added at the ends of the muscle fibers, where they attach to the tendons. In fact, new sarcomeres can be added as rapidly as several per minute in newly developing muscle, illustrating the rapidity of this type of hypertrophy.

Conversely, when a muscle continually remains shortened to less than its normal length, sarcomeres at the ends of the muscle fibers can actually disappear. It is by these processes that muscles are continually remodeled so they have the appropriate length for proper muscle contraction.

Hyperplasia of Muscle Fibers. Under rare conditions of extreme muscle force generation, the actual number of muscle fibers has been observed to increase (but only by a few percent), in addition to the fiber hypertrophy process. This increase in fiber number is called fiber hyperplasia. When it does occur, the mechanism is linear splitting of previously enlarged fibers.

Muscle Denervation Causes Rapid Atrophy. When a muscle loses its nerve supply, it no longer receives the contractile signals that are required to maintain normal muscle size. Therefore, atrophy begins almost immediately. After about 2 months, degenerative changes also begin to appear in the muscle fibers. If the nerve supply to the muscle grows back rapidly, full return of function can occur in as little as 3 months but, from then onward, the capability of functional return becomes less and less, with no further return of function after 1 to 2 years.

In the final stage of denervation atrophy, most of the muscle fibers are destroyed and replaced by fibrous and
fatty tissue. The fibers that do remain are composed of a long cell membrane with a lineup of muscle cell nuclei but with few or no contractile properties and little or no capability of regenerating myofibrils if a nerve does regrow.

The fibrous tissue that replaces the muscle fibers during denervation atrophy also has a tendency to continue shortening for many months, a process called contracture. Therefore, one of the most important problems in the practice of physical therapy is to keep atrophying muscles from developing debilitating and disfiguring contractures. This goal is achieved by daily stretching of the muscles or use of appliances that keep the muscles stretched during the atrophying process.

Recovery of Muscle Contraction in Poliomyelitis: Development of Macromotor Units. When some but not all nerve fibers to a muscle are destroyed, as occurs in poliomyelitis, the remaining nerve fibers branch off to form new axons that then innervate many of the paralyzed muscle fibers. This process results in large motor units called macromotor units, which can contain as many as five times the normal number of muscle fibers for each motoneuron coming from the spinal cord. The formation of large motor units decreases the fineness of control one has over the muscles but allows the muscles to regain varying degrees of strength.

Rigor Mortis. Several hours after death, all the muscles of the body go into a state of contracture called rigor mortis; that is, the muscles contract and become rigid, even without action potentials. This rigidity results from loss of all the ATP, which is required to cause separation of the crossbridges from the actin filaments during the relaxation process. The muscles remain in rigor until the muscle proteins deteriorate about 15 to 25 hours later, which presumably results from autolysis caused by enzymes released from lysosomes. All these events occur more rapidly at higher temperatures.

Muscular Dystrophy. The muscular dystrophies include several inherited disorders that cause progressive weakness and degeneration of muscle fibers, which are replaced by fatty tissue and collagen.

One of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This disease affects only males because it is transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait and is caused by mutation of the gene that encodes for a protein called dystrophin, which links actins to proteins in the muscle cell membrane. Dystrophin and associated proteins form an interface between the intracellular contractile apparatus and extracellular connective matrix.

Although the precise functions of dystrophin are not completely understood, lack of dystrophin or mutated forms of the protein cause muscle cell membrane destabilization and activation of multiple pathophysiological processes, including altered intracellular calcium handling and impaired membrane repair after injury. One important effect of abnormal dystrophin is an increase in membrane permeability to calcium, thus allowing extracellular calcium ions to enter the muscle fiber and initiate changes in intracellular enzymes that ultimately lead to proteolysis and muscle fiber breakdown.

Symptoms of DMD include muscle weakness that begins in early childhood and rapidly progresses, so that the patient is usually in wheelchairs by age 12 years and often dies of respiratory failure before age 30 years. A milder form of this disease, called Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), is also caused by mutations of the gene that encodes for dystrophin but has a later onset and longer survival. It is estimated that DMD and BMD affect 1 of every 5,600 to 7,700 males between the ages of 5 through 24 years. Currently, no effective treatment exists for DMD or BMD, although characterization of the genetic basis for these diseases has provided the potential for gene therapy in the future.

# Excitation of Skeletal Muscle: Neuromuscular Transmission and Excitation-Contraction Coupling 

## NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION AND TRANSMISSION OF IMPULSES FROM NERVE ENDINGS TO SKELETAL MUSCLE FIBERS

Skeletal muscle fibers are innervated by large myelinated nerve fibers that originate from large motoneurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord. As discussed in Chapter 6, each nerve fiber, after entering the muscle belly, normally branches and stimulates from three to several hundred skeletal muscle fibers. Each nerve ending makes a junction, called the neuromuscular junction, with the muscle fiber near its midpoint. The action potential initiated in the muscle fiber by the nerve signal travels in both directions toward the muscle fiber ends. With the exception of about $2 \%$ of the muscle fibers, there is only one such junction per muscle fiber.

## PHYSIOLOGIC ANATOMY OF THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION-THE MOTOR END PLATE

Figure 7-1A and $B$ shows the neuromuscular junction from a large myelinated nerve fiber to a skeletal muscle fiber. The nerve fiber forms a complex of branching nerve terminals that invaginate into the surface of the muscle fiber but lie outside the muscle fiber plasma membrane. The entire structure is called the motor end plate. It is covered by one or more Schwann cells that insulate it from the surrounding fluids.

Figure 7-1C shows the junction between a single axon terminal and the muscle fiber membrane. The invaginated membrane is called the synaptic gutter or synaptic trough, and the space between the terminal and the fiber membrane is called the synaptic space or synaptic cleft, which is 20 to 30 nanometers wide. At the bottom of the gutter are numerous smaller folds of the muscle membrane called subneural clefts, which greatly increase the surface area at which the synaptic transmitter can act.

In the axon terminal are many mitochondria that supply adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy source used for synthesis of a transmitter, acetylcholine, which excites the muscle fiber membrane. Acetylcholine is synthesized
in the cytoplasm of the terminal but is absorbed rapidly into many small synaptic vesicles, about 300,000 of which are normally in the terminals of a single end plate. In the synaptic space are large quantities of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which destroys acetylcholine a few milliseconds after it has been released from the synaptic vesicles.

## SECRETION OF ACETYLCHOLINE BY THE NERVE TERMINALS

When a nerve impulse reaches the neuromuscular junction, about 125 vesicles of acetylcholine are released from the terminals into the synaptic space. Some of the details of this mechanism can be seen in Figure 7-2, which shows an expanded view of a synaptic space with the neural membrane above and the muscle membrane and its subneural clefts below.

On the inside surface of the neural membrane are linear dense bars, shown in cross section in Figure 7-2. To each side of each dense bar are protein particles that penetrate the neural membrane; these are voltage-gated calcium channels. When an action potential spreads over the terminal, these channels open and allow calcium ions to diffuse from the synaptic space to the interior of the nerve terminal. The calcium ions, in turn, are believed to activate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates synapsin proteins that anchor the acetylcholine vesicles to the cytoskeleton of the presynaptic terminal. This process frees the acetylcholine vesicles from the cytoskeleton and allows them to move to the active zone of the presynaptic neural membrane adjacent to the dense bars. The vesicles then dock at the release sites, fuse with the neural membrane, and empty their acetylcholine into the synaptic space by the process of exocytosis.

Although some of the aforementioned details are speculative, it is known that the effective stimulus for causing acetylcholine release from the vesicles is entry of calcium ions and that acetylcholine from the vesicles is then emptied through the neural membrane adjacent to the dense bars.

Figure 7-2. Release of acetylcholine from synaptic vesicles at the neural membrane of the neuromuscular junction. Note the proximity of the release sites in the neural membrane to the acetylcholine receptors in the muscle membrane at the mouths of the subneural clefts.

Acetylcholine Opens Ion Channels on Postsynaptic Membranes. Figure 7-2 also shows many small acetylcholine receptors and voltage-gated sodium channels in the muscle fiber membrane. The acetylcholine-gated ion channels are located almost entirely near the mouths of
the subneural clefts lying immediately below the dense bar areas, where the acetylcholine is emptied into the synaptic space. The voltage-gated sodium channels also line the subneural clefts.

Each acetylcholine receptor is a protein complex that has a total molecular weight of approximately 275,000. The fetal acetylcholine receptor complex is composed of five subunit proteins, two alpha proteins and one each of beta, delta, and gamma proteins. In the adult, an epsilon protein substitutes for the gamma protein in this receptor complex. These protein molecules penetrate all the way through the membrane, lying side by side in a circle to form a tubular channel, illustrated in Figure 7-3. The channel remains constricted, as shown in part A of the figure, until two acetylcholine molecules attach respectively to the two alpha subunit proteins. This attachment causes a conformational change that opens the channel, as shown in part B of the figure.

The acetylcholine-gated channel has a diameter of about 0.65 nanometer, which is large enough to allow the important positive ions-sodium $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$, potassium $\left(\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)$, and calcium $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right)$-to move easily through the opening. Patch clamp studies have shown that one of these channels, when opened by acetylcholine, can transmit 15,000 to 30,000 sodium ions in 1 millisecond. Conversely, negative ions, such as chloride ions, do not pass through because of strong negative charges in the mouth of the channel that repel these negative ions.

![gu522415823e](gu522415823e.jpg)

B
Figure 7-3. Acetylcholine-gated channel. A, Closed state. B, After acetylcholine (Ach) has become attached and a conformational change has opened the channel, allowing sodium ions to enter the muscle fiber and excite contraction. Note the negative charges at the channel mouth that prevent passage of negative ions such as chloride ions.

In practice, far more sodium ions flow through the acetylcholine-gated channels than any other ions for two reasons. First, there are only two positive ions present in large concentrations-sodium ions in the extracellular fluid and potassium ions in the intracellular fluid. Second, the negative potential on the inside of the muscle membrane, -80 to -90 millivolts, pulls the positively charged sodium ions to the inside of the fiber while simultaneously preventing efflux of the positively charged potassium ions when they attempt to pass outward.

As shown in Figure 7-3B, the principal effect of opening the acetylcholine-gated channels is to allow sodium ions to flow to the inside of the fiber, carrying positive charges with them. This action creates a local positive potential change inside the muscle fiber membrane, called the end plate potential. This end plate potential normally causes sufficient depolarization to open neighboring voltage-gated sodium channels, allowing even greater sodium ion inflow and initiating an action potential that
![gu532415823e](gu532415823e.jpg)

B, Normal end plate potential eliciting a muscle action potential. C, Weakened end plate potential caused by botulinum toxin that decreases end plate release of acetylcholine, again too weak to elicit a muscle action potential.
spreads along the muscle membrane and causes muscle contraction.

Destruction of the Released Acetylcholine by Acetylcholinesterase. The acetylcholine, once released into the synaptic space, continues to activate acetylcholine receptors as long as the acetylcholine persists in the space. However, it is rapidly destroyed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is attached mainly to the spongy layer of fine connective tissue that fills the synaptic space between the presynaptic nerve terminal and the postsynaptic muscle membrane. A small amount of acetylcholine diffuses out of the synaptic space and is then no longer available to act on the muscle fiber membrane.

The short time that the acetylcholine remains in the synaptic space-a few milliseconds at most-normally is sufficient to excite the muscle fiber. Then the rapid removal of the acetylcholine prevents continued muscle re-excitation after the muscle fiber has recovered from its initial action potential.

End Plate Potential and Excitation of the Skeletal Muscle Fiber. The sudden insurgence of sodium ions into the muscle fiber when the acetylcholine-gated channels open causes the electrical potential inside the fiber at the local area of the end plate to increase in the positive direction as much as 50 to 75 millivolts, creating a local potential called the end plate potential. Recall from Chapter 5 that a sudden increase in nerve membrane potential of more than 20 to 30 millivolts is normally sufficient to initiate more and more sodium channel opening, thus initiating an action potential at the muscle fiber membrane.

Figure 7-4 illustrates an end plate potential initiating the action potential. This figure shows three separate end plate potentials. End plate potentials A and C are too weak to elicit an action potential, but they do produce weak local end plate voltage changes, as recorded in the figure. By contrast, end plate potential B is much stronger and causes enough sodium channels to open

so that the self-regenerative effect of more and more sodium ions flowing to the interior of the fiber initiates an action potential. The weakness of the end plate potential at point A was caused by poisoning of the muscle fiber with curare, a drug that blocks the gating action of acetylcholine on the acetylcholine channels by competing for the acetylcholine receptor sites. The weakness of the end plate potential at point C resulted from the effect of botulinum toxin, a bacterial poison that decreases the quantity of acetylcholine release by the nerve terminals.

Safety Factor for Transmission at the Neuromuscular Junction-Fatigue of the Junction. Ordinarily, each impulse that arrives at the neuromuscular junction causes about three times as much end plate potential as that required to stimulate the muscle fiber. Therefore, the normal neuromuscular junction is said to have a high safety factor. However, stimulation of the nerve fiber at rates greater than 100 times per second for several minutes may diminish the number of acetylcholine vesicles so much that impulses fail to pass into the muscle fiber. This situation is called fatigue of the neuromuscular junction, and it is the same effect that causes fatigue of synapses in the central nervous system when the synapses are overexcited. Under normal functioning conditions, measurable fatigue of the neuromuscular junction occurs rarely and, even then, only at the most exhausting levels of muscle activity.

## Acetylcholine Formation and Release

Acetylcholine formation and release at the neuromuscular junction occur in the following stages:

1. Small vesicles, about 40 nanometers in size, are formed by the Golgi apparatus in the cell body of the motoneuron in the spinal cord. These vesicles are then transported by axoplasm that streams through the core of the axon from the central cell body in the spinal cord all the way to the neuromuscular junction at the tips of the peripheral nerve fibers. About 300,000 of these small vesicles collect in the nerve terminals of a single skeletal muscle end plate.
2. Acetylcholine is synthesized in the cytosol of the nerve fiber terminal but is immediately transported through the membranes of the vesicles to their interior, where it is stored in highly concentrated form-about 10,000 molecules of acetylcholine in each vesicle.
3. When an action potential arrives at the nerve terminal, it opens many calcium channels in the membrane of the nerve terminal because this terminal has an abundance of voltage-gated calcium channels. As a result, the calcium ion concentration inside the terminal membrane increases about 100 -fold, which in turn increases the rate of fusion of the acetylcholine vesicles with the terminal membrane about 10,000-fold. This fusion makes many of the vesicles rupture, allowing exocytosis of acetylcholine into the synaptic space. About 125 vesicles usually rupture with each action potential. Then, after a few milliseconds, the acetylcholine is split by acetylcholinesterase into acetate ion and choline, and the choline
is actively reabsorbed into the neural terminal to be reused to form new acetylcholine. This sequence of events occurs within a period of 5 to 10 milliseconds.
4. The number of vesicles available in the nerve ending is sufficient to allow transmission of only a few thousand nerve to muscle impulses. Therefore, for continued function of the neuromuscular junction, new vesicles need to be re-formed rapidly. Within a few seconds after each action potential is over, coated pits appear in the terminal nerve membrane, caused by contractile proteins in the nerve ending, especially the protein clathrin, which is attached to the membrane in the areas of the original vesicles. Within about 20 seconds, the proteins contract and cause the pits to break away to the interior of the membrane, thus forming new vesicles. Within another few seconds, acetylcholine is transported to the interior of these vesicles, and they are then ready for a new cycle of acetylcholine release.

## Drugs That Enhance or Block Transmission at the Neuromuscular Junction

Drugs That Stimulate the Muscle Fiber by Acetylcholine-
Like Action. Several compounds, including methacholine, carbachol, and nicotine, have nearly the same effect on the muscle fiber as acetylcholine. The main differences between these drugs and acetylcholine are that the drugs are not destroyed by cholinesterase or are destroyed so slowly that their action often persists for many minutes to several hours. The drugs work by causing localized areas of depolarization of the muscle fiber membrane at the motor end plate where the acetylcholine receptors are located. Then, every time the muscle fiber recovers from a previous contraction, these depolarized areas, by virtue of leaking ions, initiate a new action potential, thereby causing a state of muscle spasm.

Drugs That Stimulate the Neuromuscular Junction by Inactivating Acetylcholinesterase. Three particularly well-known drugs-neostigmine, physostigmine, and diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inactivate acetylcholinesterase in the synapses so that it no longer hydrolyzes acetylcholine. Therefore, with each successive nerve impulse, additional acetylcholine accumulates and stimulates the muscle fiber repetitively. This activity causes muscle spasm when even a few nerve impulses reach the muscle. Unfortunately, it can also cause death as a result of laryngeal spasm, which smothers a person.

Neostigmine and physostigmine combine with acetylcholinesterase to inactivate the acetylcholinesterase for up to several hours, after which these drugs are displaced from the acetylcholinesterase so that the esterase once again becomes active. Conversely, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, which is a powerful nerve gas poison, inactivates acetylcholinesterase for weeks, which makes this poison particularly lethal.

Drugs That Block Transmission at the Neuromuscular Junction. A group of drugs known as curariform drugs can prevent the passage of impulses from the nerve ending into the muscle. For example. D-tubocurarine blocks the action of acetylcholine on the muscle fiber acetylcholine receptors, thus preventing sufficient increase in permeability of the muscle membrane channels to initiate an action potential.

## Myasthenia Gravis Causes Muscle Weakness

Myasthenia gravis, which occurs in about 1 in every 20,000 persons, causes muscle weakness because of the inability of the neuromuscular junctions to transmit enough signals from the nerve fibers to the muscle fibers. Antibodies that attack the acetylcholine receptors have been demonstrated in the blood of most patients with myasthenia gravis. Therefore, myasthenia gravis is believed to be an autoimmune disease in which the patients have developed antibodies that block or destroy their own acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction.

Regardless of the cause, the end plate potentials that occur in the muscle fibers are mostly too weak to initiate opening of the voltage-gated sodium channels, and muscle fiber depolarization does not occur. If the disease is intense enough, the patient may die of respiratory failure as a result of severe weakness of the respiratory muscles. The disease can usually be ameliorated for several hours by administering neostigmine or some other anticholinesterase drug, which allows larger than normal amounts of acetylcholine to accumulate in the synaptic space. Within minutes, some of those affected can begin to function almost normally until a new dose of neostigmine is required a few hours later.

## MUSCLE ACTION POTENTIAL

Almost everything discussed in Chapter 5 regarding the initiation and conduction of action potentials in nerve fibers applies equally to skeletal muscle fibers, except for quantitative differences. Some of the quantitative aspects of muscle potentials are as follows:

1. The resting membrane potential is about -80 to -90 millivolts in skeletal fibers, about 10 to 20 millivolts more negative than in neurons.
2. The duration of the action potential is 1 to 5 milliseconds in skeletal muscle, about five times as long as in large myelinated nerves.
3. The velocity of conduction is 3 to $5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$, about $1 / 13$ the velocity of conduction in the large myelinated nerve fibers that excite skeletal muscle.

## Action Potentials Spread to the Interior of the Muscle Fiber by Way of Transverse Tubules

The skeletal muscle fiber is so large that action potentials spreading along its surface membrane cause almost no current flow deep within the fiber. Maximum muscle contraction, however, requires the current to penetrate deeply into the muscle fiber to the vicinity of the separate myofibrils. This penetration is achieved by transmission of action potentials along transverse tubules ( T tubules) that penetrate all the way through the muscle fiber, from one side of the fiber to the other, as illustrated in Figure 7-5. The T tubule action potentials cause release of calcium ions inside the muscle fiber in the immediate vicinity of the myofibrils, and these calcium ions then cause contraction. The overall process is called excitation-contraction coupling.

## EXCITATION-CONTRACTION COUPLING

## Transverse Tubule-Sarcoplasmic Reticulum System

Figure 7-5 shows myofibrils surrounded by the T tubulesarcoplasmic reticulum system. The T tubules are small and run transverse to the myofibrils. They begin at the cell membrane and penetrate all the way from one side of the muscle fiber to the opposite side. Not shown in the figure is that these tubules branch among themselves and form entire planes of T tubules interlacing among all the separate myofibrils. Also, where the T tubules originate from the cell membrane, they are open to the exterior of the muscle fiber. Therefore, they communicate with the extracellular fluid surrounding the muscle fiber and contain extracellular fluid in their lumens. In other words, the T tubules are actually internal extensions of the cell membrane. Therefore, when an action potential spreads over a muscle fiber membrane, a potential change also spreads along the T tubules to the deep interior of the muscle fiber. The electrical currents surrounding these T tubules then elicit the muscle contraction.

Figure 7-5 also shows a sarcoplasmic reticulum, in yellow. This sarcoplasmic reticulum is composed of two major parts: (1) large chambers called terminal cisternae that abut the T tubules; and (2) long longitudinal tubules that surround all surfaces of the contracting myofibrils.

## Release of Calcium lons by the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum

One of the special features of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is that within its vesicular tubules is an excess of calcium ions in high concentration. Many of these ions are released from each vesicle when an action potential occurs in the adjacent T tubule.

Figures 7-6 and 7-7 show that the action potential of the T tubule causes current flow into the sarcoplasmic reticular cisternae where they abut the T tubule. As the action potential reaches the T tubule, the voltage change is sensed by dihydropyridine receptors linked to calcium release channels, also called ryanodine receptor channels, in the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticular cisternae (see Figure 7-6). Activation of dihydropyridine receptors triggers the opening of the calcium release channels in the cisternae, as well as in their attached longitudinal tubules. These channels remain open for a few milliseconds, releasing calcium ions into the sarcoplasm surrounding the myofibrils and causing contraction, as discussed in Chapter 6.

Calcium Pump Removes Calcium lons from the Myofibrillar Fluid After Contraction Occurs. Once the calcium ions have been released from the sarcoplasmic tubules and have diffused among the myofibrils, muscle contraction continues as long as the calcium ion concentration remains high. However, a continually active calcium pump located in the walls of the sarcoplasmic reticulum

![gu542415823e](gu542415823e.jpg)

Figure 7-5. Transverse (T) tubule-sarcoplasmic reticulum system. Note that the T tubules communicate with the outside of the cell membrane and, deep in the muscle fiber, each T tubule lies adjacent to the ends of longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum tubules that surround all sides of the actual myofibrils that contract. This illustration was drawn from frog muscle, which has one T tubule per sarcomere, located at the Z disk. A similar arrangement is found in mammalian heart muscle, but mammalian skeletal muscle has two T tubules per sarcomere, located at the A-I band junctions.
pumps calcium ions away from the myofibrils back into the sarcoplasmic tubules (see Figure 7-6). This pump, called SERCA (sarcoplasmic reticulum $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-ATPase), can concentrate the calcium ions about 10,000 -fold inside the tubules. In addition, inside the reticulum is a calciumbinding protein called calsequestrin, which can bind up to 40 calcium ions for each molecule of calsequestrin.

Excitatory Pulse of Calcium Ions. The normal resting state concentration ( $<10^{-7}$ molar) of calcium ions in the cytosol that bathes the myofibrils is too little to elicit contraction. Therefore, the troponin-tropomyosin complex keeps the actin filaments inhibited and maintains a relaxed state of the muscle.

Conversely, full excitation of the T tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum system causes enough release of calcium ions to increase the concentration in the myofibrillar fluid to as high as $2 \times 10^{-4}$ molar concentration, a 500 -fold increase, which is about 10 times the level required to cause maximum muscle contraction. Immediately thereafter, the calcium pump depletes the calcium
ions again. The total duration of this calcium pulse in the usual skeletal muscle fiber lasts about $1 / 20$ of a second, although it may last several times as long in some fibers and several times less in others. In heart muscle, the calcium pulse lasts about one-third of a second because of the long duration of the cardiac action potential.

During this calcium pulse, muscle contraction occurs. If the contraction is to continue without interruption for long intervals, a series of calcium pulses must be initiated by a continuous series of repetitive action potentials, as discussed in Chapter 6.

## Malignant Hyperthermia

In susceptible individuals, malignant hyperthermia and a hypermetabolic crisis may be triggered by exposure to certain types of anesthetics, including halothane and isoflurane, or succinylcholine. At least six genetic mutations, especially of the ryanodine receptor or dihydropyridine receptor genes, have been shown to increase susceptibility greatly to developing malignant hyperthermia during anesthesia. Little is known about the specific mechanisms

![gu552415823e](gu552415823e.jpg)

Figure 7-6. Excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle. The top panel shows an action potential in the transverse tubule that causes a conformational change in the voltage-sensing dihydropyridine (DHP) receptors, opening the ryanodine (RyR) $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release channels in the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and permitting $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to diffuse rapidly into the sarcoplasm and initiate muscle contraction. During repolarization (bottom panel), the conformational change in the DHP receptor closes the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release channels, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is transported from the sarcoplasm into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by an adenosine triphosphate-dependent calcium pump, called SERCA (sarcoplasmic reticulum $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-ATPase).
![gu562415823e](gu562415823e.jpg)

Figure 7-7. Excitation-contraction coupling in the muscle, showing (1) an action potential that causes release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and then (2) re-uptake of the calcium ions by a calcium pump. ATP, Adenosine triphosphate.

whereby anesthetics interact with these abnormal receptors to trigger malignant hyperthermia. It is known, however, that these mutations cause unregulated passage of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the intracellular spaces, which in turn causes the muscle fibers to contract excessively. These sustained muscled contractions greatly increase metabolic rate, generating large amounts of heat and causing cellular acidosis, as a well as depletion of energy stores.

Symptoms of malignant include muscle rigidity, high fever, and rapid heart rate. Additional complications in severe cases may include rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle (rhabdomyolysis) and a high plasma potassium level due to release of large amounts of potassium from damaged muscle cells. Treatment of malignant hyperthermia generally involves rapid cooling and the administration of dantrolene, a drug that antagonizes ryanodine receptors, which inhibits calcium ion release for the sarcoplasmic reticulum and thereby attenuating muscle contraction.

# Excitation and Contraction of Smooth Muscle 

## CONTRACTION OF SMOOTH MUSCLE

Smooth muscle is composed of small fibers that are usually 1 to 5 micrometers in diameter and only 20 to 500 micrometers in length. In contrast, skeletal muscle fibers are as much as 30 times greater in diameter and hundreds of times as long. Many of the same principles of contraction apply to smooth muscle as to skeletal muscle. Most important, essentially the same attractive forces between myosin and actin filaments cause contraction in smooth muscle as in skeletal muscle, but the internal physical arrangement of smooth muscle fibers is different.

## TYPES OF SMOOTH MUSCLE

The smooth muscle of each organ is distinctive from that of most other organs in several ways: (1) physical dimensions; (2) organization into bundles or sheets; (3) response to different types of stimuli; (4) characteristics of innervation; and (5) function. Yet, for the sake of simplicity, smooth muscle can generally be divided into two major types, which are shown in Figure 8-1, multi-unit smooth muscle and unitary (or single-unit) smooth muscle.

Multi-Unit Smooth Muscle. Multi-unit smooth muscle is composed of discrete, separate, smooth muscle fibers. Each fiber operates independently of the others and often is innervated by a single nerve ending, as occurs for skeletal muscle fibers. Furthermore, the outer surfaces of these fibers, like those of skeletal muscle fibers, are covered by a thin layer of basement membrane-like substance, a mixture of fine collagen and glycoprotein that helps insulate the separate fibers from one another.

Important characteristics of multi-unit smooth muscle fibers are that each fiber can contract independently of the others, and their control is exerted mainly by nerve signals. In contrast, a major share of control of unitary smooth muscle is exerted by non-nervous stimuli. Some examples of multi-unit smooth muscle are the ciliary muscle of the eye, the iris muscle of the eye, and the piloerector muscles that cause erection of the hairs when stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system.

Unitary Smooth Muscle. Unitary smooth muscle is also called syncytial smooth muscle or visceral smooth muscle. The term unitary does not mean single muscle fibers. Instead, it means a mass of hundreds to thousands of smooth muscle fibers that contract together as a single unit. The fibers usually are arranged in sheets or bundles, and their cell membranes are adherent to one another at multiple points so that force generated in one muscle fiber can be transmitted to the next. In addition, the cell membranes are joined by many gap junctions through which ions can flow freely from one muscle cell to the next so that action potentials, or ion flow without action potentials, can travel from one fiber to the next and cause the muscle fibers to contract together. This type of smooth muscle is also known as syncytial smooth muscle because of its syncytial interconnections among fibers. It is also called visceral smooth muscle because it is found in the walls of most viscera of the body, including the gastrointestinal tract, bile ducts, ureters, uterus, and many blood vessels.

## CONTRACTILE MECHANISM IN SMOOTH MUSCLE

## Chemical Basis for Smooth Muscle Contraction

Smooth muscle contains both actin and myosin filaments, having chemical characteristics similar to those of the actin and myosin filaments in skeletal muscle. It does not contain the troponin complex that is required for the control of skeletal muscle contraction, and thus the mechanism for controlling contraction is different. This topic is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

Chemical studies have shown that actin and myosin filaments derived from smooth muscle interact with each other in much the same way that they do in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the contractile process is activated by calcium ions, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is degraded to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to provide the energy for contraction.

There are, however, major differences between the physical organization of smooth muscle and that of

![gu572415823e](gu572415823e.jpg)

A Multi-unit smooth muscle B Unitary smooth muscle
Figure 8-1 Multi-unit (A) and unitary (B) smooth muscle.
skeletal muscle, as well as differences in excitationcontraction coupling, control of the contractile process by calcium ions, duration of contraction, and the amount of energy required for contraction.

## Physical Basis for Smooth Muscle Contraction

Smooth muscle does not have the same striated arrangement of actin and myosin filaments as is found in skeletal muscle. Instead, electron micrographic techniques suggest the physical organization shown in Figure 8-2, which illustrates large numbers of actin filaments attached to dense bodies. Some of these bodies are attached to the cell membrane, and others are dispersed inside the cell. Some of the membrane-dense bodies of adjacent cells are bonded together by intercellular protein bridges. It is mainly through these bonds that the force of contraction is transmitted from one cell to the next.

Interspersed among the actin filaments in the muscle fiber are myosin filaments. These filaments have a diameter more than twice that of the actin filaments. In electron micrographs, 5 to 10 times as many actin filaments as myosin filaments are usually found.

To the right in Figure 8-2 is a postulated structure of an individual contractile unit in a smooth muscle cell, showing large numbers of actin filaments radiating from two dense bodies; the ends of these filaments overlap a myosin filament located midway between the dense bodies. This contractile unit is similar to the contractile unit of skeletal muscle, but without the regularity of the skeletal muscle structure. In fact, the dense bodies of smooth muscle serve the same role as the Z disks in skeletal muscle.

Another difference is that most of the myosin filaments have "side polar" cross-bridges arranged so that the bridges on one side hinge in one direction, and those on the other side hinge in the opposite direction. This configuration allows the myosin to pull an actin filament in one direction
![gu582415823e](gu582415823e.jpg)

Figure 8-2 Physical structure of smooth muscle. The fiber on the upper left shows actin filaments radiating from dense bodies. The fiber on the lower left and at right demonstrate the relation of myosin filaments to actin filaments.
on one side while simultaneously pulling another actin filament in the opposite direction on the other side. The value of this organization is that it allows smooth muscle cells to contract as much as $80 \%$ of their length instead of being limited to less than $30 \%$, as occurs in skeletal muscle.

## Comparison of Smooth Muscle Contraction and Skeletal Muscle Contraction

Although most skeletal muscles contract and relax rapidly, most smooth muscle contraction is prolonged tonic contraction, sometimes lasting hours or even days. Therefore, it is to be expected that both the physical and chemical characteristics of smooth muscle versus skeletal muscle contraction would differ. Some of the differences are noted in the following sections.

Slow Cycling of the Myosin Cross-Bridges. The rapidity of cycling of the myosin cross-bridges in smooth mus-cle-that is, their attachment to actin, then release from the actin, and reattachment for the next cycle-is much slower than in skeletal muscle. The frequency is as little as $1 / 10$ to $1 / 300$ that in skeletal muscle. Yet, the fraction of time that the cross-bridges remain attached to the actin filaments, which is a major factor that determines the force of contraction, is believed to be greatly increased in smooth muscle. A possible reason for the slow cycling is that the cross-bridge heads have far less ATPase activity than in skeletal muscle; thus, degradation of the ATP that energizes the movements of the cross-bridge heads is greatly reduced, with corresponding slowing of the rate of cycling.

Low Energy Requirement to Sustain Smooth Muscle Contraction. Only $1 / 10$ to $1 / 300$ as much energy is required to sustain the same tension of contraction in smooth muscle as in skeletal muscle. This, too, is believed to result from the slow attachment and detachment cycling of the cross-bridges, and because only one molecule of ATP is required for each cycle, regardless of its duration.

This low energy utilization by smooth muscle is important to the overall energy economy of the body because organs such as the intestines, urinary bladder, gallbladder, and other viscera often maintain tonic muscle contraction almost indefinitely.

Slowness of Onset of Contraction and Relaxation of the Total Smooth Muscle Tissue. A typical smooth muscle tissue begins to contract 50 to 100 milliseconds after it is excited, reaches full contraction about 0.5 second later, and then declines in contractile force in another 1 to 2 seconds, giving a total contraction time of 1 to 3 seconds. This is about 30 times as long as a single contraction of an average skeletal muscle fiber. However, because there are so many types of smooth muscle, contraction of some types can be as short as 0.2 second or as long as 30 seconds.

The slow onset of contraction of smooth muscle, as well as its prolonged contraction, is caused by the slowness of attachment and detachment of the cross-bridges with the actin filaments. In addition, the initiation of contraction in response to calcium ions is much slower than in skeletal muscle, as will be discussed later.

Maximum Force of Contraction Is Often Greater in Smooth Muscle Than in Skeletal Muscle. Despite the relatively few myosin filaments in smooth muscle, and despite the slow cycling time of the cross-bridges, the maximum force of contraction of smooth muscle is often greater than that of skeletal muscle, as much as 4 to $6 \mathrm{~kg} /$ $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ cross-sectional area for smooth muscle in comparison with 3 to 4 kilograms for skeletal muscle. This great force of smooth muscle contraction results from the pro-
longed period of attachment of the myosin cross-bridges to the actin filaments.

Latch Mechanism Facilitates Prolonged Holding of Contractions of Smooth Muscle. Once smooth muscle has developed full contraction, the amount of continuing excitation can usually be reduced to far less than the initial level, even though the muscle maintains its full force of contraction. Furthermore, the energy consumed to maintain contraction is often minuscule, sometimes as little as $1 / 300$ of the energy required for comparable sustained skeletal muscle contraction. This mechanism is called the latch mechanism.

The importance of the latch mechanism is that it can maintain prolonged tonic contraction in smooth muscle for hours, with little use of energy. Little continued excitatory signal is required from nerve fibers or hormonal sources.

Stress-Relaxation of Smooth Muscle. Another important characteristic of smooth muscle, especially the visceral unitary type of smooth muscle of many hollow organs, is its ability to return to nearly its original force of contraction seconds or minutes after it has been elongated or shortened. For example, a sudden increase in fluid volume in the urinary bladder, thus stretching the smooth muscle in the bladder wall, causes an immediate large increase in pressure in the bladder. However, during about the next 15 to 60 seconds, despite continued stretch of the bladder wall, the pressure returns almost exactly back to the original level. Then, when the volume is increased by another step, the same effect occurs again.

Conversely, when the volume is suddenly decreased, the pressure falls drastically at first but then rises in another few seconds or minutes to or near the original level. These phenomena are called stress-relaxation and reverse stress-relaxation. Their importance is that except for short periods, they allow a hollow organ to maintain about the same amount of pressure inside its lumen despite sustained large changes in volume.

## REGULATION OF CONTRACTION BY CALCIUM IONS

As is true for skeletal muscle, the initiating stimulus for most smooth muscle contraction is an increase in intracellular calcium ions. This increase can be caused in different types of smooth muscle by nerve stimulation of the smooth muscle fiber, hormonal stimulation, stretch of the fiber, or even changes in the chemical environment of the fiber.

Smooth muscle does not contain troponin, the regulatory protein that is activated by calcium ions to cause skeletal muscle contraction. Instead, smooth muscle contraction is activated by an entirely different mechanism, as described in the next section.

![gu592415823e](gu592415823e.jpg)

Figure 8-3 Intracellular calcium ion $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right)$ concentration increases when $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enters the cell through calcium channels in the cell membrane or is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to calmodulin (CaM) to form a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$ complex, which then activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). The active MLCK phosphorylates the myosin light chain, leading to attachment of the myosin head with the actin filament and contraction of the smooth muscle. ADP, Adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; P, phosphate.

Calcium Ions Combine with Calmodulin to Cause Activation of Myosin Kinase and Phosphorylation of the Myosin Head. In place of troponin, smooth muscle cells contain a large amount of another regulatory protein called calmodulin (Figure 8-3). Although this protein is similar to troponin, it is different in the manner in which it initiates contraction. Calmodulin initiates contraction by activating the myosin cross-bridges. This activation and subsequent contraction occur in the following sequence:

1. The calcium concentration in the cytosolic fluid of the smooth muscle increases as a result of the influx of calcium from the extracellular fluid through calcium channels and/or release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
2. The calcium ions bind reversibly with calmodulin.
3. The calmodulin-calcium complex then joins with and activates myosin light chain kinase, a phosphorylating enzyme.
4. One of the light chains of each myosin head, called the regulatory chain, becomes phosphorylated in response to this myosin kinase. When this chain is not phosphorylated, the attachment-detachment

Figure 8-4 Sarcoplasmic tubules in a large smooth muscle fiber showing their relation to invaginations in the cell membrane called caveolae.
cycling of the myosin head with the actin filament does not occur. However, when the regulatory chain is phosphorylated, the head has the capability of binding repetitively with the actin filament and proceeding through the entire cycling process of intermittent pulls, the same as what occurs for skeletal muscle, thus causing muscle contraction.

## Source of Calcium Ions That Cause Contraction

Although the contractile process in smooth muscle, as in skeletal muscle, is activated by calcium ions, the source of the calcium ions differs. An important difference is that the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which provides virtually all the calcium ions for skeletal muscle contraction, is only slightly developed in most smooth muscle. Instead, most of the calcium ions that cause contraction enter the muscle cell from the extracellular fluid at the time of the action potential or other stimulus. That is, the concentration of calcium ions in the extracellular fluid is greater than $10^{-3}$ molar, in comparison with less than $10^{-7}$ molar inside the smooth muscle cell; this causes rapid diffusion of the calcium ions into the cell from the extracellular fluid when the calcium channels open. The time required for this diffusion to occur averages 200 to 300 milliseconds and is called the latent period before contraction begins. This latent period is about 50 times as great for smooth muscle as for skeletal muscle contraction.

Role of the Smooth Muscle Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. Figure 8-4 shows a few slightly developed sarcoplasmic tubules that lie near the cell membrane in some larger smooth muscle cells. Small invaginations of the cell membrane, called caveolae, abut the surfaces of these tubules. The caveolae suggest a rudimentary analog of the trans-

verse tubule system of skeletal muscle. When an action potential is transmitted into the caveolae, this is believed to excite calcium ion release from the abutting sarcoplasmic tubules in the same way that action potentials in skeletal muscle transverse tubules cause release of calcium ions from the skeletal muscle longitudinal sarcoplasmic tubules. In general, the more extensive the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the smooth muscle fiber, the more rapidly it contracts.

Smooth Muscle Contraction Is Dependent on Extracellular Calcium Ion Concentration. Whereas changing the extracellular fluid calcium ion concentration from normal has little effect on the force of contraction of skeletal muscle, this is not true for most smooth muscle. When the extracellular fluid calcium ion concentration decreases to about $1 / 3$ to $1 / 10$ normal, smooth muscle contraction usually ceases. Therefore, the force of contraction of smooth muscle is usually highly dependent on the extracellular fluid calcium ion concentration.

A Calcium Pump Is Required to Cause Smooth Muscle Relaxation. To cause relaxation of smooth muscle after it has contracted, the calcium ions must be removed from the intracellular fluids. This removal is achieved by a calcium pump that pumps calcium ions out of the smooth muscle fiber back into the extracellular fluid, or into a sarcoplasmic reticulum, if it is present (Figure 8-5). This pump requires ATP and is slow acting in comparison with the fast-acting sarcoplasmic reticulum pump in skeletal muscle. Therefore, a single smooth muscle contraction often lasts for seconds rather than hundredths to tenths of a second, as occurs for skeletal muscle.

Myosin Phosphatase Is Important in Cessation of Contraction. Relaxation of the smooth muscle occurs when the calcium channels close and the calcium pump transports calcium ions out of the cytosolic fluid of the cell. When the calcium ion concentration falls below a critical level, the aforementioned processes automatically reverse, except for the phosphorylation of the myosin head. Reversal of this situation requires another enzyme, myosin phosphatase (see Figure 8-5), located in the cytosol of the smooth muscle cell, which splits the phosphate from the regulatory light chain. Then the cycling stops, and contraction ceases. The time required for the relaxation of muscle contraction, therefore, is determined to a great extent by the amount of active myosin phosphatase in the cell.

Possible Mechanism for Regulating the Latch Phenomenon. Because of the importance of the latch phenomenon in smooth muscle, and because this phenomenon allows for the long-term maintenance of tone in many smooth muscle organs without much expenditure of energy, many attempts have been made to explain it. Among the many mechanisms that have been postulated, one of the simplest is the following.
![gu612415823e](gu612415823e.jpg)

Figure 8-5 Relaxation of smooth muscle occurs when the calcium ion $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right)$ concentration decreases below a critical level as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is pumped out of the cell or into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is then released from calmodulin (CaM), and myosin phosphatase removes phosphate from the myosin light chain, causing detachment of the myosin head from the actin filament and relaxation of the smooth muscle. ADP, Adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, sodium; P, phosphate.

When the myosin kinase and myosin phosphatase enzymes are both strongly activated, the cycling frequency of the myosin heads and the velocity of contraction are great. Then, as activation of the enzymes decreases, the cycling frequency decreases but, at the same time, the deactivation of these enzymes allows the myosin heads to remain attached to the actin filament for a longer and longer proportion of the cycling period. Therefore, the number of heads attached to the actin filament at any given time remains large. Because the number of heads attached to the actin determines the static force of contraction, tension is maintained, or latched, yet little energy is used by the muscle because ATP is not degraded to ADP, except on the rare occasion when a head detaches.

## NERVOUS AND HORMONAL CONTROL OF SMOOTH MUSCLE CONTRACTION

Although skeletal muscle fibers are stimulated exclusively by the nervous system, smooth muscle can be stimulated to contract by nervous signals, hormonal stimulation, stretch of the muscle, and several other ways. The principal reason for the difference is that the smooth muscle

![gu622415823e](gu622415823e.jpg)

Figure 8-6 Innervation of smooth muscle by autonomic nerve fibers that branch diffusely and secrete neurotransmitter from multiple varicosities. Unitary (visceral) smooth muscle cells are connected by gap junctions so that depolarization can rapidly spread from one cell to another, permitting the muscle cells to contract as a single unit. In multi-unit smooth muscle, each cell is stimulated independently by a neurotransmitter released from closely associated autonomic nerve varicosities.
membrane contains many types of receptor proteins that can initiate the contractile process. Still other receptor proteins inhibit smooth muscle contraction, which is another difference from skeletal muscle. Therefore, in this section, we discuss nervous control of smooth muscle contraction, followed by hormonal control and other means of control.

## NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTIONS OF SMOOTH MUSCLE

Physiologic Anatomy of Smooth Muscle Neuromuscular Junctions. Neuromuscular junctions of the highly structured type found on skeletal muscle fibers do not occur in smooth muscle. Instead, the autonomic nerve fibers that innervate smooth muscle generally branch diffusely on top of a sheet of muscle fibers, as shown in Figure 8-6. In most cases, these fibers do not make direct contact with the smooth muscle fiber cell membranes but instead form diffuse junctions that secrete their transmitter substance into the matrix coating of the smooth muscle, often a few nanometers to a few micrometers away from the muscle cells. The transmitter substance then diffuses to the cells. Furthermore, where there are many layers of muscle cells, the nerve fibers often innervate only the outer layer. Muscle excitation travels from this outer layer to the inner layers by action potential conduction in the muscle mass or by additional diffusion of the transmitter substance.

The axons that innervate smooth muscle fibers do not have the typical branching end feet of the type found in the motor end plate on skeletal muscle fibers. Instead,
most of the fine terminal axons have multiple varicosities distributed along their axes. At these points, the Schwann cells that envelop the axons are interrupted so that transmitter substance can be secreted through the walls of the varicosities. In the varicosities are vesicles similar to those in the skeletal muscle end plate that contain transmitter substance. However, in contrast to the vesicles of skeletal muscle junctions, which always contain acetylcholine, the vesicles of the autonomic nerve fiber endings contain acetylcholine in some fibers and norepinephrine in others and occasionally other substances as well.

In a few cases, particularly in the multi-unit type of smooth muscle, the varicosities are separated from the muscle cell membrane by as little as 20 to 30 nanome-ters-the same width as the synaptic cleft that is found in the skeletal muscle junction. These are called contact junctions, and they function in much the same way as the skeletal muscle neuromuscular junction. The rapidity of contraction of these smooth muscle fibers is considerably faster than that of fibers stimulated by the diffuse junctions.

## Excitatory and Inhibitory Transmitter Substances Secreted at the Smooth Muscle Neuromuscular Junction.

The most important transmitter substances secreted by the autonomic nerves innervating smooth muscle are acetylcholine and norepinephrine, but they are never secreted by the same nerve fibers. Acetylcholine is an excitatory transmitter substance for smooth muscle fibers in some organs but an inhibitory transmitter for smooth muscle in other organs. When acetylcholine excites a muscle fiber, norepinephrine ordinarily inhibits it. Conversely, when acetylcholine inhibits a fiber, norepinephrine usually excites it.

Why are these responses different? The answer is that both acetylcholine and norepinephrine excite or inhibit smooth muscle by first binding with a receptor protein on the surface of the muscle cell membrane. Some of the receptor proteins are excitatory receptors, whereas others are inhibitory receptors. Thus, the type of receptor determines whether the smooth muscle is inhibited or excited and also determines which of the two transmitters, acetylcholine or norepinephrine, is effective in causing the excitation or inhibition. These receptors are discussed in more detail in Chapter 61 in regard to function of the autonomic nervous system.

## MEMBRANE POTENTIALS AND ACTION POTENTIALS IN SMOOTH MUSCLE

Membrane Potentials in Smooth Muscle. The quantitative voltage of the membrane potential of smooth muscle depends on the momentary condition of the muscle. In the normal resting state, the intracellular potential is usually about -50 to -60 millivolts, which is about 30 millivolts less negative than in skeletal muscle.

![gu632415823e](gu632415823e.jpg)

Figure 8-7 A, Typical smooth muscle action potential (spike potential) elicited by an external stimulus. B, Repetitive spike potentials, elicited by slow rhythmical electrical waves that occur spontaneously in the smooth muscle of the intestinal wall. C, Action potential with a plateau, recorded from a smooth muscle fiber of the uterus.

Action Potentials in Unitary Smooth Muscle. Action potentials occur in unitary smooth muscle (e.g., visceral muscle) in the same way that they occur in skeletal muscle. They do not normally occur in most multi-unit types of smooth muscle, as discussed in a subsequent section.

The action potentials of visceral smooth muscle occur in one of two forms-(1) spike potentials or (2) action potentials with plateaus.

Spike Potentials. Typical spike action potentials, such as those seen in skeletal muscle, occur in most types of unitary smooth muscle. The duration of this type of action potential is 10 to 50 milliseconds, as shown in Figure 8-7A. Such action potentials can be elicited in many ways-for example, by electrical stimulation, by the action of hormones on the smooth muscle, by the action of transmitter substances from nerve fibers, by stretch, or as a result of spontaneous generation in the muscle fiber itself, as discussed subsequently.

Action Potentials with Plateaus. Figure 8-7C shows a smooth muscle action potential with a plateau. The onset of this action potential is similar to that of the typical spike potential. However, instead of rapid repolarization of the muscle fiber membrane, the repolarization is delayed for several hundred to as much as 1000 milliseconds ( 1 second). The importance of the plateau is that it can account for the prolonged contraction that occurs in some types of smooth muscle, such as the ureter, the uterus under
some conditions, and certain types of vascular smooth muscle. Also, this is the type of action potential seen in cardiac muscle fibers that have a prolonged period of contraction, as discussed in Chapters 9 and 10.

Calcium Channels Are Important in Generating the Smooth Muscle Action Potential. The smooth muscle cell membrane has far more voltage-gated calcium channels than skeletal muscle but few voltage-gated sodium channels. Therefore, sodium does not participate much in the generation of the action potential in most smooth muscle. Instead, the flow of calcium ions to the interior of the fiber is mainly responsible for the action potential. This flow occurs in the same self-regenerative way as occurs for the sodium channels in nerve fibers and in skeletal muscle fibers. However, the calcium channels open many times more slowly than sodium channels, and they also remain open much longer. These characteristics largely account for the prolonged plateau action potentials of some smooth muscle fibers.

Another important feature of calcium ion entry into the cells during the action potential is that the calcium ions act directly on the smooth muscle contractile mechanism to cause contraction. Thus, the calcium performs two tasks at once.

## Slow Wave Potentials in Unitary Smooth Muscle Can Lead to Spontaneous Generation of Action Potentials.

Some smooth muscle is self-excitatory-that is, action potentials arise within the smooth muscle cells without an extrinsic stimulus. This activity is often associated with a basic slow wave rhythm of the membrane potential. A typical slow wave in a visceral smooth muscle of the gut is shown in Figure 8-7B. The slow wave is not the action potential. That is, it is not a self-regenerative process that spreads progressively over the membranes of the muscle fibers. Instead, it is a local property of the smooth muscle fibers that make up the muscle mass.

The cause of the slow wave rhythm is unknown. One suggestion is that the slow waves are caused by waxing and waning of the pumping of positive ions (presumably sodium ions) outward through the muscle fiber membrane. That is, the membrane potential becomes more negative when sodium is pumped rapidly and less negative when the sodium pump becomes less active. Another suggestion is that the conductances of the ion channels increase and decrease rhythmically.

The importance of the slow waves is that when they are strong enough, they can initiate action potentials. The slow waves themselves cannot cause muscle contraction. However, when the peak of the negative slow wave potential inside the cell membrane rises in the positive direction, from -60 to about -35 millivolts (the approximate threshold for eliciting action potentials in most visceral smooth muscle), an action potential develops and spreads over the muscle mass and contraction occurs. Figure 8-7B demonstrates this effect, showing that at

each peak of the slow wave, one or more action potentials occur. These repetitive sequences of action potentials elicit rhythmical contraction of the smooth muscle mass. Therefore, the slow waves are called pacemaker waves. In Chapter 63, we see that this type of pacemaker activity controls the rhythmical contractions of the gut.

Excitation of Visceral Smooth Muscle by Muscle Stretch. When visceral (unitary) smooth muscle is stretched sufficiently, spontaneous action potentials are usually generated. They result from a combination of the following: (1) the normal slow wave potentials; and (2) a decrease in overall negativity of the membrane potential caused by the stretch. This response to stretch allows the gut wall, when excessively stretched, to contract automatically and rhythmically. For example, when the gut is overfilled by intestinal contents, local automatic contractions often set up peristaltic waves that move the contents away from the overfilled intestine, usually in the direction of the anus.

## DEPOLARIZATION OF MULTI-UNIT SMOOTH MUSCLE WITHOUT ACTION POTENTIALS

The smooth muscle fibers of multi-unit smooth muscle (e.g., the muscle of the iris of the eye or the piloerector muscle of each hair) normally contract mainly in response to nerve stimuli. The nerve endings secrete acetylcholine in the case of some multi-unit smooth muscles and norepinephrine in the case of others. In both cases, the transmitter substances cause depolarization of the smooth muscle membrane, and this depolarization in turn elicits contraction. Action potentials usually do not develop because the fibers are too small to generate an action potential. (When action potentials are elicited in visceral unitary smooth muscle, 30 to 40 smooth muscle fibers must depolarize simultaneously before a self-propagating action potential ensues.) However, in small smooth muscle cells, even without an action potential, the local depolarization (called the junctional potential) caused by the nerve transmitter substance spreads "electrotonically" over the entire fiber and is all that is necessary to cause muscle contraction.

## Local Tissue Factors and Hormones Can Cause Smooth Muscle Contraction Without Action Potentials

Approximately half of all smooth muscle contraction is likely initiated by stimulatory factors acting directly on the smooth muscle contractile machinery and without action potentials. Two types of non-nervous and nonaction potential stimulating factors often involved are (1) local tissue chemical factors and (2) various hormones.

Smooth Muscle Contraction in Response to Local Tissue Chemical Factors. In Chapter 17, we discuss control of contraction of the arterioles, meta-arterioles, and precapillary sphincters. The smallest of these vessels have lit-
tle or no nervous supply. Yet, the smooth muscle is highly contractile, responding rapidly to changes in local chemical conditions in the surrounding interstitial fluid and to stretch caused by changes in blood pressure.

In the normal resting state, many of these small blood vessels remain contracted. However, when extra blood flow to the tissue is necessary, multiple factors can relax the vessel wall, thus allowing for increased flow. In this way, a powerful local feedback control system controls the blood flow to the local tissue area. Some of the specific control factors are as follows:

1. Lack of oxygen in the local tissues causes smooth muscle relaxation and, therefore, vasodilation.
2. Excess carbon dioxide causes vasodilation.
3. Increased hydrogen ion concentration causes vasodilation.
Adenosine, lactic acid, increased potassium ions, nitric oxide, and increased body temperature can all cause local vasodilation. Decreased blood pressure, by causing decreased stretch of the vascular smooth muscle, also causes these small blood vessels to dilate.

Effects of Hormones on Smooth Muscle Contraction. Many circulating hormones in the blood affect smooth muscle contraction to some degree, and some have profound effects. Among the more important of these hormones are norepinephrine, epinephrine, angiotensin II, endothelin, vasopressin, oxytocin, serotonin, and histamine.

A hormone causes contraction of a smooth muscle when the muscle cell membrane contains hormone-gated excitatory receptors for the respective hormone. Conversely, the hormone causes inhibition if the membrane contains inhibitory receptors for the hormone rather than excitatory receptors.

Mechanisms of Smooth Muscle Excitation or Inhibition by Hormones or Local Tissue Factors. Some hormone receptors in the smooth muscle membrane open sodium or calcium ion channels and depolarize the membrane, the same as after nerve stimulation. Sometimes, action potentials result, or action potentials that are already occurring may be enhanced. In other cases, depolarization occurs without action potentials, and this depolarization allows for calcium ion entry into the cell, which promotes the contraction.

Inhibition, in contrast, occurs when the hormone (or other tissue factor) closes the sodium and calcium channels to prevent entry of these positive ions; inhibition also occurs if the normally closed potassium channels are opened, allowing positive potassium ions to diffuse out of the cell. Both these actions increase the degree of negativity inside the muscle cell, a state called hyperpolarization, which strongly inhibits muscle contraction.

Sometimes, smooth muscle contraction or inhibition is initiated by hormones without directly causing any change in the membrane potential. In these cases, the hormone may activate a membrane receptor that does not open

any ion channels but, instead, causes an internal change in the muscle fiber, such as release of calcium ions from the intracellular sarcoplasmic reticulum; the calcium then induces contraction. To inhibit contraction, other receptor mechanisms are known to activate the enzyme adenylate cyclase or guanylate cyclase in the cell membrane. The portions of the receptors that protrude to the interior of the cells are coupled to these enzymes, causing the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), so-called second messengers. cAMP or cGMP has many effects, one of which is to change the degree of phosphorylation of several enzymes that indirectly inhibit contraction. The pump that moves calcium ions from the sarcoplasm into the sarcoplasmic reticulum is activated, as well as the cell membrane pump that moves calcium ions out of the cell; these effects reduce the calcium ion concentration in the sarcoplasm, thereby inhibiting contraction.

Smooth muscles have considerable diversity in how they initiate contraction or relaxation in response to different hormones, neurotransmitters, and other substances. In some cases, the same substance may cause either relaxation or contraction of smooth muscles in different locations. For example, norepinephrine inhibits contraction of smooth muscle in the intestine but stimulates contraction of smooth muscle in blood vessels.

# Cardiac Muscle; The Heart as a Pump and Function of the Heart Valves 

The heart, shown in Figure 9-1, is actually two separate pumps, a right heart that pumps blood through the lungs and a left heart that pumps blood through the systemic circulation that provides blood flow to the other organs and tissues of the body. Each of these is a pulsatile, twochamber pump composed of an atrium and a ventricle. Each atrium is a weak primer pump for the ventricle, helping to move blood into the ventricle. The ventricles then supply the main pumping force that propels the blood either (1) through the pulmonary circulation by the right ventricle or (2) through the systemic circulation by the left ventricle. The heart is surrounded by a two-layer sac called the pericardium, which protects the heart and holds it in place.

Special mechanisms in the heart cause a continuing succession of contractions called cardiac rhythmicity, transmitting action potentials throughout the cardiac muscle to cause the heart's rhythmical beat. This rhythmical control system is discussed in Chapter 10. In this chapter, we explain how the heart operates as a pump, beginning with the special features of cardiac muscle (Video 9-1).

## PHYSIOLOGY OF CARDIAC MUSCLE

The heart is composed of three major types of cardiac muscle-atrial muscle, ventricular muscle, and specialized excitatory and conductive muscle fibers. The atrial and ventricular types of muscle contract in much the same way as skeletal muscle, except that the duration of contraction is much longer. The specialized excitatory and conductive fibers of the heart, however, contract feebly because they contain few contractile fibrils; instead, they exhibit automatic rhythmical electrical discharge in the form of action potentials or conduction of the action potentials through the heart, providing an excitatory system that controls the rhythmical beating of the heart.

## CARDIAC MUSCLE ANATOMY

Figure 9-2 shows the cardiac muscle histology, demonstrating cardiac muscle fibers arranged in a latticework, with the fibers dividing, recombining, and then spreading
again. Note that cardiac muscle is striated in the same manner as in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, cardiac muscle has typical myofibrils that contain actin and myosin filaments almost identical to those found in skeletal muscle; these filaments lie side by side and slide during contraction in the same manner as occurs in skeletal muscle (see Chapter 6). In other ways, however, cardiac muscle is quite different from skeletal muscle, as we shall see.

## Left Ventricular Rotation (Twist) Aids Left Ventricular

Ejection and Relaxation. The left ventricle is organized into complex muscle fiber layers that run in different directions and allow the heart to contract in a twisting motion during systole. The subepicardial (outer) layer spirals in a leftward direction, and the subendocardial (inner) layer spirals in the opposite direction (rightward), causing clockwise rotation of the apex of the heart and counterclockwise rotation of the base of the left ventricle (Figure 9-3). This causes a wringing motion of the left ventricle, pulling the base downward toward the apex during systole (contraction). At the end of systole, the left ventricle is similar to a loaded spring and recoils or untwists during diastole (relaxation) to allow blood to enter the pumping chambers rapidly.
Cardiac Muscle Is a Syncytium. The dark areas crossing the cardiac muscle fibers in Figure 9-2 are called intercalated discs; they are actually cell membranes that separate individual cardiac muscle cells from one another. That is, cardiac muscle fibers are made up of many individual cells connected in series and in parallel with one another.

At each intercalated disc, the cell membranes fuse with one another to form permeable communicating junctions (gap junctions) that allow rapid diffusion of ions. Therefore, from a functional point of view, ions move with ease in the intracellular fluid along the longitudinal axes of the cardiac muscle fibers so that action potentials travel easily from one cardiac muscle cell to the next, past the intercalated discs. Thus, cardiac muscle is a syncytium of many heart muscle cells in which the cardiac cells are so interconnected that when one cell becomes excited, the action potential rapidly spreads to all of them.

The heart actually is composed of two syncytia; the atrial syncytium, which constitutes the walls of the two
