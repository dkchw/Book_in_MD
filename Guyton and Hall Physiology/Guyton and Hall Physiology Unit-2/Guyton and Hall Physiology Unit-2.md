# Functional Organization of the Human Body and Control of the "Internal Environment" 

Physiology is the science that seeks to explain the physical and chemical mechanisms that are responsible for the origin, development, and progression of life. Each type of life, from the simplest virus to the largest tree or the complicated human being, has its own functional characteristics. Therefore, the vast field of physiology can be divided into viral physiology, bacterial physiology, cellular physiology, plant physiology, invertebrate physiology, vertebrate physiology, mammalian physiology, human physiology, and many more subdivisions.

Human Physiology. The science of human physiology attempts to explain the specific characteristics and mechanisms of the human body that make it a living being. The fact that we remain alive is the result of complex control systems. Hunger makes us seek food, and fear makes us seek refuge. Sensations of cold make us look for warmth. Other forces cause us to seek fellowship and to reproduce. The fact that we are sensing, feeling, and knowledgeable beings is part of this automatic sequence of life; these special attributes allow us to exist under widely varying conditions that otherwise would make life impossible.

Human physiology links the basic sciences with medicine and integrates multiple functions of the cells, tissues, and organs into the functions of the living human being. This integration requires communication and coordination by a vast array of control systems that operate at every level-from the genes that program synthesis of molecules to the complex nervous and hormonal systems that coordinate functions of cells, tissues, and organs throughout the body. Thus, the coordinated functions of the human body are much more than the sum of its parts, and life in health, as well as in disease states, relies on this total function. Although the main focus of this book is on normal human physiology, we will also discuss, to some extent, pathophysiology, which is the study of disordered body function and the basis for clinical medicine.

## CELLS ARE THE LIVING UNITS OF THE BODY

The basic living unit of the body is the cell. Each tissue or organ is an aggregate of many different cells held together by intercellular supporting structures.

Each type of cell is specially adapted to perform one or a few particular functions. For example, the red blood cells, numbering about 25 trillion in each person, transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Although the red blood cells are the most abundant of any single type of cell in the body, there are also trillions of additional cells of other types that perform functions different from those of the red blood cell. The entire body, then, contains about 35 to 40 trillion human cells.

The many cells of the body often differ markedly from one another but all have certain basic characteristics that are alike. For example, oxygen reacts with carbohydrate, fat, and protein to release the energy required for all cells to function. Furthermore, the general chemical mechanisms for changing nutrients into energy are basically the same in all cells, and all cells deliver products of their chemical reactions into the surrounding fluids.

Almost all cells also have the ability to reproduce additional cells of their own type. Fortunately, when cells of a particular type are destroyed, the remaining cells of this type usually generate new cells until the supply is replenished.

Microorganisms Living in the Body Outnumber Human Cells. In addition to human cells, trillions of microbes inhabit the body, living on the skin and in the mouth, gut, and nose. The gastrointestinal tract, for example, normally contains a complex and dynamic population of 400 to 1000 species of microorganisms that outnumber our human cells. Communities of microorganisms that inhabit the body, often called microbiota, can cause diseases, but most of the time they live in harmony with their human hosts and provide vital functions that are essential for survival of their hosts. Although the importance of gut microbiota in the digestion of foodstuffs is widely recognized, additional roles for the body's microbes in nutrition, immunity, and other functions are just beginning to be appreciated and represent an intensive area of biomedical research.

## EXTRACELLULAR FLUID-THE "INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT"

About 50\% to 70\% of the adult human body is fluid, mainly a water solution of ions and other substances. Although

most of this fluid is inside the cells and is called intracellular fluid, about one-third is in the spaces outside the cells and is called extracellular fluid. This extracellular fluid is in constant motion throughout the body. It is transported rapidly in the circulating blood and then mixed between the blood and tissue fluids by diffusion through the capillary walls.

In the extracellular fluid are the ions and nutrients needed by the cells to maintain life. Thus, all cells live in essentially the same environment-the extracellular fluid. For this reason, the extracellular fluid is also called the internal environment of the body, or the milieu intérieur, a term introduced by the great 19th-century French physiologist Claude Bernard (1813-1878).

Cells are capable of living and performing their special functions as long as the proper concentrations of oxygen, glucose, different ions, amino acids, fatty substances, and other constituents are available in this internal environment.

Differences in Extracellular and Intracellular Fluids. The extracellular fluid contains large amounts of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate ions plus nutrients for the cells, such as oxygen, glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids. It also contains carbon dioxide that is being transported from the cells to the lungs to be excreted, plus other cellular waste products that are being transported to the kidneys for excretion.

The intracellular fluid contains large amounts of potassium, magnesium, and phosphate ions instead of the sodium and chloride ions found in the extracellular fluid. Special mechanisms for transporting ions through the cell membranes maintain the ion concentration differences between the extracellular and intracellular fluids. These transport processes are discussed in Chapter 4.

## HOMEOSTASIS—MAINTENANCE OF A NEARLY CONSTANT INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

In 1929, the American physiologist Walter Cannon (1871-1945) coined the term homeostasis to describe the maintenance of nearly constant conditions in the internal environment. Essentially, all organs and tissues of the body perform functions that help maintain these relatively constant conditions. For example, the lungs provide oxygen to the extracellular fluid to replenish the oxygen used by the cells, the kidneys maintain constant ion concentrations, and the gastrointestinal system provides nutrients while eliminating waste from the body.

The various ions, nutrients, waste products, and other constituents of the body are normally regulated within a range of values, rather than at fixed values. For some of the body's constituents, this range is extremely small. Variations in the blood hydrogen ion concentration, for example, are normally less than 5 nanomoles/L ( 0.000000005 moles $/ \mathrm{L}$ ). The blood sodium concentration is also tightly
regulated, normally varying only a few millimoles per liter, even with large changes in sodium intake, but these variations of sodium concentration are at least 1 million times greater than for hydrogen ions.

Powerful control systems exist for maintaining concentrations of sodium and hydrogen ions, as well as for most of the other ions, nutrients, and substances in the body at levels that permit the cells, tissues, and organs to perform their normal functions, despite wide environmental variations and challenges from injury and diseases.

Much of this text is concerned with how each organ or tissue contributes to homeostasis. Normal body functions require integrated actions of cells, tissues, organs, and multiple nervous, hormonal, and local control systems that together contribute to homeostasis and good health.

Homeostatic Compensations in Diseases. Disease is often considered to be a state of disrupted homeostasis. However, even in the presence of disease, homeostatic mechanisms continue to operate and maintain vital functions through multiple compensations. In some cases, these compensations may lead to major deviations of the body's functions from the normal range, making it difficult to distinguish the primary cause of the disease from the compensatory responses. For example, diseases that impair the kidneys' ability to excrete salt and water may lead to high blood pressure, which initially helps return excretion to normal so that a balance between intake and renal excretion can be maintained. This balance is needed to maintain life, but, over long periods of time, the high blood pressure can damage various organs, including the kidneys, causing even greater increases in blood pressure and more renal damage. Thus, homeostatic compensations that ensue after injury, disease, or major environmental challenges to the body may represent trade-offs that are necessary to maintain vital body functions but, in the long term, contribute to additional abnormalities of body function. The discipline of pathophysiology seeks to explain how the various physiological processes are altered in diseases or injury.

This chapter outlines the different functional systems of the body and their contributions to homeostasis. We then briefly discuss the basic theory of the body's control systems that allow the functional systems to operate in support of one another.

## EXTRACELLULAR FLUID TRANSPORT AND MIXING SYSTEM—THE BLOOD CIRCULATORY SYSTEM

Extracellular fluid is transported through the body in two stages. The first stage is movement of blood through the body in the blood vessels. The second is movement of fluid between the blood capillaries and the intercellular spaces between the tissue cells.

Figure 1-1 shows the overall circulation of blood. All the blood in the circulation traverses the entire circuit an average

![gu01176257b9](gu01176257b9.jpg)

Figure 1-1. General organization of the circulatory system.
of once each minute when the body is at rest and as many as six times each minute when a person is extremely active.

As blood passes through blood capillaries, continual exchange of extracellular fluid occurs between the plasma portion of the blood and the interstitial fluid that fills the intercellular spaces. This process is shown in Figure 1-2. The capillary walls are permeable to most molecules in the blood plasma, with the exception of plasma proteins, which are too large to pass through capillaries readily. Therefore, large amounts of fluid and its dissolved constituents diffuse back and forth between the blood and the tissue spaces, as shown by the arrows in Figure 1-2.

This process of diffusion is caused by kinetic motion of the molecules in the plasma and the interstitial fluid.
![gu02176257b9](gu02176257b9.jpg)

Figure 1-2. Diffusion of fluid and dissolved constituents through the capillary walls and interstitial spaces.

That is, the fluid and dissolved molecules are continually moving and bouncing in all directions in the plasma and fluid in the intercellular spaces, as well as through capillary pores. Few cells are located more than 50 micrometers from a capillary, which ensures diffusion of almost any substance from the capillary to the cell within a few seconds. Thus, the extracellular fluid everywhere in the body-both that of the plasma and that of the interstitial fluid-is continually being mixed, thereby maintaining homogeneity of extracellular fluid throughout the body.

## ORIGIN OF NUTRIENTS IN THE EXTRACELLULAR FLUID

Respiratory System. Figure 1-1 shows that each time blood passes through the body, it also flows through the lungs. The blood picks up oxygen in alveoli, thus acquiring the oxygen needed by cells. The membrane between the alveoli and the lumen of the pulmonary capillaries, the alveolar membrane, is only 0.4 to 2.0 micrometers thick, and oxygen rapidly diffuses by molecular motion through this membrane into the blood.

Gastrointestinal Tract. A large portion of the blood pumped by the heart also passes through the walls of the gastrointestinal tract. Here different dissolved nutrients, including carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids, are absorbed from ingested food into the extracellular fluid of the blood.

Liver and Other Organs That Perform Primarily Metabolic Functions. Not all substances absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract can be used in their absorbed form by the cells. The liver changes the chemical compositions of many of these substances to more usable forms, and other tissues of the body-fat cells, gastrointestinal mucosa, kidneys, and endocrine glands-help modify the absorbed substances or store them until they are needed. The liver also eliminates certain waste products produced in the body and toxic substances that are ingested.

Musculoskeletal System. How does the musculoskeletal system contribute to homeostasis? The answer is obvious and simple. Were it not for the muscles, the body could not move to obtain the foods required for nutrition. The musculoskeletal system also provides motility for protection against adverse surroundings, without which the entire body, along with its homeostatic mechanisms, could be destroyed.

## REMOVAL OF METABOLIC END PRODUCTS

Removal of Carbon Dioxide by the Lungs. At the same time that blood picks up oxygen in the lungs, carbon dioxide is released from the blood into lung alveoli; the respiratory movement of air into and out of the lungs carries carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is the most abundant of all the metabolism products.

Kidneys. Passage of blood through the kidneys removes most of the other substances from the plasma besides carbon dioxide that are not needed by cells. These substances include different end products of cellular metabolism, such as urea and uric acid; they also include excesses of ions and water from the food that accumulate in the extracellular fluid.

The kidneys perform their function first by filtering large quantities of plasma through the glomerular capillaries into the tubules and then reabsorbing into the blood substances needed by the body, such as glucose, amino acids, appropriate amounts of water, and many of the ions. Most of the other substances that are not needed by the body, especially metabolic waste products such as urea and creatinine, are reabsorbed poorly and pass through the renal tubules into the urine.

Gastrointestinal Tract. Undigested material that enters the gastrointestinal tract and some waste products of metabolism are eliminated in the feces.

Liver. Among the many functions of the liver is detoxification or removal of ingested drugs and chemicals. The liver secretes many of these wastes into the bile to be eventually eliminated in the feces.

## REGULATION OF BODY FUNCTIONS

Nervous System. The nervous system is composed of three major parts-the sensory input portion, the central nervous system (or integrative portion), and the motor output portion. Sensory receptors detect the state of the body and its surroundings. For example, receptors in the skin alert us whenever an object touches the skin. The eyes are sensory organs that give us a visual image of the surrounding area. The ears are also sensory organs. The central nervous system is composed of the brain and spinal cord. The brain stores information, generates thoughts, creates ambition, and determines reactions that the body
performs in response to the sensations. Appropriate signals are then transmitted through the motor output portion of the nervous system to carry out one's desires.

An important segment of the nervous system is called the autonomic system. It operates at a subconscious level and controls many functions of internal organs, including the level of pumping activity by the heart, movements of the gastrointestinal tract, and secretion by many of the body's glands.

Hormone Systems. Located in the body are endocrine glands, organs and tissues that secrete chemical substances called hormones. Hormones are transported in the extracellular fluid to other parts of the body to help regulate cellular function. For example, thyroid hormone increases the rates of most chemical reactions in all cells, thus helping set the tempo of bodily activity. Insulin controls glucose metabolism, adrenocortical hormones control sodium and potassium ions and protein metabolism, and parathyroid hormone controls bone calcium and phosphate. Thus, the hormones provide a regulatory system that complements the nervous system. The nervous system controls many muscular and secretory activities of the body, whereas the hormonal system regulates many metabolic functions. The nervous and hormonal systems normally work together in a coordinated manner to control essentially all the organ systems of the body.

## PROTECTION OF THE BODY

Immune System. The immune system includes white blood cells, tissue cells derived from white blood cells, the thymus, lymph nodes, and lymph vessels that protect the body from pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. The immune system provides a mechanism for the body to carry out the following: (1) distinguish its own cells from harmful foreign cells and substances; and (2) destroy the invader by phagocytosis or by producing sensitized lymphocytes or specialized proteins (e.g., antibodies) that destroy or neutralize the invader.

Integumentary System. The skin and its various appendages (including the hair, nails, glands, and other structures) cover, cushion, and protect the deeper tissues and organs of the body and generally provide a boundary between the body's internal environment and the outside world. The integumentary system is also important for temperature regulation and excretion of wastes, and it provides a sensory interface between the body and the external environment. The skin generally comprises about $12 \%$ to $15 \%$ of body weight.

## REPRODUCTION

Although reproduction is sometimes not considered a homeostatic function, it helps maintain homeostasis by generating new beings to take the place of those that are

dying. This may sound like a permissive usage of the term homeostasis, but it illustrates that in the final analysis, essentially all body structures are organized to help maintain the automaticity and continuity of life.

## CONTROL SYSTEMS OF THE BODY

The human body has thousands of control systems. Some of the most intricate of these systems are genetic control systems that operate in all cells to help regulate intracellular and extracellular functions. This subject is discussed in Chapter 3.

Many other control systems operate within the organs to regulate functions of the individual parts of the organs; others operate throughout the entire body to control the interrelationships between the organs. For example, the respiratory system, operating in association with the nervous system, regulates the concentration of carbon dioxide in the extracellular fluid. The liver and pancreas control glucose concentration in the extracellular fluid, and the kidneys regulate concentrations of hydrogen, sodium, potassium, phosphate, and other ions in the extracellular fluid.

## EXAMPLES OF CONTROL MECHANISMS

Regulation of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Concentrations in the Extracellular Fluid. Because oxygen is one of the major substances required for chemical reactions in cells, the body has a special control mechanism to maintain an almost exact and constant oxygen concentration in the extracellular fluid. This mechanism depends principally on the chemical characteristics of hemoglobin, which is present in red blood cells. Hemoglobin combines with oxygen as the blood passes through the lungs. Then, as the blood passes through the tissue capillaries, hemoglobin, because of its own strong chemical affinity for oxygen, does not release oxygen into the tissue fluid if too much oxygen is already there. However, if oxygen concentration in the tissue fluid is too low, sufficient oxygen is released to re-establish an adequate concentration. Thus, regulation of oxygen concentration in the tissues relies to a great extent on the chemical characteristics of hemoglobin. This regulation is called the oxygen-buffering function of hemoglobin.

Carbon dioxide concentration in the extracellular fluid is regulated in a much different way. Carbon dioxide is a major end product of oxidative reactions in cells. If all the carbon dioxide formed in the cells continued to accumulate in the tissue fluids, all energy-giving reactions of the cells would cease. Fortunately, a higher than normal carbon dioxide concentration in the blood excites the respiratory center, causing a person to breathe rapidly and deeply. This deep rapid breathing increases expiration of carbon dioxide and, therefore, removes excess carbon dioxide from the blood and tissue fluids. This process continues until the concentration returns to normal.
![gu03176257b9](gu03176257b9.jpg)

Figure 1-3. Negative feedback control of arterial pressure by the arterial baroreceptors. Signals from the sensor (baroreceptors) are sent to the medulla of the brain, where they are compared with a reference set point. When arterial pressure increases above normal, this abnormal pressure increases nerve impulses from the baroreceptors to the medulla of the brain, where the input signals are compared with the set point, generating an error signal that leads to decreased sympathetic nervous system activity. Decreased sympathetic activity causes dilation of blood vessels and reduced pumping activity of the heart, which return arterial pressure toward normal.

Regulation of Arterial Blood Pressure. Several systems contribute to arterial blood pressure regulation. One of these, the baroreceptor system, is an excellent example of a rapidly acting control mechanism (Figure 1-3). In the walls of the bifurcation region of the carotid arteries in the neck, and also in the arch of the aorta in the thorax, are many nerve receptors called baroreceptors that are stimulated by stretch of the arterial wall. When arterial pressure rises too high, the baroreceptors send barrages of nerve impulses to the medulla of the brain. Here, these impulses inhibit the vasomotor center, which in turn decreases the number of impulses transmitted from the vasomotor center through the sympathetic nervous system to the heart and blood vessels. Lack of these impulses causes diminished pumping activity by the heart and dilation of peripheral blood vessels, allowing increased blood flow through the vessels. Both these effects decrease the arterial pressure, moving it back toward normal.

Conversely, a decrease in arterial pressure below normal relaxes the stretch receptors, allowing the vasomotor center to become more active than usual, thereby causing vasoconstriction and increased heart pumping. The initial decrease in arterial pressure thus initiates negative feedback mechanisms that raise arterial pressure back toward normal.

## Normal Ranges and Physical Characteristics of Important Extracellular Fluid Constituents

Table 1-1 lists some important constituents and physical characteristics of extracellular fluid, along with their normal values, normal ranges, and maximum limits without causing death. Note the narrowness of the normal range for each one. Values outside these ranges are often caused by illness, injury, or major environmental challenges.

Table 1-1 Important Constituents and Physical Characteristics of Extracellular Fluid

| Constituent | Normal Value | Normal Range | Approximate Short-Term Nonlethal Limit | Unit |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Oxygen (venous) | 40 | $25-40$ | $10-1000$ | mm Hg |
| Carbon dioxide (venous) | 45 | $41-51$ | $5-80$ | mm Hg |
| Sodium ion | 142 | $135-145$ | $115-175$ | $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ |
| Potassium ion | 4.2 | $3.5-5.3$ | $1.5-9.0$ | $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ |
| Calcium ion | 1.2 | $1.0-1.4$ | $0.5-2.0$ | $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ |
| Chloride ion | 106 | $98-108$ | $70-130$ | $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ |
| Bicarbonate ion | 24 | $22-29$ | $8-45$ | $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ |
| Glucose | 90 | $70-115$ | $20-1500$ | $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ |
| Body temperature | $98.4(37.0)$ | $98-98.8(37.0)$ | $65-110(18.3-43.3)$ | ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ |
| Acid-base (venous) | 7.4 | $7.3-7.5$ | $6.9-8.0$ | pH |

Most important are the limits beyond which abnormalities can cause death. For example, an increase in the body temperature of only $11^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ above normal can lead to a vicious cycle of increasing cellular metabolism that destroys the cells. Note also the narrow range for acid-base balance in the body, with a normal pH value of 7.4 and lethal values only about 0.5 on either side of normal. Whenever the potassium ion concentration decreases to less than one-third normal, paralysis may result from the inability of the nerves to carry signals. Alternatively, if potassium ion concentration increases to two or more times normal, the heart muscle is likely to be severely depressed. Also, when the calcium ion concentration falls below about one-half normal, a person is likely to experience tetanic contraction of muscles throughout the body because of the spontaneous generation of excess nerve impulses in peripheral nerves. When the glucose concentration falls below one-half normal, a person frequently exhibits extreme mental irritability and sometimes even has convulsions.

These examples should give one an appreciation for the necessity of the vast numbers of control systems that keep the body operating in health. In the absence of any one of these controls, serious body malfunction or death can result.

## CHARACTERISTICS OF CONTROL SYSTEMS

The aforementioned examples of homeostatic control mechanisms are only a few of the many thousands in the body, all of which have some common characteristics, as explained in this section.

## Negative Feedback Nature of Most Control Systems

Most control systems of the body act by negative feedback, which can be explained by reviewing some of the homeostatic control systems mentioned previously. In the regulation of carbon dioxide concentration, a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the extracellular fluid increases pulmonary ventilation. This, in turn, decreases
the extracellular fluid carbon dioxide concentration because the lungs expire greater amounts of carbon dioxide from the body. Thus, the high concentration of carbon dioxide initiates events that decrease the concentration toward normal, which is negative to the initiating stimulus. Conversely, a carbon dioxide concentration that falls too low results in feedback to increase the concentration. This response is also negative to the initiating stimulus.

In the arterial pressure-regulating mechanisms, a high pressure causes a series of reactions that promote reduced pressure, or a low pressure causes a series of reactions that promote increased pressure. In both cases, these effects are negative with respect to the initiating stimulus.

Therefore, in general, if some factor becomes excessive or deficient, a control system initiates negative feedback, which consists of a series of changes that return the factor toward a certain mean value, thus maintaining homeostasis.

Gain of a Control System. The degree of effectiveness with which a control system maintains constant conditions is determined by the gain of negative feedback. For example, let us assume that a large volume of blood is transfused into a person whose baroreceptor pressure control system is not functioning, and the arterial pressure rises from the normal level of 100 mm Hg up to 175 mm Hg . Then, let us assume that the same volume of blood is injected into the same person when the baroreceptor system is functioning, and this time the pressure increases by only 25 mm Hg . Thus, the feedback control system has caused a "correction" of -50 mm Hg , from 175 mm Hg to 125 mm Hg . There remains an increase in pressure of +25 mm Hg , called the "error," which means that the control system is not $100 \%$ effective in preventing change. The gain of the system is then calculated by using the following formula:

$$
\text { Gain }=\frac{\text { Correction }}{\text { Error }}
$$

Thus, in the baroreceptor system example, the correction is -50 mm Hg , and the error persisting is +25 mm Hg . Therefore, the gain of the person's baroreceptor system

![gu04176257b9](gu04176257b9.jpg)

Figure 1-4. Recovery of heart pumping caused by negative feedback after 1 liter of blood is removed from the circulation. Death is caused by positive feedback when 2 liters or more blood is removed.
for control of arterial pressure is -50 divided by +25 , or -2 . That is, a disturbance that increases or decreases the arterial pressure does so only one-third as much as would occur if this control system were not present.

The gains of some other physiological control systems are much greater than that of the baroreceptor system. For example, the gain of the system controlling internal body temperature when a person is exposed to moderately cold weather is about -33 . Therefore, one can see that the temperature control system is much more effective than the baroreceptor pressure control system.

## Positive Feedback May Cause Vicious Cycles and Death

Why do most control systems of the body operate by negative feedback rather than by positive feedback? If one considers the nature of positive feedback, it is obvious that positive feedback leads to instability rather than stability and, in some cases, can cause death.

Figure 1-4 shows an example in which death can ensue from positive feedback. This figure depicts the pumping effectiveness of the heart, showing the heart of a healthy human pumping about 5 liters of blood per minute. If the person suddenly bleeds a total of 2 liters, the amount of blood in the body is decreased to such a low level that not enough blood is available for the heart to pump effectively. As a result, the arterial pressure falls, and the flow of blood to the heart muscle through the coronary vessels diminishes. This scenario results in weakening of the heart, further diminished pumping, a further decrease in coronary blood flow, and still more weakness of the heart; the cycle repeats itself again and again until death occurs. Note that each cycle in the feedback results in further weakening of the heart. In other words, the initiating stimulus causes more of the same, which is positive feedback.

Positive feedback is sometimes known as a "vicious cycle," but a mild degree of positive feedback can be
overcome by the negative feedback control mechanisms of the body, and the vicious cycle then fails to develop. For example, if the person in the aforementioned example bleeds only 1 liter instead of 2 liters, the normal negative feedback mechanisms for controlling cardiac output and arterial pressure can counterbalance the positive feedback and the person can recover, as shown by the dashed curve of Figure 1-4.

Positive Feedback Can Sometimes Be Useful. The body sometimes uses positive feedback to its advantage. Blood clotting is an example of a valuable use of positive feedback. When a blood vessel is ruptured, and a clot begins to form, multiple enzymes called clotting factors are activated within the clot. Some of these enzymes act on other inactivated enzymes of the immediately adjacent blood, thus causing more blood clotting. This process continues until the hole in the vessel is plugged and bleeding no longer occurs. On occasion, this mechanism can get out of hand and cause formation of unwanted clots. In fact, this is what initiates most acute heart attacks, which can be caused by a clot beginning on the inside surface of an atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery and then growing until the artery is blocked.

Childbirth is another situation in which positive feedback is valuable. When uterine contractions become strong enough for the baby's head to begin pushing through the cervix, stretching of the cervix sends signals through the uterine muscle back to the body of the uterus, causing even more powerful contractions. Thus, the uterine contractions stretch the cervix, and cervical stretch causes stronger contractions. When this process becomes powerful enough, the baby is born. If they are not powerful enough, the contractions usually die out, and a few days pass before they begin again.

Another important use of positive feedback is for the generation of nerve signals. Stimulation of the membrane of a nerve fiber causes slight leakage of sodium ions through sodium channels in the nerve membrane to the fiber's interior. The sodium ions entering the fiber then change the membrane potential, which, in turn, causes more opening of channels, more change of potential, still more opening of channels, and so forth. Thus, a slight leak becomes an explosion of sodium entering the interior of the nerve fiber, which creates the nerve action potential. This action potential, in turn, causes electrical current to flow along the outside and inside of the fiber and initiates additional action potentials. This process continues until the nerve signal goes all the way to the end of the fiber.

In each case in which positive feedback is useful, the positive feedback is part of an overall negative feedback process. For example, in the case of blood clotting, the positive feedback clotting process is a negative feedback process for the maintenance of normal blood volume. Also, the positive feedback that causes nerve signals allows the nerves to participate in thousands of negative feedback nervous control systems.

## More Complex Types of Control Systems—Feed-Forward and Adaptive Control

Later in this text, when we study the nervous system, we shall see that this system contains great numbers of interconnected control mechanisms. Some are simple feedback systems similar to those already discussed. Many are not. For example, some movements of the body occur so rapidly that there is not enough time for nerve signals to travel from the peripheral parts of the body all the way to the brain and then back to the periphery again to control the movement. Therefore, the brain uses a mechanism called feed-forward control to cause required muscle contractions. Sensory nerve signals from the moving parts apprise the brain about whether the movement is performed correctly. If not, the brain corrects the feed-forward signals that it sends to the muscles the next time the movement is required. Then, if still further correction is necessary, this process will be performed again for subsequent movements. This process is called adaptive control. Adaptive control, in a sense, is delayed negative feedback.

Thus, one can see how complex the feedback control systems of the body can be. A person's life depends on all of them. Therefore, much of this text is devoted to discussing these life-giving mechanisms.

## PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABILITY

Although some physiological variables, such as plasma concentrations of potassium, calcium, and hydrogen ions, are tightly regulated, others, such as body weight and adiposity, show wide variation among different individuals and even in the same individual at different stages of life. Blood pressure, cardiac pumping, metabolic rate, nervous system activity, hormones, and other physiological variables change throughout the day as we move about and engage in normal daily activities. Therefore, when we discuss "normal" values, it is with the understanding that many of the body's control systems are constantly reacting to perturbations, and that variability may exist among different individuals, depending on body weight and height, diet, age, sex, environment, genetics, and other factors.

For simplicity, discussion of physiological functions often focuses on the "average" $70-\mathrm{kg}$ young, lean male. However, the American male no longer weighs an average of 70 kg ; he now weighs over 88 kg , and the average American female weighs over 76 kg , more than the average man in the 1960s. Body weight has also increased substantially in most other industrialized countries during the past 40 to 50 years.

Except for reproductive and hormonal functions, many other physiological functions and normal values are often discussed in terms of male physiology. However, there are clearly differences in male and female physiology beyond the obvious differences that relate to reproduction. These differences can have important consequences
for understanding normal physiology as well as for treatment of diseases.

Age-related and ethnic or racial differences in physiology also have important influences on body composition, physiological control systems, and pathophysiology of diseases. For example, in a lean young male the total body water is about $60 \%$ of body weight. As a person grows and ages, this percentage gradually decreases, partly because aging is usually associated with declining skeletal muscle mass and increasing fat mass. Aging may also cause a decline in the function and effectiveness of some organs and physiological control systems.

These sources of physiological variability-sex differences, aging, ethnic, and racial-are complex but important considerations when discussing normal physiology and the pathophysiology of diseases.

## SUMMARY—AUTOMATICITY OF THE BODY

The main purpose of this chapter has been to discuss briefly the overall organization of the body and the means whereby the different parts of the body operate in harmony. To summarize, the body is actually a social order of about 35 to 40 trillion cells organized into different functional structures, some of which are called organs. Each functional structure contributes its share to the maintenance of homeostasis in the extracellular fluid, which is called the internal environment. As long as normal conditions are maintained in this internal environment, the cells of the body continue to live and function properly. Each cell benefits from homeostasis and, in turn, each cell contributes its share toward the maintenance of homeostasis. This reciprocal interplay provides continuous automaticity of the body until one or more functional systems lose their ability to contribute their share of function. When this happens, all the cells of the body suffer. Extreme dysfunction leads to death; moderate dysfunction leads to sickness.

# The Cell and Its Functions 

Each of the trillions of cells in a human being is a living structure that can survive for months or years, provided its surrounding fluids contain appropriate nutrients. Cells are the building blocks of the body, providing structure for the body's tissues and organs, ingesting nutrients and converting them to energy, and performing specialized functions. Cells also contain the body's hereditary code, which controls the substances synthesized by the cells and permits them to make copies of themselves.

## ORGANIZATION OF THE CELL

A schematic drawing of a typical cell, as seen by the light microscope, is shown in Figure 2-1. Its two major parts are the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by a nuclear membrane, and the cytoplasm is separated from the surrounding fluids by a cell membrane, also called the plasma membrane.

The different substances that make up the cell are collectively called protoplasm. Protoplasm is composed mainly of five basic substances-water, electrolytes, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates.

Water. Most cells, except for fat cells, are comprised mainly of water in a concentration of $70 \%$ to $85 \%$. Many cellular chemicals are dissolved in the water. Others are suspended in the water as solid particulates. Chemical reactions take place among the dissolved chemicals or at the surfaces of the suspended particles or membranes.

Ions. Important ions in the cell include potassium, magnesium, phosphate, sulfate, bicarbonate, and smaller quantities of sodium, chloride, and calcium. These ions are all discussed in Chapter 4, which considers the interrelations between the intracellular and extracellular fluids.

The ions provide inorganic chemicals for cellular reactions and are necessary for the operation of some cellular control mechanisms. For example, ions acting at the cell membrane are required for the transmission of electrochemical impulses in nerve and muscle fibers.

Proteins. After water, the most abundant substances in most cells are proteins, which normally constitute $10 \%$ to
$20 \%$ of the cell mass. These proteins can be divided into two types, structural proteins and functional proteins.

Structural proteins are present in the cell mainly in the form of long filaments that are polymers of many individual protein molecules. A prominent use of such intracellular filaments is to form microtubules, which provide the cytoskeletons of cellular organelles such as cilia, nerve axons, the mitotic spindles of cells undergoing mitosis, and a tangled mass of thin filamentous tubules that hold the parts of the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm together in their respective compartments. Fibrillar proteins are found outside the cell, especially in the collagen and elastin fibers of connective tissue, and elsewhere, such as in blood vessel walls, tendons, and ligaments.

The functional proteins are usually composed of combinations of a few molecules in tubular-globular form. These proteins are mainly the enzymes of the cell and, in contrast to the fibrillar proteins, are often mobile in the cell fluid. Also, many of them are adherent to membranous structures inside the cell and catalyze specific intracellular chemical reactions. For example, the chemical reactions that split glucose into its component parts and then combine these with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water while simultaneously providing energy for cellular function are all catalyzed by a series of protein enzymes.

Lipids. Lipids are several types of substances that are grouped together because of their common property of being soluble in fat solvents. Especially important lipids
![gu05176257b9](gu05176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-1. Illustration of cell structures visible with a light microscope.

![gu06176257b9](gu06176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-2. Reconstruction of a typical cell, showing the internal organelles in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
are phospholipids and cholesterol, which together constitute only about $2 \%$ of the total cell mass. Phospholipids and cholesterol are mainly insoluble in water and therefore are used to form the cell membrane and intracellular membrane barriers that separate the different cell compartments.

In addition to phospholipids and cholesterol, some cells contain large quantities of triglycerides, also called neutral fats. In fat cells (adipocytes), triglycerides often account for as much as $95 \%$ of the cell mass. The fat stored in these cells represents the body's main storehouse of energy-giving nutrients that can later be used to provide energy wherever it is needed in the body.

Carbohydrates. Carbohydrates play a major role in cell nutrition and, as parts of glycoprotein molecules, have structural functions. Most human cells do not maintain large stores of carbohydrates; the amount usually averages only about $1 \%$ of their total mass but increases to as much as $3 \%$ in muscle cells and, occasionally, to $6 \%$ in liver cells. However, carbohydrate in the form of dissolved glucose is always present in the surrounding extracellular fluid so
that it is readily available to the cell. Also, a small amount of carbohydrate is stored in cells as glycogen, an insoluble polymer of glucose that can be depolymerized and used rapidly to supply the cell's energy needs.

## CELL STRUCTURE

The cell contains highly organized physical structures called intracellular organelles, which are critical for cell function. For example, without one of the organelles, the mitochondria, more than $95 \%$ of the cell's energy release from nutrients would cease immediately. The most important organelles and other structures of the cell are shown in Figure 2-2.

## MEMBRANOUS STRUCTURES OF THE CELL

Most organelles of the cell are covered by membranes composed primarily of lipids and proteins. These membranes include the cell membrane, nuclear membrane, membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, and membranes of the mitochondria, lysosomes, and Golgi apparatus.

![gu07176257b9](gu07176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-3. Structure of the cell membrane showing that it is composed mainly of a lipid bilayer of phospholipid molecules, but with large numbers of protein molecules protruding through the layer. Also, carbohydrate moieties are attached to the protein molecules on the outside of the membrane and to additional protein molecules on the inside.

The lipids in membranes provide a barrier that impedes movement of water and water-soluble substances from one cell compartment to another because water is not soluble in lipids. However, protein molecules often penetrate all the way through membranes, thus providing specialized pathways, often organized into actual pores, for passage of specific substances through membranes. Also, many other membrane proteins are enzymes, which catalyze a multitude of different chemical reactions, discussed here and in subsequent chapters.

## Cell Membrane

The cell membrane (also called the plasma membrane) envelops the cell and is a thin, pliable, elastic structure only 7.5 to 10 nanometers thick. It is composed almost entirely of proteins and lipids. The approximate composition is $55 \%$ proteins, $25 \%$ phospholipids, $13 \%$ cholesterol, $4 \%$ other lipids, and $3 \%$ carbohydrates.

The Cell Membrane Lipid Barrier Impedes Penetration by Water-Soluble Substances. Figure 2-3 shows the structure of the cell membrane. Its basic structure is a lipid bilayer, which is a thin, double-layered film of lipids-each layer only one molecule thick-that is
continuous over the entire cell surface. Interspersed in this lipid film are large globular proteins.

The basic lipid bilayer is composed of three main types of lipids-phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol. Phospholipids are the most abundant cell membrane lipids. One end of each phospholipid molecule is hydrophilic and soluble in water. The other end is hydrophobic and soluble only in fats. The phosphate end of the phospholipid is hydrophilic, and the fatty acid portion is hydrophobic.

Because the hydrophobic portions of the phospholipid molecules are repelled by water but are mutually attracted to one another, they have a natural tendency to attach to one another in the middle of the membrane, as shown in Figure 2-3. The hydrophilic phosphate portions then constitute the two surfaces of the complete cell membrane, in contact with intracellular water on the inside of the membrane and extracellular water on the outside surface.

The lipid layer in the middle of the membrane is impermeable to the usual water-soluble substances, such as ions, glucose, and urea. Conversely, fat-soluble substances, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and alcohol, can penetrate this portion of the membrane with ease.

Sphingolipids, derived from the amino alcohol sphingosine, also have hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups and

are present in small amounts in the cell membranes, especially nerve cells. Complex sphingolipids in cell membranes are thought to serve several functions, including protection from harmful environmental factors, signal transmission, and adhesion sites for extracellular proteins.

Cholesterol molecules in membranes are also lipids because their steroid nuclei are highly fat-soluble. These molecules, in a sense, are dissolved in the bilayer of the membrane. They mainly help determine the degree of permeability (or impermeability) of the bilayer to watersoluble constituents of body fluids. Cholesterol controls much of the fluidity of the membrane as well.

Integral and Peripheral Cell Membrane Proteins. Figure 2-3 also shows globular masses floating in the lipid bilayer. These membrane proteins are mainly glycoproteins. There are two types of cell membrane proteins, integral proteins, which protrude all the way through the membrane, and peripheral proteins, which are attached only to one surface of the membrane and do not penetrate all the way through.

Many of the integral proteins provide structural channels (or pores) through which water molecules and watersoluble substances, especially ions, can diffuse between extracellular and intracellular fluids. These protein channels also have selective properties that allow preferential diffusion of some substances over others.

Other integral proteins act as carrier proteins for transporting substances that otherwise could not penetrate the lipid bilayer. Sometimes, these carrier proteins even transport substances in the direction opposite to their electrochemical gradients for diffusion, which is called active transport. Still others act as enzymes.

Integral membrane proteins can also serve as receptors for water-soluble chemicals, such as peptide hormones, that do not easily penetrate the cell membrane. Interaction of cell membrane receptors with specific ligands that bind to the receptor causes conformational changes in the receptor protein. This process, in turn, enzymatically activates the intracellular part of the protein or induces interactions between the receptor and proteins in the cytoplasm that act as second messengers, relaying the signal from the extracellular part of the receptor to the interior of the cell. In this way, integral proteins spanning the cell membrane provide a means of conveying information about the environment to the cell interior.

Peripheral protein molecules are often attached to integral proteins. These peripheral proteins function almost entirely as enzymes or as controllers of transport of substances through cell membrane pores.

Membrane Carbohydrates-The Cell "Glycocalyx." Membrane carbohydrates occur almost invariably in combination with proteins or lipids in the form of glycoproteins or glycolipids. In fact, most of the integral proteins are glycoproteins, and about one-tenth of the membrane lipid molecules are glycolipids. The glyco- portions of
these molecules almost invariably protrude to the outside of the cell, dangling outward from the cell surface. Many other carbohydrate compounds, called proteoglycanswhich are mainly carbohydrates bound to small protein cores-are loosely attached to the outer surface of the cell as well. Thus, the entire outside surface of the cell often has a loose carbohydrate coat called the glycocalyx.

The carbohydrate moieties attached to the outer surface of the cell have several important functions:

1. Many of them have a negative electrical charge, which gives most cells an overall negative surface charge that repels other negatively charged objects.
2. The glycocalyx of some cells attaches to the glycocalyx of other cells, thus attaching cells to one another.
3. Many of the carbohydrates act as receptors for binding hormones, such as insulin. When bound, this combination activates attached internal proteins that in turn activate a cascade of intracellular enzymes.
4. Some carbohydrate moieties enter into immune reactions, as discussed in Chapter 35.

## CYTOPLASM AND ITS ORGANELLES

The cytoplasm is filled with minute and large dispersed particles and organelles. The jelly-like fluid portion of the cytoplasm in which the particles are dispersed is called cytosol and contains mainly dissolved proteins, electrolytes, and glucose.

Dispersed in the cytoplasm are neutral fat globules, glycogen granules, ribosomes, secretory vesicles, and five especially important organelles-the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes.

## Endoplasmic Reticulum

Figure 2-2 shows the endoplasmic reticulum, a network of tubular structures called cisternae and flat vesicular structures in the cytoplasm. This organelle helps process molecules made by the cell and transports them to their specific destinations inside or outside the cell. The tubules and vesicles interconnect. Also, their walls are constructed of lipid bilayer membranes that contain large amounts of proteins, similar to the cell membrane. The total surface area of this structure in some cells-the liver cells, for example-can be as much as 30 to 40 times the cell membrane area.

The detailed structure of a small portion of endoplasmic reticulum is shown in Figure 2-4. The space inside the tubules and vesicles is filled with endoplasmic matrix, a watery medium that is different from fluid in the cytosol outside the endoplasmic reticulum. Electron micrographs show that the space inside the endoplasmic reticulum is connected with the space between the two membrane surfaces of the nuclear membrane.

Substances formed in some parts of the cell enter the space of the endoplasmic reticulum and are then directed to other parts of the cell. Also, the vast surface area of this

![gu08176257b9](gu08176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-4. Structure of the endoplasmic reticulum.
reticulum and the multiple enzyme systems attached to its membranes provide the mechanisms for a major share of the cell's metabolic functions.

## Ribosomes and the Rough (Granular) Endoplasmic

Reticulum. Attached to the outer surfaces of many parts of the endoplasmic reticulum are large numbers of minute granular particles called ribosomes. Where these particles are present, the reticulum is called the rough (granular) endoplasmic reticulum. The ribosomes are composed of a mixture of RNA and proteins; they function to synthesize new protein molecules in the cell, as discussed later in this chapter and in Chapter 3.

Smooth (Agranular) Endoplasmic Reticulum. Part of the endoplasmic reticulum has no attached ribosomes. This part is called the smooth, or agranular, endoplasmic reticulum. The smooth reticulum functions for the synthesis of lipid substances and for other processes of the cells promoted by intrareticular enzymes.

## Golgi Apparatus

The Golgi apparatus, shown in Figure 2-5, is closely related to the endoplasmic reticulum. It has membranes similar to those of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The Golgi apparatus is usually composed of four or more stacked layers of thin, flat, enclosed vesicles lying near one side of the nucleus. This apparatus is prominent in secretory cells, where it is located on the side of the cell from which secretory substances are extruded.

The Golgi apparatus functions in association with the endoplasmic reticulum. As shown in Figure 2-5, small transport vesicles (also called endoplasmic reticulum vesicles [ER vesicles]) continually pinch off from the endoplasmic reticulum and shortly thereafter fuse with the Golgi apparatus. In this way, substances entrapped in ER
![gu09176257b9](gu09176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-5. A typical Golgi apparatus and its relationship to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the nucleus.
vesicles are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The transported substances are then processed in the Golgi apparatus to form lysosomes, secretory vesicles, and other cytoplasmic components (discussed later in this chapter).

## Lysosomes

Lysosomes, shown in Figure 2-2, are vesicular organelles that form by breaking off from the Golgi apparatus; they then disperse throughout the cytoplasm. The lysosomes provide an intracellular digestive system that allows the cell to digest the following: (1) damaged cellular structures; (2) food particles that have been ingested by the cell; and (3) unwanted matter such as bacteria. Lysosome are different in various cell types but are usually 250 to 750 nanometers in diameter. They are surrounded by typical lipid bilayer membranes and are filled with large numbers of small granules, 5 to 8 nanometers in diameter, which are protein aggregates of as many as 40 different hydrolase (digestive) enzymes. A hydrolytic enzyme is capable of splitting an organic compound into two or more parts by combining hydrogen from a water molecule with one part of the compound and combining the hydroxyl portion of the water molecule with the other part of the compound. For example, protein is hydrolyzed to form amino acids, glycogen is hydrolyzed to form glucose, and lipids are hydrolyzed to form fatty acids and glycerol.

Hydrolytic enzymes are highly concentrated in lysosomes. Ordinarily, the membrane surrounding the lysosome prevents the enclosed hydrolytic enzymes from coming into contact with other substances in the cell and therefore prevents their digestive actions. However, some conditions of the cell break the membranes of lysosomes, allowing release of the digestive enzymes. These enzymes then split the organic substances with which they come in contact into small, highly diffusible substances such as

![gu10176257b9](gu10176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-6. Secretory granules (secretory vesicles) in acinar cells of the pancreas.
amino acids and glucose. Some of the specific functions of lysosomes are discussed later in this chapter.

## Peroxisomes

Peroxisomes are physically similar to lysosomes, but they are different in two important ways. First, they are believed to be formed by self-replication (or perhaps by budding off from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum) rather than from the Golgi apparatus. Second, they contain oxidases rather than hydrolases. Several of the oxidases are capable of combining oxygen with hydrogen ions derived from different intracellular chemicals to form hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$. Hydrogen peroxide is a highly oxidizing substance and is used in association with catalase, another oxidase enzyme present in large quantities in peroxisomes, to oxidize many substances that might otherwise be poisonous to the cell. For example, about half the alcohol that a person drinks is detoxified into acetaldehyde by the peroxisomes of the liver cells in this manner. A major function of peroxisomes is to catabolize long-chain fatty acids.

## Secretory Vesicles

One of the important functions of many cells is secretion of special chemical substances. Almost all such secretory substances are formed by the endoplasmic reticulumGolgi apparatus system and are then released from the Golgi apparatus into the cytoplasm in the form of storage vesicles called secretory vesicles or secretory granules. Figure 2-6 shows typical secretory vesicles inside pancreatic acinar cells; these vesicles store protein proenzymes (enzymes that are not yet activated). The proenzymes are secreted later through the outer cell membrane into the pancreatic duct and then into the duodenum, where they become activated and perform digestive functions on the food in the intestinal tract.

## Mitochondria

The mitochondria, shown in Figure 2-2 and Figure 2-7, are called the powerhouses of the cell. Without them, cells would be unable to extract enough energy from the nutrients, and essentially all cellular functions would cease.
![gu11176257b9](gu11176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-7. Structure of a mitochondrion.

Mitochondria are present in all areas of each cell's cytoplasm, but the total number per cell varies from less than 100 up to several thousand, depending on the energy requirements of the cell. Cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes), for example, use large amounts of energy and have far more mitochondria than fat cells (adipocytes), which are much less active and use less energy. Furthermore, the mitochondria are concentrated in those portions of the cell responsible for the major share of its energy metabolism. They are also variable in size and shape. Some mitochondria are only a few hundred nanometers in diameter and are globular in shape, whereas others are elongated and are as large as 1 micrometer in diameter and 7 micrometers long. Still others are branching and filamentous.

The basic structure of the mitochondrion, shown in Figure 2-7, is composed mainly of two lipid bilayerprotein membranes, an outer membrane and an inner membrane. Many infoldings of the inner membrane form shelves or tubules called cristae onto which oxidative enzymes are attached. The cristae provide a large surface area for chemical reactions to occur. In addition, the inner cavity of the mitochondrion is filled with a matrix that contains large quantities of dissolved enzymes necessary for extracting energy from nutrients. These enzymes operate in association with oxidative enzymes on the cristae to cause oxidation of nutrients, thereby forming carbon dioxide and water and, at the same time, releasing energy. The liberated energy is used to synthesize a high-energy substance called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is then transported out of the mitochondrion and diffuses throughout the cell to release its own energy wherever it is needed for performing cellular functions. The chemical details of ATP formation by the mitochondrion are provided in Chapter 68, but some basic functions of ATP in the cell are introduced later in this chapter.

Mitochondria are self-replicative, which means that one mitochondrion can form a second one, a third one, and so on whenever the cell needs increased amounts of ATP. Indeed, the mitochondria contain DNA similar to that found in the cell nucleus. In Chapter 3, we will see that DNA is the basic constituent of the nucleus that

![gu12176257b9](gu12176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-8. Cell cytoskeleton composed of protein fibers called microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.
controls replication of the cell. The DNA of the mitochondrion plays a similar role, controlling replication of the mitochondrion. Cells that are faced with increased energy demands-for example, in skeletal muscles subjected to chronic exercise training-may increase the density of mitochondria to supply the additional energy required.

## Cell Cytoskeleton—Filament and Tubular Structures

The cell cytoskeleton is a network of fibrillar proteins organized into filaments or tubules. These originate as precursor proteins synthesized by ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The precursor molecules then polymerize to form filaments (Figure 2-8). As an example, large numbers of actin microfilaments frequently occur in the outer zone of the cytoplasm, called the ectoplasm, to form an elastic support for the cell membrane. Also, in muscle cells, actin and myosin filaments are organized into a special contractile machine that is the basis for muscle contraction, as discussed in Chapter 6.

Intermediate filaments are generally strong ropelike filaments that often work together with microtubules, providing strength and support for the fragile tubulin structures. They are called intermediate because their average diameter is between that of narrower actin microfilaments and wider myosin filaments found in muscle cells. Their functions are mainly mechanical, and they are less dynamic than actin microfilaments or microtubules.

All cells have intermediate filaments, although the protein subunits of these structures vary, depending on the cell type. Specific intermediate filaments found in various cells include desmin filaments in muscle cells, neurofilaments in neurons, and keratins in epithelial cells.

A special type of stiff filament composed of polymerized tubulin molecules is used in all cells to construct strong tubular structures, the microtubules. Figure 2-8 shows typical microtubules of a cell.

Another example of microtubules is the tubular skeletal structure in the center of each cilium that radiates upward from the cell cytoplasm to the tip of the cilium. This structure is discussed later in the chapter (see Figure 2-18). Also, both the centrioles and mitotic spindles of cells undergoing mitosis are composed of stiff microtubules.

A major function of microtubules is to act as a cytoskeleton, providing rigid physical structures for certain parts of cells. The cell cytoskeleton not only determines cell shape but also participates in cell division, allows cells to move, and provides a tracklike system that directs the movement of organelles in the cells. Microtubules serve as the conveyor belts for the intracellular transport of vesicles, granules, and organelles such as mitochondria.

## Nucleus

The nucleus is the control center of the cell and sends messages to the cell to grow and mature, replicate, or die. Briefly, the nucleus contains large quantities of DNA,

![gu13176257b9](gu13176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-9. Structure of the nucleus.
which comprise the genes. The genes determine the characteristics of the cell's proteins, including the structural proteins, as well as the intracellular enzymes that control cytoplasmic and nuclear activities.

The genes also control and promote cell reproduction. The genes first reproduce to create two identical sets of genes; then the cell splits by a special process called mitosis to form two daughter cells, each of which receives one of the two sets of DNA genes. All these activities of the nucleus are discussed in Chapter 3.

Unfortunately, the appearance of the nucleus under the microscope does not provide many clues to the mechanisms whereby the nucleus performs its control activities. Figure 2-9 shows the light microscopic appearance of the interphase nucleus (during the period between mitoses), revealing darkly staining chromatin material throughout the nucleoplasm. During mitosis, the chromatin material organizes in the form of highly structured chromosomes, which can then be easily identified using the light microscope, as illustrated in Chapter 3.

Nuclear Membrane. The nuclear membrane, also called the nuclear envelope, is actually two separate bilayer membranes, one inside the other. The outer membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell cytoplasm, and the space between the two nuclear membranes is also continuous with the space inside the endoplasmic reticulum, as shown in Figure 2-9.

The nuclear membrane is penetrated by several thousand nuclear pores. Large complexes of proteins are attached at the edges of the pores so that the central area of each pore is only about 9 nanometers in diameter. Even this size is large enough to allow molecules up to a molecular weight of 44,000 to pass through with reasonable ease.

Nucleoli and Formation of Ribosomes. The nuclei of most cells contain one or more highly staining structures called nucleoli. The nucleolus, unlike most other organelles discussed here, does not have a limiting membrane. Instead, it is simply an accumulation of large amounts of
![gu14176257b9](gu14176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-10. Comparison of sizes of precellular organisms with that of the average cell in the human body.

RNA and proteins of the types found in ribosomes. The nucleolus enlarges considerably when the cell is actively synthesizing proteins.

Formation of the nucleoli (and of the ribosomes in the cytoplasm outside the nucleus) begins in the nucleus. First, specific DNA genes in the chromosomes cause RNA to be synthesized. Some of this synthesized RNA is stored in the nucleoli, but most of it is transported outward through the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm. Here it is used in conjunction with specific proteins to assemble "mature" ribosomes that play an essential role in forming cytoplasmic proteins, as discussed in Chapter 3.

## COMPARISON OF THE ANIMAL CELL WITH PRECELLULAR FORMS OF LIFE

The cell is a complicated organism that required many hundreds of millions of years to develop after the earliest forms of life, microorganisms that may have been similar to present-day viruses, first appeared on earth. Figure 2-10 shows the relative sizes of the following: (1) the smallest known virus; (2) a large virus; (3) a Rickettsia; (4) a bacterium; and (5) a nucleated cell. This demonstrates that the cell has a diameter about 1000 times that of the smallest virus and therefore a volume about 1 billion times that of the smallest virus. Correspondingly, the functions and anatomical organization of the cell are also far more complex than those of the virus.

The essential life-giving constituent of the small virus is a nucleic acid embedded in a coat of protein. This nucleic acid is composed of the same basic nucleic acid constituents (DNA or RNA) found in mammalian cells and is capable of reproducing itself under appropriate conditions. Thus, the virus propagates its lineage from generation to generation and is therefore a living structure in the same way that cells and humans are living structures.

As life evolved, other chemicals in addition to nucleic acid and simple proteins became integral parts of the organism, and specialized functions began to develop in different parts of the virus. A membrane formed

around the virus and, inside the membrane, a fluid matrix appeared. Specialized chemicals then developed inside the fluid to perform special functions; many protein enzymes appeared that were capable of catalyzing chemical reactions, thus determining the organism's activities.

In still later stages of life, particularly in the rickettsial and bacterial stages, organelles developed inside the organism. These represent physical structures of chemical aggregates that perform functions in a more efficient manner than what can be achieved by dispersed chemicals throughout the fluid matrix.

Finally, in the nucleated cell, still more complex organelles developed, the most important of which is the nucleus. The nucleus distinguishes this type of cell from all lower forms of life; it provides a control center for all cellular activities and for reproduction of new cells generation after generation, with each new cell having almost exactly the same structure as its progenitor.

## FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS OF THE CELL

In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss some functional systems of the cell that make it a living organism.

## ENDOCYTOSIS—INGESTION BY THE CELL

If a cell is to live and grow and reproduce, it must obtain nutrients and other substances from the surrounding fluids. Most substances pass through the cell membrane by the processes of diffusion and active transport.

Diffusion involves simple movement through the membrane caused by the random motion of the molecules of the substance. Substances move through cell membrane pores or, in the case of lipid-soluble substances, through the lipid matrix of the membrane.

Active transport involves actually carrying a substance through the membrane by a physical protein structure that penetrates all the way through the membrane. These active transport mechanisms are so important to cell function that they are presented in detail in Chapter 4.

Large particles enter the cell by a specialized function of the cell membrane called endocytosis (Video 2-1). The principal forms of endocytosis are pinocytosis and phagocytosis. Pinocytosis means the ingestion of minute particles that form vesicles of extracellular fluid and particulate constituents inside the cell cytoplasm. Phagocytosis means the ingestion of large particles, such as bacteria, whole cells, or portions of degenerating tissue.

Pinocytosis. Pinocytosis occurs continually in the cell membranes of most cells, but is especially rapid in some cells. For example, it occurs so rapidly in macrophages that about $3 \%$ of the total macrophage membrane is engulfed in the form of vesicles each minute. Even so, the pinocytotic vesicles are so small-usually only 100 to 200 nanometers in diameter-that most of them can be seen only with an electron microscope.
![gu15176257b9](gu15176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-11. Mechanism of pinocytosis.
Pinocytosis is the only means whereby most large macromolecules, such as most proteins, can enter cells. In fact, the rate at which pinocytotic vesicles form is usually enhanced when such macromolecules attach to the cell membrane.

Figure 2-11 demonstrates the successive steps of pinocytosis $(A-D)$, showing three molecules of protein attaching to the membrane. These molecules usually attach to specialized protein receptors on the surface of the membrane that are specific for the type of protein that is to be absorbed. The receptors generally are concentrated in small pits on the outer surface of the cell membrane, called coated pits. On the inside of the cell membrane beneath these pits is a latticework of fibrillar protein called clathrin, as well as other proteins, perhaps including contractile filaments of actin and myosin. Once the protein molecules have bound with the receptors, the surface properties of the local membrane change in such a way that the entire pit invaginates inward, and fibrillar proteins surrounding the invaginating pit cause its borders to close over the attached proteins, as well as over a small amount of extracellular fluid. Immediately thereafter, the invaginated portion of the membrane breaks away from the surface of the cell, forming a pinocytotic vesicle inside the cytoplasm of the cell.

What causes the cell membrane to go through the necessary contortions to form pinocytotic vesicles is still unclear. This process requires energy from within the cell, which is supplied by ATP, a high-energy substance discussed later in this chapter. This process also requires the presence of calcium ions in the extracellular fluid, which probably react with contractile protein filaments beneath the coated pits to provide the force for pinching the vesicles away from the cell membrane.

Phagocytosis. Phagocytosis occurs in much the same way as pinocytosis, except that it involves large particles rather than molecules. Only certain cells have the capability of phagocytosis-notably, tissue macrophages and some white blood cells.

![gu16176257b9](gu16176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-12. Digestion of substances in pinocytotic or phagocytic vesicles by enzymes derived from lysosomes.

Phagocytosis is initiated when a particle such as a bacterium, dead cell, or tissue debris binds with receptors on the surface of the phagocyte. In the case of bacteria, each bacterium is usually already attached to a specific antibody; it is the antibody that attaches to the phagocyte receptors, dragging the bacterium along with it. This intermediation of antibodies is called opsonization, which is discussed in Chapters 34 and 35.

Phagocytosis occurs in the following steps:

1. The cell membrane receptors attach to the surface ligands of the particle.
2. The edges of the membrane around the points of attachment evaginate outward within a fraction of a second to surround the entire particle; then, progressively more and more membrane receptors attach to the particle ligands. All this occurs suddenly in a zipper-like manner to form a closed phagocytic vesicle.
3. Actin and other contractile fibrils in the cytoplasm surround the phagocytic vesicle and contract around its outer edge, pushing the vesicle to the interior.
4. The contractile proteins then pinch the stem of the vesicle so completely that the vesicle separates from the cell membrane, leaving the vesicle in the cell interior in the same way that pinocytotic vesicles are formed.

## LYSOSOMES DIGEST PINOCYTOTIC AND PHAGOCYTIC FOREIGN SUBSTANCES INSIDE THE CELL

Almost immediately after a pinocytotic or phagocytic vesicle appears inside a cell, one or more lysosomes become attached to the vesicle and empty their acid hydrolases to the inside of the vesicle, as shown in Figure 2-12. Thus, a digestive vesicle is formed inside the cell cytoplasm in which the vesicular hydrolases begin hydrolyzing the
proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and other substances in the vesicle. The products of digestion are small molecules of substances such as amino acids, glucose, and phosphates that can diffuse through the membrane of the vesicle into the cytoplasm. What is left of the digestive vesicle, called the residual body, represents indigestible substances. In most cases, the residual body is finally excreted through the cell membrane by a process called exocytosis, which is essentially the opposite of endocytosis. Thus, the pinocytotic and phagocytic vesicles containing lysosomes can be called the digestive organs of the cells.

Lysosomes and Regression of Tissues and Autolysis of Damaged Cells. Tissues of the body often regress to a smaller size. For example, this regression occurs in the uterus after pregnancy, in muscles during long periods of inactivity, and in mammary glands at the end of lactation. Lysosomes are responsible for much of this regression.

Another special role of the lysosomes is the removal of damaged cells or damaged portions of cells from tissues. Damage to the cell-caused by heat, cold, trauma, chemicals, or any other factor-induces lysosomes to rupture. The released hydrolases immediately begin to digest the surrounding organic substances. If the damage is slight, only a portion of the cell is removed, and the cell is then repaired. If the damage is severe, the entire cell is digested, a process called autolysis. In this way, the cell is completely removed, and a new cell of the same type is formed, ordinarily by mitotic reproduction of an adjacent cell to take the place of the old one.

The lysosomes also contain bactericidal agents that can kill phagocytized bacteria before they cause cellular damage. These agents include the following: (1) lysozyme, which dissolves the bacterial cell wall; (2) lysoferrin, which binds iron and other substances before they can promote bacterial growth; and (3) acid at a pH of about 5.0, which activates the hydrolases and inactivates bacterial metabolic systems.

Autophagy and Recycling of Cell Organelles. Lysosomes play a key role in the process of autophagy, which literally means "to eat oneself." Autophagy is a housekeeping process whereby obsolete organelles and large protein aggregates are degraded and recycled (Figure 2-13). Worn-out cell organelles are transferred to lysosomes by double-membrane structures called autophagosomes, which are formed in the cytosol. Invagination of the lysosomal membrane and the formation of vesicles provides another pathway for cytosolic structures to be transported into the lumen of lysosomes. Once inside the lysosomes, the organelles are digested, and the nutrients are reused by the cell. Autophagy contributes to the routine turnover of cytoplasmic components; it is a key mechanism for tissue development, cell survival when nutrients are scarce, and maintenance of homeostasis. In liver cells, for example, the average mitochondrion normally has a life span of only about 10 days before it is destroyed.

## SYNTHESIS OF CELLULAR STRUCTURES BY ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM AND GOLGI APPARATUS

## Endoplasmic Reticulum Functions

The extensiveness of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in secretory cells has already been emphasized. These structures are formed primarily of lipid bilayer membranes, similar to the cell membrane, and their walls are loaded with protein enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of many substances required by the cell.

Most synthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum. The products formed there are then passed on to the Golgi apparatus, where they are further processed before being released into the cytoplasm. First, however, let us note the specific products that are synthesized in specific portions of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.

Proteins Synthesis by the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is characterized by large numbers of ribosomes attached to the outer surfaces of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As discussed in Chapter 3, protein molecules are synthesized within the structures of the ribosomes. The ribosomes extrude some of the synthesized protein molecules directly into the cytosol, but they also extrude many more through the wall of the endoplasmic reticulum to the interior of the endoplasmic vesicles and tubules into the endoplasmic matrix.

Lipid Synthesis by the Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum also synthesizes lipids, especially phospholipids and cholesterol. These lipids are rapidly incorporated into the lipid bilayer of the endoplasmic reticulum, thus causing the endoplasmic reticulum to grow more extensive. This process occurs mainly in the smooth portion of the endoplasmic reticulum.

To keep the endoplasmic reticulum from growing beyond the needs of the cell, small vesicles called $E R$ vesicles or transport vesicles continually break away from the smooth reticulum; most of these vesicles then migrate rapidly to the Golgi apparatus.

Other Functions of the Endoplasmic Reticulum. Other significant functions of the endoplasmic reticulum, especially the smooth reticulum, include the following:

1. It provides the enzymes that control glycogen breakdown when glycogen is to be used for energy.
2. It provides a vast number of enzymes that are capable of detoxifying substances, such as drugs, that might damage the cell. It achieves detoxification by processes such as coagulation, oxidation, hydrolysis, and conjugation with glycuronic acid.

## Golgi Apparatus Functions

Synthetic Functions of the Golgi Apparatus. Although a major function of the Golgi apparatus is to provide additional processing of substances already formed in the endoplasmic reticulum, it can also synthesize certain carbohydrates that cannot be formed in the endoplasmic reticulum. This is especially true for the formation of large saccharide polymers bound with small amounts of protein; important examples include hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.

A few of the many functions of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate in the body are as follows: (1) they are the major components of proteoglycans secreted in mucus and other glandular secretions; (2) they are the major components of the ground substance, or nonfibrous components of the extracellular matrix, outside the cells in the interstitial spaces, which act as fillers between collagen fibers and cells; (3) they are principal components of the organic matrix in both cartilage and bone; and (4) they are important in many cell activities, including migration and proliferation.

![gu18176257b9](gu18176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-14. Formation of proteins, lipids, and cellular vesicles by the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.

Processing of Endoplasmic Secretions by the Golgi Apparatus-Formation of Vesicles. Figure 2-14 summarizes the major functions of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. As substances are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum, especially proteins, they are transported through the tubules toward portions of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum that lie nearest to the Golgi apparatus. At this point, transport vesicles composed of small envelopes of smooth endoplasmic reticulum continually break away and diffuse to the deepest layer of the Golgi apparatus. Inside these vesicles are synthesized proteins and other products from the endoplasmic reticulum.

The transport vesicles instantly fuse with the Golgi apparatus and empty their contained substances into the vesicular spaces of the Golgi apparatus. Here, additional carbohydrate moieties are added to the secretions. Also, an important function of the Golgi apparatus is to compact the endoplasmic reticular secretions into highly concentrated packets. As the secretions pass toward the outermost layers of the Golgi apparatus, the compaction and processing proceed. Finally, both small and large vesicles continually break away from the Golgi apparatus, carrying with them the compacted secretory substances and diffusing throughout the cell.

The following example provides an idea of the timing of these processes. When a glandular cell is bathed in amino acids, newly formed protein molecules can be detected in the granular endoplasmic reticulum within 3 to 5 minutes. Within 20 minutes, newly formed proteins are already present in the Golgi apparatus and, within 1 to 2 hours, the proteins are secreted from the surface of the cell.

Types of Vesicles Formed by the Golgi ApparatusSecretory Vesicles and Lysosomes. In a highly secretory cell, the vesicles formed by the Golgi apparatus are mainly secretory vesicles containing proteins that are secreted through the surface of the cell membrane. These secretory vesicles first diffuse to the cell membrane and then fuse with it and empty their substances to the exterior by the mechanism called exocytosis. Exocytosis, in most cases, is stimulated by entry of calcium ions into the cell. Calcium ions interact with the vesicular membrane and cause its fusion with the cell membrane, followed by exocytosis-opening of the membrane's outer surface and extrusion of its contents outside the cell. Some vesicles, however, are destined for intracellular use.

Use of Intracellular Vesicles to Replenish Cellular Membranes. Some intracellular vesicles formed by the Golgi apparatus fuse with the cell membrane or with the membranes of intracellular structures such as the mitochondria and even the endoplasmic reticulum. This fusion increases the expanse of these membranes and replenishes the membranes as they are used up. For example, the cell membrane loses much of its substance every time it forms a phagocytic or pinocytotic vesicle, and the vesicular membranes of the Golgi apparatus continually replenish the cell membrane.

In summary, the membranous system of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus are highly metabolic and capable of forming new intracellular structures and secretory substances to be extruded from the cell.

## THE MITOCHONDRIA EXTRACT ENERGY FROM NUTRIENTS

The principal substances from which cells extract energy are foods that react chemically with oxygen-carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. In the human body, essentially all carbohydrates are converted into glucose by the digestive tract and liver before they reach the other cells of the body. Similarly, proteins are converted into amino acids, and fats are converted into fatty acids. Figure 2-15 shows oxygen and the foodstuffs-glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids-all entering the cell. Inside the cell, they react chemically with oxygen under the influence of enzymes that control the reactions and channel the energy released in the proper direction. The details of all these digestive and metabolic functions are provided in Chapters 63 through 73.

Briefly, almost all these oxidative reactions occur inside the mitochondria, and the energy that is released is used to form the high-energy compound ATP. Then, ATP, not the original food, is used throughout the cell to energize almost all the subsequent intracellular metabolic reactions.

![gu19176257b9](gu19176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-15. Formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the cell showing that most of the ATP is formed in the mitochondria. (ADP, Adenosine diphosphate; CoA, coenzyme A.)

## Functional Characteristics of Adenosine Triphosphate

![gu20176257b9](gu20176257b9.jpg)

ATP is a nucleotide composed of the following: (1) the nitrogenous base adenine; (2) the pentose sugar ribose; and (3) three phosphate radicals. The last two phosphate radicals are connected with the remainder of the molecule by high-energy phosphate bonds, which are represented in the formula shown by the symbol $\sim$. Under the physical and chemical conditions of the body, each of these high-energy bonds contains about 12,000 calories of energy per mole of ATP, which is many times greater than the energy stored in the average chemical bond, thus giving rise to the term high-energy bond. Furthermore, the high-energy phosphate bond is very labile, so that it can be split instantly on demand whenever energy is required to promote other intracellular reactions.

When ATP releases its energy, a phosphoric acid radical is split away, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is formed. This released energy is used to energize many of
the cell's other functions, such as syntheses of substances and muscular contraction.

To reconstitute the cellular ATP as it is used up, energy derived from the cellular nutrients causes ADP and phosphoric acid to recombine to form new ATP, and the entire process is repeated over and over. For these reasons, ATP has been called the energy currency of the cell because it can be spent and reformed continually, having a turnover time of only a few minutes.

Chemical Processes in the Formation of ATP—Role of the Mitochondria. On entry into the cells, glucose is converted by enzymes in the cytoplasm into pyruvic acid (a process called glycolysis). A small amount of ADP is changed into ATP by the energy released during this conversion, but this amount accounts for less than $5 \%$ of the overall energy metabolism of the cell.

About $95 \%$ of the cell's ATP formation occurs in the mitochondria. The pyruvic acid derived from carbohydrates, fatty acids from lipids, and amino acids from proteins is eventually converted into the compound acetyl-coenzyme $A(\mathrm{CoA})$ in the matrix of mitochondria. This substance, in turn, is further dissolved (for the purpose of extracting its energy) by another series of enzymes in the mitochondrion matrix, undergoing dissolution in a sequence of chemical reactions called the citric acid cycle, or Krebs cycle. These chemical reactions are so important that they are explained in detail in Chapter 68.

In this citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA is split into its component parts, hydrogen atoms and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide diffuses out of the mitochondria and eventually out of the cell; finally, it is excreted from the body through the lungs.

The hydrogen atoms, conversely, are highly reactive; they combine with oxygen that has also diffused into the mitochondria. This combination releases a tremendous amount of energy, which is used by mitochondria to convert large amounts of ADP to ATP. The processes of these reactions are complex, requiring the participation of many protein enzymes that are integral parts of mitochondrial membranous shelves that protrude into the mitochondrial matrix. The initial event is the removal of an electron from the hydrogen atom, thus converting it to a hydrogen ion. The terminal event is the combination of hydrogen ions with oxygen to form water and the release of large amounts of energy to globular proteins that protrude like knobs from the membranes of the mitochondrial shelves; these proteins are called ATP synthetase. Finally, the enzyme ATP synthetase uses the energy from the hydrogen ions to convert ADP to ATP. The newly formed ATP is transported out of the mitochondria into all parts of the cell cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, where it energizes multiple cell functions.

This overall process for formation of ATP is called the chemiosmotic mechanism of ATP formation. The chemical and physical details of this mechanism are presented

![gu21176257b9](gu21176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-16. Use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP; formed in the mitochondrion) to provide energy for three major cellular functionsmembrane transport, protein synthesis, and muscle contraction. (ADP, Adenosine diphosphate.)
in Chapter 68, and many of the detailed metabolic functions of ATP in the body are discussed in Chapters 68 through 72 .

Uses of ATP for Cellular Function. Energy from ATP is used to promote three major categories of cellular functions: (1) transport of substances through multiple cell membranes; (2) synthesis of chemical compounds throughout the cell; and (3) mechanical work. These uses of ATP are illustrated by the examples in Figure 2-16: (1) to supply energy for the transport of sodium through the cell membrane; (2) to promote protein synthesis by the ribosomes; and (3) to supply the energy needed during muscle contraction.

In addition to the membrane transport of sodium, energy from ATP is required for the membrane transport of potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, chloride, urate, and hydrogen ions and many other ions, as well as various organic substances. Membrane transport is so important to cell function that some cells-the renal tubular cells, for example-use as much as $80 \%$ of the ATP that they form for this purpose alone.

In addition to synthesizing proteins, cells make phospholipids, cholesterol, purines, pyrimidines, and many other substances. Synthesis of almost any chemical compound requires energy. For example, a single protein molecule might be composed of as many as several thousand amino acids attached to one another by peptide linkages. The formation of each of these linkages requires energy derived from the breakdown of four high-energy bonds; thus, many thousand ATP molecules must release their energy as each protein molecule is formed. Indeed, some cells use as much as $75 \%$ of all the ATP formed in the cell
![gu22176257b9](gu22176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-17. Ameboid motion by a cell.
simply to synthesize new chemical compounds, especially protein molecules; this is particularly true during the growth phase of cells.

Another use of ATP is to supply energy for special cells to perform mechanical work. We discuss in Chapter 6 that each contraction of a muscle fiber requires the expenditure of large quantities of ATP energy. Other cells perform mechanical work in other ways, especially by ciliary and ameboid motion, described later in this chapter. The source of energy for all these types of mechanical work is ATP.

In summary, ATP is readily available to release its energy rapidly wherever it is needed in the cell. To replace ATP used by the cell, much slower chemical reactions break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins and use the energy derived from these processes to form new ATP. More than $95 \%$ of this ATP is formed in the mitochondria, which is why the mitochondria are called the powerhouses of the cell.

## LOCOMOTION OF CELLS

The most obvious type of movement in the body is that which occurs in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells, which constitute almost $50 \%$ of the entire body mass. The specialized functions of these cells are discussed in Chapters 6 through 9. Two other types of movement-ameboid locomotion and ciliary movement-occur in other cells.

## AMEBOID MOVEMENT

Ameboid movement is a crawling-like movement of an entire cell in relation to its surroundings, such as movement of white blood cells through tissues. This type of movement gets its name from the fact that amebae move in this manner, and amebae have provided an excellent tool for studying the phenomenon.

Typically, ameboid locomotion begins with the protrusion of a pseudopodium from one end of the cell. The pseudopodium projects away from the cell body and partially secures itself in a new tissue area; then the remainder of the cell is pulled toward the pseudopodium. Figure 2-17

demonstrates this process, showing an elongated cell, the right-hand end of which is a protruding pseudopodium. The membrane of this end of the cell is continually moving forward, and the membrane at the left-hand end of the cell is continually following along as the cell moves.

Mechanism of Ameboid Locomotion. Figure 2-17 shows the general principle of ameboid motion. Basically, this results from the continual formation of new cell membrane at the leading edge of the pseudopodium and continual absorption of the membrane in the mid and rear portions of the cell. Two other effects are also essential for forward movement of the cell. The first is attachment of the pseudopodium to surrounding tissues so that it becomes fixed in its leading position while the remainder of the cell body is being pulled forward toward the point of attachment. This attachment is caused by receptor proteins that line the insides of exocytotic vesicles. When the vesicles become part of the pseudopodial membrane, they open so that their insides evert to the outside, and the receptors now protrude to the outside and attach to ligands in the surrounding tissues.

At the opposite end of the cell, the receptors pull away from their ligands and form new endocytotic vesicles. Then, inside the cell, these vesicles stream toward the pseudopodial end of the cell, where they are used to form new membrane for the pseudopodium.

The second essential effect for locomotion is to provide the energy required to pull the cell body in the direction of the pseudopodium. A moderate to large amount of the protein actin is in the cytoplasm of all cells. Much of the actin is in the form of single molecules that do not provide any motive power; however, these molecules polymerize to form a filamentous network, and the network contracts when it binds with an actin-binding protein such as myosin. The entire process is energized by the high-energy compound ATP. This is what occurs in the pseudopodium of a moving cell, where such a network of actin filaments forms anew inside the enlarging pseudopodium. Contraction also occurs in the ectoplasm of the cell body, where a preexisting actin network is already present beneath the cell membrane.

## Types of Cells That Exhibit Ameboid Locomotion.

The most common cells to exhibit ameboid locomotion in the human body are the white blood cells when they move out of the blood into the tissues to form tissue macrophages. Other types of cells can also move by ameboid locomotion under certain circumstances. For example, fibroblasts move into a damaged area to help repair the damage, and even the germinal cells of the skin, although ordinarily completely sessile cells, move toward a cut area to repair the opening. Cell locomotion is also especially important in the development of the embryo and fetus after fertilization of an ovum. For example, embryonic cells often must migrate long distances from their sites of origin to new areas during the development of special structures.

Some types of cancer cells, such as sarcomas, which arise from connective tissue cells, are especially proficient at ameboid movement. This partially accounts for their relatively rapid spreading from one part of the body to another, known as metastasis.

Control of Ameboid Locomotion-Chemotaxis. An important initiator of ameboid locomotion is the process called chemotaxis, which results from the appearance of certain chemical substances in the tissues. Any chemical substance that causes chemotaxis to occur is called a chemotactic substance. Most cells that exhibit ameboid locomotion move toward the source of a chemotactic substance-that is, from an area of lower concentration toward an area of higher concentration. This is called positive chemotaxis. Some cells move away from the source, which is called negative chemotaxis.

How does chemotaxis control the direction of ameboid locomotion? Although the answer is not certain, it is known that the side of the cell most exposed to the chemotactic substance develops membrane changes that cause pseudopodial protrusion.

## CILIA AND CILIARY MOVEMENTS

There are two types of cilia, motile and nonmotile, or primary, cilia. Motile cilia can undergo a whiplike movement on the surfaces of cells. This movement occurs mainly in two places in the human body, on the surfaces of the respiratory airways and on the inside surfaces of the uterine tubes (fallopian tubes) of the reproductive tract. In the nasal cavity and lower respiratory airways, the whiplike motion of motile cilia causes a layer of mucus to move at a rate of about $1 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{min}$ toward the pharynx, in this way continually clearing these passageways of mucus and particles that have become trapped in the mucus. In the uterine tubes, cilia cause slow movement of fluid from the ostium of the uterine tube toward the uterus cavity; this movement of fluid transports the ovum from the ovary to the uterus.

As shown in Figure 2-18, a cilium has the appearance of a sharp-pointed straight or curved hair that projects 2 to 4 micrometers from the surface of the cell. Often, many motile cilia project from a single cell-for example, as many as 200 cilia on the surface of each epithelial cell inside the respiratory passageways. The cilium is covered by an outcropping of the cell membrane, and it is supported by 11 microtubules-nine double tubules located around the periphery of the cilium and two single tubules down the center, as demonstrated in the cross section shown in Figure 2-18. Each cilium is an outgrowth of a structure that lies immediately beneath the cell membrane, called the basal body of the cilium.

The flagellum of a sperm is similar to a motile cilium; in fact, it has much the same type of structure and same type of contractile mechanism. The flagellum, however, is much longer and moves in quasisinusoidal waves instead of whiplike movements.

![gu23176257b9](gu23176257b9.jpg)

Figure 2-18. Structure and function of the cilium. (Modified from Satir P: Cilia. Sci Am 204:108, 1961.)

In the inset of Figure 2-18, movement of the motile cilium is shown. The cilium moves forward with a sudden, rapid whiplike stroke 10 to 20 times per second, bending sharply where it projects from the surface of the cell. Then it moves backward slowly to its initial position. The rapid, forward-thrusting, whiplike movement pushes the fluid lying adjacent to the cell in the direction that the cilium moves; the slow dragging movement in the backward direction has almost no effect on fluid movement. As a result, the fluid is continually propelled in the direction of the fast-forward stroke. Because most motile ciliated cells have large numbers of cilia on their surfaces, and because all the cilia are oriented in the same direction, this is an effective means for moving fluids from one part of the surface to another.

Mechanism of Ciliary Movement. Although not all aspects of ciliary movement are known, we are aware of the following elements. First, the nine double tubules and two single tubules are all linked to one another by a complex of protein cross-linkages; this total complex of tubules and cross-linkages is called the axoneme. Second, even after removal of the membrane and destruction of other elements of the cilium in addition to the axoneme,
the cilium can still beat under appropriate conditions. Third, two conditions are necessary for continued beating of the axoneme after removal of the other structures of the cilium: (1) the availability of ATP; and (2) appropriate ionic conditions, especially appropriate concentrations of magnesium and calcium. Fourth, during forward motion of the cilium, the double tubules on the front edge of the cilium slide outward toward the tip of the cilium, whereas those on the back edge remain in place. Fifth, multiple protein arms composed of the protein dynein, which has adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzymatic activity, project from each double tubule toward an adjacent double tubule.

Given this basic information, it has been determined that the release of energy from ATP in contact with the ATPase dynein arms causes the heads of these arms to "crawl" rapidly along the surface of the adjacent double tubule. If the front tubules crawl outward while the back tubules remain stationary, bending occurs.

The way in which cilia contraction is controlled is not well understood. The cilia of some genetically abnormal cells do not have the two central single tubules, and these cilia fail to beat. Therefore, it is presumed that some signal, perhaps an electrochemical signal, is transmitted along these two central tubules to activate the dynein arms.

Nonmotile Primary Cilia Serve as Cell Sensory "Antennae." Primary cilia are nonmotile and generally occur only as a single cilium on each cell. Although the physiological functions of primary cilia are not fully understood, current evidence indicates that they function as cellular "sensory antennae," which coordinate cellular signaling pathways involved in chemical and mechanical sensation, signal transduction, and cell growth. In the kidneys, for example, primary cilia are found in most epithelial cells of the tubules, projecting into the tubule lumen and acting as a flow sensor. In response to fluid flow over the tubular epithelial cells, the primary cilia bend and cause flow-induced changes in intracellular calcium signaling. These signals, in turn, initiate multiple effects on the cells. Defects in signaling by primary cilia in renal tubular epithelial cells are thought to contribute to various disorders, including the development of large fluid-filled cysts, a condition called polycystic kidney disease.

# Genetic Control of Protein Synthesis, Cell Function, and Cell Reproduction 

Genes, which are located in the nuclei of all cells of the body, control heredity from parents to children, as well as the daily functioning of all the body's cells. The genes control cell function by determining which structures, enzymes, and chemicals are synthesized within the cell.

Figure 3-1 shows the general schema of genetic control. Each gene, which is composed of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), controls the formation of another nucleic acid, ribonucleic acid (RNA); this RNA then spreads throughout the cell to control formation of a specific protein. The entire process, from transcription of the genetic code in the nucleus to translation of the RNA code and the formation of proteins in the cell cytoplasm, is often referred to as gene expression.

Because the human body has approximately 20,000 to 25,000 different genes that code for proteins in each cell, it is possible to form a large number of different cellular proteins. In fact, RNA molecules transcribed from the same segment of DNA-the same gene-can be processed in more than one way by the cell, giving rise to alternate versions of the protein. The total number of different proteins produced by the various cell types in humans is estimated to be at least 100,000.

Some of the cellular proteins are structural proteins, which, in association with various lipids and carbohydrates, form structures of the various intracellular organelles discussed in Chapter 2. However, most of the proteins are enzymes that catalyze different chemical reactions in the cells. For example, enzymes promote all the oxidative reactions that supply energy to the cell, along with synthesis of all the cell chemicals, such as lipids, glycogen, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

## CELL NUCLEUS GENES CONTROL PROTEIN SYNTHESIS

In the cell nucleus, large numbers of genes are attached end on end in extremely long, double-stranded helical molecules of DNA having molecular weights measured in the billions. A very short segment of such a molecule is shown in Figure 3-2. This molecule is composed of several simple chemical compounds bound together in a regular pattern, the details of which are explained in the next few paragraphs.

## Building Blocks of DNA

Figure 3-3 shows the basic chemical compounds involved in the formation of DNA. These compounds include the following: (1) phosphoric acid; (2) a sugar called deoxyribose; and (3) four nitrogenous bases (two purines, adenine and guanine, and two pyrimidines, thymine and cytosine). The phosphoric acid and deoxyribose form the two helical strands that are the backbone of the DNA molecule, and the nitrogenous bases lie between the two strands and connect them, as illustrated in Figure 3-2.

## Nucleotides

The first stage of DNA formation is to combine one molecule of phosphoric acid, one molecule of deoxyribose, and one of the four bases to form an acidic nucleotide. Four separate nucleotides are thus formed, one for each of the four bases: deoxyadenylic, deoxythymidylic, deoxyguanylic, and deoxycytidylic acids. Figure 3-4 shows the chemical

structure of deoxyadenylic acid, and Figure 3-5 shows simple symbols for the four nucleotides that form DNA.

## Nucleotides Are Organized to Form Two Strands of DNA Loosely Bound to Each Other

Figure 3-2 shows the manner in which multiple nucleotides are bound together to form two strands of DNA. The two strands are, in turn, loosely bonded with each other by weak cross-linkages, as illustrated in Figure 3-6 by the central dashed lines. Note that the backbone of each DNA strand is composed of alternating phosphoric acid and deoxyribose molecules. In turn, purine and pyrimidine bases are attached to the sides of the deoxyribose molecules. Then, by means of loose hydrogen bonds (dashed

lines) between the purine and pyrimidine bases, the two respective DNA strands are held together. Note the following caveats, however:

1. Each purine base adenine of one strand always bonds with a pyrimidine base thymine of the other strand.
2. Each purine base guanine always bonds with a pyrimidine base cytosine.
Thus, in Figure 3-6, the sequence of complementary pairs of bases is CG, CG, GC, TA, CG, TA, GC, AT, and AT. Because of the looseness of the hydrogen bonds, the two strands can pull apart with ease, and they do so many times during the course of their function in the cell.

To put the DNA of Figure 3-6 into its proper physical perspective, one could merely pick up the two ends and twist them into a helix. Ten pairs of nucleotides are present in each full turn of the helix in the DNA molecule.

## GENETIC CODE

The importance of DNA lies in its ability to control the formation of proteins in the cell, which it achieves by means of a genetic code. That is, when the two strands of a DNA molecule are split apart, the purine and pyrimidine bases projecting to the side of each DNA strand are exposed, as shown by the top strand in Figure 3-7. It is these projecting bases that form the genetic code.

The genetic code consists of successive "triplets" of bases-that is, each three successive bases is a code word. The successive triplets eventually control the sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule that is to be synthesized in the cell. Note in Figure 3-6 that the top strand of DNA, reading from left to right, has the genetic code GGC, AGA, CTT, with the triplets being separated from one another by the arrows. As we follow this genetic code through Figure 3-7 and Figure 3-8, we see that these three respective triplets are responsible for successive placement of the three amino acids, proline, serine, and glutamic acid, in a newly formed molecule of protein.

## TRANSCRIPTION—TRANSFER OF CELL NUCLEUS DNA CODE TO CYTOPLASM RNA CODE

Because DNA is located in the cell nucleus, yet most of the cell functions are carried out in the cytoplasm, there must be some means for DNA genes of the nucleus to control chemical reactions of the cytoplasm. This control

Figure 3-8. A portion of an RNA molecule showing three RNA codons-CCG, UCU, and GAA-that control attachment of the three amino acids, proline, serine, and glutamic acid, respectively, to the growing RNA chain.
is achieved through the intermediary of another type of nucleic acid, RNA, the formation of which is controlled by DNA of the nucleus. Thus, as shown in Figure 3-7, the code is transferred to RNA in a process called transcription. The RNA, in turn, diffuses from the nucleus through nuclear pores into the cytoplasmic compartment, where it controls protein synthesis.

## RNA IS SYNTHESIZED IN THE NUCLEUS FROM A DNA TEMPLATE

During RNA synthesis, the two strands of DNA separate temporarily; one of these strands is used as a template for synthesis of an RNA molecule. The code triplets in the DNA result in the formation of complementary code triplets (called codons) in the RNA. These codons, in turn, will control the sequence of amino acids in a protein to be synthesized in the cell cytoplasm.

Building Blocks of RNA. The basic building blocks of RNA are almost the same as those of DNA, except for two differences. First, the sugar deoxyribose is not used in RNA formation. In its place is another sugar of slightly different composition, ribose, which contains an extra hydroxyl ion appended to the ribose ring structure. Second, thymine is replaced by another pyrimidine, uracil.

Formation of RNA Nucleotides. The basic building blocks of RNA form RNA nucleotides, exactly as described previously for DNA synthesis. Here again, four separate nucleotides are used to form RNA. These nucleotides contain the bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil. Note that these bases are the same as in DNA, except that uracil in RNA replaces thymine in DNA.
"Activation" of RNA Nucleotides. The next step in the synthesis of RNA is "activation" of RNA nucleotides by an enzyme, RNA polymerase. This activation occurs by adding two extra phosphate radicals to each nucleotide to form
triphosphates (shown in Figure 3-7 by the two RNA nucleotides to the far right during RNA chain formation). These last two phosphates are combined with the nucleotide by high-energy phosphate bonds derived from ATP in the cell.

The result of this activation process is that large quantities of ATP energy are made available to each of the nucleotides. This energy is used to promote chemical reactions that add each new RNA nucleotide at the end of the developing RNA chain.

## RNA CHAIN ASSEMBLY FROM ACTIVATED NUCLEOTIDES USING THE DNA STRAND AS A TEMPLATE

As shown in Figure 3-7, assembly of RNA is accomplished under the influence of an enzyme, RNA polymerase. This large protein enzyme has many functional properties necessary for formation of RNA, as follows:

1. In the DNA strand immediately ahead of the gene to be transcribed is a sequence of nucleotides called the promoter. The RNA polymerase has an appropriate complementary structure that recognizes this promoter and becomes attached to it, which is the essential step for initiating the formation of RNA.
2. After the RNA polymerase attaches to the promoter, the polymerase causes unwinding of about two turns of the DNA helix and separation of the unwound portions of the two strands.
3. The polymerase then moves along the DNA strand, temporarily unwinding and separating the two DNA strands at each stage of its movement. As it moves along, at each stage it adds a new activated RNA nucleotide to the end of the newly forming RNA chain through the following steps:
a. First, it causes a hydrogen bond to form between the end base of the DNA strand and the base of an RNA nucleotide in the nucleoplasm.

b. Then, one at a time, the RNA polymerase breaks two of the three phosphate radicals away from each of these RNA nucleotides, liberating large amounts of energy from the broken high-energy phosphate bonds. This energy is used to cause covalent linkage of the remaining phosphate on the nucleotide with the ribose on the end of the growing RNA chain.
c. When the RNA polymerase reaches the end of the DNA gene, it encounters a new sequence of DNA nucleotides called the chain-terminating sequence, which causes the polymerase and the newly formed RNA chain to break away from the DNA strand. The polymerase then can be used again and again to form more new RNA chains.
d. As the new RNA strand is formed, its weak hydrogen bonds with the DNA template break away because the DNA has a high affinity for rebonding with its own complementary DNA strand. Thus, the RNA chain is forced away from the DNA and is released into the nucleoplasm.
Therefore, the code that is present in the DNA strand is eventually transmitted in complementary form to the RNA chain. The ribose nucleotide bases always combine with the deoxyribose bases in the following combinations:

| DNA Base | RNA Base |
| :-- | :-- |
| guanine | Cytosine |
| cytosine | Guanine |
| adenine | Uracil |
| thymine | adenine |

There Are Several Different Types of RNA. As research on RNA has continued to advance, many different types of RNA have been discovered. Some types of RNA are involved in protein synthesis, whereas other types serve gene regulatory functions or are involved in posttranscriptional modification of RNA. The functions of some types of RNA, especially those that do not appear to code for proteins, are still mysterious. The following six types of RNA play independent and different roles in protein synthesis:

1. Precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) is a large, immature, single strand of RNA that is processed in the nucleus to form mature messenger RNA (mRNA). The pre-RNA includes two different types of segments, called introns, which are removed by a process called splicing, and exons, which are retained in the final mRNA.
2. Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) directs the splicing of pre-mRNA to form mRNA.
3. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the genetic code to the cytoplasm for controlling the type of protein formed.
4. Transfer RNA (tRNA) transports activated amino acids to the ribosomes to be used in assembling the protein molecule.
5. Ribosomal RNA, along with about 75 different proteins, forms ribosomes, the physical and chemical
structures on which protein molecules are actually assembled.
6. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded RNA molecules of 21 to 23 nucleotides that can regulate gene transcription and translation.

## MESSENGER RNA-THE CODONS

Messenger RNA molecules are long single RNA strands that are suspended in the cytoplasm. These molecules are composed of several hundred to several thousand RNA nucleotides in unpaired strands, and they contain codons that are exactly complementary to the code triplets of the DNA genes. Figure 3-8 shows a small segment of mRNA. Its codons are CCG, UCU, and GAA, which are the codons for the amino acids proline, serine, and glutamic acid. The transcription of these codons from the DNA molecule to the RNA molecule is shown in Figure 3-7.

RNA Codons for the Different Amino Acids. Table 3-1 lists the RNA codons for the 20 common amino acids found in protein molecules. Note that most of the amino acids are represented by more than one codon; also, one codon represents the signal "start manufacturing the protein molecule," and three codons represent "stop manufacturing the protein molecule." In Table 3-1, these two

CI, Chain-initiating; $C T$, chain-terminating.

types of codons are designated CI for "chain-initiating" or "start" codon and CT for "chain-terminating" or "stop" codon.

## TRANSFER RNA—THE ANTICODONS

Another type of RNA that is essential for protein synthesis is called transfer RNA (tRNA) because it transfers amino acids to protein molecules as the protein is being synthesized. Each type of tRNA combines specifically with 1 of the 20 amino acids that are to be incorporated into proteins. The tRNA then acts as a carrier to transport its specific type of amino acid to the ribosomes, where protein molecules are forming. In the ribosomes, each specific type of tRNA recognizes a particular codon on the mRNA (described later) and thereby delivers the appropriate amino acid to the appropriate place in the chain of the newly forming protein molecule.

Transfer RNA, which contains only about 80 nucleotides, is a relatively small molecule in comparison with mRNA. It is a folded chain of nucleotides with a cloverleaf appearance similar to that shown in Figure 3-9. At one end of the molecule there is always an adenylic acid to which the transported amino acid attaches at a hydroxyl group of the ribose in the adenylic acid.

Because the function of tRNA is to cause attachment of a specific amino acid to a forming protein chain, it is essential that each type of tRNA also have specificity for a particular codon in the mRNA. The specific code in the tRNA that allows it to recognize a specific codon is again a triplet of nucleotide bases and is called an anticodon. This anticodon is located approximately in the middle of the tRNA molecule (at the bottom of the cloverleaf configuration shown in Figure 3-9). During formation of the protein molecule, the anticodon bases combine loosely by hydrogen bonding with the codon bases of the mRNA. In this way, the respective amino acids are lined up one after another along the mRNA chain, thus establishing the

Figure 3-9. A messenger RNA strand is moving through two ribosomes. As each codon passes through, an amino acid is added to the growing protein chain, which is shown in the right-hand ribosome. The transfer RNA molecule transports each specific amino acid to the newly forming protein.
appropriate sequence of amino acids in the newly forming protein molecule.

## RIBOSOMAL RNA

The third type of RNA in the cell is ribosomal RNA, which constitutes about $60 \%$ of the ribosome. The remainder of the ribosome is protein, including about 75 types of proteins that are both structural proteins and enzymes needed to manufacture proteins.

The ribosome is the physical structure in the cytoplasm on which proteins are actually synthesized. However, it always functions in association with the other two types of RNA; tRNA transports amino acids to the ribosome for incorporation into the developing protein, whereas $m R N A$ provides the information necessary for sequencing the amino acids in proper order for each specific type of protein to be manufactured. Thus, the ribosome acts as a manufacturing plant in which the protein molecules are formed.

Formation of Ribosomes in the Nucleolus. The DNA genes for the formation of ribosomal RNA are located in five pairs of chromosomes in the nucleus. Each of these chromosomes contains many duplicates of these particular genes because of the large amounts of ribosomal RNA required for cellular function.

As the ribosomal RNA forms, it collects in the nucleolus, a specialized structure lying adjacent to the chromosomes. When large amounts of ribosomal RNA are being synthesized, as occurs in cells that manufacture large amounts of protein, the nucleolus is a large structure, whereas in cells that synthesize little protein, the nucleolus may not even be seen. Ribosomal RNA is specially processed in the nucleolus, where it binds with ribosomal proteins to form granular condensation products that are primordial subunits of ribosomes. These subunits are then released from the nucleolus and transported through the large pores of the nuclear envelope to almost all parts of the cytoplasm. After the subunits enter the cytoplasm, they are assembled to form mature functional ribosomes. Therefore, proteins are formed in the cytoplasm of the cell, but not in the cell nucleus, because the nucleus does not contain mature ribosomes.

## miRNA AND SMALL INTERFERING RNA

A fourth type of RNA in the cell is microRNA (miRNA); miRNA are short ( 21 to 23 nucleotides) single-stranded RNA fragments that regulate gene expression (Figure 3-10). The miRNAs are encoded from the transcribed DNA of genes, but they are not translated into proteins and are therefore often called noncoding RNA. The miRNAs are processed by the cell into molecules that are complementary to mRNA and act to decrease gene expression. The generation of miRNAs involves special processing of longer primary precursor RNAs called primiRNAs, which are the primary transcripts of the gene.

![gu35176257b9](gu35176257b9.jpg)

Figure 3-10. Regulation of gene expression by microRNA (miRNA). Primary miRNA (pri-miRNA), the primary transcripts of a gene processed in the cell nucleus by the microprocessor complex, are converted to pre-miRNAs. These pre-miRNAs are then further processed in the cytoplasm by dicer, an enzyme that helps assemble an RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) and generates miRNAs. The miRNAs regulate gene expression by binding to the complementary region of the RNA and repressing translation or promoting degradation of the messenger RNA (mRNA) before it can be translated by the ribosome.

The pri-miRNAs are then processed in the cell nucleus by the microprocessor complex to pre-miRNAs, which are 70-nucleotide, stem loop structures. These pre-miRNAs are then further processed in the cytoplasm by a specific dicer enzyme that helps assemble an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and generates miRNAs.

The miRNAs regulate gene expression by binding to the complementary region of the RNA and promoting repression of translation or degradation of the mRNA before it can be translated by the ribosome. miRNAs are believed to play an important role in normal regulation of cell function, and alterations in miRNA function have been associated with diseases such as cancer and heart disease.

Another type of miRNA is small interfering RNA (siRNA), also called silencing RNA or short interfering RNA. The siRNAs are short, double-stranded RNA molecules, comprised of 20 to 25 nucleotides, that interfere with expression of specific genes. siRNAs generally refer to synthetic miRNAs and can be administered to silence expression of specific genes. They are designed to avoid nuclear processing by the microprocessor complex and, after the siRNA enters the cytoplasm, it activates the RISC silencing complex, blocking the translation of mRNA. Because siRNAs can be tailored for any specific sequence in the gene, they can be used to block translation of any mRNA and therefore expression by any gene for which the nucleotide sequence is known. Researchers have proposed that siRNAs may become useful therapeutic tools to silence genes that contribute to the pathophysiology of diseases.

## TRANSLATION-FORMATION OF PROTEINS ON THE RIBOSOMES

When a molecule of mRNA comes in contact with a ribosome, it travels through the ribosome, beginning at a predetermined end of the RNA molecule specified by an appropriate sequence of RNA bases called the chaininitiating codon. Then, as shown in Figure 3-9, while the mRNA travels through the ribosome, a protein molecule is formed, a process called translation. Thus, the ribosome reads the codons of the mRNA in much the same way that a tape is read as it passes through the playback head of a tape recorder. Then, when a "stop" (or "chainterminating") codon slips past the ribosome, the end of a protein molecule is signaled, and the protein molecule is freed into the cytoplasm.
Polyribosomes. A single mRNA molecule can form protein molecules in several ribosomes at the same time because the initial end of the RNA strand can pass to a successive ribosome as it leaves the first, as shown at the bottom left in Figure 3-9 and Figure 3-11. The protein molecules are in different stages of development in each ribosome. As a result, clusters of ribosomes frequently occur, with 3 to 10 ribosomes being attached to a single mRNA at the same time. These clusters are called polyribosomes.

An mRNA can cause formation of a protein molecule in any ribosome; there is no specificity of ribosomes for given types of protein. The ribosome is simply the physical manufacturing plant in which the chemical reactions take place.
Many Ribosomes Attach to the Endoplasmic Reticulum. In Chapter 2, we noted that many ribosomes become attached to the endoplasmic reticulum. This attachment occurs because the initial ends of many forming protein molecules have amino acid sequences that immediately attach to specific receptor sites on the endoplasmic reticulum, causing these molecules to penetrate the

Figure 3-11. The physical structure of the ribosomes, as well as their functional relationship to messenger RNA, transfer RNA, and the endoplasmic reticulum during the formation of protein molecules.
![gu36176257b9](gu36176257b9.jpg)
reticulum wall and enter the endoplasmic reticulum matrix. This process gives a granular appearance to the portions of the reticulum where proteins are being formed and are entering the matrix of the reticulum.

Figure 3-11 shows the functional relationship of mRNA to the ribosomes and the manner in which the ribosomes attach to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Note the process of translation occurring in several ribosomes at the same time in response to the same strand of mRNA. Note also the newly forming polypeptide (protein) chains passing through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane into the endoplasmic matrix.

It should be noted that except in glandular cells, in which large amounts of protein-containing secretory vesicles are formed, most proteins synthesized by the ribosomes are released directly into the cytosol instead of into the endoplasmic reticulum. These proteins are enzymes and internal structural proteins of the cell.

Chemical Steps in Protein Synthesis. Some of the chemical events that occur in the synthesis of a protein molecule are shown in Figure 3-12. This Fig. shows representative reactions for three separate amino acids, $\mathrm{AA}_{1}$, $\mathrm{AA}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{AA}_{20}$. The stages of the reactions are as follows:

1. Each amino acid is activated by a chemical process in which ATP combines with the amino acid to form an adenosine monophosphate complex with the amino acid, giving up two high-energy phosphate bonds in the process.
2. The activated amino acid, having an excess of energy, then combines with its specific tRNA to form an amino acid-tRNA complex and, at the same time, releases the adenosine monophosphate.
3. The tRNA carrying the amino acid complex then comes in contact with the mRNA molecule in the ribosome, where the anticodon of the tRNA attaches temporarily to its specific codon of the mRNA, thus lining up the amino acid in the appropriate sequence to form a protein molecule.
Then, under the influence of the enzyme peptidyl transferase (one of the proteins in the ribosome), peptide bonds are formed between the successive amino acids, thus adding progressively to the protein chain. These
chemical events require energy from two additional high-energy phosphate bonds, making a total of four high-energy bonds used for each amino acid added to the protein chain. Thus, the synthesis of proteins is one of the most energy-consuming processes of the cell.
Peptide Linkage-Combination of Amino Acids. The successive amino acids in the protein chain combine with one another according to the typical reaction.
![gu37176257b9](gu37176257b9.jpg)

In this chemical reaction, a hydroxyl radical $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)$is removed from the COOH portion of the first amino acid, and a hydrogen $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$of the $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ portion of the other amino acid is removed. These combine to form water, and the two reactive sites left on the two successive amino acids bond with each other, resulting in a single molecule. This process is called peptide linkage. As each additional amino acid is added, an additional peptide linkage is formed.

## SYNTHESIS OF OTHER SUBSTANCES IN THE CELL

Many thousand protein enzymes formed in the manner just described control essentially all the other chemical reactions that take place in cells. These enzymes promote synthesis of lipids, glycogen, purines, pyrimidines, and hundreds of other substances. We discuss many of these synthetic processes in relation to carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism in Chapters 68 through 70. These substances each contribute to the various functions of the cells.

## CONTROL OF GENE FUNCTION AND BIOCHEMICAL ACTIVITY IN CELLS

From our discussion thus far, it is clear that the genes control both the physical and chemical functions of the cells. However, the degree of activation of respective genes must also be

![gu38176257b9](gu38176257b9.jpg)

Figure 3-12. Chemical events in the formation of a protein molecule. AMP, Adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; tRNA, transfer RNA.
controlled; otherwise, some parts of the cell might overgrow or some chemical reactions might overact until they kill the cell. Each cell has powerful internal feedback control mechanisms that keep the various functional operations of the cell in step with one another. For each gene ( $\approx 20,000-25,000$ genes in all), at least one such feedback mechanism exists.

There are basically two methods whereby the biochemical activities in the cell are controlled: (1) genetic regulation, in which the degree of activation of the genes and the formation of gene products are themselves controlled, and (2) enzyme regulation, in which the activity levels of already formed enzymes in the cell are controlled.

## GENETIC REGULATION

Genetic regulation, or regulation of gene expression, covers the entire process from transcription of the genetic code in the nucleus to the formation of proteins in the cytoplasm. Regulation of gene expression provides all living organisms with the ability to respond to changes in their environment. In animals that have many different types of cells, tissues, and organs, differential regulation of gene expression also permits the different cell types in the body to each perform their specialized functions. Although a cardiac myocyte contains the same genetic code as a renal tubular epithelial cell, many genes are expressed in cardiac cells that are not expressed in renal tubular cells. The ultimate measure of gene "expression" is whether (and how much) of the gene products (proteins) are produced because proteins carry out cell functions specified by the genes. Regulation of gene expression can occur at any point in the pathways of transcription, RNA processing, and translation.

The Promoter Controls Gene Expression. Synthesis of cellular proteins is a complex process that starts with transcription of DNA into RNA. Transcription of DNA is
![gu39176257b9](gu39176257b9.jpg)

Figure 3-13. Gene transcription in eukaryotic cells. A complex arrangement of multiple clustered enhancer modules is interspersed with insulator elements, which can be located upstream or downstream of a basal promoter containing TATA box (TATA), proximal promoter elements (response elements, RE), and initiator sequences (INR).
controlled by regulatory elements found in the promoter of a gene (Figure 3-13). In eukaryotes, which includes all mammals, the basal promoter consists of a sequence of bases (TATAAA) called the TATA box, the binding site for the TATA-binding protein and several other important transcription factors that are collectively referred to as the transcription factor IID complex. In addition to the transcription factor IID complex, this region is where transcription factor IIB binds to both the DNA and RNA polymerase 2 to facilitate transcription of the DNA into RNA. This basal promoter is found in all protein-coding genes, and the polymerase must bind with this basal promoter before it can begin traveling along the DNA strand to synthesize RNA. The upstream promoter is located farther upstream from the transcription start site and contains several binding sites for positive or negative transcription factors that can affect transcription through interactions with proteins bound to the basal promoter. The structure and transcription factor binding sites in the

upstream promoter vary from gene to gene to give rise to the different expression patterns of genes in different tissues.

Transcription of genes in eukaryotes is also influenced by enhancers, which are regions of DNA that can bind transcription factors. Enhancers can be located a great distance from the gene they act on or even on a different chromosome. They can also be located upstream or downstream of the gene that they regulate. Although enhancers may be located far from their target gene, they may be relatively close when DNA is coiled in the nucleus. It is estimated that there are more than 100,000 gene enhancer sequences in the human genome.

In the organization of the chromosome, it is important to separate active genes that are being transcribed from genes that are repressed. This separation can be challenging because multiple genes may be located close together on the chromosome. The separation is achieved by chromosomal insulators. These insulators are gene sequences that provide a barrier so that a specific gene is isolated against transcriptional influences from surrounding genes. Insulators can vary greatly in their DNA sequence and the proteins that bind to them. One way an insulator activity can be modulated is by DNA methylation, which is the case for the mammalian insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene. The mother's allele has an insulator between the enhancer and promoter of the gene that allows for the binding of a transcriptional repressor. However, the paternal DNA sequence is methylated such that the transcriptional repressor cannot bind to the insulator, and the IGF-2 gene is expressed from the paternal copy of the gene.

## Other Mechanisms for Control of Transcription by the

Promoter. Variations in the basic mechanism for control of the promoter have been discovered in the past three decades. Without giving details, let us list some of them:

1. A promoter is frequently controlled by transcription factors located elsewhere in the genome. That is, the regulatory gene causes the formation of a regulatory protein that in turn acts as an activator or repressor of transcription.
2. Occasionally, many different promoters are controlled at the same time by the same regulatory protein. In some cases, the same regulatory protein functions as an activator for one promoter and as a repressor for another promoter.
3. Some proteins are controlled not at the starting point of transcription on the DNA strand but farther along the strand. Sometimes, the control is not even at the DNA strand itself but occurs during the processing of the RNA molecules in the nucleus before they are released into the cytoplasm. Control may also occur at the level of protein formation in the cytoplasm during RNA translation by the ribosomes.
4. In nucleated cells, the nuclear DNA is packaged in specific structural units, the chromosomes. Within
each chromosome, the DNA is wound around small proteins called histones, which in turn are held tightly together in a compacted state by still other proteins. As long as the DNA is in this compacted state, it cannot function to form RNA. However, multiple control mechanisms are being discovered that can cause selected areas of chromosomes to become decompacted one part at a time, so that partial RNA transcription can occur. Even then, specific transcriptor factors control the actual rate of transcription by the promoter in the chromosome. Thus, still higher orders of control are used to establish proper cell function. In addition, signals from outside the cell, such as some of the body's hormones, can activate specific chromosomal areas and specific transcription factors, therefore controlling the chemical machinery for function of the cell.
Because there are many thousands of different genes in each human cell, the large number of ways in which genetic activity can be controlled is not surprising. The gene control systems are especially important for controlling intracellular concentrations of amino acids, amino acid derivatives, and intermediate substrates and products of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism.

## CONTROL OF INTRACELLULAR FUNCTION BY ENZYME REGULATION

In addition to control of cell function by genetic regulation, cell activities are also controlled by intracellular inhibitors or activators that act directly on specific intracellular enzymes. Thus, enzyme regulation represents a second category of mechanisms whereby cellular biochemical functions can be controlled.

Enzyme Inhibition. Some chemical substances formed in the cell have direct feedback effects to inhibit the specific enzyme systems that synthesize them. Almost always, the synthesized product acts on the first enzyme in a sequence, rather than on the subsequent enzymes, usually binding directly with the enzyme and causing an allosteric conformational change that inactivates it. One can readily recognize the importance of inactivating the first enzyme because this prevents buildup of intermediary products that are not used.

Enzyme inhibition is another example of negative feedback control. It is responsible for controlling intracellular concentrations of multiple amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, vitamins, and other substances.

Enzyme Activation. Enzymes that are normally inactive often can be activated when needed. An example of this phenomenon occurs when most of the ATP has been depleted in a cell. In this case, a considerable amount of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) begins to be formed as a breakdown product of ATP. The presence of this cAMP, in turn, immediately activates the glycogensplitting enzyme phosphorylase, liberating glucose mole-

cules that are rapidly metabolized, with their energy used for replenishment of the ATP stores. Thus, cAMP acts as an enzyme activator for the enzyme phosphorylase and thereby helps control intracellular ATP concentration.

Another interesting example of both enzyme inhibition and enzyme activation occurs in the formation of the purines and pyrimidines. These substances are needed by the cell in approximately equal quantities for the formation of DNA and RNA. When purines are formed, they inhibit the enzymes that are required for formation of additional purines. However, they activate the enzymes for formation of pyrimidines. Conversely, the pyrimidines inhibit their own enzymes but activate the purine enzymes. In this way, there is continual cross-talk between the synthesizing systems for these two substances, resulting in almost exactly equal amounts of the two substances in the cells at all times.

Summary. There are two principal mechanisms whereby cells control proper proportions and quantities of different cellular constituents: (1) genetic regulation; and (2) enzyme regulation. The genes can be activated or inhibited, and likewise, the enzyme systems can be activated or inhibited. These regulatory mechanisms usually function as feedback control systems that continually monitor the cell's biochemical composition and make corrections as needed. However, on occasion, substances from outside the cell (especially some of the hormones discussed in this text) also control the intracellular biochemical reactions by activating or inhibiting one or more of the intracellular control systems.

## THE DNA-GENETIC SYSTEM CONTROLS CELL REPRODUCTION

Cell reproduction is another example of the ubiquitous role that the DNA-genetic system plays in all life processes. The genes and their regulatory mechanisms determine cell growth characteristics and when or whether cells will divide to form new cells. In this way, the allimportant genetic system controls each stage in the development of the human, from the single-cell fertilized ovum to the whole functioning body. Thus, if there is any central theme to life, it is the DNA-genetic system.

## Life Cycle of the Cell

The life cycle of a cell is the period from cell reproduction to the next cell reproduction. When mammalian cells are not inhibited and are reproducing as rapidly as they can, this life cycle may be as little as 10 to 30 hours. It is terminated by a series of distinct physical events called mitosis that cause division of the cell into two new daughter cells. The events of mitosis are shown in Figure 3-14 and described later. The actual stage of mitosis, however, lasts for only about 30 minutes, and thus more than $95 \%$ of the life cycle of even rapidly reproducing cells is represented by the interval between mitosis, called interphase.

Except in special conditions of rapid cellular reproduction, inhibitory factors almost always slow or stop the

uninhibited life cycle of the cell. Therefore, different cells of the body actually have life cycle periods that vary from as little as 10 hours for highly stimulated bone marrow cells to an entire lifetime of the human body for many nerve cells.

## Cell Reproduction Begins with Replication of DNA

The first step of cell reproduction is replication (duplication) of all DNA in the chromosomes. It is only after this replication has occurred that mitosis can take place.

The DNA begins to be duplicated 5 to 10 hours before mitosis, and the duplication is completed in 4 to 8 hours. The net result is two exact replicas of all DNA. These replicas become the DNA in the two new daughter cells that will be formed at mitosis. After replication of the DNA, there is another period of 1 to 2 hours before mitosis begins abruptly. Even during this period, preliminary changes that will lead to the mitotic process are beginning to take place.

DNA Replication. DNA is replicated in much the same way that RNA is transcribed from DNA, except for a few important differences:

1. Both strands of the DNA in each chromosome are replicated, not just one of them.

![gu41176257b9](gu41176257b9.jpg)

Figure 3-15. DNA replication, showing the replication fork and leading and lagging strands of DNA.
2. Both entire strands of the DNA helix are replicated from end to end, rather than small portions of them, as occurs in the transcription of RNA.
3. Multiple enzymes called DNA polymerase, which is comparable to RNA polymerase, are essential for replicating DNA. DNA polymerase attaches to and moves along the DNA template strand, adding nucleotides in the $5^{\prime}$ to $3^{\prime}$ direction. Another enzyme, DNA ligase, causes bonding of successive DNA nucleotides to one another, using high-energy phosphate bonds to energize these attachments.
4. Replication fork formation. Before DNA can be replicated, the double-stranded molecule must be "unzipped" into two single strands (Figure 3-15). Because the DNA helixes in each chromosome are approximately 6 centimeters in length and have millions of helical turns, it would be impossible for the two newly formed DNA helixes to uncoil from each other were it not for some special mechanism. This uncoiling is achieved by DNA helicase enzymes that break the hydrogen bonding between the base pairs of the DNA, permitting the two strands to separate into a Y shape known as the replication fork, the area that will be the template for replication to begin.
DNA is directional in both strands, signified by a $5^{\prime}$ and $3^{\prime}$ end (see Figure 3-15). Replication progresses only in the $5^{\prime}$ to $3^{\prime}$ direction. At the replication fork one strand, the leading strand, is oriented in the $3^{\prime}$ to $5^{\prime}$ direction, toward the replication fork, while the lagging strand is oriented $5^{\prime}$ to $3^{\prime}$, away from the replication fork. Because of their different orientations, the two strands are replicated differently.
5. Primer binding. Once the DNA strands have been separated, a short piece of RNA called an RNA primer binds to the $3^{\prime}$ end of the leading strand. Primers are generated by the enzyme DNA primase.

Primers always bind as the starting point for DNA replication.
6. Elongation. DNA polymerases are responsible for creating the new strand by a process called elongation. Because replication proceeds in the $5^{\prime}$ to $3^{\prime}$ direction on the leading strand, the newly formed strand is continuous. The lagging strand begins replication by binding with multiple primers that are only several bases apart. DNA polymerase then adds pieces of DNA, called Okazaki fragments, to the strand between primers. This process of replication is discontinuous because the newly created Okazaki fragments are not yet connected. An enzyme, DNA ligase, joins the Okazaki fragments to form a single unified strand.
7. Termination. After the continuous and discontinuous strands are both formed, the enzyme exonuclease removes the RNA primers from the original strands, and the primers are replaced with appropriate bases. Another exonuclease "proofreads" the newly formed DNA, checking and clipping off any mismatched or unpaired residues.
Another enzyme, topoisomerase, can transiently break the phosphodiester bond in the backbone of the DNA strand to prevent the DNA in front of the replication fork from being overwound. This reaction is reversible, and the phosphodiester bond reforms as the topoisomerase leaves.

Once completed, the parent strand and its complementary DNA strand coils into the double helix shape. The process of replication therefore produces two DNA molecules, each with one strand from the parent DNA and one new strand. For this reason, DNA replication is often described as semiconservative; half of the chain is part of the original DNA molecule and half is brand new.

DNA Repair, DNA "Proofreading," and "Mutation." During the hour or so between DNA replication and

the beginning of mitosis, there is a period of active repair and "proofreading" of the DNA strands. Wherever inappropriate DNA nucleotides have been matched up with the nucleotides of the original template strand, special enzymes cut out the defective areas and replace them with appropriate complementary nucleotides. This repair process, which is achieved by the same DNA polymerases and DNA ligases that are used in replication, is referred to as DNA proofreading.

Because of repair and proofreading, mistakes are rarely made in the DNA replication process. When a mistake is made, it is called a mutation. The mutation may cause formation of some abnormal protein in the cell rather than a needed protein, which may lead to abnormal cellular function and sometimes even cell death. Given that many thousands of genes exist in the human genome, and that the period from one human generation to another is about 30 years, one would expect as many as 10 or many more mutations in the passage of the genome from parent to offspring. As a further protection, however, each human genome is represented by two separate sets of chromosomes, one derived from each parent, with almost identical genes. Therefore, one functional gene of each pair is almost always available to the child, despite mutations.

## CHROMOSOMES AND THEIR REPLICATION

The DNA helixes of the nucleus are packaged in chromosomes. The human cell contains 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 pairs. Most of the genes in the two chromosomes of each pair are identical or almost identical to each other, so it is usually stated that the different genes also exist in pairs, although occasionally this is not the case.

In addition to DNA, there is a large amount of protein in the chromosome, composed mainly of many small molecules of electropositively charged histones. The histones are organized into vast numbers of small, bobbinlike cores. Small segments of each DNA helix are coiled sequentially around one core after another.

The histone cores play an important role in regulation of DNA activity because as long as the DNA is packaged tightly, it cannot function as a template for formation of RNA or replication of new DNA. Furthermore, some of the regulatory proteins decondense the histone packaging of the DNA and allow small segments at a time to form RNA.

Several nonhistone proteins are also major components of chromosomes, functioning as chromosomal structural proteins and, in connection with the genetic regulatory machinery, as activators, inhibitors, and enzymes.

Replication of the chromosomes in their entirety occurs during the next few minutes after replication of the DNA helixes has been completed; the new DNA helixes collect new protein molecules as needed. The two newly formed chromosomes remain attached to each other (until time
for mitosis) at a point called the centromere located near their center. These duplicated but still attached chromosomes are called chromatids.

## CELL MITOSIS

The actual process whereby the cell splits into two new cells is called mitosis. Once each chromosome has been replicated to form the two chromatids, mitosis follows automatically within 1 or 2 hours in many cells.

Mitotic Apparatus: Function of the Centrioles. One of the first events of mitosis takes place in the cytoplasm in or around the small structures called centrioles during the latter part of interphase. As shown in Figure 3-14, two pairs of centrioles lie close to each other near one pole of the nucleus. These centrioles, like the DNA and chromosomes, are also replicated during interphase, usually shortly before replication of the DNA. Each centriole is a small cylindrical body about 0.4 micrometer long and about 0.15 micrometer in diameter, consisting mainly of nine parallel tubular structures arranged in the form of a cylinder. The two centrioles of each pair lie at right angles to each other. Each pair of centrioles, along with attached pericentriolar material, is called a centrosome.

Shortly before mitosis takes place, the two pairs of centrioles begin to move apart from each other. This movement is caused by polymerization of protein microtubules growing between the respective centriole pairs and actually pushing them apart. At the same time, other microtubules grow radially away from each of the centriole pairs, forming a spiny star called the aster, in each end of the cell. Some of the spines of the aster penetrate the nuclear membrane and help separate the two sets of chromatids during mitosis. The complex of microtubules extending between the two new centriole pairs is called the spindle, and the entire set of microtubules plus the two pairs of centrioles is called the mitotic apparatus.
Prophase. The first stage of mitosis, called prophase, is shown in Figure 3-14A, B, and C. While the spindle is forming, the chromosomes of the nucleus (which in interphase consist of loosely coiled strands) become condensed into well-defined chromosomes.
Prometaphase. During the prometaphase stage (see Figure 3-14D), the growing microtubular spines of the aster fragment the nuclear envelope. At the same time, multiple microtubules from the aster attach to the chromatids at the centromeres, where the paired chromatids are still bound to each other. The tubules then pull one chromatid of each pair toward one cellular pole and its partner toward the opposite pole.
Metaphase. During the metaphase stage (see Figure 3-14E), the two asters of the mitotic apparatus are pushed farther apart. This pushing is believed to occur because the microtubular spines from the two asters, where they interdigitate with each other to form the mitotic spindle,

push each other away. Minute contractile protein molecules called "molecular motors," which may be composed of the muscle protein actin, extend between the respective spines and, using a stepping action as in muscle, actively slide the spines in a reverse direction along each other. Simultaneously, the chromatids are pulled tightly by their attached microtubules to the very center of the cell, lining up to form the equatorial plate of the mitotic spindle.

Anaphase. During the anaphase stage (see Figure 3-14F), the two chromatids of each chromosome are pulled apart at the centromere. All 46 pairs of chromatids are separated, forming two separate sets of 46 daughter chromosomes. One of these sets is pulled toward one mitotic aster, and the other is pulled toward the other aster, as the two respective poles of the dividing cell are pushed still farther apart.

Telophase. In the telophase stage (see Figure 3-14G and H), the two sets of daughter chromosomes are pushed completely apart. Then, the mitotic apparatus dissipates, and a new nuclear membrane develops around each set of chromosomes. This membrane is formed from portions of the endoplasmic reticulum that are already present in the cytoplasm. Shortly thereafter, the cell pinches in two, midway between the two nuclei. This pinching is caused by the formation of a contractile ring of microfilaments composed of actin and probably myosin (the two contractile proteins of muscle) at the juncture of the newly developing cells that pinches them off from each other.

## CONTROL OF CELL GROWTH AND CELL REPRODUCTION

Some cells grow and reproduce all the time, such as the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow, the germinal layers of the skin, and the epithelium of the gut. Many other cells, however, such as smooth muscle cells, may not reproduce for many years. A few cells, such as the neurons and most striated muscle cells, do not reproduce during the entire life of a person, except during the original period of fetal life.

In certain tissues, an insufficiency of some types of cells causes them to grow and reproduce rapidly until appropriate numbers of these cells are again available. For example, in some young animals, seven-eighths of the liver can be removed surgically, and the cells of the remaining one-eighth will grow and divide until the liver mass returns to almost normal. The same phenomenon occurs for many glandular cells and most cells of the bone marrow, subcutaneous tissue, intestinal epithelium, and almost any other tissue except highly differentiated cells such as nerve and muscle cells.

The mechanisms that maintain proper numbers of the different types of cells in the body are still poorly understood. However, experiments have shown at least three ways in which growth can be controlled. First, growth often is controlled by growth factors that come from other
parts of the body. Some of these growth factors circulate in the blood, but others originate in adjacent tissues. For example, the epithelial cells of some glands, such as the pancreas, fail to grow without a growth factor from the underlying connective tissue of the gland. Second, most normal cells stop growing when they have run out of space for growth. This phenomenon occurs when cells are grown in tissue culture; the cells grow until they contact a solid object, and then growth stops. Third, cells grown in tissue culture often stop growing when minute amounts of their own secretions are allowed to collect in the culture medium. This mechanism, too, could provide a means for negative feedback control of growth.

Telomeres Prevent the Degradation of Chromosomes. A telomere is a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences located at each end of a chromatid (Figure 3-16). Telomeres serve as protective caps that prevent the chromosome from deterioration during cell division. During cell division, a short piece of "primer" RNA attaches to the DNA strand to start the replication. However, because the primer does not attach at the very end of the DNA strand, the copy is missing a small section of the DNA. With each cell division, the copied DNA loses additional nucleotides from the telomere region. The nucleotide sequences provided by the telomeres therefore prevent the degradation of genes near the ends of chromosomes. Without telomeres, the genomes would progressively lose information and be truncated after each cell division. Thus, the telomeres can be considered to be disposable chromosomal buffers that help maintain stability of the genes but are gradually consumed during repeated cell divisions.
![gu42176257b9](gu42176257b9.jpg)

Figure 3-16. Control of cell replication by telomeres and telomerase. The cells' chromosomes are capped by telomeres, which, in the absence of telomerase activity, shorten with each cell division until the cell stops replicating. Therefore, most cells of the body cannot replicate indefinitely. In cancer cells, telomerase is activated, and telomere length is maintained so that the cells continue to replicate themselves uncontrollably.

Each time a cell divides, an average person loses 30 to 200 base pairs from the ends of that cell's telomeres. In human blood cells, the length of telomeres ranges from 8000 base pairs at birth to as low as 1500 in older people. Eventually, when the telomeres shorten to a critical length, the chromosomes become unstable, and the cells die. This process of telomere shortening is believed to be an important reason for some of the physiological changes associated with aging. Telomere erosion can also occur as a result of diseases, especially those associated with oxidative stress and inflammation.

In some cells, such as stem cells of the bone marrow or skin that must be replenished throughout life, or germ cells in the ovaries and testes, the enzyme telomerase adds bases to the ends of the telomeres so that many more generations of cells can be produced. However, telomerase activity is usually low in most cells of the body, and after many generations the descendent cells will inherit defective chromosomes, become senescent, and cease dividing. This process of telomere shortening is important in regulating cell proliferation and maintaining gene stability. In cancer cells, telomerase activity is abnormally activated so that telomere length is maintained, making it possible for the cells to replicate over and over again uncontrollably (see Figure 3-16). Some scientists have therefore proposed that telomere shortening protects us from cancer and other proliferative diseases.

Regulation of Cell Size. Cell size is determined almost entirely by the amount of functioning DNA in the nucleus. If replication of the DNA does not occur, the cell grows to a certain size and thereafter remains at that size. Conversely, use of the chemical colchicine makes it possible to prevent formation of the mitotic spindle and therefore prevent mitosis, even though replication of the DNA continues. In this event, the nucleus contains far greater quantities of DNA than it normally does, and the cell grows proportionately larger. It is assumed that this cell growth results from increased production of RNA and cell proteins, which, in turn, cause the cell to grow larger.

## CELL DIFFERENTIATION

A special characteristic of cell growth and cell division is cell differentiation, which refers to changes in the physical and functional properties of cells as they proliferate in the embryo to form the different body structures and organs. The following description of an especially interesting experiment helps explain these processes.

When the nucleus from an intestinal mucosal cell of a frog is surgically implanted into a frog ovum from which the original ovum nucleus was removed, the result is often the formation of a normal frog. This experiment demonstrates that even the intestinal mucosal cell, which is a well-differentiated cell, carries all the necessary genetic information for development of all structures required in the frog's body.

Therefore, it has become clear that differentiation results not from loss of genes but from selective repression of different gene promoters. In fact, electron micrographs suggest that some segments of DNA helixes that are wound around histone cores become so condensed that they no longer uncoil to form RNA molecules. One explanation for this is as follows. It has been supposed that the cellular genome begins at a certain stage of cell differentiation to produce a regulatory protein that forever after represses a select group of genes. Therefore, the repressed genes never function again. Regardless of the mechanism, mature human cells each produce a maximum of about 8000 to 10,000 proteins rather than the potential 20,000 to 25,000 or more that would be produced if all genes were active.

Embryological experiments have shown that certain cells in an embryo control differentiation of adjacent cells. For example, the primordial chordamesoderm is called the primary organizer of the embryo because it forms a focus around which the remainder of the embryo develops. It differentiates into a mesodermal axis that contains segmentally arranged somites and, as a result of inductions in the surrounding tissues, causes the formation of essentially all the organs of the body.

Another instance of induction occurs when the developing eye vesicles come into contact with the ectoderm of the head and cause the ectoderm to thicken into a lens plate that folds inward to form the lens of the eye. Therefore, a large share of the embryo develops as a result of such inductions, with one part of the body affecting another part, and this part affecting still other parts.

Thus, although our understanding of cell differentiation is still hazy, we are aware of many control mechanisms whereby differentiation could occur.

## APOPTOSIS—PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH

The many trillions of the body's cells are members of a highly organized community in which the total number of cells is regulated not only by controlling the rate of cell division, but also by controlling the rate of cell death. When cells are no longer needed or become a threat to the organism, they undergo a suicidal programmed cell death, or apoptosis. This process involves a specific proteolytic cascade that causes the cell to shrink and condense, disassemble its cytoskeleton, and alter its cell surface so that a neighboring phagocytic cell, such as a macrophage, can attach to the cell membrane and digest the cell.

In contrast to programmed death, cells that die as a result of an acute injury usually swell and burst due to loss of cell membrane integrity, a process called cell necrosis. Necrotic cells may spill their contents, causing inflammation and injury to neighboring cells. Apoptosis, however, is an orderly cell death that results in disassembly and phagocytosis of the cell before any leakage of its contents occurs, and neighboring cells usually remain healthy.

Apoptosis is initiated by activation of a family of proteases called caspases, which are enzymes that are synthesized and stored in the cell as inactive procaspases. The mechanisms of activation of caspases are complex but, once activated, the enzymes cleave and activate other procaspases, triggering a cascade that rapidly breaks down proteins within the cell. The cell thus dismantles itself, and its remains are rapidly digested by neighboring phagocytic cells.

A tremendous amount of apoptosis occurs in tissues that are being remodeled during development. Even in adult humans, billions of cells die each hour in tissues such as the intestine and bone marrow and are replaced by new cells. Programmed cell death, however, is normally balanced by formation of new cells in healthy adults. Otherwise, the body's tissues would shrink or grow excessively. Abnormalities of apoptosis may play a key role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, as well as in cancer and autoimmune disorders. Some drugs that have been used successfully for chemotherapy appear to induce apoptosis in cancer cells.

## CANCER

Cancer may be caused by mutation or by some other abnormal activation of cellular genes that control cell growth and cell mitosis. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that code for various proteins that control cell adhesion, growth and division. If mutated or excessively activated, proto-oncogenes can become abnormally functioning oncogenes capable of causing cancer. As many as 100 different oncogenes have been discovered in human cancers.

Also present in all cells are antioncogenes, also called tumor suppressor genes, which suppress the activation of specific oncogenes. Therefore, loss or inactivation of antioncogenes can allow activation of oncogenes that lead to cancer.

For several reasons, only a minute fraction of the cells that mutate in the body ever lead to cancer:

- First, most mutated cells have less survival capability than normal cells, and they simply die.
- Second, only a few of the mutated cells that survive become cancerous because most mutated cells still have normal feedback controls that prevent excessive growth.
- Third, cells that are potentially cancerous are often destroyed by the body's immune system before they grow into a cancer.
Most mutated cells form abnormal proteins within their cell bodies because of their altered genes, and these proteins activate the body's immune system, causing it to form antibodies or sensitized lymphocytes that react against the cancerous cells, destroying them. In people whose immune systems have been suppressed, such as in persons taking immunosuppressant drugs after kidney or heart transplantation, the probability that a cancer will develop is multiplied as much as fivefold.
- Fourth, the simultaneous presence of several different activated oncogenes is usually required to cause a cancer. For example, one such gene might promote rapid reproduction of a cell line, but no cancer occurs because another mutant gene is not present simultaneously to form the needed blood vessels.
What is it that causes the altered genes? Considering that many trillions of new cells are formed each year in humans, a better question might be to ask why all of us do not develop millions or billions of mutant cancerous cells. The answer is the incredible precision with which DNA chromosomal strands are replicated in each cell before mitosis can take place, along with the proofreading process that cuts and repairs any abnormal DNA strand before the mitotic process is allowed to proceed. Yet, despite these inherited cellular precautions, probably one newly formed cell in every few million still has significant mutant characteristics.

Thus, chance alone is all that is required for mutations to take place, so we can suppose that a large number of cancers are merely the result of an unlucky occurrence. However, the probability of mutations can be greatly increased when a person is exposed to certain chemical, physical, or biological factors, including the following:

1. Ionizing radiation, such as x-rays, gamma rays, particle radiation from radioactive substances, and even ultraviolet light, can predispose individuals to cancer. Ions formed in tissue cells under the influence of such radiation are highly reactive and can rupture DNA strands, causing many mutations.
2. Chemical substances of certain types may also cause mutations. It was discovered long ago that various aniline dye derivatives are likely to cause cancer, and thus workers in chemical plants producing such substances, if unprotected, have a special predisposition to cancer. Chemical substances that can cause mutation are called carcinogens. The carcinogens that currently cause the greatest number of deaths are those in cigarette smoke. These carcinogens cause over $30 \%$ of all cancer deaths and at least $85 \%$ of lung cancer deaths.
3. Physical irritants can also lead to cancer, such as continued abrasion of the linings of the intestinal tract by some types of food. The damage to the tissues leads to rapid mitotic replacement of the cells; the more rapid the mitosis, the greater the chance for mutation.
4. Hereditary tendency to cancer occurs in some families. This hereditary tendency results from the fact that most cancers require not one mutation but two or more mutations before cancer occurs. In families that are particularly predisposed to cancer, it is presumed that one or more cancerous genes are already

mutated in the inherited genome. Therefore, far fewer additional mutations must take place in such family members before a cancer begins to grow.
5. Certain types of oncoviruses can cause various types of cancer. Some examples of viruses associated with cancers in humans include human papilloma virus (HPV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus, EpsteinBarr virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), and Merkel cell polyomavirus. Although the mechanisms whereby oncoviruses cause cancer are not fully understood, there are at least two potential ways. In the case of DNA viruses, the DNA strand of the virus can insert itself directly into one of the chromosomes, thereby causing a mutation that leads to cancer. In the case of RNA viruses, some of these viruses carry with them an enzyme called reverse transcriptase that causes DNA to be transcribed from the RNA. The transcribed DNA then inserts itself into the animal cell genome, leading to cancer.
Invasive Characteristic of the Cancer Cell. The major differences between a cancer cell and a normal cell are as follows:

1. The cancer cell does not respect usual cellular growth limits because these cells presumably do not require all the same growth factors that are necessary to cause growth of normal cells.
2. Cancer cells are often far less adhesive to one another than are normal cells. Therefore, they tend to wander through the tissues, enter the blood stream, and be transported all through the body, where they form nidi for numerous new cancerous growths.
3. Some cancers also produce angiogenic factors that cause many new blood vessels to grow into the cancer, thus supplying the nutrients required for cancer growth.
Why Do Cancer Cells Kill? Cancer tissue competes with normal tissues for nutrients. Because cancer cells continue to proliferate indefinitely, with their numbers multiplying every day, cancer cells soon demand essentially all the nutrition available to the body or to an essential part of the body. As a result, normal tissues gradually sustain nutritive death.

Some cancers cause disruption of vital organ functions. For example, a lung cancer might replace healthy tissue to the extent that the lungs cannot absorb enough oxygen to maintain tissues in the rest of the body.

# Transport of Substances Through Cell Membranes 

Figure 4-1 lists the approximate concentrations of important electrolytes and other substances in the extracellular fluid and intracellular fluid. Note that the extracellular fluid contains a large amount of sodium but only a small amount of potassium. The opposite is true of the intracellular fluid. Also, the extracellular fluid contains a large amount of chloride ions, whereas the intracellular fluid contains very little of these ions. However, the concentrations of phosphates and proteins in the intracellular fluid are considerably greater than those in the extracellular fluid. These differences are extremely important to the life of the cell. The purpose of this chapter is to explain how the differences are brought about by the cell membrane transport mechanisms.

## THE CELL MEMBRANE IS A LIPID BILAYER WITH CELL MEMBRANE TRANSPORT PROTEINS

The structure of the membrane covering the outside of every cell of the body is discussed in Chapter 2 and illustrated in Figure 2-3 and Figure 4-2. This membrane consists almost entirely of a lipid bilayer with large numbers of protein molecules in the lipid, many of which penetrate all the way through the membrane.

The lipid bilayer is not miscible with the extracellular fluid or the intracellular fluid. Therefore, it constitutes a barrier against movement of water molecules and watersoluble substances between the extracellular and intracellular fluid compartments. However, as shown in Figure $4-2$ by the leftmost arrow, lipid-soluble substances can diffuse directly through the lipid substance.

The membrane protein molecules interrupt the continuity of the lipid bilayer, constituting an alternative pathway through the cell membrane. Many of these penetrating proteins can function as transport proteins. Some proteins have watery spaces all the way through the molecule and allow free movement of water, as well as selected ions or molecules; these proteins are called channel proteins. Other proteins, called carrier proteins, bind with molecules or ions that are to be transported, and conformational changes in the protein molecules then move the substances through the interstices of the protein to the
