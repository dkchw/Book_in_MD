# Gene Expression and the Synthesis of Proteins 

In the middle of the 20th century, DNA was identified as the genetic material and its structure was determined. Using this knowledge, researchers then discovered the mechanisms by which genetic information is inherited and expressed. During the last quarter of the 20th century, our understanding of this critical area of science, known as molecular biology, grew at an increasingly rapid pace. We now have techniques to probe the human genome that will completely revolutionize the way medicine is practiced in the 21 st century.

The genome of a cell consists of all its genetic information, encoded in DNA. In eukaryotes, DNA is located mainly in nuclei, but small amounts are also found in mitochondria. Nuclear genes are packaged in chromosomes that contain DNA and protein in tightly coiled structures (Chapter 12).

The molecular mechanism of inheritance involves a process known as replication, in which the strands of parental DNA serve as templates for the synthesis of DNA copies (Fig. III.1) (Chapter 13). After DNA replication, cells divide, and these DNA copies are passed to daughter cells. Alterations in genetic material occur by recombination (the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes) and by mutation (the result of chemical changes that alter DNA). DNA repair mechanisms correct much of this damage, but, nevertheless, many gene alterations are passed to daughter cells.

The expression of genes within cells requires two processes: transcription and translation (see Fig. III.1) (Chapters 14 and 15). DNA is transcribed to produce RNA. Three major types of RNA are transcribed from DNA and subsequently participate in the process of translation (the synthesis of proteins). Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the genetic information from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where translation occurs on ribosomes-structures that contain proteins complexed with ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) carries individual amino acids to the ribosomes, where they are joined in peptide linkage to form proteins. During translation, the sequence of nucleic acid bases in mRNA is read in sets of three (each set of three bases constitutes a codon). The sequence of codons in the mRNA dictates the sequence of amino acids in the protein. Proteins function in cell structure, signaling, and catalysis and, therefore, determine the appearance and behavior of cells and the organism as a whole. The regulation of gene expression (Chapter 16) determines which proteins are synthesized and the amount synthesized at any time, thus allowing cells to undergo development and differentiation and to respond to changing environmental conditions.

Research in molecular biology has produced a host of techniques, known collectively as recombinant DNA technology, biotechnology, or genetic engineering, that can be used for the diagnosis and treatment of disease (Chapter 17). These techniques can detect a number of genetic diseases that previously could only be diagnosed after symptoms appeared. Diagnosis of these diseases can now be made with considerable accuracy even before birth, and carriers of these diseases also can be identified.

Many drugs used in medicine to treat bacterial infections are targeted to interfere with the bacteria's ability to synthesize RNA and proteins. Thus, medical students need to know the basics of bacterial DNA replication, RNA synthesis, and protein synthesis to understand the mechanism of action of these drugs.

Ethical dilemmas have come together with technological advances in molecular biology. Consider the case of a patient with a mild case of ornithine transcarbamoylase deficiency, a urea-cycle defect that, if untreated, leads to elevated ammonia levels and nervous system dysfunction. The patient was being treated effectively by dietary restriction of protein. However, in 1999, he was treated with a common virus carrying the normal gene for ornithine transcarbamoylase. The patient developed a severe immune response to the virus and died as a result of the treatment. This case history raises the issues of appropriate patient consent, appropriate criteria to be included in this type of study, and the types of diseases for which gene therapy is appropriate. These are issues that are still applicable over 15 years after this unfortunate incident, and that you, the student, will be facing as you enter your practice of medicine.

(1)Tumors may be benign or malignant. A tumor is malignant if it invades locally or if cells break away from the tumor; enter the blood stream, and travel to other parts of the body where they establish new growths (a process called metastasis), resulting in destruction of the tissues they invade. Many of the drugs used to treat malignant tumors are directed toward inhibition of DNA replication. These chemotherapeutic drugs are more toxic to cancer cells than to normal cells because the cancer cells divide more rapidly. However, such drugs also may inhibit normal rapidly dividing cells, such as the cells of the bone marrow (causing a decrease in white blood cell count) or cells in the hair follicles (resulting in hair loss during chemotherapy).

With recent developments in the field of gene therapy, diseases that for centuries have been considered hopeless are now potentially curable. Much of the therapy for these diseases is currently experimental. However, during the 21st century, physicians may be using genetic engineering techniques routinely for both the diagnosis and treatment of their patients.

Replication and cell division are highly regulated processes in the human. Cancer is a group of diseases in which a cell in the body has been transformed and begins to grow and divide out of control (Chapter 18). It results from multiple mutations or changes in DNA structure in the genes that activate cell growth, called proto-oncogenes, and those that ensure that DNA replication and repair are normal, called growth-suppressor or tumor-suppressor genes. Mutations that activate proto-oncogenes to oncogenes disturb the regulation of the cell cycle and the rate of cell proliferation. Mutations that disrupt tumor-suppressor genes lead to an increased incidence of these proto-oncogene-activating mutations. Such mutations may be inherited, causing a predisposition to a type of cancer. They also may arise from DNA replication or copying errors that remain uncorrected, from chemicals or radiation that damages DNA, from translocation of pieces of chromosomes from one chromosome to another during replication, or from incorporation of viralencoded DNA into the genome.

# Structure of the Nucleic Acids 

Nucleotides in DNA and RNA. Nucleotides are the monomeric units of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA. Each nucleotide consists of a heterocyclic nitrogenous base, a sugar, and phosphate. DNA contains the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G) and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine (T). RNA contains $A, G$, and $C$, but it has uracil (U) instead of thymine. In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose, whereas in RNA, it is ribose.

Polynucleotides such as DNA and RNA are linear sequences of nucleotides linked by 3'- to 5'-phosphodiester bonds between the sugars (Fig. I2.I). The bases of the nucleotides can interact with other bases or with proteins.

DNA Structure. Genetic information is encoded by the sequence of different nucleotide bases in DNA. DNA is double-stranded, it contains two antiparallel polynucleotide strands. The two strands are joined by hydrogen bonding between their bases to form base pairs. Adenine pairs with thymine, and guanine pairs with cytosine. The two DNA strands run in opposite directions. One strand runs in a $5^{\prime}$-to- $3^{\prime}$ direction, and the other strand runs in a $3^{\prime}$-to- $5^{\prime}$ direction. The two DNA strands wind around each other, forming a double helix.

Transcription of a gene generates a single-stranded RNA that is identical in nucleotide sequence to one of the strands of the duplex DNA. The three major types of RNA are messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA).

RNA Structures. mRNAs contain the nucleotide sequence that is converted into the amino acid sequence of a protein in the process of translation. Eukaryotic mRNA has a structure known as a cap at the $5^{\prime}$-end, a sequence of adenine nucleotides (a poly[A] tail) at the $3^{\prime}$-end, and a coding region in between containing codons that dictate the sequence of amino acids in a protein or relay a signal. Each codon in the genetic code is a different sequence of three nucleotides.
rRNAs and tRNAs are part of the apparatus for protein synthesis, but they do not encode proteins. rRNA has extensive internal base pairing and complexes with proteins to form ribonucleoprotein particles called ribosomes. The ribosomes bind mRNA and tRNAs during translation. Each tRNA binds and activates a specific amino acid for insertion into the polypeptide chain and therefore has a somewhat different nucleotide sequence than other tRNAs. A unique trinucleotide sequence on each tRNA called an anticodon binds to a complementary codon on the mRNA, thereby ensuring insertion of the correct amino acid. In spite of their differences, all tRNAs contain several unusual nucleotides and assume a similar cloverleaf structure.

FIGURE 12.1 Structure of a polynucleotide. The $5^{\prime}$-carbon of the top sugar and the $3^{\prime}$-carbon of the bottom sugar are indicated. Because the sugar is ribose, this is an example of RNA.

An adenoma is a mass of rapidly proliferating cells called a neoplasm (neo $=$ new; plasm $=$ growth), which is formed from epithelial cells growing into a glandlike structure. The cells lining all the external and internal organs are epithelial cells, and most human tumors are adenocarcinomas. Adenomatous polyps are adenomas that grow into the lumen of the colon or rectum. The term malignant applied to a neoplasm refers to invasive, unregulated growth. Clark T. has an adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant adenoma that has started to grow through the wall of the colon into surrounding tissues. Cells from adenocarcinomas can break away and spread through the blood or lymph to other parts of the body, where they form "colony" tumors. This process is called metastasis.

0The Gram stain is a standard laboratory test that can be used to determine what type of bacteria is present in an infection. The test is based on the cell wall of the bacteria trapping a specific dye (crystal violet). Gram-positive bacteria, which trap the dye, have a thicker cell wall than gram-negative bacteria, which exclude the dye. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria have differences in the sugar and protein composition of their outer cell walls as well as the lipid components associated with the cell walls. Because of these differences in cell-wall structure, antibiotics will affect each class of bacteria differently.Typing the bacteria using the Gram stain should allow the appropriate treatment options for the patient to be better determined.

## THE WAITING ROOM

Isabel S. is a 26-year-old intravenous drug user who has used shared needles. She presented to the emergency department with an abscess on her right arm where she injects. She reported that a few months ago, she had a 3-week course of a flulike syndrome with fever, malaise, and muscle aches. She was offered an HIV test, which was positive, and a multidrug regimen was initiated.

Clark T. had a screening colonoscopy at age 50 years during which they removed several intestinal polyps whose pathology was consistent with adenomas. He did not return for a 3-year colonoscopic examination as instructed for surveillance. At age 59 years he reappeared, complaining of marooncolored stools, an indication of intestinal bleeding. The source of the blood loss was an adenocarcinoma growing from a colonic polyp of the large intestine. At surgery, it was found that the tumor had invaded the gut wall and penetrated the visceral peritoneum, and several pericolic lymph nodes contained cancer cells. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed several small nodules of metastatic cancer in the liver. Following resection of the tumor in both the colon and liver, the oncologist began treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combined with other chemotherapeutic agents.

Paul T. complains to his physician of a 3-day history of worsening fever and cough. His cough produces thick yellow-brown sputum. He has crackles on pulmonary examination at the right base of his lungs. He is empirically started on azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia. A stain of his sputum shows many gram-positive diplococci. A sputum culture confirms that he has a respiratory infection, in this case caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.

## I. DNA Structure

## A. Location of DNA

DNA and RNA serve as the genetic material for prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, for viruses, and for plasmids, each of which stores it in a different arrangement or location. In prokaryotes, DNA is not separated from the rest of the cellular contents. In eukaryotes, however, DNA is located in the nucleus, where it is separated from the rest of the cell by the nuclear envelope (see Fig. 10.14), and in the mitochondria. Eukaryotic nuclear DNA is bound to proteins, forming a complex called chromatin. During interphase (when cells are not dividing), some of the chromatin is diffuse (euchromatin) and some is dense (heterochromatin), but no distinct structures can be observed. However, before mitosis (when cells divide), the DNA is replicated, resulting in two identical chromosomes called sister chromatids. During metaphase (a period in mitosis), these condense into discrete, visible chromosomes.

DNA is a double-stranded molecule that forms base pairs (bp), via hydrogen bonding, between strands (see the following paragraph). The base pair designation is often used to indicate the size of a DNA molecule. For example, in a stretch of DNA 200 bp long, both strands are included, with 200 bases in each strand, for a total of 400 bases.

Less than $0.1 \%$ of the total DNA in a cell is present in mitochondria. The genetic information in a mitochondrion is encoded in $<20,000 \mathrm{bp}$ of DNA; the information in a human haploid nucleus (i.e., an egg or a sperm cell) is encoded in about $3 \times 10^{9}$ ( 3 billion) bp. The DNA and protein-synthesizing systems in mitochondria more closely resemble the systems in bacteria, which do not have membrane-enclosed organelles, than those in the eukaryotic nucleus and cytoplasm. It has been suggested that mitochondria were derived from ancient bacterial invaders of primordial eukaryotic cells.

Viruses are small infectious particles consisting of a DNA or RNA genome (but not both), proteins required for pathogenesis or replication, and a protein coat. They lack, however, complete systems for DNA replication, production of RNA (transcription), and synthesis of proteins (translation). Consequently, viruses must invade other cells and commandeer their DNA, RNA, and protein-synthesizing machinery to reproduce. Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes can be infected by viruses. Viruses that infect bacteria are known as bacteriophages (or more simply as phages).

Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that can enter bacteria and replicate autonomously; that is, outside the host genome. In contrast to viruses, plasmids are not infectious; they do not convert their host cells into factories devoted to plasmid production. Plasmids do, however, often carry genes, some of which confer resistance to antibiotics. Genetic engineers use plasmids as tools for transfer of foreign genes into bacteria because segments of DNA can readily be incorporated into plasmids.

## B. Determination of the Structure of DNA

In 1865, Frederick Meischer first isolated DNA, obtaining it from pus scraped from surgical bandages. Initially, scientists speculated that DNA was a cellular storage form for inorganic phosphate, an important but unexciting function that did not spark widespread interest in determining its structure. In fact, the details of DNA structure were not fully determined until 1953, almost 90 years after it had first been isolated but only 9 years after it had been identified as the genetic material.

Early in the 20th century, the bases of DNA were identified as the purines adenine (A) and guanine (G) and the pyrimidines cytosine (C) and thymine (T) (Fig. 12.2). The sugar was found to be deoxyribose, a derivative of ribose, lacking a hydroxyl group on carbon 2 (see Fig. 12.2).

Nucleotides, composed of a base, a sugar, and phosphate, were found to be the monomeric units of the nucleic acids (Table 12.1). In nucleosides, the nitrogenous base is linked by an N -glycosidic bond to the anomeric carbon of the sugar, either ribose or deoxyribose. The atoms in the sugar are numbered using the prime symbol (') to distinguish them from the numbering of the atoms in the nitrogenous base. A nucleotide is a nucleoside with an inorganic phosphate attached to a 5'-hydroxyl group of the sugar in ester linkage (Fig. 12.3). The names and abbreviations of nucleotides specify the base, the sugar, and the number of phosphates attached (monophosphate [MP], diphosphate [DP], triphosphate [TP]). In deoxynucleotides, the prefix " d " precedes the abbreviation. For example, GDP is guanosine diphosphate (the base guanine attached to a ribose that has two phosphate

${ }^{a}$ If the sugar is deoxyribose rather than ribose, the nucleoside has "deoxy" as a prefix (e.g., deoxyadenosine). Nucleotides are given the name of the nucleoside plus mono-, di-, or triphosphate (e.g., adenosine triphosphate, deoxyadenosine triphosphate).
${ }^{b}$ The base hypoxanthine is not found in DNA but is produced during degradation of the purine bases. It is found in certain tRNA molecules. Its nucleoside, inosine, is produced during synthesis of the purine nucleotides (see Chapter 39).

FIGURE 12.2 A. Purine and pyrimidine bases in DNA. B. Deoxyribose and ribose, the sugars of DNA and RNA, respectively. The carbon atoms are numbered from I to 5 .

After Isabel 5. was diagnosed with HIV, she was treated with a multidrug regimen. One of the first drugs used to treat HIV was zidovudine (ZDV), formerly called AZT. This is a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor drug and is an analog of the thymine nucleotide found in DNA (the modified group is shown in the dashed box). ZDV is phosphorylated in the body by the kinases that normally phosphorylate nucleosides and nucleotides. As the viral DNA chain is being synthesized in a human cell, ZDV is then added to the growing $3^{\prime}$-end by viral reverse transcriptase. However, ZDV lacks a $3^{\prime}-\mathrm{OH}$ group, and therefore, no additional nucleotides can be attached through a $5^{\prime} \rightarrow 3^{\prime}$-bond. Thus, chain elongation of the DNA is terminated. Reverse transcriptase has a higher affinity for ZDV than do normal human cellular DNA polymerases, enabling the drug to target viral replication more specifically than cellular replication. Lamivudine ( $3 \mathrm{TC}, 2^{\prime}, 3^{\prime}$-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine) is also a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor with an analog of cytidine and is used more commonly as a first-line agent.

groups) and dATP is deoxyadenosine triphosphate (the base adenine attached to a deoxyribose with three phosphate groups).

In 1944, after Oswald Avery's experiments establishing DNA as the genetic material were published, interest in determining the structure of DNA intensified. Digestion with enzymes of known specificity proved that inorganic phosphate joined the nucleotide monomers, forming a phosphodiester bond between the $3^{\prime}$-carbon of one sugar and the $5^{\prime}$-carbon of the next sugar along the polynucleotide chain (Fig. 12.4). Another key to DNA structure was provided by Erwin Chargaff. He analyzed the base composition of DNA from various sources and concluded that on a molar basis, the amount of adenine was always equal to the amount of thymine and the amount of guanine was equal to the amount of cytosine.

During this era, James Watson and Francis Crick joined forces and, using the X-ray diffraction data of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, incorporated the available information into a model for DNA structure. In 1953, they published a brief paper ( $\sim 900$ words), describing DNA as a double helix consisting of two polynucleotide strands joined by pairing between the bases (adenine with thymine and guanine with cytosine). The model of base pairing they proposed, and the implications of the model for understanding DNA replication, formed the basis of modern molecular biology.

## C. Concept of Base Pairing

As proposed by Watson and Crick, each DNA molecule consists of two polynucleotide chains joined by hydrogen bonds between the bases. In each base pair, a purine on one strand forms hydrogen bonds with a pyrimidine on the other strand. In one type of base pair, adenine on one strand pairs with thymine on the other strand (Fig. 12.5). This base pair is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds. The other base pair, formed between guanine and cytosine, is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds. As a consequence of base pairing, the two strands of DNA are complementary; that is, adenine on one strand corresponds to thymine on the other strand, and guanine corresponds to cytosine.

The concept of base pairing proved to be essential for determining the mechanism of DNA replication (in which the copies of DNA are produced that are distributed to daughter cells) and the mechanisms of transcription and translation (in which mRNA is produced from genes and used to direct the process of protein synthesis). As Watson and Crick implied in their article, base pairing allows one strand of DNA

FIGURE 12.5 Base pairs of DNA. Note that the purine bases are "flipped over" from the positions in which they are usually shown (see Fig. 12.4). The bases must be in this orientation to form base pairs. The dotted lines indicate hydrogen bonds between the bases. Although the hydrogen bonds participate in holding the bases and thus the two DNA strands together, they are weaker than covalent bonds and allow the DNA strands to separate during replication and transcription.

![ma08486325cc](ma08486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 12.6 DNA strands serve as templates. During replication, the strands of the helix separate in a localized region. Each parental strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new DNA strand.

Multidrug regimens used to treat cancers (e.g., lymphomas) sometimes include the drug doxorubicin (Adriamycin). It is a natural product with a complex multiring structure that intercalates or slips in between the stacked base pairs of DNA and inhibits replication and transcription. It will inhibit DNA synthesis in all cells but will preferentially affect rapidly growing cells (such as tumor cells as compared to normal cells).
to serve as a template for the synthesis of the other strand (Fig. 12.6). Base pairing also allows a strand of DNA to serve as a template for the synthesis of a complementary strand of RNA.

## D. DNA Strands Are Antiparallel

As concluded by Watson and Crick, the two complementary strands of DNA run in opposite directions (antiparallel). On one strand, the $5^{\prime}$-carbon of the sugar is above the $3^{\prime}$-carbon (Fig. 12.7). This strand is said to run in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction. On the other strand, the $3^{\prime}$-carbon is above the $5^{\prime}$-carbon. This strand is said to run in a $3^{\prime}$ 'to-5' direction. Thus, the strands are antiparallel (i.e., they run in opposite directions). This concept of directionality of nucleic acid strands is essential for understanding the mechanisms of replication and transcription.

## E. The Double Helix

Because each base pair contains a purine bonded to a pyrimidine, the strands are equidistant from each other throughout. If two strands that are equidistant from each other are twisted at the top and the bottom, they form a double helix (Fig. 12.8). In the double helix of DNA, the base pairs that join the two strands are stacked like a spiral staircase along the central axis of the molecule. The electrons of the adjacent base pairs interact, generating hydrophobic stacking forces that, in addition to the hydrogen bonding of the base pairs, stabilize the helix.

The phosphate groups of the sugar-phosphate backbones are on the outside of the helix (see Fig. 12.8). Each phosphate has two oxygen atoms forming the phosphodiester bonds that link adjacent sugars. However, the third -OH group on the phosphate is free and dissociates a hydrogen ion at physiologic pH . Therefore, each DNA helix has negative charges coating its surface that facilitate the binding of specific proteins.

The helix contains grooves of alternating size, known as the major and minor grooves (see Fig. 12.8). The bases in these grooves are exposed and therefore can interact with proteins or other molecules.

Watson and Crick described the B form of DNA, a right-handed helix, with 3.4 $\AA\left(1 \AA=10^{-8} \mathrm{~cm}\right)$ between base pairs and 10.4 bp per turn. Although this form predominates in vivo, other forms also occur (Fig. 12.9). The A form, which predominates

FIGURE 12.7 Antiparallel strands of DNA. For the strand on the left, the $5^{\prime}$-carbon of each sugar is above the $3^{\prime}$-carbon, so the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction is from top to bottom. For the strand on the right, the $5^{\prime}$-carbon of each sugar is below the $3^{\prime}$-carbon, so the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction is from bottom to top.

FIGURE 12.8 A. Two DNA strands twist to form a double helix. The distance between the two phosphodiester backbones is about II $\AA$. The hydrogen-bonded base pairs, shown bonded by dotted lines, create stacking forces with adjacent base pairs. Each phosphate group contains one negatively charged oxygen atom that provides the phosphodiester backbone with a negative charge. Because of the twisting of the helix, grooves are formed along the surface; the larger one is the major groove and the smaller one is the minor groove. B. If you look up through the bottom of a helix along the central axis and the helix spirals away from you in a clockwise direction (toward the arrowhead in the drawing), it is a right-handed helix. If it spirals away from you in a counterclockwise direction, it is a left-handed helix.

circular double-stranded DNA molecule, contains $>4 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{bp}$. Its molecular weight is $>2,500 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$ (compared to the molecular weight for a glucose molecule of $180 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$ ). If this molecule were linear, its length would measure almost 2 mm . DNA from eukaryotic cells is approximately 1,000 times larger than that from bacterial cells. In eukaryotes, each chromosome contains one continuous linear DNA helix. The DNA of the longest human chromosome is $>7 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length. In fact, if the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a diploid human cell were placed end to end, our total DNA would span a distance of about $2 \mathrm{~m}(>6 \mathrm{ft})$. Our total DNA contains about $6 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{bp}$.

## B. Packaging of DNA

DNA molecules require special packaging to enable them to reside within cells because the molecules are so large. In E. coli, the circular DNA is supercoiled and attached to an RNA-protein core. Recall that DNA consists of a double helix, with the two strands of DNA wrapping around each other to form a helical structure. In order to compact, the DNA molecule coils about itself to form a structure called a supercoil. A telephone cord, which connects the handpiece to the phone, displays supercoiling when the coiled cord wraps about itself. When the strands of a DNA molecule separate and unwind over a small local region (which occurs during DNA replication), supercoils are introduced into the remaining portion of the molecule, thereby increasing stress on this portion of the molecule. Enzymes known as topoisomerases relieve this stress so that unwinding of the DNA strands can occur. This will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 13.

Packaging of eukaryotic DNA is much more complex than that of prokaryotic DNA because eukaryotic DNA is larger and must be contained within the nucleus of the cell. Eukaryotic DNA binds to an equal weight of histones, which are small basic proteins containing large amounts of arginine and lysine. The complex of DNA and proteins is called chromatin. The organization of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin is essential for controlling transcription as well as for packaging. When chromatin is extracted from cells, it has the appearance of beads on a string (Fig. 12.12). The beads with DNA protruding from each end are known as nucleosomes, and the beads themselves are known as nucleosome cores (Fig. 12.13). Two molecules of each of four histone classes (histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form the center of the core around which approximately 140 bp of double-stranded DNA are wound. The DNA wrapped around the nucleosome core is continuous and joins one nucleosome core to the next. The DNA joining the cores is complexed with the fifth type of histone, H1. Further compaction of chromatin occurs as the strings of nucleosomes wind into helical tubular coils called solenoid structures.

Although complexes of DNA and histones form the nucleosomal substructures of chromatin, other types of proteins are also associated with DNA in the nucleus. These proteins were given the unimaginative name of nonhistone chromosomal proteins. The cells of different tissues contain different amounts and types of these proteins, which include enzymes that act on DNA and factors that regulate transcription.

## C. The Human Genome

The genome, or total genetic content, of a human haploid cell (a sperm or an egg) is distributed in 23 chromosomes. Haploid cells contain one copy of each chromosome. The haploid egg and haploid sperm cells combine to form the diploid zygote, which continues to divide to form our other cells (mitosis), also diploid. In diploid cells, there are thus 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes, with each pair composed of two homologous chromosomes containing a similar series of genes (Fig. 12.14). In addition to the autosomal chromosomes, each diploid cell has two sex chromosomes, designated X and Y . A female has two X chromosomes, and a male has one X and one Y chromosome. The total number of chromosomes per diploid cell is 46.

Genes are arranged linearly along each chromosome. A gene, in genetic terms, is the fundamental unit of heredity. In structural terms, a gene encompasses the DNA sequence that encodes the structural components of the gene product (whether it be

FIGURE 12.12 Chromatin showing "beads on a string" structure.

If histones contain large amounts of arginine and lysine, will their net charge be positive or negative?

At physiologic pH, arginine and lysine carry positive charges on their side chains; therefore, histones have a net positive charge. The arginine and lysine residues are clustered in regions of the histone molecules. These positively charged regions of the histones interact with the negatively charged DNA phosphate groups.

a polypeptide chain or an RNA molecule) along with the DNA sequences adjacent to the $5^{\prime}$-end of the gene that regulates its expression. A genetic locus is a specific position or location on a chromosome. Each gene on a chromosome in a diploid cell is matched by an alternate version of the gene at the same genetic locus on the homologous chromosome (Fig. 12.15). These alternate versions of a gene are called alleles. We thus have two alleles of each gene, one from our mother and one from our father. If the alleles are identical in base sequence, we are homozygous for this gene.

Each female diploid cell contains two $X$ chromosomes. Each haploid cell contains chromosomes I through 22 plus either an $X$ or aY. (From Gelehrter TD, Collins FS, Ginsburg D. Principles of Medical Genetics. 2nd ed. Baltimore, MD:Williams \& Wilkins; 1998:I8.)

If the alleles differ, we are heterozygous for this gene and may produce two versions of the encoded protein that differ somewhat in primary structure.

The genomes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells differ in size. The genome of the bacterium E. coli contains approximately 3,000 genes. All of this bacterial DNA has a function; it either codes for proteins, rRNA, and tRNA, or it serves to regulate the synthesis of these gene products. In contrast, the genome of the human haploid cell contains between 20,000 and 25,000 genes, about seven to eight times the number in E. coli. The function of most of this extra DNA has not been determined (an issue considered in more detail in Chapter 15).

## III. Structure of RNA

## A. General Features of RNA

RNA is similar to DNA. Like DNA, it is composed of nucleotides joined by $3^{\prime}$ - to $5^{\prime}$-phosphodiester bonds, the purine bases adenine and guanine, and the pyrimidine base cytosine. However, its other pyrimidine base is uracil rather than thymine. Uracil and thymine are identical bases except that thymine has a methyl group at position 5 of the ring (Fig. 12.16). In RNA, the sugar is ribose, which contains a hydroxyl group on the $2^{\prime}$-carbon (see Fig. 12.3; the prime refers to the position on the ribose ring). As indicated previously, the presence of the $2^{\prime}$-hydroxyl is what renders RNA susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis.

RNA chains are usually single-stranded and lack the continuous helical structure of double-stranded DNA. However, RNA still has considerable secondary and tertiary structure because base pairs can form in regions where the strand loops back on itself. As in DNA, pairing between the bases is complementary and antiparallel. But in RNA, adenine pairs with uracil rather than thymine (see Fig. 12.16B). Base pairing in RNA can be extensive, and the irregular looped structures that are generated are important for the binding of molecules, such as enzymes, that interact with specific regions of the RNA.

The three major types of RNA (mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA) participate directly in the process of protein synthesis. Other, less abundantRNAs are involved in replication

FIGURE 12.15 Homologous chromosomes and their protein products. A set of homologous chromosomes is shown diagrammatically. (Of course, during interphase, when they are producing their protein products, they cannot be visualized as discrete entities.) Four genes are shown as examples on each homolog. The genes of the homologs are alleles (e.g., $A A, B b, C C, d D$ ). They may be identical (e.g., $A A, C C$ ) or they may differ (e.g., $B b$, $d D$ ) in DNA sequence. Thus, the corresponding protein products may be identical, or they may differ in amino acid sequence.

Clark T.'s original benign adenomatous polyp was located in the ascending colon. Because Mr.Ts father died of a cancer of the colon, his physician had warned him that his risk for developing colon cancer was two to three times higher than for the general population. Unfortunately, Mr.T. neglected to have a repeat colonoscopic examination after 3 years as recommended, and he developed an adenocarcinoma that metastasized.

Mr.T. is being treated with several chemotherapy agents, including 5-FU, a pyrimidine base similar to uracil and thymine. 5-FU inhibits the synthesis of the thymine nucleotides required for DNA replication. Thymine is normally produced by a reaction catalyzed by thymidylate synthase, an enzyme that converts deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). 5-FU is converted in the body to 5-FdUMP, which binds tightly to thymidylate synthase in a transition-state complex and inhibits the reaction (recall that thymine is 5-methyluracil). Thus, thymine nucleotides cannot be generated for DNA synthesis, and the rate of cell proliferation decreases.

FIGURE 12.17 The regions of eukaryotic mRNA. The wavy line indicates the polynucleotide chain of the mRNA and the As comprise the poly(A) tail. The $5^{\prime}$-cap consists of a guanosine residue linked at its $5^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group to three phosphates, which are linked to the $5^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group of the next nucleotide in the RNA chain (a $5^{\prime}-5^{\prime}$ triphosphate linkage). The start and stop codons represent where protein synthesis is initiated and terminated from this mRNA.
or in the processing of RNA; that is, in the conversion of RNA precursors to their mature forms or destruction of existing RNA molecules (see Chapter 17). Other forms of RNA are involved in gene regulation (e.g., microRNA; see Chapter 16).

Some RNA molecules are capable of catalyzing reactions. Thus, RNA, as well as protein, can have enzymatic activity. Certain rRNA precursors can remove internal segments of themselves, splicing the remaining fragments together. Because this RNA is changed by the reaction that it catalyzes, it is not truly an enzyme and therefore has been termed a ribozyme. Other RNAs act as true catalysts, serving as ribonucleases that cleave other RNA molecules or as a peptidyl transferase, the enzyme in protein synthesis that catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds.

## B. Structure of mRNA

Each mRNA molecule contains a nucleotide sequence that is converted into the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide chain in the process of translation. In eukaryotes, mRNA is transcribed from protein-coding genes as a long primary transcript that is processed in the nucleus to form mRNA. The various processing intermediates, which are mRNA precursors, are called pre-mRNA or heterogenous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). mRNA travels through nuclear pores to the cytoplasm, where it binds to ribosomes and tRNAs and directs the sequential insertion of the appropriate amino acids into a polypeptide chain.

Eukaryotic mRNA consists of a leader sequence at the $5^{\prime}$-end, a coding region, and a trailer sequence at the $3^{\prime}$-end (Fig. 12.17). The leader sequence begins with a guanosine cap structure at its $5^{\prime}$-end. The coding region begins with a trinucleotide start codon that signals the beginning of translation, followed by the trinucleotide codons for amino acids, and ends at a termination signal. The trailer sequence terminates at its $3^{\prime}$-end with a poly $(\mathrm{A})$ tail that may be up to 200 nucleotides long. Most of the leader sequence, all of the coding region, and most of the trailer are formed by transcription of the complementary nucleotide sequence in DNA. However, the terminal guanosine in the cap structure and the poly(A) tail do not have complementary sequences; they are added after transcription has been completed (posttranscriptionally).

## C. Structure of rRNA

Ribosomes are subcellular ribonucleoprotein complexes on which protein synthesis occurs. Different types of ribosomes are found in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of eukaryotic cells (Fig. 12.18). Prokaryotic ribosomes contain three types of rRNA molecules with sedimentation coefficients of $16 \mathrm{~S}, 23 \mathrm{~S}$, and 5 S . A sedimentation coefficient is a measure of the rate of sedimentation of a macromolecule in a high-speed centrifuge (ultracentrifuge). The units of sedimentation are expressed in Svedberg units (S). The 30 S ribosomal subunit contains the 16 S rRNA complexed with proteins, and the 50 S ribosomal subunit contains the 23 S and 5 S rRNAs complexed with proteins. The 30 S and 50 S ribosomal subunits join to form the 70 S ribosome, which participates in protein synthesis. Although larger macromolecules generally have higher sedimentation coefficients than do smaller macromolecules, sedimentation coefficients are not additive. Because frictional forces acting on the surface of a macromolecule slow its migration through the solvent, the rate of sedimentation depends not only on the density of the macromolecule but also on its shape.

Cytoplasmic ribosomes in eukaryotes contain four types of rRNA molecules of $18 \mathrm{~S}, 28 \mathrm{~S}, 5 \mathrm{~S}$, and 5.8 S . The 40 S ribosomal subunit contains the 18 S rRNA complexed with proteins, and the 60 S ribosomal subunit contains the $28 \mathrm{~S}, 5 \mathrm{~S}$, and 5.8 S rRNAs complexed with proteins. In the cytoplasm, the 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits combine to form the 80 S ribosomes that participate in protein synthesis.

Mitochondrial ribosomes, with a sedimentation coefficient of 55 S , are smaller than cytoplasmic ribosomes. Their properties are similar to those of the 70 S ribosomes of bacteria.

rRNAs contain many loops and exhibit extensive base pairing in the regions between the loops. The sequences of the rRNAs of the smaller ribosomal subunits exhibit secondary structures that are common to many different species.

## D. Structure of tRNA

During protein synthesis, $t R N A$ molecules carry amino acids to ribosomes and ensure that they are incorporated into the appropriate positions in the growing polypeptide chain. This is done through base pairing in an antiparallel manner of three bases of the tRNA (the anticodon) with the three base codons within the coding region of the mRNA. Therefore, cells contain at least 20 different tRNA molecules that differ somewhat in nucleotide sequence, one for each of the amino acids found in proteins. Many amino acids have more than one tRNA.
tRNA molecules contain not only the usual nucleotides but also derivatives of these nucleotides that are produced by posttranscriptional modifications. In eukaryotic cells, $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of the nucleotides of tRNA are modified. Most tRNA molecules contain ribothymidine (rT), in which a methyl group is added to uridine to form ribothymidine. They also contain dihydrouridine (D), in which one of the double bonds of the base is reduced, and pseudouridine $(\psi)$, in which uracil is attached to ribose by a carbon-carbon bond rather than a nitrogen-carbon bond (see Chapter 14). The base at the $5^{\prime}$-end of the anticodon of tRNA is also frequently modified.
tRNA molecules are small compared with both mRNA and the large rRNA molecules. On average, tRNA molecules contain about 80 nucleotides and have a sedimentation coefficient of 4 S . Because of their small size and high content of modified nucleotides, tRNAs were the first nucleic acids to be sequenced. Since 1965, when Robert Holley deduced the structure of the first tRNA, the nucleotide sequences of many different tRNAs have been determined. Although their primary sequences differ, all tRNA molecules can form a structure resembling a cloverleaf (discussed in more detail in Chapter 14).

## E. Other Types of RNA

In addition to the three major types of RNA described previously, other RNAs are present in cells. These RNAs include the oligonucleotides that serve as primers for DNA replication and the RNAs in the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs or snurps) that are involved in the splicing and modification reactions that occur during the maturation of RNA precursors (see Chapter 14). Also included are microRNAs, which participate in the regulation of gene expression (see Chapters 16 and 18).

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Isabel S. Isabel S.'s infection with HIV was from needles contaminated with HIV. Without treatment, her HIV will progress and will result in the development of AIDS. The progressive immunologic deterioration that accompanies this disease ultimately results in life-threatening opportunistic infections with fungi (e.g., Candida, Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis jirovecii [formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii]), other viruses (e.g., cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex), and bacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium, Salmonella). The immunologic incompetence also frequently results in the development of certain neoplasms (e.g., Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma) as well as meningitis, neuropathies, and neuropsychiatric disorders causing cognitive dysfunction. Although recent advances in drug therapy can slow or stop the course of the disease, no cure is yet available.

Clark T. Clark T.'s original benign adenomatous polyp was located on the right side of the colon, which is less common than the left side but is increasing in incidence. Because Mr. T.'s father died from a cancer of

FIGURE 12.18 Comparison of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. The cytoplasmic ribosomes of eukaryotes are shown. Mitochondrial ribosomes are similar to prokaryotic ribosomes, but they are smaller ( 555 rather than 705).

Azithromycin, the antibiotic used to treat Paul T. inhibits protein synthesis on prokaryotic ribosomes but not on eukaryotic ribosomes. It binds to the 505 ribosomal subunit, which is absent in eukaryotes. Therefore, it will selectively inhibit bacterial growth. However, because mitochondrial ribosomes are similar to those of bacteria, mitochondrial protein synthesis can also be inhibited. This fact is important in understanding some of the side effects of antibiotics that work by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.

Clark T. completed his first course of intravenous chemotherapy in the hospital. He tolerated the therapy with only mild anorexia and diarrhea and with only a mild leukopenia (a decreased white blood cell count; leuko $=$ white). Thirty days after the completion of the initial course, these symptoms abated and he started his second course of chemotherapy, including 5-FU as an outpatient.

Because 5-FU inhibits synthesis of thymine, DNA synthesis is affected in all cells in the human body that are rapidly dividing, such as the cells in the bone marrow that produce leukocytes and the mucosal cells lining the intestines. Inhibition of DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells contributes to the side effects of 5-FU and many other chemotherapeutic drugs.
the colon, his physician had warned him that his risk for developing colon cancer was two to three times higher than for the general population. Unfortunately, Mr. T. neglected to have his annual colonoscopic examinations as prescribed, and he developed an adenocarcinoma that metastasized.

The most malignant characteristic of neoplasms is their ability to metastasize; that is, form a new neoplasm at a noncontiguous site. The initial site of metastases for a tumor is usually at the first capillary bed encountered by the malignant cells once they are released. Thus, cells from tumors of the gastrointestinal tract often pass through the portal vein to the liver, which is Clark T.'s site of metastasis. Because his adenocarcinoma has metastasized, there is little hope of eradicating it, and his therapy with 5-FU and other chemotherapy agents is palliative (directed toward reducing the severity of the disease and alleviating the symptoms without actually curing the disease). Although if the metastatic disease in the liver responds to the chemotherapy, those lesions may then be able to be resected, resulting in improved survival.

Paul T. Paul T.'s infection was treated with azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic. Because this agent can inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, it has the potential to alter host-cell function, leading to such side effects as epigastric distress, diarrhea, and, infrequently, cholestatic jaundice.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Retroviruses. RNA also serves as the genome for certain types of viruses, including retroviruses. HIV is an example of a retrovirus (Fig. 12.19). Because they are not capable of reproducing independently, viruses must invade host cells to reproduce. Some viruses that are pathogenic to humans contain DNA as their genetic material; others contain RNA as their genetic material. HIV invades cells of the immune system and prevents the affected individual from mounting an adequate immune response to combat infections.

According to the "central dogma" proposed by Francis Crick, information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins. For the most part, this concept holds true. However, retroviruses provide one violation of this rule. When retroviruses invade cells, their RNA genome is transcribed to produce a DNA copy. The enzyme that catalyzes this process is encoded in the viral RNA and is known as reverse transcriptase. This DNA copy integrates into the genome of the infected cell, and enzymes of the host cell are used to produce many copies of the viral RNA, as well as viral proteins, which can be packaged into new viral particles.
![ma24486325cc](ma24486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 12.19 The life cycle of a retrovirus. The virus contains two identical RNA strands, only one of which is shown for clarity. After penetrating the plasma membrane, the single-stranded viral RNA genome is reverse-transcribed to a double-stranded DNA form. The viral DNA migrates to the nucleus and integrates into the chromosomal DNA, where it is transcribed to form a viral RNA transcript. The viral transcript can form the viral RNA genome for progeny viruses, or it can be translated to generate viral structural proteins.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- The central dogma of molecular biology is that DNA is transcribed to RNA, which is translated to protein.
- Nucleotides, consisting of a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar, and phosphate, are the monomeric units of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA (see Chapter 5).
- DNA contains the sugar 2'-deoxyribose; RNA contains ribose.
- DNA and RNA contain the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G).
- DNA contains the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine (T), whereas RNA contains C and uracil (U).
- DNA and RNA are linear sequences of nucleotides linked by phosphodiester bonds between the $3^{\prime}$-sugar of one nucleotide and the $5^{\prime}$-sugar of the next nucleotide.
- Genetic information is encoded by the sequence of the nucleotide bases in DNA.
- DNA is double stranded; one strand runs in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction, whereas the other is antiparallel and runs in the $3^{\prime}$-to-5' direction.
- The two strands of DNA wrap about each other to form a double helix and are held together by hydrogen bonding between bases in each strand and by hydrophobic interactions between the stacked bases in the core of the molecule.
- The base adenine hydrogen-bonds to thymine, whereas cytosine hydrogenbonds to guanine.
- Transcription of a gene generates a single-stranded RNA; the three major types of RNA are messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA).
- Eukaryotic mRNA is modified at both the $5^{\prime}$ - and $3^{\prime}$-ends. In between, it contains a coding region for the synthesis of a protein.
- Codons within the coding region dictate the sequence of amino acids in a protein. Each codon is three nucleotides long.
- rRNA and tRNA are required for protein synthesis.
- rRNA is complexed with proteins to form ribonucleoprotein particles called ribosomes, which bind mRNA and tRNAs during translation.
- tRNA contains an anticodon that binds to a complementary codon on mRNA , ensuring insertion of the correct amino acid into the protein being synthesized.
- The diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 12.2.

D. [A] is $25 \mathrm{~mol} \%$, [T] is $25 \mathrm{~mol} \%$, [G] is $25 \mathrm{~mol} \%$, and $[\mathrm{C}]$ is $25 \mathrm{~mol} \%$.
E. The composition of the complementary strand cannot be determined from the data given.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is D. Viruses consist of either a DNA or RNA genome but not both. All the viruses that cause the common cold are RNA viruses. When viruses infect bacteria (prokaryotes), they are called bacteriophages or phages. Plasmids are not viruses and are not infectious. Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that can replicate autonomously, whereas viruses cannot and must use the host cell's DNA, RNA, and protein-synthesizing machinery.
2. The answer is B. rRNA and tRNA are part of the apparatus for protein synthesis, but the sequences of rRNA and tRNA do not encode proteins. mRNA carries the genetic information that is converted into the amino acid sequence of a protein, but that is used in the process of translation. Transcription of a gene from DNA generates RNA that is complementary to only one strand of DNA.
3. The answer is B. Adenine and guanine are purines, which form urate during their metabolism. Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are pyrimidines that follow different metabolic pathways and do not form uric acid. Deoxyribose is a component of DNA, but it is a sugar and not a purine base, and it is not converted to uric acid.
4. The answer is D. Both alkali and heat cause the two strands of DNA to separate. Alkali does not break the phosphodiester bonds of DNA but does cleave the phosphodiester bonds of RNA, degrading RNA to nucleotides. RNA is single stranded, not double stranded. In the analysis of DNA, many techniques call for its separation from RNA (the alkali treatment) and its denaturation (separation of the double strands).
5. The answer is E. The leader sequence begins with an $N^{7}$-methylguanosine cap at the $5^{\prime}$-end of the mRNA. The coding region of the mRNA then follows. The $3^{\prime}$-end of the mRNA contains a polyadenine tail, which aids in the stability of the mRNA. Only the tail of the mRNA is added after transcription of the mRNA.
6. The answer is D. The complementary strand must run in the opposite direction, so the $5^{\prime}$-end must base-pair with the G at the $3^{\prime}$-end of the given strand. Therefore, the $5^{\prime}$-end of the complementary strand must be C . G would then base-pair to C, A to T, and T to A. Answer B is incorrect because the bases do not base-pair with each other with the sequences indicated, C is incorrect because $U$ is not found in DNA, and $E$ is incorrect because it has the wrong polarity (the $5^{\prime}-\mathrm{T}$ in answer E would not base-pair with the $3^{\prime}-\mathrm{G}$ in the given sequence).
7. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. The RNA strand must be complementary to the DNA strand, and A in DNA base-pairs with U in RNA, whereas T in DNA base-pairs with A in RNA, G in DNA base-pairs with C in RNA, and C in DNA base-pairs with G in RNA. Answers A and E are incorrect because they contain T, which is found in DNA, not RNA. Answer B is incorrect because the base-pairing rules are broken when the strands are aligned in antiparallel fashion. Answers D is incorrect because the polarity of the strand is incorrect (if one were to switch the $5^{\prime}$ and $3^{\prime}$-ends, the answer would be correct).
8. The answer is D. The phosphate is in an ester bond between two deoxyribose groups, generating the phosphodiester bond in the DNA backbone (these are covalent bonds). None of the other types of bonds is correct.
9. The answer is A. The DNA backbone is composed of the phosphates and deoxyribose in phosphodiester linkages. The bases are internal to the backbone, base-paired to bases in the complementary strand, and form stacking interactions within the double helix.
10. The answer is A. The base pairs in double-stranded DNA require that $[\mathrm{A}]=[\mathrm{T}]$, and $[\mathrm{C}]=[\mathrm{G}]$. Therefore, if the concentration of A in one strand is $20 \mathrm{~mol} \%$, the concentration of T in the complementary strand must also be $20 \mathrm{~mol} \%$. For the example given, then, [A] would be $25 \mathrm{~mol} \%$, [T] would be $20 \mathrm{~mol} \%$, [G] would be $25 \mathrm{~mol} \%$, and $[\mathrm{C}]$ would be $30 \mathrm{~mol} \%$.

FIGURE 13.1 A replicating DNA helix. The parental strands separate at the replication fork. Each parental strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new strand.

## Synthesis of DNA

DNA synthesis occurs by the process of replication. During replication, each of the two parental strands of DNA serves as a template for the synthesis of a complementary strand. Thus, each DNA molecule generated by the replication process contains one intact parental strand and one newly synthesized strand (Fig. I3.I). In eukaryotes, DNA replication occurs during the $\mathbf{S}$ phase of the cell cycle, which is followed by the $G_{2}$ phase. The cell divides during the next phase (M), and each daughter cell receives an exact copy of the DNA of the parent cell.

The Replication Fork. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the site at which replication is occurring at any given moment is called the replication fork. As replication proceeds, the two parental strands separate in front of the fork. Behind the fork, each newly synthesized strand of DNA base-pairs with its complementary parental template strand. A complex of proteins is involved in replication. Helicases and topolsomerases unwind the parental strands, and single-strand binding proteins prevent them from reannealing.

The major enzyme involved in replication is a DNA polymerase that copies each parental template strand in the $3^{\prime}$-to-5' direction, producing new strands in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates serve as the precursors. One strand of newly synthesized DNA grows continuously, whereas the other strand is synthesized discontinuously in short segments known as Okazaki fragments. These fragments are subsequently joined by DNA ligase.

Initiation. DNA polymerase cannot initiate the synthesis of new strands. Therefore, a short primer is produced which contains ribonucleotides (RNA). DNA polymerase can add deoxyribonucleotides to the $3^{\prime}$-end of this primer. This RNA primer is subsequently removed and replaced by deoxyribonucleotides.

Telomeres. The ends of linear chromosomes are called telomeres. The enzyme telomerase, an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that carries its own RNA template, is required for their replication.

Errors and Repair. Errors that occur during replication can lead to deleterious mutations. However, many errors are corrected by enzyme activities associated with the complex at the replication fork. The error rate is thus kept at a very low level.

Damage to DNA molecules also causes mutations. Repair mechanisms correct DNA damage, usually by removing and replacing the damaged region. The intact, undamaged strand serves as a template for the DNA polymerase involved in the repair process.

Recombination. Although cells have mechanisms to correct replication errors and to repair DNA damage, some genetic change is desirable. It produces new proteins or variations of proteins that may increase the survival rate of the species. Genetic change is produced by unrepaired mutations and by a mechanism known as recombination, in which portions of chromosomes are exchanged.

## THE WAITING ROOM

Isabel S. is having difficulty complying with her multidrug regimen. She often forgets to take her pills. When she returns for a checkup, she asks if it is that important to take her pills every day for treatment of HIV.

$\square$Dianne A. responded to treatment for her diabetes mellitus but subsequently developed a low-grade fever, an increase in urinary urgency and frequency, and burning at the urethral opening with urination (dysuria). A urinalysis showed a large number of white blood cells and many gram-negative bacilli. A urine culture indicated many colonies of Escherichia coli, which is sensitive to several antibiotics, including the quinolone ciprofloxacin.

$\square$Calvin A. is a 46-year-old man who noted a superficial, brownish-black, 5-mm nodule with irregular borders in the skin on his chest. He was scheduled for outpatient surgery, at which time a wide excision biopsy was performed such that the complete mole was removed and biopsied. Examination of the nodule revealed histologic changes characteristic of a malignant melanoma reaching a thickness of only 0.7 mm (Stage I).

$\square$Michael T. is a 62-year-old electrician who has smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 40 years. He recently noted that his chronic cough had gotten worse. His physician ordered a chest X-ray, which showed a 2-cm nodule in the upper lobe of the right lung. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed and confirmed a $2-\mathrm{cm}$ nodule very concerning for malignancy. The patient was taken for surgery and the nodule excised. The pathology showed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung. Malignant neoplasms (new growth, a tumor) of epithelial cell origin (including the intestinal lining, cells of the skin, and cells lining the airways of the lungs) are called carcinomas. If the cancer grows in a gland-like pattern, it is an adenocarcinoma.

## I. DNA Synthesis in Prokaryotes

The basic features of the mechanism of DNA replication are illustrated by the processes occurring in the bacterium E. coli. This bacillus grows symbiotically in the human colon. It has been extensively studied and serves as a model for the more complex, and consequently less well understood, processes that occur in eukaryotic cells.

## A. Bidirectional Replication

Replication of the circular double-stranded DNA of the chromosome of E. coli begins with the binding of approximately 30 molecules of the protein DnaA at a single point of origin (known as the origin of replication), designated oriC, where the DNA coils around the DnaA core (Fig. 13.2). With the assistance of other proteins (e.g., a helicase, gyrase, and single-stranded binding protein), the two parental strands separate within this region, and both strands are copied simultaneously. Synthesis begins at the origin and occurs at two replication forks that move away from the origin bidirectionally (in both directions at the same time). Replication ends on the other side of the chromosome at a termination point. One round of synthesis, involving the incorporation of over 4 million nucleotides in each new strand of DNA, is completed in approximately 40 minutes. However, a second round of synthesis can begin at the origin before the first round is finished. These multiple initiations of replication allow bacterial multiplication to occur much more quickly than the time it takes to complete a single round of replication.

$\square$Collection of a patient's urine allows many variables to be examined, including sugar (glucose) levels, creatinine (kidney function) levels, ketone bodies (significant fatty acid oxidation), and crystal or bacterial infiltration. In the case of bacteria, the finding of any bacteria in the urine is unusual because normal urine is sterile. If large numbers of organisms are seen microscopically and they are accompanied by white blood cells, a urinary tract infection is the diagnosis. In
Dianne A.'s case, the bacteria were demonstrated to be gram-negative (see Chapter 12)—specifically, E. coli. Typing the bacteria will allow the appropriate antibiotic to be given to cure the infection.

FIGURE 13.2 Bidirectional replication of a circular chromosome. Replication begins at the point of origin (oriC) and proceeds in both directions at the same time. Parental strands are shown in blue; newly synthesized strands are shown in red.

## B. Semiconservative Replication

Each daughter chromosome contains one of the parental DNA strands and one newly synthesized complementary strand. Therefore, replication is said to be semiconservative; that is, the parental strands are conserved but are no longer together. Each one is paired with a newly synthesized strand (see Figs. 13.1 and 13.2).

## C. DNA Unwinding

Replication requires separation of the parental DNA strands and unwinding of the helix ahead of the replication fork. Helicases (an example of which is the protein DnaB) separate the DNA strands and unwind the parental duplex. Single-strand binding proteins prevent the strands from reassociating and protect them from enzymes that cleave single-stranded DNA (Fig. 13.3). Topoisomerases, enzymes that can break phosphodiester bonds and rejoin them, relieve the supercoiling of the parental duplex caused by unwinding. DNA gyrase is a major topoisomerase in bacterial cells.

## D. DNA Polymerase Action

Enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of DNA are known as DNA polymerases. E. coli has three DNA polymerases: Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III. Pol III is the major replicative enzyme (Table 13.1). All DNA polymerases that have been studied copy a DNA

| TABLE 13.1 Functions of Bacterial DNA Polymerases |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| POLYMERASES | FUNCTIONS ${ }^{a}$ | EXONUCLEASE ACTIVITY ${ }^{b}$ |
| Pol I | Filling of gap after removal of RNA primer DNA repair <br> Removal of RNA primer in conjunction with RNase H | $5^{\prime}$-to-3' and $3^{\prime}$-to-5' |
| Pol II | DNA repair | $3^{\prime}$-to-5' |

${ }^{a}$ Synthesis of new DNA strands always occurs in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction.
${ }^{b}$ Exonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands, acting either at the $5^{\prime}$-end (cleaving $5^{\prime}$-to-3') or at the $3^{\prime}$-end (cleaving $3^{\prime}$-to-5'). Endonucleases cleave bonds within polynucleotide chains.
template strand in its $3^{\prime}$-to-5' direction, producing a new strand in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction (Fig. 13.4). Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP) serve as substrates for the addition of nucleotides to the growing chain.

The incoming nucleotide forms a base pair with its complementary nucleotide on the template strand. Then, an ester bond is formed between the first (or $\alpha$ ) $5^{\prime}$-phosphate of the incoming nucleotide and the free $3^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group at the end of the growing chain. Pyrophosphate is released. The release of pyrophosphate (formed from the $\beta$ - and $\gamma$-phosphates of the nucleotide) and its subsequent cleavage by a pyrophosphatase provide the energy that drives the polymerization reaction.

DNA polymerases that catalyze the synthesis of new strands during replication exhibit a feature called processivity. They remain bound to the parental template strand while continuing to "process" down the chain rather than dissociating and reassociating as each nucleotide is added. Consequently, synthesis is much more rapid than it would be with an enzyme that was not processive.

$\sigma$
Dianne A.'s urinary tract infection was treated with ciprofloxacin, a fluorinated member of the quinolone family. This group of drugs inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase, a topoisomerase that unwinds the closed circular bacterial DNA helix ahead of the replication fork and thus inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis. Because eukaryotic cells use a different protein as a topoisomerase and do not contain DNA gyrase, they are not affected by quinolones.

One of the drugs used to treat Isabel S. was lamivudine, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). It is a dideoxynucleoside, an example of which is shown in the following figure. For an earlygeneration NRTI, didanosine, the base in the drug is hypoxanthine. For lamivudine, the base is cytosine.
![ma29486325cc](ma29486325cc.jpg)

A dideoxynucleoside
The dideoxynucleosides do not have a hydroxyl group on either the $2^{\prime}$ - or $3^{\prime}$-carbon. They can be converted to dideoxynucleoside triphosphates in cells and, like zidovudine (ZDV), terminate chain growth when incorporated into DNA. In the case of the dideoxynucleosides, chain termination results from the absence of a hydroxyl group on the $3^{\prime}$-carbon. The HIV mutates very rapidly (mostly because reverse transcriptase lacks $3^{\prime}$-to-5' exonuclease activity, which is the proofreading activity) and frequently develops resistance to one or more of these drugs. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with AIDS take several drugs, including two NRTIs.

RNAse H is a ribonuclease that specifically degrades RNA from an RNA-DNA hybrid. The HIV (see Chapter 12) converts an RNA genome to a double-stranded DNA copy using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. An intermediate in the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome to double-stranded DNA is an RNA-DNA hybrid. To remove the RNA so a double-stranded DNA molecule can be made, reverse transcriptase also contains RNase H activity. Because reverse transcriptase lacks error-checking capabilities, the HIV genome can mutate at a rapid rate. Isabel S. takes many drugs because of the need to block HIV replication at multiple steps in order to "keep ahead" of the high mutation rate of the virus. The RNase H activity of reverse transcriptase has proven to be a difficult target for drug development to block HIV genome replication, although research in this area is still quite active.

## E. Base-Pairing Errors

In E. coli, the replicative enzyme Pol III also performs a proofreading or editing function. This enzyme has $3^{\prime}$-to-5' exonuclease activity in addition to its polymerase activity (see Table 13.1). If the nucleotide at the end of the growing chain is incorrectly base-paired with the template strand, Pol III removes this nucleotide before continuing to lengthen the growing chain. This proofreading activity eliminates most base-pairing errors as they occur. Only about one base pair in a million is mismatched in the final DNA product; the error rate is about $10^{-4}$. If this proofreading activity is experimentally removed from the enzyme, the error rate increases to about $10^{-3}$.

After replication, other mechanisms replace mismatched bases that escaped proofreading so that the fidelity of DNA replication is very high. The two processes of proofreading and postreplication mismatch repair result in an overall error rate of about $10^{-10}$; that is, less than one mismatched base pair in 10 billion.

## F. RNA Primer Requirement

DNA polymerase cannot initiate the synthesis of new strands; it requires the presence of a free $3^{\prime}-\mathrm{OH}$ group to function. Therefore, a primer is required to supply the free $3^{\prime}-\mathrm{OH}$ group. This primer is an RNA oligonucleotide. It is synthesized in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction by an RNA polymerase (primase) that copies the DNA template strand. DNA polymerase initially adds a deoxyribonucleotide to the $3^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group of the primer and then continues adding deoxyribonucleotides to the $3^{\prime}$-end of the growing strand (Fig. 13.5).

## G. The Replication Fork

Both parental strands are copied at the same time in the direction of the replication fork, an observation that is difficult to reconcile with the known activity of DNA polymerase, which can produce chains only in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction. Because the parental strands run in opposite directions relative to each other, synthesis should occur in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction toward the fork on one template strand and in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction away from the fork on the other template strand.

Okazaki resolved this dilemma by showing that synthesis on one strand, called the leading strand, is continuous in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction toward the fork. The other strand, called the lagging strand, is synthesized discontinuously in short fragments (see Fig. 13.5). These fragments, named for Okazaki, are produced in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction (away from the fork) but then are joined together so that, overall, synthesis proceeds toward the replication fork.

## H. DNA Ligase

As replication progresses, the RNA primers are removed from Okazaki fragments, probably by the combined action of DNA polymerase I (Pol I, using its $5^{\prime}$-to-3' exonuclease activity) and RNase $H$, an enzyme that removes RNA from DNA-RNA hybrids. Pol I fills in the gaps produced by removal of the primers. Because DNA polymerases cannot join two polynucleotide chains together, an additional enzyme, DNA ligase, is required to perform this function. The $3^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group at the end of one fragment is ligated to the phosphate group at the $5^{\prime}$-end of the next fragment (Fig. 13.6).

## II. DNA Synthesis in Eukaryotes

The process of replication in eukaryotes is similar to that in prokaryotes. Differences in the processes are related mainly to the vastly larger amount of DNA in eukaryotic cells ( $>1,000$ times the amount in E. coli) and the association of eukaryotic DNA with histones in nucleosomes. Enzymes with DNA polymerase, primase, ligase,

![ma30486325cc](ma30486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 13.5 Synthesis of DNA at the replication fork. (See Fig. 13.6 for the ligation reaction.)
helicase, and topoisomerase activity are all present in eukaryotes, although these enzymes differ in some respects from those of prokaryotes.

## A. Eukaryotic Cell Cycle

The cell cycle of eukaryotes consists of four phases (Fig. 13.7). The first three phases $\left(\mathrm{G}_{1}, \mathrm{~S}\right.$, and $\left.\mathrm{G}_{2}\right)$ constitute interphase. Cells spend most of their time in these three phases, carrying out their normal metabolic activities. The fourth phase is mitosis, the process of cell division. This phase is very brief.

The first phase of the cell cycle, $G_{1}$ (the first "gap" phase), is the most variable in length. Late in $\mathrm{G}_{1}$, the cells prepare to duplicate their chromosomes (e.g., by producing nucleotide precursors). In the second $(S)$ phase, DNA replicates.
![ma31486325cc](ma31486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 13.6 Action of DNA ligase. Two polynucleotide chains, one with a free $3^{\prime}-\mathrm{OH}$ group and one with a free $5^{\prime}$-phosphate group, are joined by DNA ligase, which forms a phosphodiester bond.

Although Prometheus was chained to a rock as punishment for his theft of fire from the gods, and a vulture pecked at his liver each day, he survived. Can you guess why?

In the human body, many cells cycle frequently—for example, hair follicles, skin cells, and cells of the duodenal crypts. Other cells, such as the precursors of red blood cells, divide several times and then lose their nuclei and leave the cell cycle to form mature red blood cells. These cells transport oxygen and carbon dioxide among the lungs and other tissues for about 120 days and then die. Other cells are normally quiescent (in $\mathrm{G}_{0}$ ). However, they can be stimulated to divide. In many instances, the stimuli are growth factors or hormones (e.g., mammary alveolar cells, uterine cells). In the case of liver cells, the stimulus is produced by death of some of the cells.

![ma32486325cc](ma32486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 13.7 Eukaryotic cell cycle. The times given for the length of each phase are for cells growing in culture. DNA content is expressed as 2 N (diploid) and, after DNA replication, as 4 N (tetraploid).

Nucleosomes disassemble as the replication forks advance. Throughout S phase, the synthesis of histones and other proteins associated with DNA is markedly increased. The amount of DNA and histones both double and chromosomes are duplicated. Histones complex with DNA, and nucleosomes are formed very rapidly behind the advancing replication forks.

During the third phase of the cell cycle, $G_{2}$ (the second "gap" phase), the cells prepare to divide and synthesize tubulin for construction of the microtubules of the spindle apparatus. Finally, division occurs in the brief mitotic or $M$ phase.

Following mitosis, some cells reenter $\mathrm{G}_{1}$, repeatedly going through the phases of the cell cycle and dividing. Other cells arrest in the cycle after mitosis, never to divide again, or they enter an extended $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ phase (sometimes called $G_{0}$ ), in which they remain quiescent but metabolically active for long periods of time. Upon the appropriate signal, cells in $\mathrm{G}_{0}$ are stimulated to reenter the cycle and divide.

## B. Points of Origin for Replication

In contrast to bacterial chromosomes (see Section I.A of this chapter), eukaryotic chromosomes have multiple points of origin at which replication begins. "Bubbles" appear at these points on the chromosomes. At each end of a bubble, a replication fork forms; thus, each bubble has two forks. DNA synthesis occurs at each of these forks, as illustrated in Figure 13.8. As the bubbles enlarge, they eventually merge and replication is completed. Because eukaryotic chromosomes contain multiple points of origin of replication (and, thus, multiple replicons, or units of replication), duplication of such large chromosomes can occur within a few hours.

## C. Eukaryotic DNA Polymerases

Fifteen different DNA polymerases have been identified in eukaryotic cells. Examples of some of these polymerases, and their properties, are shown in Table 13.2. Polymerases $\delta(\operatorname{Pol} \delta)$ and $\varepsilon(\operatorname{Pol} \varepsilon)$ are the major replicative enzymes. Polymerase $\alpha$ is also involved in replication. Polymerases $\delta$ and $\varepsilon$, as well as Pol $\alpha$, appear to be involved in DNA repair. Polymerase $\gamma$ is located in mitochondria and replicates the DNA of this organelle. Polymerases $\zeta, \kappa, \eta$, and $\iota$, which lack $5^{\prime}$ exonuclease activity, are used when DNA is damaged and are known as bypass polymerases because they can "bypass" the damaged area of DNA and continue replication.

TABLE 13.3 Functions of Some Eukaryotic DNA Polymerases

| POLYMERASE | FUNCTIONS ${ }^{a}$ | EXONUCLEASE ACTIVITY |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Pol $\alpha$ | Replication (in a complex with primase and aids in starting the primer) DNA repair | None |
| Pol $\beta$ | DNA repair exclusively | None |
| Pol $\gamma$ | DNA replication in mitochondria | $3^{\prime}$-to-5' |
| Pol $\delta$ | Replication (processive DNA synthesis on lagging strand) DNA repair | $3^{\prime}$-to-5' |
| Pol $\varepsilon$ | Replication (processive DNA synthesis on leading strand) DNA repair | $3^{\prime}$-to-5' |
| Pol $\kappa$ | DNA repair (bypass polymerase) ${ }^{b}$ | None |
| Pol $\eta$ | DNA repair (bypass polymerase) | None |
| Pol $\zeta$ | DNA repair (bypass polymerase) | None |
| Pol $\downarrow$ | DNA repair (bypass polymerase) | None |

${ }^{a}$ Synthesis of new DNA strands always occurs in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction.
${ }^{b}$ Bypass polymerases are able to "bypass" areas of DNA damage and continue DNA replication. Some enzymes are error-free and insert the correct bases; other enzymes are error-prone and sometimes insert incorrect bases.

## D. The Eukaryotic Replication Complex

Many proteins bind at or near the replication fork and participate in the process of duplicating DNA (Fig. 13.9 and Table 13.3). Polymerases $\delta$ and $\varepsilon$ are the major replicative enzymes. However, before the DNA polymerases can act, a primase associated with Pol $\alpha$ produces an RNA primer ( $\sim 10$ nucleotides in length).
![ma33486325cc](ma33486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 13.9 Replication complex in eukaryotes. The lagging strand is shown looped around the replication complex to demonstrate that all DNA synthesis is in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction. Single-strand binding proteins (not shown) are bound to the unpaired singlestranded DNA. Other proteins also participate in this complex (see text).

FIGURE 13.8 Replication of a eukaryotic chromosome. Synthesis is bidirectional from each point of origin $(O)$ and semiconservative. Each daughter DNA helix contains one intact parental strand (blue line) and one newly synthesized strand (red line).

$\Delta$Liver cells are in $\mathrm{G}_{0} . \mathrm{Up}$ to $90 \%$ of the human liver can be removed. The remaining liver cells are stimulated to reenter the cell cycle and divide, regenerating a mass equivalent to the original mass of the liver within a few weeks. The myth of Prometheus indicates that the capacity of the liver to regenerate was recognized even in ancient times.

FIGURE 13.10 The end-replication problem in linear chromosomes. After replication and removal of the RNA primers, the telomeres have $3^{\prime}$ overhangs. When these molecules are replicated, chromosome shortening will result. The figure depicts a linear chromosome with one origin of replication. At the origin, two replication forks are generated, moving in opposite directions, labeled as Fork I and Fork 2. As Fork I moves to the right, the bottom strand is read in the $3^{\prime}$-to-5' direction, which means it is the template for the leading strand. The newly synthesized DNA complementary to the upper strand at Fork I will be the lagging strand. Now consider Fork 2. As this replication fork moves to the left, the upper strand is read in the $3^{\prime}$-to-5' direction, so the newly synthesized DNA complementary to this strand will be the leading strand. For this fork, the newly synthesized DNA complementary to the bottom strand will be the lagging strand. The overhangs result from degradation of the RNA primers at the $5^{\prime}$-ends of the lagging strand, resulting in a $3^{\prime}$ overhang.
at the very end of the chromosome, or, after DNA replication is complete, the RNA at the end of the chromosome is degraded. Consequently, the newly synthesized strand is shorter at the $5^{\prime}$-end, and there is a $3^{\prime}$ overhang in the DNA strand being replicated. If the chromosome became shorter with each successive replication, genes would be lost. How is this problem solved?

The 3' overhang is lengthened by the addition of nucleotides so that primase can bind and synthesize a primer for the complementary strand. Telomeres consist of a repeating sequence of bases (TTAGGG for humans), which may be repeated thousands of times. The enzyme telomerase contains both proteins and RNA and acts as an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (just like reverse transcriptase). The RNA within telomerase contains the complementary copy of the repeating sequence in the telomeres and can base-pair with the existing $3^{\prime}$ overhang (Fig. 13.11). The polymerase activity of telomerase then uses the existing $3^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group of the overhang as a primer and its own RNA as a template and
![ma36486325cc](ma36486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 13.11 Telomerase action. The RNA present in telomerase base-pairs with the overhanging $3^{\prime}$-end of telomeres and extends it by acting as both a template and a reverse transcriptase. After copying a small number of repeats, the complex moves down to the $3^{\prime}$-end of the overhang and repeats the process.

An inability to replicate telomeres has been linked to cell aging and death. Many somatic cells do not express telomerase; when they are placed in culture, they survive a fixed number of population doublings, enter senescence, and then die. Analysis has shown significant telomere shortening in those cells. In contrast, stem cells do express telomerase and appear to have an infinite lifetime in culture. Research is underway to understand the role of telomeres in cell aging, growth, and cancer.

Michael T. has been smoking for 40 years because of the highly addictive nature of nicotine in tobacco and in spite of the warnings on cigarette packs that this habit can be dangerous and even deadly. The burning of tobacco, and, for that matter, the burning of any organic material, produces many different carcinogens such as benzo[o]pyrene. These carcinogens coat the airways and lungs. They can cross cell membranes and interact with DNA, causing damage to bases that interferes with normal base pairing. If these DNA lesions cannot be repaired or if they are not repaired rapidly enough, a permanent mutation can be produced when the cells replicate. Some mutations are silent, whereas other mutations can lead to abnormal cell growth, and cancer results.

Melanomas develop from exposure of the skin to the UV rays of the sun. The UV radiation causes pyrimidine dimers to form in DNA. Mutations may result from nonrepair of the dimers that produce melanomas, which appear as dark brown growths on the skin.

Fortunately, Calvin A.'s malignant skin lesion was discovered at an early stage. Because there was no evidence of cancer in the margins of the resected mass, full recovery was expected. However, lifelong surveillance for return of the melanoma was recommended.
synthesizes new DNA that lengthens the $3^{\prime}$-end of the DNA strand. The telomerase moves down the DNA toward the new $3^{\prime}$-end and repeats the process many times. When the $3^{\prime}$-overhang is sufficiently long, primase binds and synthesis of the complementary strand is initiated. Even after this lengthening process, there is still a $3^{\prime}$ overhang that forms a complicated structure with telomere-binding proteins to protect the ends of the chromosomes from damage and nuclease attack once they have been lengthened.

## III. DNA Repair

## A. Actions of Mutagens

Despite proofreading and mismatch repair (see the following) during replication, some mismatched bases do persist. Additional problems may arise from DNA damaged by mutagens, chemicals produced in cells, inhaled, or absorbed from the environment which cause mutations. Mutagens that cause normal cells to become cancer cells are known as carcinogens. Unfortunately, mismatching of bases and DNA damage produce thousands of potentially mutagenic lesions in each cell every day. Without repair mechanisms, we could not survive these assaults on our genes.

DNA damage can be caused by radiation and by chemicals (Fig. 13.12). These agents can directly affect the DNA or they can act indirectly. For example, X-rays, a type of ionizing radiation, act indirectly to damage DNA by exciting water in the cell and generating the hydroxyl radical, which reacts with DNA, thereby altering the structure of the bases or cleaving the DNA strands.

Although exposure to X-rays is infrequent, it is more difficult to avoid exposure to cigarette smoke and virtually impossible to avoid exposure to sunlight. Cigarette smoke contains carcinogens such as the aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbon benzo[a] pyrene (see Fig. 13.12). When this compound is oxidized by cellular enzymes, which normally act to make foreign compounds more water-soluble and easy to excrete, it becomes capable of forming bulky adducts with guanine residues in DNA. Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun, which also produce distortions in the DNA helix, excite adjacent pyrimidine bases on DNA strands, causing them to form covalent dimers, usually in the form of thymine dimers (Fig. 13.13).
![ma37486325cc](ma37486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 13.12 Oxidation of benzo[a]pyrene and covalent binding to DNA. Benzo[a] pyrene is not carcinogenic until it is oxidized within cells. Then, it can bind covalently to guanine residues in DNA, interrupting hydrogen bonding in G-C base pairs and producing distortions of the helix, interfering with replication of the DNA at this site.

## B. Repair Mechanisms

The mechanisms used for the repair of DNA have many similarities (Fig. 13.14). First, a distortion in the DNA helix is recognized, and the region containing the distortion is removed. The gap in the damaged strand is replaced by the action of a DNA polymerase that uses the intact, undamaged strand as a template, and synthesizes DNA in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction. Finally, a ligase seals the nick in the strand that has undergone repair. The one exception to this scheme occurs in bacteria. Bacteria can remove thymine dimers by photoactivating enzymes that cleave the bonds between the bases using energy from visible light. In this process, nucleotides are not released from the damaged DNA.

## I. Nucleotide Excision Repair

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) involves local distortions of the DNA helix, such as mismatched bases or bulky adducts (e.g., oxidized benzo[a]pyrene) (Fig. 13.15; see also Fig. 13.14). Specific repair endonucleases cleave the abnormal chain and remove the distorted region. The gap is then filled by a DNA polymerase that adds deoxyribonucleotides, one at a time, to the $3^{\prime}$-end of the cleaved DNA, using the intact complementary DNA strand as a template. The newly synthesized segment is joined to the $5^{\prime}$-end of the remainder of the original DNA strand by a DNA ligase.

## 2. Base Excision Repair

DNA glycosylases recognize small distortions in DNA involving lesions caused by damage to a single base. A glycosylase cleaves the N -glycosidic bond that joins the damaged base to deoxyribose (see Fig. 13.15). The sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA now lacks a base at this site (known as an apurinic or apyrimidinic site, or an AP site). Then, an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease cleaves
![ma38486325cc](ma38486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 13.14 Common steps in DNA repair mechanisms.
![ma39486325cc](ma39486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 13.13 A thymine dimer in a DNA strand. Ultraviolet light can cause two adjacent pyrimidines to form a covalent dimer.

Pyrimidine dimers occur frequently in the skin. Usually, repair mechanisms correct this damage and cancer rarely occurs. However, in individuals with XP, cancers are extremely common. These individuals have defects in their DNA repair systems. The first defect to be identified was a deficiency of the endonuclease involved in removal of pyrimidine dimers from DNA. Because of the inability to repair DNA, the frequency of mutation increases. A cancer develops once proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes mutate (see Chapter 18). By scrupulously avoiding sunlight, these individuals can reduce the number of skin cancers that develop.

![ma40486325cc](ma40486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE I3.I5 Types of damage and various repair mechanisms. In base excision repair, the glycosylase cleaves the glycosidic bond between the altered base (shown with an $X$ ) and ribose. In nucleotide excision repair, the entire nucleotide is removed at once. The gap formed by the incision (cut) and excision (removal) endonucleases is usually several nucleotides wider than that shown.

Spontaneous deamination occurs frequently in human DNA, and cytosine is a base that is often deaminated. How will cytosine deamination, if not repaired, lead to a mutation in the DNA?

Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (a human cancer that does not arise from intestinal polyps) is caused by mutations in genes for proteins involved in mismatch repair (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, with MLH1 and MSH2 being the genes most often mutated). The inability to repair mismatches increases the mutation frequency, resulting in cancers from mutations in growth-regulatory genes.
the sugar-phosphate strand at this site. Subsequently, the same types of enzymes involved in other types of repair mechanisms restore this region to normal.

## 3. Mismatch Repair

Mismatched bases (bases that do not form normal Watson-Crick base pairs) are recognized by enzymes of the mismatch repair system. Because neither of the bases in a mismatch is damaged, these repair enzymes must be able to determine which base of the mismatched pair to correct.

The mismatch-repair enzyme complex acts during replication when an incorrect but normal base (i.e., A, G, C, or T) is incorporated into the growing chain (Fig. 13.16). In bacteria, parental DNA strands contain methyl groups on adenine bases in specific sequences. During replication, the newly synthesized strands are not immediately methylated. Before methylation occurs, the proteins involved in mismatch repair can distinguish parental from newly synthesized strands. A region of the new, unmethylated strand, containing the mismatched base, is removed and replaced.

![ma41486325cc](ma41486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 13.16 Mismatch repair. Normal, undamaged, but mismatched bases bind proteins of the mismatch repair system. In bacteria, these proteins recognize the older, parental strand because it is methylated and replace a segment of newly synthesized (and unmethylated) DNA containing the mismatched base. The mechanism for distinguishing between parental and newly synthesized strands in humans is not as well understood.

Human enzymes also can distinguish parental from newly synthesized strands and repair mismatches. However, the mechanism for strand recognition has not yet been as clearly defined as those in bacteria. Otherwise, the process in bacteria and eukaryotes is very similar.

## 4. Transcription-Coupled Repair

Genes that are actively transcribed to produce messenger RNA (mRNA) are preferentially repaired. The RNA polymerase that is transcribing a gene (see Chapter 14 for a description of the process) stalls when it encounters a damaged region of the DNA template. Excision-repair proteins are attracted to this site and repair the damaged region, similar to the process of NER. Subsequently, RNA polymerase can resume transcription.

## IV. Genetic Rearrangements

The exchange of segments between DNA molecules occurs quite frequently and is responsible for genetic alterations that can have beneficial or devastating consequences for affected individuals and, in some instances, for their offspring. The DNA segments that are exchanged may be homologous (i.e., of very similar sequence) or they may be totally unrelated. The size of these segments can range from a few nucleotides to tens of thousands of nucleotides and can include many different genes or portions of genes. Many of the enzymes involved in these exchanges are the same as or similar to those used for replication and repair and include endonucleases, exonucleases, unwinding enzymes, topoisomerases, DNA polymerases, and ligases.

One type of genetic rearrangement that has been observed for many years is "crossing over" between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. Another type occurs in stem cells as they differentiate into lymphocytes. Segments of the genes of stem cells are rearranged so that the mature cell is capable of producing only a single type of antibody (see Figs. 16.10 and 7.19). Other types of genetic exchanges involve transposable elements (transposons) that can move from one site in the genome to another or produce copies that can be inserted into new sites. Translocations occur when chromosomes break and portions randomly become joined to other chromosomes, producing gross changes that can be observed under the light microscope. Genetic exchanges can even occur between species-for example, when foreign DNA is inserted into the human genome as a result of viral infection.

When cytosine is deaminated, uracil is produced. Uracil is not normally found in DNA and is potentially harmful because U pairs with A , forming $\mathrm{U}-\mathrm{A}$ base pairs instead of the normal C-G pairs. Therefore, if not repaired, after one round of DNA replication, one of the daughter cells will have a U-A base pair in this position instead of the normal C-G base pair. To prevent this change from occurring, a uracil N -glycosylase removes uracil, and it is replaced by a cytosine via base excision repair.

![ma42486325cc](ma42486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 13.17 Key steps in homologous recombination. D loop, displacement loop.

## A. General or Homologous Recombination

Various models, supported by experimental evidence, have been proposed for the mechanism of recombination between homologous DNA sequences. Although these mechanisms are complex, a simplified scheme for one type of recombination is presented in Figure 13.17.

Initially, two homologous chromosomes or segments of double-helical (duplex) DNA that have very similar, but not necessarily identical, sequences become aligned (see Fig. 13.17). One strand of one duplex is nicked by an enzyme and invades the other DNA duplex, base-pairing with a region of complementary sequence. The match between the sequences does not have to be perfect, but a significant number of bases must pair so that the strand displaced from its partner can form a displacement loop (D loop). This D loop is nicked, and the displaced strand now base-pairs with the former partner of the invading strand. Ligation occurs, and a Holliday structure is generated (see Fig. 13.17). The branch point of the Holliday structure can migrate and may move many thousands of nucleotides from its original position. The Holliday structure, named for the scientist who discovered it, is finally cleaved and then re-ligated, forming two chromosomes that have exchanged segments. In addition to enzymes similar to those used in DNA replication, enzymes for strand invasion, branch migration, and cleavage of the Holliday structure are required. Homologous recombination also is an important component of repairing double-strand breaks in DNA.

## B. Translocations

Breaks in chromosomes, caused by agents such as X-rays or chemical carcinogens, can result in gross chromosomal rearrangements (Fig. 13.18). If the free ends of the DNA at the break point reseal with the free ends of a different broken chromosome, a translocation is produced. These exchanges of large portions of chromosomes can have deleterious effects and are observed frequently in cancer cells.
![ma43486325cc](ma43486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 13.18 A chromosomal translocation. A portion of the long arm of chromosome 8 is exchanged for a portion of the long arm of chromosome 14. This chromosomal translocation occurs in Burkitt lymphoma.

## C. Transposable Elements

Movable (or transposable) genetic elements, "jumping genes," were first observed by Barbara McClintock in the 1940s. Her work, initially greeted with skepticism, was ultimately accepted, and she was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1983.

Transposons are segments of DNA that can move from their original position in the genome to a new location (Fig. 13.19). They are found in all organisms. Transposons contain the gene for an enzyme called a transposase, which is involved in cleaving the transposon from the genome and moving it from one location to another.

Retroposons are similar to transposons except that they involve an RNA molecule. Reverse transcriptase (see below) makes a single-stranded DNA copy of the RNA which is converted to a double-stranded DNA. The double-stranded DNA is then inserted into the genome at multiple locations, forming a repetitive element in the DNA.

## V. Reverse Transcriptase

Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that uses a single-stranded RNA template and makes a DNA copy (Fig. 13.20). The RNA template can be transcribed from DNA by RNA polymerase or obtained from another source such as an RNA virus. The DNA copy of the RNA produced by reverse transcriptase is known as complementary DNA (because it is complementary to the RNA template) or cDNA. Retroviruses (RNA viruses) contain a reverse transcriptase, which copies the viral RNA genome. A double-stranded cDNA is produced, which can become integrated into the human genome (see Fig. 12.19). After integration, the viral genes may be inactive, or they may be transcribed, sometimes causing diseases such as AIDS or cancer (see Chapter 18). The integration event may also disrupt an adjacent cellular gene, which also may lead to disease (see Chapter 18).
![ma44486325cc](ma44486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 13.20 Action of reverse transcriptase. This enzyme catalyzes the production of a DNA copy (cDNA) from an RNA template. The RNA of a DNA-RNA hybrid is degraded by an associated activity of reverse transcriptase (designated as RNase H ), and the single DNA strand is used as a template to make double-stranded DNA. This figure is a simplified version of a more complex process.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

Isabel S. Isabel S. contracted HIV when she used needles contaminated with HIV to inject drugs intravenously. Intravenous drug users account for about $10 \%$ of newly diagnosed HIV cases in the United States. HIV mutates rapidly, and therefore, current treatment involves a combination of drugs that affect different aspects of its life cycle (designated HAART, for highly active antiretroviral therapy). This multidrug therapy lowers the viral titer (the number of viral particles found in a given volume of blood), sometimes to undetectable levels. However, if treatment is not followed carefully (i.e., if the patient is not "compliant"), the titer increases rapidly. Therefore, Isabel's physician emphasized that she must carefully follow her drug regimen and worked with her to ensure that she was able to take all her medications.

Dianne A. Dianne A.'s poorly controlled diabetes mellitus predisposed her to a urinary tract infection because glucose in the urine serves as a "culture medium" for bacterial growth. The kidney glomerulotubular unit reabsorbs filtered glucose so that, normally, the urine is glucose-free. However, when serum blood glucose levels exceed 175 to $185 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (the tubular threshold for glucose), the capacity for reabsorption is exceeded. In Ms. A.'s case, blood glucose levels frequently exceed this threshold.

Calvin A. The average person has about 30 moles on the body surface, yet only about 20 people out of every 100,000 develop a malignant melanoma. The incidence of malignant melanoma, however, is rising rapidly. Because about $10 \%$ of patients with malignant melanoma die as a result of this cancer, the physician's decision to biopsy a pigmented mole with an irregular border and variation of color probably saved Calvin's life.

Michael T. Lung cancer currently accounts for about $15 \%$ of all cancers in men and women. The overall 5-year survival rate is approximately $15 \%$. Thankfully, cigarette smoking has declined in the United States. Whereas $50 \%$ of men and $32 \%$ of women smoked in 1965, these figures have, in 2014, fallen to $18.8 \%$ and $14.8 \%$, respectively.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

DNA Repair and Disease. DNA serves a unique role within a cell in that it produces the blueprint for gene expression throughout the lifetime of the cell. However, DNA is present in limited copies within cells (unlike RNA and proteins), and various agents of ten compromise its structural integrity. The DNA, then, must be continually monitored for damage; when damage is found, repair mechanisms are required to restore the DNA to its original structure. If the integrity of the DNA cannot be maintained, deleterious mutations may accumulate in the genome, ultimately having a negative impact on the person as a whole. Failures in DNA repair mechanisms will lead to disease, as indicated by the examples below.

DNA can undergo various types of damage within the cells aqueous environment. DNA undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis of the N -glycosidic bonds, generating apurinic or apyrimidinic sites within the DNA. Failure to repair these sites (via base excision repair) will lead to changes in nucleotide sequence of the DNA. DNA, when exposed to UV light rapidly forms thymine dimers, which will interfere with DNA replication unless repaired. DNA exposure to X-rays or ionizing radiation will lead to single-strand or double-strand breaks within the DNA. Failure to repair these breaks will lead to replicative errors. The DNA is also exposed to environmental toxins, leading to chemically modified bases, which need to be repaired before DNA replication occurs; otherwise, the risk of inappropriate base-pairing during replication is greatly increased.

DNA repair disorders, caused by mutations in single genes, often give rise to a cell that actively accumulates mutations and can eventually turn into a cancer cell (see Chapter 18). A common theme in DNA repair enzyme mutations is the clinical display of cancer. It is important to note that the mutations themselves do not directly lead to cancer; rather, successive cell generations, each with accumulated mutations caused by DNA repair defects, will eventually acquire a mutation that leads to growth advantages and cancer. Distinct examples of such diseases are described in the following paragraph.

The first example is the mutations that give rise to XP. XP is primarily a defect in NER (see Fig. 13.15). There are at least 13 genes responsible for XP and its variants, all of which are involved in NER and/or transcription-coupled repair. The disorder is seen clinically as sun hypersensitivity resulting in skin abnormalities. It leads to a significantly greater risk of developing skin cancer, in particular at a younger age than in the general population. This results from an inability to remove UV-induced thymine dimers in the DNA, leading to mismatches being created during DNA replication through the thymine dimer.

Mutations in proteins specifically responsible for transcription-coupled repair lead to Cockayne syndrome, which presents clinically as premature aging. Cells with these mutations cannot transcribe damaged genes. If the DNA cannot be repaired because of the defect in transcription-coupled repair, premature cell death can result from the reduction of gene expression. There are also specific mutations within the XP constellation of genes that give rise to a phenotype that reflects traits of both XP and Cockayne syndrome, indicating that there are commonalities in symptoms when either NER or transcription-coupled repair is defective.

Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) is caused by mutations in enzymes present in intestinal epithelial cells that are responsible for mismatch repair. The inability to repair mismatches will eventually lead to a series of mutations within the cells, leading to colon cancer (most commonly right-sided). This disorder is inherited, and the affected individuals have an increased risk of several cancers, with colorectal cancer being the most common. In addition, they have an early age of onset of the cancers as compared to the general population.

Hereditary breast cancer (BRCA1 and BRCA2) results from the inheritance of mutations in proteins responsible for the DNA repair of single-strand and doublestrand breaks. Inheritance of mutations in these genes will predispose the patients to an earlier age of onset of the disorder. The roles of BRCA1 and BRCA2 will be discussed further in Chapter 18.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Replication of the genome requires DNA synthesis.
- During replication, each of the two parental strands of DNA serves as a template for the synthesis of a complementary strand.
- The site at which replication is occurring is called the replication fork.
- Helicases and topoisomerases are required to unwind the DNA helix of the parental strands.
- DNA polymerase is the major enzyme involved in replication.
- DNA polymerase copies each parental template strand in the $3^{\prime}$-to- $5^{\prime}$ direction, producing new strands in a $5^{\prime}$-to- $3^{\prime}$ direction.
- The precursors for replication are deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates.
- As DNA synthesis proceeds in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction, one parental strand is synthesized continuously, whereas the other exhibits discontinuous synthesis, creating small fragments named Okazaki fragments which are subsequently joined. This is necessary because DNA polymerase can only synthesize DNA in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction.

- DNA polymerase requires a free $3^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group of a nucleotide primer in order to replicate DNA. The primer is synthesized by the enzyme primase, which provides an RNA primer.
- The enzyme telomerase synthesizes the replication of the ends of linear chromosomes (telomeres).
- Errors during replication can lead to mutations, so error checking and repair systems function to maintain the integrity of the genome.
- Table 13.4 summarizes the diseases discussed in this chapter.

B. Inability to excise a section of the UV-damaged DNA
C. Mutation of one of the mismatch repair components
D. Inability to synthesize DNA across the damaged region
E. Loss of proofreading capacity

1. The answer is E. Helicases and topoisomerases unwind the parental strands. DNA polymerases copy each parental template in the $3^{\prime}$-to-5' direction, producing new strands in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction. One strand of newly synthesized DNA grows continuously, but the other strand is synthesized discontinuously in short segments knows as Okazaki fragments. These fragments are subsequently joined by DNA ligase. Targeting a single enzyme with a drug is more likely to succeed than inhibiting an entire family of enzymes.
2. The answer is E. DNA polymerases catalyze the synthesis of DNA but cannot initiate the synthesis of new strands de novo, because a short primer first must be synthesized by DNA primase (a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase). Phosphodiester bonds, which link the backbone, are covalent bonds and are not formed from hydrogen bonds. During the course of adding a nucleotide to an existing DNA chain, pyrophosphate is released, and its subsequent hydrolysis (pyrophosphate contains a high-energy bond) by the enzyme pyrophosphatase (not DNA polymerase) provides the energy that drives the polymerization reactions. DNA polymerases exhibit processivity, in which the enzyme remains bound to the parental template strand as the enzyme creates new phosphodiester bonds while reading the template. The enzyme does not dissociate and reassociate after each nucleotide is added to the existing DNA strand. DNA polymerases copy a template in the $3^{\prime}$-to-5' direction, producing new strands in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction.
3. The answer is C. Mitochondria in human cells are very similar to bacteria and are theorized to have arisen from bacteria that developed a symbiotic relationship with the host cell. Polymerase $\gamma$ is located in mitochondria and replicates the DNA of this organelle. Polymerases $\delta$ and $\varepsilon$ are the major replicative enzymes in the eukaryotic nucleus. Polymerase $\alpha$ is involved in DNA repair. Polymerase $\beta$ participates in base excision repair.
4. The answer is B. Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear, and the ends of the chromosomes are called telomeres. Bacteria have circular DNA and therefore have no telomeres. Telomeres in humans consist of a repeating sequence of TTAGGG. The newly synthesized DNA strand, before telomerase action, is shorter at the $5^{\prime}$-end so that the strand being replicated has an overhang at the $3^{\prime}$-end. Somatic cells have telomeres, but as they age, their expression of telomerase decreases, so the cells only survive for a fixed number of population doublings.
5. The answer is C. Proofreading, an inherent property of most DNA polymerase owing to its $3^{\prime}$ exonuclease activity, eliminates base-pairing errors as they occur during replication, but proofreading does not eliminate all errors made by DNA polymerase. Postreplication error
repair systems replace mismatched bases that are missed by proofreading. Genes that produce mRNA contain a unique transcription-coupled repair system (repair occurs as the genes are transcribed). Nucleotide excision repair involves local distortion of the DNA helix, such as in bulky adducts, whereas DNA glycosylases recognize damage to a single base.
6. The answer is E. Translocations can occur in both somatic and stem cells. Translocations occur frequently and can be either beneficial or devastating. Some translocations can lead to developmental delay, and some can lead to a higher risk of developing cancer, but they also can be beneficial or have no discernable effect. Translocation consists of a portion of one chromosome being exchanged for a portion of another chromosome. Reverse transcriptase is found in RNA viruses and has no role in human translocation.
7. The answer is B. A DNA polymerase's $3^{\prime}$-to-5' exonuclease activity is required for proofreading (check the base just inserted, and if it is incorrect, remove it), and reverse transcriptase does not have this activity, whereas Pol $\delta$ does. Both reverse transcriptase and Pol $\delta$ synthesize DNA in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' directions (all DNA polymerases do this), and both follow standard Watson-Crick base-pairing rules (A with T or $\mathrm{U}, \mathrm{G}$ with C ). Neither polymerase can synthesize DNA in the wrong direction ( $3^{\prime}$-to-5') or insert inosine into a growing DNA chain. Thus, the only difference between the two polymerases is answer B. Pol $\delta$ is used primarily for lagging-strand synthesis during DNA replication, although it also has repair functions.
8. The answer is D. In 50 seconds, each replication origin will have synthesized 100 kb of DNA ( 50 in each direction). Because there are 10 origins, $10 \times 100$ will yield the $1,000 \mathrm{~kb}$ needed to replicate the DNA. The first origin will be 50 kb from one end, and the remaining 9 origins will each be 100 kb apart.
9. The answer is E. The role of the primer is to provide a free $3^{\prime}-\mathrm{OH}$ group for DNA polymerase to add the next nucleotide and form a phosphodiester bond. When DNA repair occurs, one of the remaining bases in the DNA will have a free $3^{\prime}-\mathrm{OH}$, which repair DNA polymerases (such as DNA pol I in bacteria) will use to begin extension of the DNA.
10. The answer is B. XP is a set of diseases all related to an inability to repair thymine dimers, leading to an inability to excise UV-damaged DNA. It does not affect bypass polymerases, which can synthesize across the damaged region, sometimes making mutations in its path. The primase gene, or mismatch repair, is not involved in excising thymine dimers. Proofreading ability of DNA polymerases is likewise not involved in this process.

# Transcription: Synthesis of RNA 

Synthesis of RNA from a DNA template is called transcription. Genes are transcribed by enzymes called RNA polymerases that generate a single-stranded RNA identical in sequence (with the exception of $U$ in place of $T$ ) to one of the strands of the double-stranded DNA. The DNA strand that directs the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA by complementary base pairing is the template strand. The RNA strand that is initially generated is the primary transcript. The DNA template is copied in the 3'-to-5' direction, and the RNA transcript is synthesized in the 5'-to-3' direction. RNA polymerases differ from DNA polymerases in that they can initiate the synthesis of new strands in the absence of a primer.

In addition to catalyzing the polymerization of ribonucleotides, RNA polymerases must be able to recognize the appropriate gene to transcribe, the appropriate strand of the double-stranded DNA to copy, and the start point of transcription (Fig. 14.1). Specific sequences on DNA, called promoters, determine where the RNA polymerase binds and how frequently it initiates transcription. Other regulatory sequences, such as promoter-proximal elements and enhancers, also affect the frequency of transcription.

In bacteria, a single RNA polymerase produces the primary transcript precursors for all three major classes of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA). Because bacteria do not contain nuclei, ribosomes bind to mRNA as it is being transcribed, and protein synthesis occurs simultaneously with transcription.

Eukaryotic genes are transcribed in the nucleus by three different RNA polymerases, each principally responsible for one of the major classes of RNA. The primary transcripts are modified and trimmed to produce the mature RNAs. The precursors of mRNA (called pre-mRNA) have a guanosine "cap" added at the 5'-end and a poly(A) "tail" at the 3'-end. Exons, which contain the coding sequences for the proteins, are separated in pre-mRNA by introns, regions that have no coding function. During splicing reactions, introns are removed and the exons connected to form the mature mRNA. In eukaryotes, tRNA and rRNA precursors are also modified and trimmed, although not as extensively as pre-mRNA.

FIGURE 14.1 Regions of a gene. A gene is a segment of DNA that functions as a unit to generate an RNA product or, through the processes of transcription and translation, a polypeptide chain. The transcribed region of a gene contains the template for synthesis of an RNA, which begins at the start point. A gene also includes regions of DNA that regulate production of the encoded product, such as a promoter region. In a structural gene, the transcribed region contains the coding sequences that dictate the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide chain.

The thalassemias are a heterogenous group of hereditary anemias that constitute the most common gene disorder in the world, with a carrier rate of almost 7\%. The disease was first discovered in countries around the Mediterranean Sea and was named for the Greek word thalassa, meaning "sea." However, it is also present in areas extending into India and China that are near the equator.

The thalassemia syndromes are caused by mutations that decrease or abolish the synthesis of the $\alpha$ - or $\beta$-chains in the adult hemoglobin A tetramer. Individual syndromes are named according to the chain whose synthesis is affected and the severity of the deficiency. Thus, in $\beta^{0}$-thalassemia, the superscript 0 denotes that none of the $\beta$-chain is present; in $\beta^{+}$-thalassemia, the plus sign denotes a partial reduction in the synthesis of the $\beta$-chain. More than 170 different mutations have been identified that cause $\beta$-thalassemia; most of these interfere with the transcription of $\beta$-globin mRNA or its processing or translation.

The measurement of hemoglobin levels in blood is important for the appropriate diagnosis of many diseases such as anemia. Laboratories measure hemoglobin content by first exposing the sample (usually lysed blood cells to release the hemoglobin from the red blood cells) to an oxidizing agent, which converts the ferrous iron in hemoglobin to its ferric state. The level of ferric iron is then determined with a second reagent (either a cyanide or azide derivative), which reacts with the ferric iron and generates a colored product whose concentration can be determined spectrophotometrically.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Lisa N. is a 4-year-old girl of Mediterranean ancestry whose height and body weight are below the 20th percentile for girls of her age. She tires easily and complains of loss of appetite and shortness of breath on exertion. A dull pain has been present in her right upper quadrant for the last 3 months and she appears pale. Initial laboratory studies indicate a severe anemia (decreased red blood cell count) with a hemoglobin of $7.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range $=12$ to $16 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). A battery of additional hematologic tests reveals that Lisa has $\beta^{+}$-thalassemia, intermediate type.

Isabel S., a patient with HIV (see Chapters 12 and 13), has developed a cough that produces a gray, slightly blood-tinged sputum. A chest X-ray indicates a cavitary infiltrate in the right upper lung field. A stain of sputum shows the presence of acid-fast bacilli, suggesting a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

$\square$Catherine T. picked mushrooms in a wooded area near her home. A few hours after eating one small mushroom, she experienced mild nausea and diarrhea. She brought a mushroom with her to the hospital emergency department. A poison expert identified it as Amanita phalloides (the "death cap"). These mushrooms contain the toxin $\alpha$-amanitin.

Sarah L., a 28-year-old computer programmer, notes increasing fatigue, pleuritic chest pain, and a nonproductive cough. In addition, she complains of joint pains, especially in her hands. A rash on both cheeks and the bridge of her nose ("butterfly rash") has been present for the last 6 months. Initial laboratory studies reveal a subnormal white blood cell count and a mild reduction in hemoglobin. Tests result in a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (frequently called lupus).

## I. Action of RNA Polymerase

Transcription, the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template, is carried out by RNA polymerases (Fig. 14.2). Like DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases catalyze the formation of ester bonds between nucleotides that base-pair with the complementary nucleotides on the DNA template. Unlike DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases can initiate the synthesis of new chains in the absence of primers. They also lack the $3^{\prime}$-to-5' exonuclease activity found in DNA polymerases, although they do perform rudimentary error-checking through a different mechanism. A strand of DNA serves as the template for RNA synthesis and is copied in the $3^{\prime}$-to-5' direction. Synthesis of the new RNA molecule occurs in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction. The ribonucleoside triphosphates adenosine triphosphate (ATP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP), cytidine triphosphate (CTP), and uridine triphosphate (UTP) serve as the precursors. Each nucleotide base sequentially pairs with the complementary deoxyribonucleotide base on the DNA template (A, G, C, and U pair with T, C, G, and A, respectively). The polymerase forms an ester bond between the $\alpha$-phosphate on the ribose $5^{\prime}$-hydroxyl of the nucleotide precursor and the ribose $3^{\prime}$-hydroxyl at the end of the growing RNA chain. The cleavage of a high-energy phosphate bond in the nucleotide triphosphate and release of pyrophosphate (from the $\beta$ - and $\gamma$-phosphates) provide the energy for this polymerization reaction. Subsequent cleavage of the pyrophosphate by a pyrophosphatase also helps to drive the polymerization reaction forward by removing a product. The overall error rate of RNA polymerase is 1 in 100,000 bases.

RNA polymerases must be able to recognize the start point for transcription of each gene and the appropriate strand of DNA to use as a template. They also must be sensitive to signals that reflect the need for the gene product and control the frequency of transcription. A region of regulatory sequences called the promoter

FIGURE 14.2 RNA synthesis. The $\alpha$-phosphate from the added nucleotide connects the ribosyl groups.
(often composed of smaller sequences called boxes or elements), usually contiguous with the transcribed region, controls the binding of RNA polymerase to DNA and identifies the start point (see Fig. 14.1). The frequency of transcription is controlled by regulatory sequences within the promoter and nearby the promoter (promoterproximal elements) and by other regulatory sequences, such as enhancers (also called distal-promoter elements), that may be located at considerable distancessometimes thousands of nucleotides-from the start point. Both the promoterproximal elements and the enhancers interact with proteins that stabilize RNA polymerase binding to the promoter.

## II. Types of RNA Polymerases

Bacterial cells have a single RNA polymerase that transcribes DNA to generate all of the different types of RNA (mRNA, rRNAs, and tRNA. The RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli contains five subunits ( $2 \alpha, \beta, \beta^{\prime}$, and $\omega$ ), which form the core enzyme. Another protein called a $\sigma$ (sigma) factor binds the core enzyme and directs binding of RNA polymerase to specific promoter regions of the DNA template. The $\sigma$ factor dissociates shortly after transcription begins. E. coli has several different $\sigma$ factors that recognize the promoter regions of different groups of genes. The major $\sigma$ factor is $\sigma^{70}$, a designation related to its molecular weight of $70,000 \mathrm{Da}$.

In contrast to prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells have three RNA polymerases (Table 14.1). Polymerase I produces most of the rRNAs, polymerase II produces mRNA and microRNAs (microRNAs regulate gene expression and are discussed in more detail in Chapter 16), and polymerase III produces small RNAs, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA. All of these RNA polymerases have the same mechanism of action. However, they recognize different types of promoters.

0Patients with AIDS frequently develop tuberculosis. After Isabel 5.'s sputum stain suggested that she had tuberculosis, a multidrug antituberculous regimen, which includes an antibiotic of the rifamycin family (rifampin), was begun. A culture of her sputum was done to confirm the diagnosis.

Rifampin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase, selectively killing the bacteria that cause the infection. The nuclear RNA polymerase from eukaryotic cells is not affected. Although rifampin can inhibit the synthesis of mitochondrial RNA, the concentration required is considerably higher than that used for treatment of tuberculosis.

Why is it important for RNA polymerase to distinguish between the two DNA strands at the promoter?

## A. Sequences of Genes

Double-stranded DNA consists of a coding strand and a template strand (Fig. 14.3). The DNA template strand is the strand that is used by RNA polymerase during the process of transcription. It is complementary and antiparallel both to the coding (nontemplate) strand of the DNA and to the RNA transcript produced from the template. Thus, the coding strand of the DNA is identical in base sequence and direction to the RNA transcript except, of course, that wherever this DNA strand contains a T, the RNA transcript contains a U. By convention, the nucleotide sequence of a gene is represented by the letters of the nitrogenous bases of the coding strand of the DNA duplex. It is written from left to right in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction.

During translation, mRNA is read $5^{\prime}$-to-3' in sets of three bases, called codons, that determine the amino acid sequence of the protein (see Fig. 14.3) Thus, the base sequence of the coding strand of the DNA can be used to determine the amino acid sequence of the protein. For this reason, when gene sequences are given, they refer to the coding strand.

A gene consists of the transcribed region and the regions that regulate transcription of the gene (e.g., promoter and enhancer regions) (Fig. 14.4). The base in the coding strand of the gene serving as the start point for transcription is numbered +1 . This nucleotide corresponds to the first nucleotide incorporated into the RNA at the $5^{\prime}$-end of the transcript. Subsequent nucleotides within the transcribed region of the gene are numbered $+2,+3$, and so on, toward the $3^{\prime}$-end of the gene. Untranscribed sequences to the left of the start point, known as the $5^{\prime}$-flanking region of the gene, are numbered $-1,-2,-3$, and so on, starting with the nucleotide $(-1)$ immediately to the left of the start point $(+1)$ and moving from right to left. By analogy to a river, the sequences to the left of the start point are said to be upstream from the start point and those to the right are said to be downstream.

## B. Recognition of Genes by RNA Polymerase

For genes to be expressed, RNA polymerase must recognize the appropriate point at which to start transcription and the strand of the DNA to transcribe (the template strand). RNA polymerase also must recognize which genes to transcribe because transcribed genes are only a small fraction of the total DNA. The genes that are

FIGURE 14.3 Relationship between the coding strand of DNA (also known as the sense strand, or the nontemplate strand), the DNA template strand (also known as the antisense strand), the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript, and the protein produced from the gene. The bases in mRNA are used in sets of three (called codons) to specify the order of the amino acids inserted into the growing polypeptide chain during the process of translation (see Chapter 15).

![ma48486325cc](ma48486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 14.4 A schematic view of a eukaryotic gene, and steps required to produce a protein product. The gene consists of promoter and transcribed regions. The transcribed region contains introns, which do not contain coding sequences for proteins, and exons, which do carry coding sequences for proteins. The first RNA form produced is heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA), which contains both intronic and exonic sequences. The hnRNA is modified such that a cap is added at the 5 '-end (cap site) and a poly(A) tail is added to the 3 '-end. The introns are removed (a process called splicing) to produce the mature messenger RNA (mRNA), which leaves the nucleus to direct protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. $P y$ is pyrimidine ( C or T ). Although the TATA box is still included in this figure for historical reasons, only $12.5 \%$ of eukaryotic promoters contain this sequence.
transcribed differ from one type of cell to another and change with alterations in physiologic conditions. These signals in DNA that RNA polymerase recognizes are called promoters. Promoters are sequences in DNA (often composed of smaller sequences called boxes or elements) that determine the start point and the frequency of transcription. Because they are located on the same molecule of DNA and near the gene they regulate, they are said to be cis-acting (i.e., cis refers to acting on the same side). Proteins that bind to these DNA sequences and facilitate or prevent the binding of RNA polymerase are said to be trans-acting.

# C. Promoter Regions of Genes for mRNA 

The binding of RNA polymerase and the subsequent initiation of gene transcription involves several consensus sequences in the promoter regions of the gene (Fig. 14.5). A consensus sequence is the sequence that is most commonly found in a given region when many genes are examined. In prokaryotes, an adenine- and thymine-rich consensus sequence in the promoter determines the start point of transcription by binding proteins that facilitate the binding of RNA polymerase. In the prokaryote E. coli, this consensus sequence is TATAAT, which is known as the TATA or Pribnow box. It is centered about -10 and is recognized by the sigma factor $\sigma^{70}$. A similar sequence in the -25 region of about $12.5 \%$ of eukaryotic genes has a consensus sequence of TATA(A/T)A. (The [A/T] in the fifth position indicates that either A or T occurs with equal frequency.) This eukaryotic sequence is also known as a TATA box, but it is sometimes named the Hogness or Hogness-Goldberg box after its discoverers. Other consensus sequences involved in binding of RNA polymerase are found farther upstream in the promoter region (see Fig. 14.5) or downstream after the transcriptional start signal. Bacterial promoters contain a sequence of TTGACA in the -35 region. Eukaryotes frequently have disparate sequences, such as the $\mathrm{TF}_{0} \mathrm{~B}$-recognition element (a GC-rich sequence, abbreviated as BRE), the initiator element, the downstream promoter element (DPE), and the motif ten element (MTE). The DPE and MTE are found downstream from the transcription start site. Eukaryotic genes also contain promoter-proximal elements (in the region of -100 to -200 ), which are sites that bind other gene regulatory proteins. Genes vary

The two strands of DNA are antiparallel, with complementary nucleotides at each position. Because RNA synthesis always occurs in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction, each strand would produce a different mRNA, resulting in different codons for amino acids and a different protein product. Therefore, it is critical that RNA polymerase transcribe the correct strand.

![ma49486325cc](ma49486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 14.5 Prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters. The promoter-proximal region contains binding sites for transcription factors that can accelerate the rate at which RNA polymerase binds to the promoter. $B R E, T F_{0} B$ recognition element; $M T E$, motif ten element; $D P E$, downstream promoter element; Pu, purine; Py, pyrimidine.

(2)Lia N. has a $\beta^{+}$-thalassemia classified clinically as $\beta$-thalassemia intermedia. She produces an intermediate amount of functional $\beta$-globin chains (her hemoglobin is $7.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$; normal is 12 to $16 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). $\beta$-Thalassemia intermedia is usually the result of two different mutations (one that mildly affects the rate of synthesis of $\beta$-globin and one severely affecting its rate of synthesis); or, less frequently, homozygosity for a mild mutation in the rate of synthesis; or a complex combination of mutations. For example, mutations within the promoter region of the $\beta$-globin gene could result in a significantly decreased rate of $\beta$-globin synthesis in an individual who is homozygous for the allele, without completely abolishing synthesis of the protein.

Two of the point mutations that result in a $\beta^{+}$-phenotype are within the TATA box ( $\mathrm{A} \rightarrow \mathrm{G}$ or $A \rightarrow C$ in the -28 to -31 region) for the $\beta$-globin gene. These mutations reduce the accuracy of the start point of transcription so that only $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of the normal amount of $\beta$-globin is synthesized. Other mutations that also reduce the frequency of $\beta$-globin transcription have been observed farther upstream in the promoter region ( $-87 \mathrm{C} \rightarrow \mathrm{G}$ and $-88 \mathrm{C} \rightarrow \mathrm{T}$ ).

What property of an AT-rich region of a DNA double helix makes it suitable to serve as a recognition site for the start point of transcription?
in the number of such sequences present. An analysis of nearly 10,000 promoter sequences indicated that the initiator element was the most common element in these promoters ( $\sim 50 \%$ ), whereas BRE and DPE were present in about $15 \%$ of the promoters, and TATA, the least abundant, at $12.5 \%$ of the promoters.

In bacteria, several protein-producing genes may be linked together and controlled by a single promoter. This genetic unit is called an operon (Fig. 14.6). One mRNA is produced that contains the coding information for all of the proteins encoded by the operon. Proteins bind to the promoter and either inhibit or facilitate transcription of the operon. Repressors are proteins that bind to a region in the promoter known as the operator and inhibit transcription by preventing the binding of RNA polymerase to DNA. Activators are proteins that stimulate transcription by binding within the -35 region or upstream from it, facilitating the binding of RNA polymerase. (Operons are described in more detail in Chapter 16.)

FIGURE 14.7 Transcription apparatus. The TATA-binding protein (TBP), a component of $\mathrm{TF}_{II} \mathrm{D}$, binds to the TATA box. Transcription factors $\mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{~A}$ and -B bind to TBP. RNA polymerase binds, and then $\mathrm{TF}_{II} \mathrm{E},-F$, and -H bind. This complex can transcribe at a basal level. Some coactivator proteins are present as a component of $\mathrm{TF}_{1} \mathrm{D}$, and these can bind to other regulatory DNA-binding proteins (called specific transcription factors or transcriptional activators). $\mathrm{TF}_{1} \mathrm{D}$ also recognizes the initiator element and the downstream promoter element in the case of TATA-less promoters (see Fig. 14.5).

In eukaryotes, proteins known as general transcription factors (or basal factors) bind to the TATA box (or other promoter elements, in the case of TATA-less promoters) and facilitate the binding of RNA polymerase II, the polymerase that transcribes mRNA (Fig. 14.7). This binding process involves at least six basal transcription factors (labeled as $\mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{~S}$, transcription factors for RNA polymerase II). The TATA-binding protein (TBP), which is a component of $\mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{D}$, initially binds to the TATA box. $\mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{D}$ consists of both the TBP and several transcriptional coactivators. Components of $\mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{D}$ will also recognize initiator and DPE boxes in the absence of a TATA box. $\mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{~A}$ and $\mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{~B}$ interact with TBP. RNA polymerase II binds to the complex of transcription factors and to DNA and is aligned at the start point for transcription. $\mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{E}, \mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{~F}$, and $\mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{H}$ subsequently bind, cleaving ATP, and transcription of the gene is initiated.

With only these transcription (or basal) factors and RNA polymerase II attached (the basal transcription complex), the gene is transcribed at a low or basal rate. $\mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{H}$ plays several roles in both transcription and DNA repair. In both processes, it acts as an ATP-dependent DNA helicase, unwinding DNA for either transcription or repair to occur. Two of the forms of xeroderma pigmentosum (XPB and XPD; see Chapter 13) arise from mutations within two different helicase subunits of $\mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{H}$. $\mathrm{TF}_{11} \mathrm{H}$ also contains a kinase activity, and RNA polymerase II is phosphorylated by this factor during certain phases of transcription.

The rate of transcription can be further increased by binding of other regulatory DNA-binding proteins to additional gene regulatory sequences (such as the promoter-proximal or enhancer regions). These regulatory DNA-binding proteins are called gene-specific transcription factors (or transactivators) because they are specific to the gene involved (see Chapter 16). They interact with coactivators in the basal transcription complex. These are depicted in Figure 14.7 under the general term coactivators. Coactivators consist of transcription-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with transcription factors through an activation domain on the transcription factor (which is bound to DNA). The TAFs interact with other factors (described as the mediator proteins), which in turn interact with the RNA polymerase complex. These interactions are further discussed in Chapter 16.

# III. Transcription of Bacterial Genes 

In bacteria, binding of RNA polymerase with a $\sigma$ factor to the promoter region of DNA causes the two DNA strands to unwind and separate within a region

$\Delta$In regions where DNA is being transcribed, the two strands of the DNA must be separated. AT base pairs in DNA are joined by only two hydrogen bonds, whereas GC pairs have three hydrogen bonds. Therefore, in AT-rich regions of DNA, the two strands can be separated more readily than in regions that contain GC base pairs.

FIGURE 14.8 An overview of transcription at the site of RNA synthesis.
approximately 10 to 20 nucleotides in length. As the polymerase transcribes the DNA, the untranscribed region of the helix continues to separate, whereas the transcribed region of the DNA template rejoins its DNA partner (Fig. 14.8). The $\sigma$ factor is released when the growing RNA chain is approximately 10 nucleotides long. The elongation reactions continue until the RNA polymerase encounters a transcription termination signal. One type of termination signal involves the formation of a hairpin loop in the transcript, preceding several $U$ residues. The second type of mechanism for termination involves the binding of a protein, the rho factor, which causes release of the RNA transcript from the template in an energy-requiring mechanism. The signal for both termination processes is the sequence of bases in the newly synthesized RNA.

A cistron is a region of DNA that encodes a single polypeptide chain. In bacteria, mRNA is usually generated from an operon as a polycistronic transcript (one that contains the information to produce several different proteins). Because bacteria do not contain a nucleus, the polycistronic transcript is translated as it is being transcribed. This process is known as coupled transcription translation. This transcript is not modified and trimmed, and it does not contain introns (regions within the coding sequence of a transcript that are removed before translation occurs). Several different proteins are produced during translation of the polycistronic transcript, one from each cistron (see Fig. 14.6).

In prokaryotes, rRNA is produced as a single long transcript that is cleaved to produce the $16 \mathrm{~S}, 23 \mathrm{~S}$, and 5 S rRNAs. tRNA is also cleaved from larger transcripts (Fig. 14.9). One of the cleavage enzymes, RNase P, is a protein containing an RNA molecule. This RNA actually catalyzes the cleavage reaction.

FIGURE 14.9 Bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) transcripts. One large precursor is cleaved (at arrows) to produce 16S, 23S, and 5S rRNA and some tRNAs.

## IV. Transcription of Eukaryotic Genes

The process of transcription in eukaryotes is similar to that in prokaryotes. RNA polymerase binds to the transcription factor complex in the promoter region and to the DNA, the helix unwinds within a region near the start point of transcription, DNA strand separation occurs, synthesis of the RNA transcript is initiated, and the RNA transcript is elongated, copying the DNA template. The DNA strands separate as the polymerase approaches and rejoin as the polymerase passes.

One of the major differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is that eukaryotes have more elaborate mechanisms for processing the transcripts, particularly the precursors of mRNA (pre-mRNA). Eukaryotes also have three polymerases rather than just the one present in prokaryotes. Other differences include the facts that (1) eukaryotic mRNA usually contains the coding information for only one polypeptide chain and (2) eukaryotic RNA is transcribed in the nucleus and migrates to the cytoplasm where translation occurs. Thus, coupled transcription translation does not occur in eukaryotes.

## A. Synthesis of Eukaryotic mRNA

In eukaryotes, extensive processing of the primary transcript occurs before the mature mRNA is formed and can migrate to the cytosol where it is translated into a protein product. RNA polymerase II synthesizes a large primary transcript from the template strand that is capped at the $5^{\prime}$-end as it is transcribed (Fig. 14.10). The transcript also rapidly acquires a poly(A) tail at the $3^{\prime}$-end. Pre-mRNAs thus contain untranslated regions at both the $5^{\prime}$ - and $3^{\prime}$-ends (the leader and trailing sequences, respectively). These untranslated regions are retained in the mature mRNA. The coding region of the pre-mRNA, which begins with the start codon for protein synthesis and ends with the stop codon, contains both exons and introns. Exons consist of the nucleotide codons that dictate the amino acid sequence of the eventual protein product. Between the exons, interspersing regions called introns contain nucleotide sequences that are removed by splicing reactions to form the mature RNA. The mature RNA thus contains a leader sequence (that includes the cap), a coding region comprising exons, and a trailing sequence that includes the poly(A) tail.
![ma54486325cc](ma54486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 14.10 Overview of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis. Transcription produces heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA, also known as pre-mRNA) from the DNA template. hnRNA processing involves addition of a $5^{\prime}$-cap and a poly(A) tail and splicing to join exons and remove introns. The product, mRNA, migrates to the cytoplasm, where it will direct protein synthesis.

There are three different types of methyl caps, shown in red.
![ma55486325cc](ma55486325cc.jpg)

CAP 0 refers to the methylated guanosine (on the nitrogen at the seven position, $N^{3}$ ) added in the $5^{\prime}$-to-5' linkage to the mRNA; CAP I refers to CAP 0 with the addition of a methyl group to the $2^{\prime}$-carbon of ribose on the nucleotide $\left(N_{1}\right)$ at the $5^{\prime}$-end of the chain; and CAP 2 refers to CAP I with the addition of another $2^{\prime}$-methyl group to the next nucleotide $\left(\mathrm{N}_{2}\right)$. The methyl groups are donated by S -adenosylmethionine (SAM).

Once SAM donates its methyl group, it must be regenerated by reactions that require the vitamins folate and $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. Thus, formation of mRNA is also one of the processes affected by a deficiency of these vitamins.

Within about 4 weeks of initiation of treatment for tuberculosis, culture results of Isabel S.'s sputum confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis caused by M. tuberculosis. Therefore, the multidrug therapy, which included the antibiotic rifampin, was continued. Rifampin binds to the RNA polymerases of several bacteria. M. tuberculosis rapidly develops resistance to rifampin through mutations that result in an RNA polymerase that cannot bind the complex structure. Simultaneous treatment with drugs that work through different mechanisms decreases the selective advantage of the mutation and the rate at which resistance develops.

This mature mRNA complexes with the poly(A)-binding protein and other proteins. It travels through pores in the nuclear envelope into the cytoplasm. There it combines with ribosomes and directs the incorporation of amino acids into proteins.

## 1. Transcription and Capping of mRNA

Capping of the primary transcript synthesized by RNA polymerase II occurs at its $5^{\prime}$-end as it is being transcribed (Fig. 14.11). The $5^{\prime}$-terminal, the initial nucleotide of the transcript, is a pyrimidine with three phosphate groups attached to the $5^{\prime}$-hydroxyl of the ribose. To form the cap, the terminal triphosphate loses one phosphate, forming a $5^{\prime}$-diphosphate. The $\beta$-phosphate of the diphosphate then attacks the $\alpha$-phosphate of GTP, liberating pyrophosphate and forming an unusual $5^{\prime}$-to-5' triphosphate linkage. A methyl group is transferred from SAM, a universal methyl donor, to position 7 of the added guanine ring. Methylation also occurs on the ribose $2^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group in the terminal nucleotide to which the cap is attached and sometimes on the $2^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group of the adjacent nucleotide ribose. This cap seals the $5^{\prime}$-end of the primary transcript and decreases the rate of degradation. It also serves as a recognition site for the binding of the mature mRNA to a ribosome at the initiation of protein synthesis.

## 2. Addition of a Poly(A) Tail

After the RNA polymerase transcribes the stop codon for protein translation, it passes a sequence called the polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) (Fig. 14.12). It continues past the polyadenylation signal until it reaches an unknown, and possibly nonspecific, termination signal many nucleotides later. However, as the primary transcript is released from the RNA polymerase elongation complex, an enzyme complex binds to the polyadenylation signal and cleaves the primary transcript approximately 10 to 20 nucleotides downstream, thereby forming the $3^{\prime}$-end. Following this cleavage, a poly(A) tail that can be $>200$ nucleotides in length is added to the $3^{\prime}$-end. Thus, there is no poly(dT) sequence in the DNA template that corresponds to this tail; it is added after transcription is completed. ATP serves as
![ma56486325cc](ma56486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 14.11 The cap structure in eukaryotic mRNA. The phosphates in red originated from the original RNA transcript; the phosphate in black comes from guanosine triphosphate (GTP).

FIGURE 14.12 Synthesis of the poly(A) tail.As RNA polymerase continues to transcribe the DNA, enzymes cleave the transcript (heterogeneous nuclear RNA [hnRNA]) at a point 10 to 20 nucleotides beyond an AAUAAA sequence, just before a run of Us (or Gs). Approximately 250 adenine nucleotides are then added to the $3^{\prime}$-end of the hnRNA, one at a time, by poly(A) polymerase. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $P P_{2}$ pyrophosphate.
the precursor for the sequential addition of the adenine nucleotides. They are added one at a time, with poly(A) polymerase catalyzing each addition. The poly(A) tail is a protein-binding site that protects the mRNA from degradation.

## 3. Removal of Introns

Eukaryotic pre-mRNA transcripts contain regions known as exons and introns. Exons appear in the mature mRNA; introns are removed from the transcript and are not found in the mature mRNA (see Fig. 14.10). Therefore, introns do not contribute to the amino acid sequence of the protein. Some genes contain 50 or more introns. These introns are carefully removed from the pre-mRNA transcript, and the exons are spliced together so that the appropriate protein is produced from the gene.

The consensus sequences at the intron/exon boundaries of the pre-mRNA are AGGU (AGGT in the DNA). The sequences vary to some extent on the exon side of the boundaries, but almost all introns begin with a $5^{\prime}$-GU and end with a $3^{\prime}$-AG (Fig. 14.13). These intron sequences at the left splice site and the right splice site are therefore invariant. Because every $5^{\prime}$-GU and $3^{\prime}$-AG combination does not result in a functional splice site, clearly other features (still to be determined) within the exon or intron help to define the appropriate splice sites.

A complex structure known as a spliceosome ensures that exons are spliced together with great accuracy (Fig. 14.14). Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), called "snurps," are involved in formation of the spliceosome. Because snurps are rich in uracil, they are identified by numbers preceded by a U.

Exons frequently code for separate functional or structural domains of proteins. Proteins with similar functional regions (e.g., ATP- or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD]-binding regions) frequently have similar domains, although their overall structure and amino acid sequence is quite different. A process known as exon shuffling has probably occurred throughout evolution, allowing new proteins to develop with functions similar to those of other proteins.

## B. Synthesis of Eukaryotic rRNA

rRNAs form the ribonucleoprotein complexes on which protein synthesis occurs. In eukaryotes, the rRNA gene exists as many copies in the nucleolar organizer region of the nucleus (Fig. 14.15, circle 1). Each gene produces a large, 45S transcript (synthesized by RNA polymerase I) that is cleaved to produce the 18S, 28S, and

(5)Lisa N. has $\beta^{+}$-thalassemia (enough of the $\beta$-chain is produced to maintain blood hemoglobin levels $>6.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). One mutation resulting in $\beta^{+}$-thalassemia is a point mutation (AATAAA $\rightarrow$ AACAAA) that changes the sequence in hnRNA at the polyadenylation signal site from AAUAAA to AACAAA. Homozygous individuals with this mutation produce only one-tenth the amount of normal $\beta$-globin mRNA.

(6)Some types of $\beta^{0}$-thalassemia (little or none of the hemoglobin $\beta$-chain produced) are caused by homozygous mutations in the splice-junction sequences at intron/ exon boundaries. In some individuals, an AT replaces a GT in the gene at the $5^{\prime}$-end of the first or second intron. Mutations also occur within the splicejunction sequences at the $3^{\prime}$-ends of introns (which are normally GT at the donor-site $5^{\prime}$-end and AG at the acceptor-site $3^{\prime}$-end). Mutations at either site totally abolish normal splicing and result in $\beta^{0}$-thalassemia.

$$

$$

FIGURE 14.13 Splice junctions in heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). The intron sequences shown in the boxes are invariant. They always appear at this position in introns. The sequences on the exon side of the splice sites are more variable.

![ma58486325cc](ma58486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 14.14 Splicing process. Nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snurps U1 to U6) bind to the intron, causing it to form a loop. The complex is called a spliceosome. The U1 snurp binds near the first exon/intron junction, and U2 binds within the intron in a region containing an adenine nucleotide residue. Another group of snurps, U4, U5, and U6, binds to the complex, and the loop is formed. The phosphate attached to the G residue at the $5^{\prime}$-end of the intron forms a $2^{\prime}-5^{\prime}$ linkage with the $2^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group of the adenine nucleotide residue. Cleavage occurs at the end of the first exon, between the AG residues at the $3^{\prime}$-end of the exon and the GU residues at the $5^{\prime}$-end of the intron. The complex continues to be held in place by the spliceosome. A second cleavage occurs at the $3^{\prime}$-end of the intron after the AG sequence. The exons are joined together. The intron, shaped like a lariat, is released and degraded to nucleotides.
5.8S rRNAs. Approximately 1,000 copies of this gene are present in the human genome. The genes are linked in tandem, separated by spacer regions that contain the termination signal for one gene and the promoter for the next. Promoters for rRNA genes are located in the $5^{\prime}$-flanking region of the genes and extend into the region surrounding the start point. rRNA genes caught in the act of transcription by electron micrographs show that many RNA polymerase I molecules can be attached to a gene at any given time, all moving toward the $3^{\prime}$-end as the 45 S rRNA precursors are synthesized.

As the 45 S rRNA precursors are released from the DNA, they complex with proteins, forming ribonucleoprotein particles that generate the granular regions of the nucleolus (see Fig. 14.15, circle 2). Processing of the transcript occurs in the granular regions. 5 S rRNA, produced by RNA polymerase III from genes located outside the nucleolus in the nucleoplasm, migrates into the nucleolus and joins the ribonucleoprotein particles.

One to two percent of the nucleotides of the 45 S precursor become methylated, primarily on the $2^{\prime}$-hydroxyl groups of ribose moieties (see Fig. 14.15, circle 3). These methyl groups may serve as markers for cleavage of the 45 S precursors and are conserved in the mature rRNA. A series of cleavages in the 45 S transcripts occur to produce the mature rRNAs (Fig. 14.16).

In the production of cytoplasmic ribosomes in human cells, one portion of the 45S rRNA precursor becomes the 18 S rRNA that, complexed with proteins, forms

The 5 S rRNA, transcribed from nonnucleolar genes, and several proteins complex with the 28 S and 5.8 S rRNAs to form the 60 S ribosomal subunit (Fig. 14.15, circle 5). The ribosomal subunits migrate through the nuclear pores. In the cytoplasm, the 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits interact with mRNA, forming the 80 S ribosomes on which protein synthesis occurs.

## C. Synthesis of Eukaryotic tRNA

A tRNA has one binding site for a specific sequence of three nucleotides in mRNA (the anticodon site) and another binding site for the encoded amino acid. Thus, tRNAs ensure that the genetic code is translated into the correct sequence of amino acids. At least 20 types of tRNAs occur in cells, one for every amino acid that is incorporated into growing polypeptide chains during the synthesis of proteins. tRNAs have a cloverleaf structure that folds into a three-dimensional L shape and contain several bases that are modified posttranscriptionally (Fig. 14.17). The loop closest to the $5^{\prime}$-end is known as the D-loop because it contains dihydrouridine (D). The second, or anticodon loop, contains the trinucleotide anticodon that base-pairs with the codon on mRNA. The third loop (the $T \Psi C$ loop) contains both ribothymidine (T) and pseudouridine $(\Psi)$. A fourth loop, known as the variable loop because it varies in size, is frequently found between the anticodon and T $\Psi$ C loops. Base pairing occurs in the stem regions of tRNA, and a three-nucleotide sequence (e.g., CCA) at the $3^{\prime}$-end is the attachment site for the specific amino acid carried by each tRNA. Different tRNAs bind different amino acids. The three-dimensional structure of tRNA has been determined and is shown in Figure 14.18. tRNA is produced by RNA polymerase III, which recognizes, along with promoter-proximal elements,

a split promoter within the transcribed region of the gene (Fig. 14.19). One segment of the promoter is located between +8 and +19 . A second segment is 30 to 60 base pairs (bp) downstream from the first.
tRNA precursors of approximately 100 nucleotides in length are generated. (Fig. 14.20, circle 1). The pre-tRNA assumes a cloverleaf shape and is subsequently cleaved at the $5^{\prime}$ - and $3^{\prime}$-ends (see Fig. 14.20, circle 2). The enzyme that acts at the $5^{\prime}$-end is RNase P , similar to the RNase P of bacteria. Both enzymes contain a small RNA (M1) that has catalytic activity and serves as an endonuclease. Some tRNA precursors contain introns that are removed by endonucleases. To close the opening, a $2^{\prime}$ - or $3^{\prime}$-phosphate group from one end is ligated to a $5^{\prime}$-hydroxyl on the other end by an RNA ligase.

The bases are modified at the same time the endonucleolytic cleavage reactions are occurring (see Fig. 14.20, circle 3). Three modifications occur in most tRNAs: (1) Uracil is methylated by SAM to form thymine; (2) one of the double bonds of uracil is reduced to form dihydrouracil; and (3) a uracil residue (attached to ribose by an N -glycosidic bond) is rotated to form pseudouridine, which contains uracil linked to ribose by a carbon-carbon bond (see Fig. 14.17). Other, less common but more complex modifications also occur and involve bases other than uracil. Of particular note is the deamination of adenine in the nucleoside adenosine to form the base hypoxanthine and the nucleoside inosine.

The final step in forming the mature tRNA is the addition of a CCA sequence at its $3^{\prime}$-end (see Fig. 14.20, circle 4). These nucleotides are added one at a time

by nucleotidyltransferase. The tRNA then migrates to the cytoplasm. The terminal adenosine at the $3^{\prime}$-end is the site at which the specific amino acid for each tRNA is bound and activated for incorporation into a protein.

# V. Differences in Size between Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic DNA 

## A. Diploid versus Haploid

Except for the germ cells, most normal human cells are diploid. Therefore, they contain two copies of each chromosome, and each chromosome contains genes that are alleles of the genes on the homologous chromosome. Because one chromosome in each set of homologous chromosomes is obtained from each parent, the alleles can be identical, containing the same DNA sequence, or they can differ. A diploid human cell contains 2,000 times more DNA than the genome of the bacterium in the haploid E. coli cell $\left(\sim 4 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{bp}\right)$.

## B. Introns

Eukaryotic introns contribute to the DNA size difference between bacteria and human cells. In eukaryotic genes, introns (noncoding regions) occur within sequences that code for proteins. Consequently, the primary transcript (heterogeneous nuclear RNA [hnRNA]) averages roughly 10 times longer than the mature mRNA produced by removal of the introns. In contrast, bacterial genes do not contain introns.

## C. Repetitive Sequences in Eukaryotic DNA

Although being diploid and containing introns account for some of the difference between the DNA content of humans and bacteria, a large difference remains that is related to the greater complexity of the human organism. Bacterial cells have a single copy of each gene, called unique DNA, and they contain very little DNA

Four million base pairs contain $\left(4 \times 10^{6}\right) / 3$ or 1.33 million codons. If each protein contained approximately 300 amino acids, E. coli could produce about 4,000 different proteins $\left[\left(1.33 \times 10^{6}\right) / 300\right]$.

Alu sequences in DNA were named for the enzyme Alu (obtained from Arthrobacter luteus), which is able to cleave them. Alu sequences make up $6 \%$ to $8 \%$ of the human genome. In some cases of familial hypercholesterolemia, homologous recombination is believed to have occurred between two Alu repeats, resulting in a large deletion in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor gene. The LDL receptor mediates uptake of the cholesterol-containing LDL particle into many cell types, and, in the absence of functional LDL receptors, blood cholesterol levels are elevated. Patients who are homozygous for this mutation may die from cardiac disease as early as in their second or third decade of life.
that does not produce functional products. Eukaryotic cells contain substantial amounts of DNA that does not code for functional products (i.e., proteins or rRNA and tRNA). In addition, some genes that encode functional products are present in multiple copies, called highly repetitive or moderately repetitive DNA. About $64 \%$ of the DNA in the human genome is unique, consisting of DNA sequences present in one or a very few copies in the genome (Fig. 14.21). Some of the unique DNA sequences are transcribed to generate mRNA, which is translated to produce proteins.

Highly repetitive DNA consists of sequences approximately 6 to 100 bp in length that are present in hundreds of thousands to millions of copies, clustered within a few locations in the genome (see Fig. 14.21). It occurs in centromeres (which join sister chromatids during mitosis) and in telomeres (the ends of chromosomes). This DNA represents approximately $10 \%$ of the human genome. It is not transcribed.

Moderately repetitive DNA is present in a few to tens of thousands of copies in the genome (see Fig. 14.21). This fraction constitutes approximately $25 \%$ of the human genome. It contains DNA that is functional and transcribed to produce rRNA, tRNA, and also some mRNA. The histone genes, present in a few hundred copies in the genome, belong to this class. Moderately repetitive DNA also includes some gene sequences that are functional but not transcribed. Promoters and enhancers (which are involved in regulating gene expression) are examples of gene sequences in this category. Other groups of moderately repetitive gene sequences that have been found in the human are called the Alu sequences ( $\sim 300 \mathrm{bp}$ in length). Alu sequences are also examples of short interspersed elements (SINEs). The long

FIGURE 14.21 Distribution of unique, moderately repetitive, and highly repetitive sequences in a hypothetical human chromosome. Unique genes encode messenger RNA (mRNA). These genes occur in single copies. The genes for the large ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the transfer RNA (tRNA) precursors occur in multiple copies that are clustered in the genome. The large rRNA genes form the nucleolar organizer. Moderately repetitive sequences are dispersed throughout the genome, and highly repetitive sequences are clustered around the centromere and at the ends of the chromosome (the telomeres). Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA) are usually found in ribonuclear protein particles. sn/sc RNA, small nuclear, small cytoplasmic RNAs, usually found in ribonucleoprotein particles.

interspersed elements (LINEs) are 6,000 to 7,000 bp in length. The functions of the Alu and LINE sequences have not been determined.

## D. Summary of the Differences between Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic DNA and RNA

Several differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes affect the processes of replication, transcription, and translation, in addition to the content of their DNA. Eukaryotic DNA is complexed with histones, and prokaryotic DNA is not. In eukaryotic cells, the process of transcription, which occurs in the nucleus, is separated by the nuclear envelope from the process of translation (protein synthesis from the mRNA template), which occurs in the cytoplasm. Because prokaryotes lack nuclei, the processes of transcription and translation occur simultaneously. Transcription of bacterial DNA requires only one promoter per operon. In contrast, human DNA requires one promoter for each gene.

Complexity may explain some of the differences between the DNA content of bacteria and humans. But an extension of this line of reasoning would lead to the conclusion that frogs are more complex than humans because frogs have 8 ft of DNA per diploid nucleus, compared to the 6 ft in a human cell. Logic, or perhaps vanity, suggests that the amount of DNA per cell does not necessarily reflect the complexity of the organism. One of the features of frog DNA that may explain its length is that frogs have more repetitive DNA than humans. More than $75 \%$ of the frog genome is in the moderately and highly repetitive category, whereas only about $35 \%$ of the human genome is repetitive.

Major differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA and RNA are summarized in Table 14.2. LINEs make up about 5\% of the human genome. In some patients with hemophilia (a disease in which blood does not clot normally), a LINE sequence has been inserted into exon 14 of the gene for factor VIII, a protein of the blood-clotting system. The insertion of the LINE sequence leads to the production of a nonfunctional protein.

(1)The mutations that cause the thalassemias affect the synthesis of either the $\alpha$ - or the $\beta$-chains of adult hemoglobin, causing an anemia. They are classified by the chain affected ( $\alpha$ - or $\beta$-) and by the amount of chain synthesized ( 0 for no synthesis and + for synthesis of some functional chains). They are also classified as major, intermediate, or minor, according to the severity of the clinical disorder. $\beta$-Thalassemia major (also called homozygous $\beta$-thalassemia) is a clinically severe disorder requiring frequent blood transfusions. It is caused by the inheritance of two alleles for a severe mutation. In $\beta$-thalassemia intermedia, the patient exhibits a less severe clinical phenotype and is able to maintain hemoglobin levels $>6$ to 7 g/dL. It is usually the result of two different mild mutations or homozygosity for a mild mutation. $\beta$-Thalassemia minor (also known as $\beta$-thalassemia trait) is a heterozygous disorder involving a single mutation that is often clinically asymptomatic.

During embryonic and fetal life, the $\beta$-chain is replaced by the $\varepsilon$ - and $\gamma$-chains, respectively. As a result, patients with severe mutations in the $\alpha$-chain tend to die in utero, whereas those with mutations in the $\beta$-chains exhibit symptoms postnatally, because hemoglobin $F\left(\alpha_{1} \gamma_{2}\right)$ is normally replaced with adult hemoglobin $A\left(\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}\right)$ after birth.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

![ma66486325cc](ma66486325cc.jpg)

Lisa N. Patients with $\beta^{+}$-thalassemia who maintain their hemoglobin levels $>6.0$ to $7.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ are usually classified as having thalassemia intermedia. In the $\beta$-thalassemias, the $\alpha$-chains of adult hemoglobin $\mathrm{A}\left(\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}\right)$ continue to be synthesized at a normal rate. These chains accumulate in the bone marrow in which the red blood cells are synthesized during the process of erythropoiesis (generation of red blood cells). The accumulation of $\alpha$-chains diminishes erythropoiesis, resulting in an anemia. Individuals who are homozygous for a severe mutation require constant transfusions.

Individuals with thalassemia intermedia, such as Lisa N., could have inherited two different defective alleles, one from each parent. One parent may be a "silent" carrier, with one normal allele and one mildly affected allele. This parent produces enough functional $\beta$-globin so few or no clinical symptoms of thalassemia appear. (However, they generally have a somewhat decreased amount of hemoglobin, resulting in microcytic hypochromic red blood cells.) When this parent contributes the mildly defective allele and the other heterozygous parent contributes a more severely defective allele, thalassemia intermedia occurs in the child. The child is thus heterozygous for two different defective alleles.

Isabel S. Isabel S. was treated with a multidrug regimen for tuberculosis because the microbes that cause the disease frequently become resistant to the individual drugs. The current approach in patients with $M$. tuberculosis is to initiate antimycobacterial therapy with four agents because the mycobacteria frequently become resistant to one or more of the individual antitubercular drugs. The same approach is taken for patients with HIV, with careful attention given to drug interactions. Isabel was started on isoniazid (INH), rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Isoniazid inhibits the biosynthesis of mycolic acids, which are important constituents of the mycobacterial cell wall. Isoniazid is often prescribed with vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ (pyridoxine) because isoniazid can interfere with the activation of this vitamin (to pyridoxal phosphate), which can lead to an alteration in normal cellular metabolism and result in a clinical neuropathy. Rifampin binds to and inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase, which selectively kills the bacteria that cause the infection. Pyrazinamide, a synthetic analog of nicotinamide, targets the mycobacterial fatty acid synthase I gene involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis. Ethambutol blocks arabinosyl transferases that are involved in cell wall biosynthesis.

Just as bacteria can become resistant to drugs, so can HIV. Because of this concern, patients with HIV are treated with multidrug regimens. Multidrug regimens usually include two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as lamivudine (3TC, Epivir) and abacavir, as well as a third agent. The third agent is usually either a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), an example of which is efavirenz; a protease inhibitor (PI), an example of which is indinavir; or an integrase inhibitor. PIs prevent the HIV polyprotein from being cleaved into its mature products (see "Biochemical Comments"). The drugs are often combined into one pill to make it easier to take. Isabel S. was started on efavirenz as her third drug and was counseled on not getting pregnant because this drug is teratogenic.

Catherine T. The toxin $\alpha$-amanitin is capable of causing irreversible hepatocellular and renal dysfunction through inhibition of mammalian RNA polymerases. $\alpha$-Amanitin is particularly effective at blocking the action of RNA polymerase II. Fortunately, Catherine T.'s toxicity proved mild. She developed only gastrointestinal symptoms and slight changes in her hepatic and renal function, which returned to normal within a few weeks. Treatment was primarily supportive, with fluid and electrolyte replacement for that lost through the gastrointestinal tract. No effective antidote is available for the Amanita phalloides toxin.

Sarah L. SLE is a multisystem disease characterized by inflammation related to the presence of autoantibodies in the blood. These autoantibodies react with antigens normally found in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane of the cell. Such "self" antigen-antibody (autoimmune) interactions initiate an inflammatory cascade that produces the broad symptom profile of multiorgan dysfunction found in Sarah L.

Pharmacologic therapy for SLE involves anti-inflammatory drugs and immunosuppressive agents. It can include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antimalarials, or immunosuppressive drugs. Plaquenil is an antimalarial drug used to treat skin and joint symptoms in SLE, although its exact mechanism of action in these patients is not fully understood. Sarah was placed on such a drug regimen.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

$\triangle$Production of the Virus that Causes AIDS. AIDS is caused by the HIV. Two forms of the virus have been discovered, HIV-1, which is prevalent in industrialized countries, and HIV-2, which is prevalent in certain regions of Africa. Eight to 10 years or more can elapse between the initial infection and development of the full-blown syndrome.

Proteins in the viral coat bind to membrane protein receptors (named CD4) of helper T-lymphocytes, a class of cells involved in the immune response. Subsequently, conformational changes occur that allow the viral-coat proteins to bind to a chemokine coreceptor in the cell membrane. The lipid in the viral coat then fuses with the cell membrane, and the viral core enters the cell, releasing its RNA and enzymes (including the reverse transcriptase) by a process called uncoating. Reverse transcriptase uses the viral RNA as a template to produce a single-stranded DNA copy, which then serves as a template for synthesis of a double-stranded DNA. An integrase enzyme, also carried by the virus, enables this DNA to integrate into the host cell genome as a provirus (Fig. 14.22).

In the initial stage of transcription of the provirus, the transcript is spliced, and three proteins-Nef, Tat, and Rev-are produced. Tat stimulates transcription of the viral genes. As Rev accumulates, it allows unspliced viral RNA to leave the nucleus and to produce proteins of the viral envelope and viral core, including reverse transcriptase. Two of the envelope glycoproteins (gp41 and gp120, which are derived from the env gene product) form a complex that embeds in the cell membrane. The other proteins, which are translated as a polyprotein and cleaved by the viral protease (one of the targets of anti-HIV drugs), combine with the fulllength viral RNA to form core viral particles, which bud from the cell membrane. Thus, the virus obtains its lipid coat from the host cell membrane, and the coat contains the viral proteins gp41 and gp120. These surface proteins of the virus bind to CD4 receptors on other human helper T-lymphocytes, and the infection spreads.

In an uninfected person, helper T-lymphocytes usually number approximately $1,000 / \mathrm{mL}$. Infection with HIV causes the number of these cells to decrease, which results in a deficiency of the immune system. When the number of T-lymphocytes drops to $<200 / \mathrm{mL}$, the disease is in an advanced stage, and opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, occur. Although macrophages and dendritic cells lack CD4 receptors, they can also become infected with HIV and can carry the virus to the central nervous system.

The most effective means of combating HIV infection involves the use of drugs that inhibit the viral reverse transcriptase or the viral protease. However, these drugs only hold the infection at bay; they do not effect a cure.

(1)Studies have indicated that a failure to dispose properly of cellular debris, a normal by-product of cell death, may lead to the induction of autoantibodies directed against chromatin in patients with SLE. Normal cells have a finite lifetime and are programmed to die (apoptosis) through a distinct biochemical mechanism. One of the steps in this mechanism is the stepwise degradation of cellular DNA (and other cellular components). If the normal intracellular components are exposed to the immune system, autoantibodies against them may be generated. The enzyme in cells that degrades DNA is deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), and individuals with SLE have reduced serum activity levels of DNase I compared with individuals who do not have the disease. Through an understanding of the molecular mechanism whereby autoantibodies are generated, it may be possible to develop therapies to combat this disorder.

(2)Drugs currently used to treat HIV act on the viral reverse transcriptase or the protease (see Fig. 14.22). The nonnucleoside drugs (e.g., efavirenz) bind to reverse transcriptase and inhibit its action. The nucleoside analogs (e.g., lamivudine) add to the $3^{\prime}$-end of the growing DNA transcript produced by reverse transcriptase and prevent further elongation. The PI (e.g., indinavir) bind to the protease and prevent it from cleaving the polyprotein.

FIGURE 14.22 Infection of a host cell by HIV. The HIV particle binds to the CD4 receptor and a chemokine coreceptor in the host cell membrane. The virus enters the cell and uncoats, releasing its RNA and proteins. The viral enzyme reverse transcriptase produces a doublestranded DNA copy that is integrated into the host cell genome. HIV is now a provirus. Transcripts of the viral DNA are spliced and translated to produce the proteins Tat, Rev, and Nef. Tat stimulates transcription of the viral DNA, and Rev causes the viral RNA transcripts to leave the nucleus unspliced. The unspliced RNA serves as the viral genome and also codes for the proteins of the viral core and envelope. The envelope proteins (gp41 and gp120, which are derived from the Env protein) enter the cell membrane. The viral core proteins are synthesized as a polyprotein, which is cleaved by a protease as the viral particles form and bud from the cell membrane. The particles carry membrane lipid as a coat that contains gp41 and gp120. Nef indirectly aids in the assembly of viral particles. Pol is the reverse transcriptase produced from the viral RNA. 13, stimulates.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Transcription is the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template.
- The enzyme RNA polymerase transcribes genes into a single-stranded RNA.
- The RNA produced is complementary to one of the strands of DNA, which is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand is the coding, or sense, strand.
- Bacteria contain a single RNA polymerase; eukaryotic cells use three different RNA polymerases.
- The DNA template is copied in the $3^{\prime}$-to-5' direction and the RNA transcript is synthesized in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction.
- In contrast to DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases do not require a primer to initiate transcription, nor do they contain extensive error-checking capabilities.
- Promoter regions, specific sequences in DNA, determine where on the DNA template RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription.
- Transcription initiation requires several protein factors to allow for efficient RNA polymerase binding to the promoter.
- Other DNA sequences, such as promoter-proximal elements and enhancers, affect the rate of transcription initiation through the interactions of DNA-binding proteins with RNA polymerase and other initiation factors.
- Eukaryotic genes contain exons and introns. Exons specify the coding region of proteins, whereas introns have no coding function.
- The primary transcript of eukaryotic genes is modified to remove the introns (splicing) before a final, mature mRNA is produced.
- Table 14.3 summarizes the diseases discussed in this chapter.

B. The single-stranded RNA produced is identical to both of the strands of double-stranded DNA.
C. Eukaryotic genes are transcribed in the cytosol by three different RNA polymerases.
D. RNA polymerase cannot initiate new strand synthesis and must have a primer.
E. Eukaryotic genes are transcribed in the nucleus by three different DNA polymerases.
7. Eukaryotic cells contain multiple RNA polymerases, which makes it difficult to block all RNA synthesis with one drug targeted to a specific polymerase. Which one of the following best describes properties of eukaryotic RNA polymerases?

10. A researcher wants to develop an antibiotic that targets histones and introns in bacteria, and she has applied for a grant. Why would the grant's physician/ biochemist advisor advise against funding this grant application?
A. The proposed antibiotic would have no effect on bacteria but could harm human cells.
B. The proposed antibiotic would negatively affect both bacteria and human cells.
C. The proposed antibiotic would have no effect on either bacteria or human cells.
D. Bacteria have histones but do not have introns.
E. Bacteria have introns but do not have histones.

1. The answer is B. The transcript that is produced is copied from the DNA template strand, which must be of the opposite orientation from the transcript. So the $5^{\prime}$-end of the template strand should base-pair with the $3^{\prime}$-end of the transcript, or the G. Thus, CGTACGGAT would base-pair with the transcript and would represent the template strand.
2. The answer is A. Catherine T. weighs 50 kg , and if $0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight is the $\mathrm{LD}_{50}$, then for Amanda, 5 mg of toxin would bring her to the $\mathrm{LD}_{50}$. Because one mushroom contains 7 mg of the toxin, ingesting just one mushroom could be fatal.
3. The answer is C. Enhancer sequences can be thousands of bases away from the basal promoter and still stimulate transcription of the gene. This is accomplished by looping of the DNA so that the proteins binding to the enhancer sequence (transactivators) can also bind to proteins bound to the promoter (coactivators). A promoter-proximal element is a DNA sequence near to the promoter that can bind transcription factors that aid in recruiting RNA polymerase to the promoter region.
4. The answer is D. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes require RNA polymerase binding to an upstream promoter element. Answer A applies only to eukaryotes; prokaryote mRNA is not capped, nor does it contain a poly(A) tail. Prokaryotes have no nucleus; therefore, the $5^{\prime}$-end of an mRNA is immediately available for ribosome binding and initiation of translation (thus, B is incorrect). Answer C is incorrect overall; RNA synthesis, like DNA synthesis, is always in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction. Answer E is incorrect because introns are present only in eukaryotic genes.
5. The answer is A. A $\beta$-thalassemia refers to a condition in which the $\alpha$-chain of globin is produced in excess of the $\beta$-chain. The greater the ratio of $\alpha$ - to $\beta$-chain, the more severe the disease. Patients are usually asymptomatic at a ratio of $2: 1$, but once the ratio is greater than 2:1, symptoms will become evident. The reduction in $\beta$-globin synthesis can come about because of splicing mutations, promoter mutations, or point mutations within the coding regions of the $\beta$-globin gene.
6. The answer is A. The single-stranded RNA produced by transcription is identical in sequence to one (not both) of the DNA strands except that the RNA strand contains the base uracil in locations where the DNA strand contains thymine. Eukaryotic genes are transcribed in the nucleus (not cytosol) by three different RNA polymerases (not DNA polymerases). RNA polymerase does not require a primer to initiate transcription, unlike DNA polymerase, which does require a primer to initiate DNA replication.
7. The answer is A. The promoter region on the DNA identifies the start point of transcription for each gene. Enhancers are distal promoter elements that stabilize RNA polymerase binding to the promoter, but enhancers do not identify the initiation point for transcription. All of the RNA polymerases have the same mechanism of action but differ in which promoters they recognize (the sequence of promoters differs for each polymerase) owing to the use of different accessory factors in forming the initiation complex. Polymerase I produces rRNA; polymerase II, mRNA; and polymerase III, tRNA in eukaryotic cells.
8. The answer is C. The sense (or coding) strand of DNA is identical to the mRNA produced, with the exception of the DNA containing thymine and the RNA containing uracil. The template (or antisense) strand of DNA is the strand that is used by RNA polymerase to produce a complementary RNA sequence to the template strand (thus, the antisense strand is complementary to the mRNA produced and is not identical to it). The first RNA form produced by RNA polymerase is hnRNA, which contains both intron (noncoding) and exon (coding sequences) sequences. hnRNA is modified by the addition of a cap to the $5^{\prime}$-end, a poly(A) tail added to the $3^{\prime}$-end, and all introns removed. During processing, the intron sequences are removed from the hnRNA to produce the mature mRNA.
9. The answer is D. tRNA contains a three-base sequence known as the anticodon, which binds to a corresponding complementary codon on the mRNA. The amino acid is covalently linked to the tRNA at its $3^{\prime}$-end, which is distinct from the anticodon site. A particular tRNA only links to one amino acid, not multiple amino acids. In the cloverleaf structure of tRNA, one of the loops contains the anticodon that is distinct from the D loop, which frequently contains dihydrouridine as an unusual base.
10. The answer is A. Bacteria do not have histones or introns, but humans have both. The proposed antibiotic would have no effect on bacteria but could have a deleterious effect on human cells.

FIGURE 15.1 Binding of transfer RNA (tRNA) to a codon on messenger RNA (mRNA). The tRNA contains an amino acid at its $3^{\prime}$-end that corresponds to the codon on mRNA with which the anticodon of the tRNA can base-pair. Note that the codon-anticodon pairing is complementary and antiparallel.

# Translation: Synthesis of Proteins 

Proteins are produced by the process of translation, which occurs on ribosomes and is directed by messenger RNA (mRNA). The genetic message encoded in DNA is first transcribed into mRNA, and the nucleotide sequence in the coding region of the mRNA is then translated into the amino acid sequence of the protein.

Translation of the Code. The portion of mRNA that specifies the amino acid sequence of the protein is read in codons, which are sets of three nucleotides that specify individual amino acids (Fig 15.1). The codons on mRNA are read sequentially in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction, starting with the 5'-AUG (or 'start' codon) that specifies methionine and sets the reading frame and ending with a 3'-termination (or 'stop') codon (UAG, UGA, or UAA). The protein is synthesized from its $\mathbf{N}$ terminus to its $\mathbf{C}$ terminus.

Each amino acid is carried to the ribosome by an aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) (i.e., a tRNA with an amino acid covalently attached). Base pairing between the anticodon of the tRNA and the codon on the mRNA ensures that each amino acid is inserted into the growing polypeptide at the appropriate position.

Synthesis of the Protein. Initiation involves formation of a complex containing the initial methionyl-tRNA bound to the AUG "start" codon of the mRNA and to the "P" site of the ribosome. It requires guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and proteins known as eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs).

Elongation of the polypeptide involves three steps: (I) binding of an aminoacyl-tRNA to the "A" site on the ribosome, where it base-pairs with the second codon on the mRNA; (2) formation of a peptide bond between the first and second amino acids; and (3) translocation, movement of the mRNA relative to the ribosome, so that the third mRNA codon moves into the "A" site. These three elongation steps are repeated until a termination codon aligns with the site on the ribosome where the next aminoacyl-tRNA would normally bind. Release factors bind instead, causing the completed protein to be released from the ribosome.

After one ribosome binds and moves along the mRNA, translating the polypeptide, another ribosome can bind and begin translation. The complex of a single mRNA with multiple ribosomes is known as a polysome.

Folding and Modification and Targeting of the Protein. Folding of the polypeptide into its three-dimensional configuration occurs as the polypeptide is being translated. This process involves proteins called chaperones. Modification of amino acid residues in a protein occurs during or after translation. Proteins synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes are released into the cytosol or transported into mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the nucleus. Proteins synthesized on ribosomes attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) are destined for lysosomes, cell membranes, or secretion from the cell. These proteins are transferred to the Golgi complex, where they are modified and targeted to their ultimate locations.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\qquad$
$\square$Lisa N., a 4-year-old patient with $\beta^{+}$-thalassemia intermedia (see Chapter 14), showed no improvement in her symptoms at her second visit. Her hemoglobin level was $7.3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range for females $=12$ to $16 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ).

2Jay S. is a 9-month-old male infant of Ashkenazi Jewish parentage. His growth and development were normal until age 5 months, when he began to exhibit mild, generalized muscle weakness. By 7 months, he had poor head control and slowed development of motor skills, and he was increasingly inattentive to his surroundings. His parents also noted unusual eye movements and staring episodes. On careful examination of his retinae, his pediatrician observed a "cherry red" spot within a pale macula. The physician suspected Tay-Sachs disease and sent samples of his whole blood to the molecular biology-genetics laboratory.

3
Paul T. returned to his physician's office after 5 days of azithromycin therapy (see Chapter 12) feeling significantly better. The sputum sample from his previous visit had been cultured. The results confirmed that his respiratory infection was caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and that the organism was sensitive to penicillin, macrolides (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin), tetracycline, and other antibiotics.

(1)Edna R., a 25-year-old junior medical student, brings her healthy 4-monthold daughter, Beverly, to the pediatrician for her second diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis ( DTaP , acellular pertussis) immunization, along with the following immunizations: pneumococcal, inactivated polio, Haemophilus influenza, and rotavirus. Edna tells the doctor that her great-great aunt had died of diphtheria during an epidemic many years ago.

## I. The Genetic Code

Transcription, the transfer of the genetic message from DNA to RNA, and translation, the transfer of the genetic message from the nucleotide language of nucleic acids to the amino acid language of proteins, both depend on base pairing. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, molecular biologists attempting to decipher the process of translation recognized two problems. The first involved decoding the relationship between the language of the nucleic acids and the language of the proteins, and the second involved determining the molecular mechanism by which translation between these two languages occurs.

Twenty different amino acids are commonly incorporated into proteins, and therefore, the protein alphabet has 20 characters. The nucleic acid alphabet, however, has only four characters, corresponding to the four nucleotides of mRNA (A, G, C, and U). If two nucleotides constituted the code for an amino acid, then only $4^{2}$ (or 16) amino acids could be specified. Therefore, the number of nucleotides that code for an amino acid has to be at least three, providing $4^{3}$ (or 64) possible combinations or codons-more than required, but not excessive.

Scientists set out to determine the specific codons for each amino acid. In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg produced the first crack in the genetic code (the collection of codons that specifies all the amino acids found in proteins). He showed that poly(U), a polynucleotide in which all the bases are uracil, produced polyphenylalanine in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system. Thus, UUU must be the codon for phenylalanine. As a result of experiments using synthetic polynucleotides in place of mRNA, other codons were identified.

The pioneering molecular biologists recognized that, because amino acids cannot bind directly to the sets of three nucleotides that form their codons, adapters are required. The adapters were found to be transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. Each tRNA molecule contains an anticodon and covalently binds a specific amino acid at

4The results of tests performed in the molecular biology laboratory show that Jay S. has an insertion in exon II of the $\alpha$-chain of the hexosaminidase A gene, the most common mutation found in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish background who have Tay-Sachs disease. Hexosaminidase A, the enzyme activity that is lacking in Jay S. can be assayed using a serum sample and a substrate that releases a fluorescent dye upon being hydrolyzed. When measuring enzyme activity, one needs to be careful to distinguish between hexosaminidase A activity and a closely related activity from hexosaminidase B. This is accomplished by differential heat inactivation of the sample (exposure of the sample to $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ will inactivate hexosaminidase A activity but not hexosaminidase B activity). For prenatal screening, molecular techniques are the preferred method because of their sensitivity and the limited amount of sample available (see Chapter 17).

## A. Codons for alanine

![ma69486325cc](ma69486325cc.jpg)
B. Base pairing of three alanine codons with anticodon IGC
![ma70486325cc](ma70486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 15.2 Base pairing of codons for alanine with $5^{\prime}$-IGC-3'. A. The variation is in the third base. B. The first three of these codons can pair with a transfer RNA (tRNA) that contains the anticodon 5'-IGC-3'. Hypoxanthine (I) is an unusual base found in tRNA that can form base pairs with $U, C$, or $A$. It is formed by the deamination of adenine. Hypoxanthine is the base attached to ribose in the nucleoside inosine. The single-letter abbreviation for hypoxanthine is I, referring to the nucleoside inosine. mRNA, messenger RNA.
its $3^{\prime}$-end (see Chapters 12 and 14). The anticodon of a tRNA molecule is a set of three nucleotides that can interact with a codon on mRNA (see Fig. 15.1). In order to interact, the codon and anticodon must be complementary (i.e., they must be able to form base pairs in an antiparallel orientation). Thus, the anticodon of a tRNA serves as the link between an mRNA codon and the amino acid that the codon specifies.

Obviously, each codon present within mRNA must correspond to a specific amino acid. Nirenberg found that trinucleotides of known base sequence could bind to ribosomes and induce the binding of specific aminoacyl-tRNAs (i.e., tRNAs with amino acids attached covalently). As a result of these and the earlier experiments, the relationship between all 64 codons and the amino acids they specify (the entire genetic code) was determined by the mid-1960s (Table 15.1).

Three of the 64 possible codons (UGA, UAG, and UAA) terminate protein synthesis and are known as stop or nonsense codons. The remaining 61 codons specify amino acids. Two amino acids each have only one codon (AUG for methionine; UGG for tryptophan). The remaining amino acids have multiple codons.

## A. The Code Is Degenerate Yet Unambiguous

Because many amino acids are specified by more than one codon, the genetic code is described as degenerate, which means that an amino acid may have more than one codon. However, each codon specifies only one amino acid, and the genetic code is thus unambiguous.

Inspection of a codon table shows that in most instances of multiple codons for a single amino acid, the variation occurs in the third base of the codon (see Table 15.1). Crick noted that the pairing between the $3^{\prime}$-base of the codon and the $5^{\prime}$-base of the anticodon does not always follow the strict base-pairing rules that he and Watson had previously discovered (i.e., A pairs with U, and G with C). This observation resulted in the wobble hypothesis.

At the third base of the codon (the $3^{\prime}$-position of the codon and the $5^{\prime}$-position of the anticodon), the base pairs can wobble. For example, G can pair with U , and A , C, or U can pair with the unusual base hypoxanthine (I) found in tRNA. Thus, three of the four codons for alanine (GCU, GCC, and GCA) can pair with a single tRNA that contains the anticodon 5'-IGC-3' (Fig. 15.2). If each of the 61 codons for amino acids required a distinct tRNA, cells would contain 61 tRNAs. However, because of wobble between the codon and anticodon, fewer than 61 tRNAs are required to translate the genetic code.

FIGURE 15.3 Reading frame of messenger RNA (mRNA). A. For any given mRNA sequence, there are three possible reading frames ( 1,2 , and 3 ). B. An AUG near the $5^{\prime}$-end of the mRNA (the start codon) sets the reading frame for translation of a protein from the mRNA. The codons are read in linear order, starting with this AUG. (The other potential reading frames are not used. They would give proteins with different amino acid sequences.)

All organisms studied so far use the same genetic code, with some rare exceptions. One exception occurs in human mitochondrial mRNA, in which UGA codes for tryptophan instead of serving as a stop codon, AUA codes for methionine instead of isoleucine, and CUA codes for threonine instead of leucine.

# B. The Code Is Nonoverlapping 

mRNA does not contain extra nucleotides, or punctuation, to separate one codon from the next, and the codons do not overlap. Each nucleotide is read only once. Beginning with a start codon (AUG) near the $5^{\prime}$-end of the mRNA, the codons are read sequentially, ending with a stop codon (UGA, UAG, or UAA) near the $3^{\prime}$-end of the mRNA.

## C. Relationship between mRNA and the Protein Product

The start codon (AUG) sets the reading frame-the order in which the sequence of bases in the mRNA is sorted into codons (Fig. 15.3). The order of the codons in the mRNA determines the sequence in which amino acids are added to the growing polypeptide chain. Thus, the order of the codons in the mRNA determines the linear sequence of amino acids in the protein.

## II. Effects of Mutations

Mutations that result from damage to the nucleotides of DNA molecules or from unrepaired errors during replication (see Chapter 13) can be transcribed into mRNA and therefore can result in the translation of a protein with an abnormal amino acid sequence. Various types of mutations can occur which have different effects on the encoded protein (Table 15.2).

TABLE 15.2 Types of Mutations

| TYPE | DESCRIPTION | EXAMPLE |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Point | A single base change |  |
| Silent | A change that specifies the same amino acid | $\mathrm{CGA} \rightarrow \mathrm{CGG}$ |
|  |  | $\mathrm{Arg} \rightarrow \mathrm{Arg}$ |
| Missense | A change that specifies a different amino acid | $\mathrm{CGA} \rightarrow \mathrm{CCA}$ |
|  |  | $\mathrm{Arg} \rightarrow$ Pro |
| Nonsense | A change that produces a stop codon | $\mathrm{CGA} \rightarrow \mathrm{UGA}$ |
|  |  | $\mathrm{Arg} \rightarrow$ Stop |
| Insertion | An addition of one or more bases |  |
| Deletion | A loss of one or more bases |  |

Silent point mutations can also lead to disease if they create a new splice site during mRNA processing. HutchinsonGilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a premature aging disorder, can result from a mutation in the lamin A gene (LAMA gene) in which the base at position 1,824 in the gene is altered from a cytosine to a thymine. This single nucleotide change does not alter the amino acid sequence (the codon indicated a glycine before the change and indicates a glycine after the change), but it does create a cryptic splice site in exon II, which gives rise to a prelamin A that is missing 50 amino acids. The loss of these amino acids interferes with posttranslational processing of the protein as well as disruption of the nuclear membrane, telomere dysfunction, chromatinremodeling defects, and epigenetic alterations.

Sickle cell anemia is caused by a missense mutation. In each of the alleles for $\beta$-globin, Will S.'s DNA has a single base change (see Chapter 6). In the sickle cell gene, GTG replaces the normal GAG. Thus, in the mRNA, the codon GUG replaces GAG and a valine residue replaces a glutamate residue in the protein. The amino acid change is indicated as E6V; the normal glutamate (E) at position 6 of the $\beta$-chain has been replaced by a valine (V).

0One type of thalassemia is caused by a nonsense mutation. Codon 17 of the $\beta$-globin chain is changed from UGG to UGA. This change results in the conversion of a codon for a tryptophan residue to a stop codon. Other types of thalassemia are caused by deletions in the globin genes. Patients have been studied who have large deletions in either the $5^{\prime}$ - or the $3^{\prime}$-coding region of the $\beta$-globin gene, removing almost one-third of the DNA sequence.

Is it possible that Lisa N. has either a nonsense mutation in codon 17 or a large deletion of the $\beta$-globin gene?

## A. Point Mutations

Point mutations occur when only one base in DNA is altered, producing a change in a single base of an mRNA codon. There are three basic types of point mutations: silent mutations, missense mutations, and nonsense mutations. Point mutations are said to be "silent" when they do not affect the amino acid sequence of the protein. For example, a codon change from CGA to CGG does not affect the protein because both of these codons specify arginine (see Table 15.1). In missense mutations, one amino acid in the protein is replaced by a different amino acid. For example, a change from CGA to CCA causes arginine to be replaced by proline. A nonsense mutation causes the premature termination of a polypeptide chain. For example, a codon change from CGA to UGA causes a codon for arginine to be replaced by a stop codon, so synthesis of the mutant protein terminates at this point.

## B. Insertions, Deletions, and Frameshift Mutations

An insertion occurs when one or more nucleotides are added to DNA. If the insertion does not generate a stop codon, a protein with more amino acids than normal could be produced.

When one or more nucleotides are removed from DNA, the mutation is known as a deletion. If the deletion does not affect the normal start and stop codons, a protein with fewer than the normal number of amino acids could be produced.

A frameshift mutation occurs when the number of inserted or deleted nucleotides is not a multiple of three (Fig. 15.4). The reading frame shifts at the point where the insertion or deletion begins. Beyond that point, the amino acid sequence of the protein translated from the mRNA differs from the normal protein.

## III. Formation of Aminoacyl-tRNA

A tRNA that contains an amino acid attached covalently to its $3^{\prime}$-end is called an aminoacyl-tRNA and is considered to be charged. Aminoacyl-tRNAs are named both for the amino acid and the tRNA that carries the amino acid. For example, the tRNA for alanine (tRNA ${ }^{\text {Ala }}$ ) acquires alanine to become alanyl-tRNA ${ }^{\text {Ala }}$. A particular tRNA recognizes only the AUG start codon that initiates protein synthesis and not other AUG codons that specify insertion of methionine within the polypeptide chain. This initiator methionyl-tRNA ${ }^{\text {Met }}$ is denoted by the subscript "i" in methionyl-tRNA ${ }_{i}^{\text {Met }}$.

Amino acids are attached to their tRNAs by highly specific enzymes known as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Twenty different synthetases exist; one for each amino acid. Each synthetase recognizes a particular amino acid and all of the tRNAs that carry that amino acid.

The formation of the ester bond that links the amino acid to the tRNA by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is an energy-requiring process that occurs in two steps.
![ma72486325cc](ma72486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 15.4 A frameshift mutation. The insertion of a single nucleotide (the $A$ in the dotted red box) causes the reading frame to shift so that the amino acid sequence of the protein translated from the mRNA is different after the point of insertion. A similar effect can result from the insertion or deletion of nucleotides if the number inserted or deleted is not a multiple of three.

The amino acid is activated in the first step when its carboxyl group reacts with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to form an enzyme-aminoacyl-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) complex and pyrophosphate (Fig. 15.5). The cleavage of a high-energy bond of ATP in this reaction provides energy, and the subsequent cleavage of pyrophosphate by a pyrophosphatase helps to drive the reaction by removing one of the products. In the second step, the activated amino acid is transferred to the $2^{\prime}$ - or $3^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group (depending on the type of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that catalyzes the reaction) of the ribose connected to the $3^{\prime}$-terminal A residue of the tRNA, and AMP is released (recall that all tRNAs have a CCA added to their $3^{\prime}$-end posttranscriptionally). The energy in the aminoacyl-tRNA ester bond is subsequently used in the formation of a peptide bond during the process of protein synthesis. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase provides the first error-checking step in preserving the fidelity of translation. The enzymes check their work, and if the incorrect amino acid has been linked to a particular tRNA, the enzyme will remove the amino acid from the tRNA and try again using the correct amino acid.

Some aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases use the anticodon of the tRNA as a recognition site as they attach the amino acid to the hydroxyl group at the $3^{\prime}$-end of the tRNA (Fig. 15.6). However, other synthetases do not use the anticodon but recognize only bases located at other positions in the tRNA. Nevertheless, insertion of the amino acid into a growing polypeptide chain depends solely on the bases of the anticodon, through complementary base pairing with the mRNA codon.

## IV. Process of Translation

Translation of a protein involves three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. It begins with the formation of the initiation complex. Subsequently, synthesis of the polypeptide occurs by a series of elongation steps that are repeated as each amino acid is added to the growing chain (Fig. 15.7). Termination occurs where the mRNA contains an in-frame stop codon, and the completed polypeptide chain is released.

## A. Initiation of Translation

In eukaryotes, initiation of translation involves formation of an initiation complex composed of methionyl-tRNA ${ }_{i}{ }^{\text {Met }}$, mRNA, and a ribosome (Fig. 15.8). Methionyl$\mathrm{tRNA}_{i}{ }^{\text {Met }}$ (also known as Met-tRNA ${ }_{i}{ }^{\text {Met }}$ ) initially forms a complex with the protein
![ma73486325cc](ma73486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 15.6 Some aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase recognition sites on tRNA. Each aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is specific for certain tRNAs, which it "recognizes" by binding the sequences of nucleotides called recognition sites, shown in green. In some cases, the anticodon is a recognition site; in others, it is not. This is true for human tRNAs as well as for those shown here.E.coli, Escherichia coli.

A nonsense mutation at codon 17 would cause premature termination of translation. A nonfunctional peptide containing only 16 amino acids would result, producing a $\beta^{S}$-thalassemia if the mutation occurred in both alleles. A large deletion in the coding region of the gene could also produce a truncated protein. If Lisa N. has a nonsense mutation or a large deletion, it could be in only one allele. The mutation in the other allele must be milder because she produces some normal $\beta$-globin. Her hemoglobin is $7.3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, typical of thalassemia intermedia (a $\beta^{+}$-thalassemia).

FIGURE 15.5 Formation of aminoacyltransfer RNA (tRNA). The amino acid is first activated by reacting with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The amino acid is then transferred from the aminoacyl-AMP to tRNA. AMP, adenosine monophosphate; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate; $\mathrm{PP}_{\mathrm{i}}$, pyrophosphate.

FIGURE 15.7 Overview of the process of translation. (I) Once a transfer RNA (tRNA) has donated its amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain (which itself is still linked to a tRNA), it is released from the mRNA. (2) A new aminoacyl-tRNA binds to the correct codon in the mRNA to donate its amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain.
eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which binds GTP. This complex then binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit with the participation of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3). eIF3 also participates in preventing premature association of the 60S ribosomal subunit with the pre-initiation complex. The cap at the $5^{\prime}$-end of the mRNA binds to components of the eIF4 complex, eIF4F, known as the cap-binding complex. eIF4F is a complex comprising eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G. The mRNA, in association with the cap-binding complex, then binds to the eIFs-Met-tRNA ${ }_{i}{ }^{\text {Met }}$ 40S ribosome complex. In a reaction that requires hydrolysis of ATP (because of the helicase activity of an eIF subunit), this complex unwinds a hairpin loop in the mRNA and scans the mRNA until it locates the AUG start codon (usually the first AUG in the mRNA). GTP is hydrolyzed, the initiation factors (IFs) are released, and the large ribosomal (60S) subunit binds. The ribosome is now complete. It contains one small and one large subunit, and it has three binding sites for tRNA, known as the $P$ (peptidyl), $A$ (aminoacyl), and $E$ (ejection) sites. During initiation,

This is a simplified version of translational initiation; many more initiation factors and steps are required.

Met-tRNA ${ }_{i}^{\text {Met }}$ binds to the ribosome at the P site, which is located initially at the start codon for translation. Eukaryotes also contain a Kozak consensus sequence which is recognized by the ribosome as the translational start site (the sequence is A or $\mathrm{G}-\mathrm{CCAU} G \mathrm{G}$, where the purine base is three bases upstream of the AUG start codon). The Kozak sequence aids in defining the initial AUG codon for translation. Loss of this sequence reduces the efficiency of translational initiation.

The initiation process differs for prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Table 15.3). In bacteria, the initiating methionyl-tRNA is formylated, producing a formyl-methionyl$\mathrm{tRNA}_{i}{ }^{\text {Met }}$ that participates in formation of the initiation complex (Fig. 15.9). Only three IFs are required to generate this complex in prokaryotes compared with the dozen or more required by eukaryotes. The ribosomes also differ in size. Prokaryotes have 70 S ribosomes, composed of 30 S and 50 S subunits; eukaryotes have 80 S ribosomes, composed of 40 S and 60 S subunits. Unlike eukaryotic mRNA, bacterial mRNA is not capped. Identification of the initiating AUG triplet in prokaryotes occurs when a sequence in the mRNA (known as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence) binds to a complementary sequence near the $3^{\prime}$-end of the 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the small ribosomal subunit.

Initiation of translation is also regulated at the level of the IFs. For example, insulin, an anabolic hormone, stimulates general protein synthesis by activating eIF4E. Normally, eIF4E is bound to an inhibitor protein, designated 4E-binding protein (4E-BP). When insulin binds to its cell surface receptor, it initiates an intracellular sequence of events resulting in phosphorylation of 4E-BP. Phosphorylated 4E-BP no longer binds to eIF4E, and eIF4E is now free to participate in the initiation of protein synthesis.

Similarly, eIF2 is a regulator of the initiation step in protein synthesis. When it is phosphorylated, it is inactive and protein synthesis cannot begin. Conditions such as starvation, heat shock, and viral infection result in phosphorylation of eIF2 by a specific kinase.

The regulation of globin synthesis by heme in reticulocytes illustrates the role of eIF2 in the regulation of translation. Reticulocytes, which are the precursors of red blood cells, synthesize the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin molecules from the globin polypeptide chains and the Fe-binding pigment heme. In the absence of heme, the rate of initiation of globin synthesis decreases. Heme acts by inhibiting the phosphorylation of eIF2. Thus, eIF2 is active in the presence of heme and globin synthesis is initiated.

And finally, both eIF2 and elongation factor 1 (EF1) are types of heterotrimeric G-proteins (see Chapter 11). They dramatically change their conformation and actively form complexes when they bind GTP but become inactive and dissociate when they hydrolyze this GTP to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). GTP can then displace the bound GDP to reactivate eIF2 or EF1.

FIGURE 15.9 Bacterial tRNA containing formyl-methionine. The initial methionine is not formylated in eukaryotic protein synthesis.

Many antibiotics that are used to combat bacterial infections in humans take advantage of the differences between the mechanisms for protein synthesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. For example, streptomycin binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of prokaryotes. It interferes with initiation of protein synthesis and causes misreading of mRNA. Streptomycin, however, was not used to treat PaulT, because it can cause permanent hearing loss. Its use is therefore confined mainly to the treatment of tuberculosis or other infections that do not respond adequately to other antibiotics. Another example is tetracycline, which binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of prokaryotes and inhibits binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site of the ribosome.

These four steps keep repeating until termination occurs. $E F$, elongation factor; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate; $G D P$, guanosine diphosphate; $G T P$, guanosine triphosphate; mRNA, messenger RNA; tRNA, transfer RNA; $P$ site, peptidyl site; $A$ site, aminoacyl site; $E$ site, free tRNA ejection site.

The antibiotic levofloxacin (a quinolone) inhibits two bacterial enzymes: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.The bacterium causing Paul T.'s infection was found to be sensitive to levofloxacin, and this could have been used in place of azithromycin.

## B. Elongation of Polypeptide Chains

After the initiation complex is formed, addition of each amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain involves binding of an aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site on the ribosome, formation of a peptide bond, and translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA to the P site (Fig. 15.10). The peptidyl-tRNA contains the growing polypeptide chain.

## I. Binding of Aminoacyl-tRNA to the A Site

When Met-tRNA ${ }_{i}$ (or a peptidyl-tRNA) is bound to the P site, the mRNA codon in the A site determines which aminoacyl-tRNA will bind to that site. An aminoacyltRNA binds when its anticodon is antiparallel and complementary to the mRNA codon. In eukaryotes, the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA first combines with eEF1A containing bound GTP before binding to the mRNA-ribosome complex. eEF1A is similar to the $\alpha$-subunit of a heterotrimeric G-protein in that it contains GTPase activity (see Chapter 11). When the aminoacyl-tRNA-eEF1A-GTP complex binds to the A site, GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP as the ribosome activates the GTPase activity of eEF1A. This prompts dissociation of eEF1A-GDP from the aminoacyl-tRNA ribosomal complex, thereby allowing protein synthesis to continue. The binding of the appropriate aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site comprises the second error-checking step in protein synthesis. If an improper aminoacyl-tRNA is brought to the A site, the ribosomal activation of the GTPase of eEF1A does not occur and the complex will leave the binding site along with the aminoacyl-tRNA. Only when the GTP is hydrolyzed can eEF1A release the aminoacyl-tRNA and dissociate from the complex.

![ma80486325cc](ma80486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE I 5.II Recycling of eEFIA in eukaryotes. eEFIA contains a GTPase activity, which is activated upon binding to the ribosome. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is hydrolyzed, and eEFIA is released from the ribosome, binding to eEFIB $\alpha$. eEFIB $\alpha$ is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and accelerates the substitution of GTP for the guanosine diphosphate (GDP) on eEFIA. Once this occurs, eEFIA is ready for another round of translation. In prokaryotes, eEFIA corresponds to EF-Tu, and the protein corresponding to eEFIB $\alpha$ is EF-Ts. $E F$, elongation factor; $P$, inorganic phosphate; $P$ site, peptidyl site; $A$ site, aminoacyl site; $E$ site, free tRNA ejection site.

Once released, the free eEF1A-GDP binds with the eEFB1 $\alpha$, which accelerates the replacement of bound GDP with GTP (Figure 15.11). Thus, eEF1A-GTP is ready to bind another aminoacyl-tRNA molecule and continue protein synthesis.

The process of elongation is very similar in prokaryotes, except that the corresponding factor for eEF1A is named $E F-T u$ and the associating elongation factors are called $E F-T s$ instead of eEFB1 $\alpha$.

## 2. Formation of a Peptide Bond

In the first round of elongation, the amino acid on the tRNA in the A site forms a peptide bond with the methionine on the tRNA in the P site. In subsequent rounds of elongation, the amino acid on the tRNA in the A site forms a peptide bond with the peptide on the tRNA in the P site (see Fig. 15.10). Peptidyltransferase, which is not a protein but the rRNA of the large ribosomal subunit, catalyzes the formation of the peptide bond. The tRNA in the A site now contains the growing polypeptide chain, and the tRNA in the P site is uncharged (i.e., it no longer contains an amino acid or a peptide).

## 3. Translocation

Translocation in eukaryotes involves another G-protein, elongation factor eEF2 (EF-G in prokaryotes), that complexes with GTP and binds to the ribosome, causing a conformational change that moves the mRNA and its base-paired tRNAs with respect to the ribosome. The uncharged tRNA moves from the P site to the E site. It is released from the ribosome when the next charged tRNA enters the A site. The peptidyl-tRNA moves into the P site, and the next codon of the mRNA occupies the A site. During translocation, GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, which is released from the ribosome along with the elongation factor (see Fig. 15.10).

## C. Termination of Translation

The three elongation steps are repeated until a termination (stop) codon moves into the A site on the ribosome. Because no tRNAs with anticodons that can pair with stop codons normally exist in cells, release factors bind to the ribosome instead, causing peptidyltransferase to hydrolyze the bond between the peptide chain and tRNA. The newly synthesized polypeptide is released from the ribosome, which dissociates into its individual subunits, releasing the mRNA.

(1)The macrolide antibiotics (e.g, erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin) bind to the 505 ribosomal subunit of bacteria and inhibit translocation. Azithromycin was used to treat Paul T. because he had taken it previously without difficulty. It has less-serious side effects than many other antibiotics and can be used as an alternative drug in patients who are allergic to penicillin, like $\mathrm{M} /$. After 2 weeks of therapy, $\mathrm{M} /$.T. recovered from his infection.

(2)Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that interferes with the peptidyltransferase activity of the 505 ribosomal subunit of bacteria. It was not used to treat Paul T. because it is very toxic to humans, partly because of its effect on mitochondrial protein synthesis.

DIphtheria is a highly contagious disease caused by a toxin secreted by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Although the toxin is a protein, it is not produced by a bacterial gene but by a gene brought into the bacterial cell by an infecting bacteriophage.

Diphtheria toxin is composed of two protein subunits. The B-subunit binds to a cell surface receptor, facilitating the entry of the A -subunit into the cell. In the cell, the A -subunit catalyzes a reaction in which the ADP-ribose (ADPR) portion of NAD is transferred to eEF2 (ADP-ribosylation). In this reaction, the ADPR is attached covalently to a posttranslationally modified histidine residue known as diphthamide.ADP-ribosylation of eEF2 inhibits protein synthesis, leading to cell death. Children, including Edna R/s daughter, should be immunized against this often-fatal disease at an early age, unless there is a contraindication.

$\stackrel{\infty}{\infty}$
Currently, owing to misperceptions of vaccine side effects, some parents are not having their children immunized. The decrease in the incidence of infectious disease in the United States has led to complacency. Anyone who remembers the summertime fear of poliomyelitis in the 1940s and 1950s realizes that immunizations are a blessing that should be available to all children. This has been reinforced by several outbreaks, including the measles outbreak in Anaheim, California, at Disneyland in December 2015.
![ma81486325cc](ma81486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 15.12 A polysome. The complex of messenger RNA (mRNA) and multiple ribosomes, each of which is producing a polypeptide chain, is called a polysome.

Protein synthesis requires a considerable amount of energy. Formation of each aminoacyl-tRNA requires the equivalent of two high-energy phosphate bonds because ATP is converted to AMP and pyrophosphate, which is cleaved to form two inorganic phosphates. As each amino acid is added to the growing peptide chain, two GTPs are hydrolyzed, one at the step involving eEF1A and the second at the translocation step. Thus, four high-energy bonds are cleaved for each amino acid of the polypeptide. In addition, energy is required for initiation of synthesis of a polypeptide chain and for synthesis from nucleoside triphosphate precursors of the mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA involved in translation.

## V. Polysomes

As one ribosome moves along the mRNA, producing a polypeptide chain, a second ribosome can bind to the vacant $5^{\prime}$-end of the mRNA. Many ribosomes can simultaneously translate a single mRNA, forming a complex known as a polysome or polyribosome (Fig. 15.12). A single ribosome covers approximately 80 nucleotides of mRNA. Therefore, ribosomes are positioned on mRNA at intervals of approximately 100 nucleotides. The growing polypeptide chains attached to the ribosomes become longer as each ribosome moves from the $5^{\prime}$-end toward the $3^{\prime}$-end of the mRNA.

## VI. Processing of Proteins

Nascent polypeptide chains (i.e., polypeptides that are in the process of being synthesized) are processed. As they are being produced, they travel through a tunnel in the ribosome, which can hold roughly 30 amino acid residues. As polymerization of the chain progresses, the amino acid residues at the $N$-terminal end begin to emerge from this protected region within the ribosome and to fold and refold into the three-dimensional conformation of the polypeptide. Proteins bind to the nascent polypeptide and mediate the folding process. These mediators are called chaperones (they are members of the heat-shock family of proteins; see Chapter 7) because they prevent improper interactions from occurring. Disulfide-bond formation between cysteine residues is catalyzed by protein disulfide isomerases and may also be involved in producing the three-dimensional structure of the polypeptide.

## VII. Posttranslational Modifications

After proteins emerge from the ribosome, they may undergo posttranslational modifications. The initial methionine is removed by specific proteases; methionine is not the N -terminal amino acid of all mature proteins. Subsequently, other specific cleavages also may occur that convert proteins to more active forms (e.g., the conversion of proinsulin to insulin). In addition, amino acid residues within the peptide chain can be modified enzymatically to alter the activity or stability of the protein, direct the protein to a subcellular compartment, or prepare it for secretion from the cell.

Amino acid residues are modified enzymatically by the addition of various types of functional groups (Table 15.4). For example, the N -terminal amino acid is sometimes acetylated, and methyl groups can be added to lysine residues (methylation). These changes alter the charge on the protein. Proline and lysine residues can be modified by hydroxylation. In collagen, hydroxylation leads to stabilization of the protein. Carboxylations are important especially for the function of proteins involved in blood coagulation. Formation of $\gamma$-carboxyglutamate allows these proteins to chelate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, a step in clot formation. Fatty acids or other hydrophobic groups (e.g., prenyl groups) anchor the protein in membranes (fatty acylation and prenylation). An adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose group can be transferred from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$to certain proteins (ADP-ribosylation). The addition and removal of phosphate groups (which bind covalently to serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues) serve to regulate the activity of many proteins

(e.g., the enzymes of glycogen degradation and regulators of gene transcription) (phosphorylation). Glycosylation, the addition of carbohydrate groups, is a common modification that occurs mainly on proteins that are destined to be secreted or incorporated into lysosomes or cellular membranes.

# VIII. Targeting of Proteins to Subcellular and Extracellular Locations 

Many proteins are synthesized on polysomes in the cytosol. After they are released from ribosomes, they remain in the cytosol, where they carry out their functions. Other proteins synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes enter organelles such as mitochondria or nuclei. These proteins contain amino acid sequences called targeting sequences or signal sequences that facilitate their transport into a certain organelle. Another group of proteins are synthesized on ribosomes bound to the RER. These proteins are destined for secretion or for incorporation into various subcellular organelles (e.g., lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum [ER], Golgi complex) or cellular membranes, including the plasma membrane.

Proteins that enter the RER as they are being synthesized have signal peptides near their $N$ termini that do not have a common amino acid sequence. However, they do contain several hydrophobic residues and are 15 to 30 amino acids in length (Fig. 15.13). A signal-recognition particle (SRP) binds to the ribosome and to the

FIGURE 15.13 Synthesis of proteins on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). (I) Translation of the protein begins in the cytosol. (2) As the signal peptide emerges from the ribosome, a signal-recognition particle (SRP) binds to it and to the ribosome and inhibits further synthesis of the protein.

signal peptide as the nascent polypeptide emerges from the tunnel in the ribosome and translation ceases. When the SRP subsequently binds to an SRP receptor (docking protein) on the RER, translation resumes and the polypeptide begins to enter the lumen of the RER. The signal peptide is removed by the signal peptidase, and the remainder of the newly synthesized protein enters the lumen of the RER. These proteins are transferred in small vesicles to the Golgi complex.

The Golgi complex serves to process the proteins it receives from the RER and to sort them so that they are delivered to their appropriate destinations (Fig. 15.14). Processing, which can be initiated in the ER, involves glycosylation, the addition of carbohydrate groups, and modification of existing carbohydrate chains. Sorting signals permit delivery of proteins to their target locations. For example, glycosylation of enzymes destined to become lysosomal enzymes results in the presence of a mannose 6-phosphate residue on an oligosaccharide attached to the enzyme. This residue is recognized by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor protein, which incorporates the enzyme into a clathrin-coated vesicle. The vesicle travels to endosomes and

FIGURE 15.14 Fate of proteins synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Proteins synthesized on ribosomes attached to the endoplasmic reticulum travel in vesicles to the cis face of the Golgi complex. After the membranes fuse, the proteins enter the Golgi complex. Structural features of the proteins determine their fate. Some remain in the Golgi complex, and some return to the RER. Others bud from the trans face of the Golgi complex in vesicles. These vesicles can become lysosomes or secretory vesicles, depending on their contents. Secretory proteins are released from the cell when secretory vesicles fuse with the cell membrane (exocytosis). Proteins with hydrophobic regions embedded in the membrane of secretory vesicles become cell membrane proteins. See Chapter 10 for descriptions of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, lysosomes, and the cell membrane, and also for an explanation of the process of exocytosis.

is eventually incorporated into lysosomes. Other proteins containing a Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) sequence at their carboxyl terminus are returned to the ER from the Golgi. Proteins with hydrophobic regions can embed in various membranes. Some proteins, whose sorting signals have not yet been determined, enter secretory vesicles and travel to the cell membrane where they are secreted by the process of exocytosis.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Lisa N. Lisa N. has a $\beta^{+}$-thalassemia classified clinically as $\beta$-thalassemia intermedia. She produces an intermediate amount of functional $\beta$-globin chains (her hemoglobin is $7.3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$; normal is 12 to $16 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). In $\beta^{0}$-thalassemia, little or none of the hemoglobin $\beta$-chain is produced. $\beta$-Thalassemia intermedia is usually the result of two different mutations (one that mildly affects the rate of synthesis of $\beta$-globin and one that severely affects its rate of synthesis); or, less frequently, homozygosity for a mild mutation in the rate of synthesis; or a complex combination of mutations. The mutations that cause the thalassemias have been studied extensively, and some are summarized in Table 15.5. For each of these mutations, the student should now be able to explain why the mutation results in a $\beta^{+}$- or $\beta^{0}$-thalassemia.

Jay S. The molecular biology-genetics laboratory's report on Jay S.'s white blood cells indicated that he had a deficiency of hexosaminidase A caused by a defect in the gene encoding the $\alpha$-subunit of this enzyme (variant B, Tay-Sachs disease). Hexosaminidases are lysosomal enzymes that are necessary for the normal degradation of glycosphingolipids such as the gangliosides. Gangliosides are found in high concentrations in neural ganglia, although they are produced in many areas of the nervous system. When the activity of these degradative enzymes is absent or subnormal, partially degraded gangliosides accumulate in lysosomes in various cells of the central nervous system, causing a wide array of neurologic disorders known collectively as gangliosidoses. When the enzyme deficiency is severe, symptoms appear within the first 3 to 5 months of life. Eventually, symptoms include upper and lower motor neuron deficits, visual difficulties that can progress to blindness, seizures, and increasing cognitive dysfunction. By the second year of life, the patient may regress to a completely vegetative state, often succumbing to bronchopneumonia caused by aspiration or an inability to cough.

Edna R. With the availability of diphtheria toxoid as part of the almost universal diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis ( DTaP ) immunization practiced in the United States, fatalities caused by infection by the grampositive bacillus C. diphtheriae are rare. Most children, as is the case with Edna R.'s daughter Beverly, are immunized. In unimmunized individuals, however, symptoms are caused by a bacterial exotoxin encoded by a phage that infects the bacterial cells. The toxin enters human cells, inhibiting protein synthesis and, ultimately, causing cell death. Complications related to cardiac and nervous system involvement are the major causes of morbidity and mortality. Patients for whom a definitive diagnosis of diphtheria is established are treated with equine diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotics.

Paul T. Paul's use of the antibiotic azithromycin effectively cleared up his pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae. His physician released Paul with no further follow up appointments necessary.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Antibiotics that Inhibit Protein Synthesis. The processes of translation on bacterial ribosomes and on the cytoplasmic ribosomes of eukaryotic cells have many similarities, but there are several subtle differences. Antibiotics

0I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II) is an inherited disorder of protein targeting. Lysosomal proteins are not sorted properly from the Golgi to the lysosomes, and lysosomal enzymes end up being secreted from the cell. This is because of a mutation in the enzyme N -acetylglucosamine phosphotransferase, which is a required first step for attaching the lysosomal targeting signal, mannose 6-phosphate, to lysosomal proteins. Thus, lysosomal proteins cannot be targeted to the lysosomes, and these organelles become clogged with materials that cannot be digested, destroying overall lysosomal function. This leads to a lysosomal storage disease of severe consequence, with death before the age of 8 years.

act at steps at which these differences occur, and different antibiotics target each of the major steps of protein synthesis (Table 15.6). Therefore, these compounds can be used selectively to prevent bacterial protein synthesis and inhibit bacterial proliferation while having little or no effect on human cells. Caution must be exercised in their use, however, because some of the antibiotics affect human mitochondria, which have a protein-synthesizing system similar to that of bacteria. Another problem with these drugs is that bacteria can become resistant to their action. Mutations in genes that encode the proteins or RNA of bacterial ribosomes can cause resistance. Resistance also

results when bacteria take up plasmids that carry genes for inactivation of the antibiotic. Because of the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics, strains of bacteria are rapidly developing that are resistant to all known antibiotics.

Streptomycin. Streptomycin inhibits translation initiation by binding to three proteins and probably the 16 S rRNA of the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria. Abnormal initiation complexes, known as streptomycin monosomes, accumulate. Streptomycin can also cause misreading of mRNA, resulting in premature termination of translation or in the incorporation of incorrect amino acids into polypeptide chains that have already been initiated. The use of this antibiotic is limited because it causes ototoxicity that can result in loss of hearing.

Tetracycline. Tetracycline binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria and prevents an aminoacyl-tRNA from binding to the A site on the ribosome. This effect of the drug is reversible; thus, when the drug is removed, bacteria resume protein synthesis and growth, resulting in a rekindling of the infection. Furthermore, tetracycline is not absorbed well from the intestine, and its concentration can become elevated in the contents of the gut, leading to changes in the intestinal flora. Because it has been used to treat human infections and has been added to animal feed to prevent animal infections, humans have had extensive exposure to tetracycline. As a result, resistant strains of bacteria have developed.

Chloramphenicol. Chloramphenicol binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria and prevents binding of the amino acid portion of the aminoacyl-tRNA, effectively inhibiting peptidyltransferase action. This antibiotic is used only for certain extremely serious infections such as meningitis and typhoid fever. Chloramphenicol readily enters human mitochondria, where it inhibits protein synthesis. Cells of the bone marrow often fail to develop in patients treated with chloramphenicol, and use of this antibiotic has been linked to fatal blood dyscrasias, including an aplastic anemia.

Erythromycin. Erythromycin and the other macrolide antibiotics bind to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria near the binding site for chloramphenicol. They prevent the translocation step, the movement of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site on the ribosome. Because the side effects are less severe and more readily reversible than those of many other antibiotics, the macrolides are often used to treat infections in persons who are allergic to penicillin, an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell-wall synthesis. However, bacterial resistance to erythromycin is increasing. Therefore, its close relative, azithromycin, is often used.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Translation is the process of translating the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA to an amino acid sequence of a protein.
- Translation proceeds from the amino to the carboxyl terminus, reading the mRNA in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction.

- Protein synthesis occurs on ribosomes.
- The mRNA is read in codons, sets of three nucleotides that specify individual amino acids.
- AUG, which specifies methionine, is the start codon for all protein synthesis.
- Specific stop codons (UAG, UGA, and UAA) signal when the translation of the mRNA is to end.
- Amino acids are linked covalently to tRNA by the enzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, creating charged tRNA.
- Charged tRNAs base-pair with the codon via the anticodon region of the tRNA.
- Protein synthesis is divided into three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.
- Multiprotein factors are required for each stage of protein synthesis.
- Proteins fold as they are synthesized.
- Specific amino acid side chains may be modified after translation by a process known as posttranslational modification.
- Mechanisms within eukaryotic cells specifically target newly synthesized proteins to different compartments in the cell.
- Table 15.7 summarizes the diseases discussed in this chapter.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. It is important to note that the question is asking about prokaryotic mechanisms. In prokaryotes, there is no nucleus (thus, E cannot be correct), and translation begins before transcription is terminated (coupled translation-transcription, thus B is incorrect). Therefore, before the ribosome can move from one codon to the next (translocation), or the protein synthesis machinery terminates (via termination factors), the initiating tRNA must bind and align with the mRNA to initiate translation, indicating that answer A is the first step of the choices listed that must occur.
2. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Because the extract contains all normal components, the Cys-tRNA charged with alanine will compete with Cys-tRNA charged with cysteine for binding to the cysteine codons. Thus, the protein will have some alanines put in the place of cysteine, leading to a deficiency of cysteine residues. Answer A is incorrect because the tRNA recognizes the cysteine codon, not the alanine codon. Answer B is incorrect because of the competition mentioned previously.
3. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. In order to answer this question, one first needs to find the start codon: AUG in mRNA and ATG in DNA. Bases 3 to 5 in the sequence contain this element. Next, the sequence needs to specify a phenylalanine residue near the amino terminus, which is UUU or UUC in mRNA, or TTT or TTG in DNA, but these sequences need to be in frame with the initiating methionine codon. The last element to look for is the absence of a premature stop codon because this protein is 300 amino acids long. There is no stop sequence in the remaining bases of this piece of DNA. For answer B, the last three bases of this sequence are TGA, which in mRNA would be UGA, and this is an in-frame stop signal. This sequence would not give rise to a protein that contained 300 amino acids. For answer C, the TTT in that sequence (bases 10 to 12) are not in frame with the initiating methionine, indicating that there is not a phenylalanine near the amino terminus in the protein encoded by this sequence. For answers D and E, there are no ATG sequences, indicating that the initiating
methionine is absent and that this stretch of DNA cannot code for the amino-terminal end of a protein.
4. The answer is $\mathbf{F}$. $N$-Formyl-methionine is used for the initiation of prokaryotic protein synthesis but not eukaryotic protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, the mRNA is processed within the nucleus and then exported into the cytoplasm before ribosomes can bind to it, so there is no nuclear mRNA-ribosome complex formed. Splicing occurs in the nucleus, but splicing errors will not alter translation. Eukaryotic translation requires an initiator tRNA for methionine, so if that tRNA were unavailable, there would be no eukaryotic translation occurring. The cap on eukaryotic mRNA is necessary for appropriate IF binding to allow the charged initiator tRNA and ribosomes to bind to the mRNA. In the absence of cap formation, eukaryotic translation would be inhibited.
5. The answer is B. The codons for Phe are UUC and UUU. Leucine has six codons, and single nucleotide changes in four of those codons would result in a Phe codon. This is not the case for Pro, Gly, Asn, or Arg codons; in order to convert those codons to a Phe codon, two nucleotide changes are required. Answering this question required consultation with the genetic code.
6. The answer is $\mathbf{E}$. A nonsense codon is the conversion of a codon to a stop codon. The stop codons are UGA, UAG, and UAA. The codon for Trp is UGG, which can be converted to UGA or UAG with a single nucleotide change. None of the other amino acid codons, with a single nucleotide change, can be converted into a stop codon.
7. The answer is $\mathbf{E}$. A single mutation of one amino acid (valine for glutamate) causes sickle cell anemia. This change specifies a different amino acid (missense). A silent mutation specifies the same amino acid and has no consequence. A nonsense mutation is a change to a stop codon. An insertion is an addition of at least one base within the DNA. A deletion is a loss of at least one base in the DNA sequence. Sickle cell anemia could also be considered a point mutation since only a single base is changed which codes for a different amino acid.

8. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. There is no coding sequence between the TATA box (the promoter region where RNA polymerase binds) and the transcription initiation site, so the presence of a TAG in the DNA will not affect protein synthesis. In fact, the RNA corresponding to this sequence (UAG) will not even be synthesized because the transcription initiation site occurs after this sequence in the DNA. The introns and exons are not affected by this mutation, and splicing will occur normally. Thus, the mRNA produced would be of normal size and would produce a normal-sized protein.
9. The answer is B. All tRNA molecules have the nucleotides CCA added to the $3^{\prime}$-end of the tRNA after it has been transcribed. The ribose on the $3^{\prime}$-terminal adenine is the one that accepts amino acids to form aminoacyltRNA. The absence of this A residue would prevent the charging of the tRNA molecules, which would lead to cessation of all protein synthesis. It would require several generations of growth such that any functional
enzyme produced would have been degraded after that many generations. Spliceosomes are eukaryoticspecific because bacterial genes do not contain introns that need to be spliced from the initial transcript. There are multiple aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and lacking one would lead to incomplete protein synthesis (protein synthesis would stop when this particular charged tRNA needed to be brought to the ribosome), but some protein synthesis would occur. Prokaryotic RNA is not capped; nor are poly(A) tails added to each mRNA, as in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes do not contain a nucleus.
10. The answer is D. Diphtheria toxin catalyzes the ADPribosylation of eEF2, thereby inhibiting the activity of this factor, which is required for the translocation step of protein synthesis. The toxin does not affect RNA polymerase II, the peptidyltransferase activity of the large ribosomal subunit, the initiation complex required for ribosome assembly, or the termination steps of protein synthesis.

# Regulation of Gene Expression 

Gene expression, the generation of a protein or RNA product from a particular gene, is controlled by complex mechanisms. Normally, only a fraction of the genes in a cell are expressed at any time. Gene expression is regulated differently in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

Regulation of Gene Expression in Prokaryotes. In prokaryotes, gene expression is regulated mainly by controlling the initiation of gene transcription. Sets of genes that encode proteins with related functions are organized into operons, and each operon is under the control of a single promoter (or regulatory region). Regulatory proteins called repressors bind to the promoter and inhibit the binding of RNA polymerase (negative control), whereas activator proteins facilitate RNA polymerase binding (positive control). Repressors are controlled by nutrients or their metabolites, classified as inducers or corepressors. Regulation also may occur through attenuation of transcription.

Eukaryotes: Regulation of Gene Expression at the Level of DNA. In eukaryotes, activation of a gene requires changes in the state of chromatin (chromatin remodeling) that are facilitated by acetylation of histones and methylation of bases. These changes in DNA determine which genes are available for transcription.

Regulation of Eukaryotic Gene Transcription. Transcription of specific genes is regulated by proteins (called specific transcription factors or transactivators) that bind to gene regulatory sequences (called promoter-proximal elements, response elements, or enhancers) that activate or inhibit assembly of the basal transcription complex and RNA polymerase at a TATA box or similar regulatory element. These specific transcription factors, which may bind to DNA sequences some distance from the promoter, interact with coactivators or corepressors that bind to components of the basal transcription complex. These protein factors are said to work in "trans"; the DNA sequences to which they bind are said to work in "cis."

Other Sites for Regulation of Eukaryotic Gene Expression. Regulation also occurs during the processing of RNA, during RNA transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and at the level of translation in the cytoplasm. Regulation can occur simultaneously at multiple levels for a specific gene, and many factors act in concert to stimulate or inhibit expression of a gene.

He is receiving multidrug chemotherapy with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone).

Mannie W. is a 56-year-old man who complains of weight loss related to a decreased appetite and increased fatigue. He notes discomfort in the left upper quadrant of his abdomen. On physical examination, he is noted to be pale and to have ecchymoses (bruises) on his arms and legs. His spleen is markedly enlarged.

Initial laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of $10.4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ (normal $=13.5$ to $17.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) and a leukocyte (white blood cell) count of 106,000 cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ (normal $=4,500$ to 11,000 cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ). The majority of the leukocytes are granulocytes (white blood cells arising from the myeloid lineage), some of which have an "immature" appearance. The percentage of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood is decreased. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy show the presence of an abnormal chromosome (the Philadelphia chromosome) in dividing marrow cells.

Ann R., who has anorexia nervosa, has continued on an almost meat-free diet (see Chapters 1, 3, 9, and 11). She now appears emaciated and pale. Her hemoglobin is $9.7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ (normal $=12$ to $16 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), her hematocrit (volume of packed red cells) is $31 \%$ (reference range for women $=36 \%$ to $46 \%$ ), and her mean corpuscular volume (the average volume of a red cell) is 70 femtoliters (fL; 1 fL is $10^{-15} \mathrm{~L}$ ) (reference range $=80$ to 100 fL ). These values indicate an anemia that is microcytic (small red cells) and hypochromic (light in color, indicating a reduced amount of hemoglobin per red cell). Her serum ferritin (the cellular storage form of iron) was also subnormal. Her plasma level of transferrin (the iron transport protein in plasma) is higher than normal, but its percentage saturation with iron is below normal. This laboratory profile is consistent with changes that occur in an iron deficiency state.

## I. Gene Expression Is Regulated for Adaptation and Differentiation

Virtually all cells of an organism contain identical sets of genes. However, at any given time, only a small number of the total genes in each cell are expressed (i.e., generate a protein or RNA product). The remaining genes are inactive. Organisms gain several advantages by regulating the activity of their genes. For example, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells adapt to changes in their environment by turning the expression of genes on and off. Because the processes of RNA transcription and protein synthesis consume a considerable amount of energy, cells conserve fuel by making proteins only when they are needed.

In addition to regulating gene expression to adapt to environmental changes, eukaryotic organisms alter expression of their genes during development. As a fertilized egg becomes a multicellular organism, different kinds of proteins are synthesized in varying quantities. In humans, as the child progresses through adolescence and then into adulthood, physical and physiologic changes result from variations in gene expression and, therefore, of protein synthesis. Even after an organism has reached the adult stage, regulation of gene expression enables certain cells to undergo differentiation to assume new functions.

Many of the drugs used by Charles F. inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells in various ways. Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is a large nonpolar molecule synthesized by fungi that intercalates between DNA bases, inhibiting replication and transcription and forming DNA with single- and double-strand breaks.Vincristine binds to tubulin and inhibits formation of the mitotic spindle, thereby preventing cell division. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that damages DNA by covalently attaching alkyl groups to DNA bases. Rituximab is an anti-CD20 antibody which specifically targets B-cells (including the tumor cells) for destruction (a form of immunotherapy). Prednisone is a steroid hormone; its effect on cancer cells is not exactly understood, but it is given to help manage the side effects of the other agents.

4The measurement of iron in the blood needs to account for iron associated with hemoglobin, free iron, and iron bound to its carrier protein, transferrin. When a physician orders a determination of serum iron, the order refers to ferric iron $\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right)$ bound to transferrin and not to the ferrous iron $\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right)$ bound to circulating hemoglobin (which may be present in the plasma as a result of occasional red-cell lysis). Measurement of ferric iron has been adapted to automated spectrophotometric analysis. In most cases, the samples are acidified to remove the ferric ion from transferrin. The iron is then reduced to the ferrous state by a reducing agent (such as ascorbic acid), and the level of iron is determined by its binding to a dye that changes color when ferrous ion binds to it.

The total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is determined by adding ferric ion to the sample to saturate all transferrin-binding sites in the sample. Excess iron (free iron, not bound to transferrin) is precipitated by treatment with $\mathrm{MgCO}_{3}$, and the precipitate is removed by centrifugation. The resulting soluble sample is then analyzed for $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, as described previously. By comparing the levels of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ bound both before and after saturation, one can determine what percentage of transferrin contained bound iron. For a woman between the ages of 16 and 40 years, the percentage saturation should be in the range of $20 \%$ to $50 \%$. Ann R.'s iron saturation is below this normal range, indicating an iron deficiency.

FIGURE 16.I Escherichia coli cell. In prokaryotes, DNA is not separated from the rest of the cellular contents by a nuclear envelope; therefore, simultaneous transcription and translation occur in bacteria. Once a small piece of messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized, ribosomes bind to the mRNA and translation begins.

## II. Regulation of Gene Expression in Prokaryotes

Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms and therefore require less complex regulatory mechanisms than the multicellular eukaryotes (Fig. 16.1). The most extensively studied prokaryote is the bacterium Escherichia coli, an organism that thrives in the human colon, usually enjoying a symbiotic relationship with its host. Based on the size of its genome ( $4 \times 10^{6}$ base pairs), E. coli should be capable of making several thousand proteins. However, under normal growth conditions E. coli synthesizes only about 600 to 800 different proteins. Thus, many genes are inactive and E. coli will only synthesize those genes that generate the proteins required for growth in that particular environment.

All E. coli cells of the same strain are morphologically similar and contain an identical circular chromosome (see Fig. 16.1). As in other prokaryotes, DNA is not complexed with histones, no nuclear envelope separates the genes from the contents of the cytoplasm, and gene transcripts do not contain introns. In fact, as messenger RNA (mRNA) is being synthesized, ribosomes bind and begin to produce proteins, so that transcription and translation occur simultaneously (known as coupled transcription-translation). The mRNA molecules in E. coli have a very short halflife and are degraded within a few minutes. mRNA molecules must be constantly generated from transcription to maintain synthesis of its proteins. Thus, regulation of transcription, principally at the level of initiation, is sufficient to regulate the level of proteins within the cell.

## A. Operons

The genes encoding proteins are called structural genes. In the bacterial genome, the structural genes for proteins involved in performing a related function (such as the enzymes of a biosynthetic pathway) are often grouped sequentially into units called operons (Fig. 16.2, and see Fig. 14.6). The genes in an operon are coordinately expressed; that is, they are either all turned on or all turned off. When an operon is expressed, all of its genes are transcribed (refer to Chapter 14, Section III). A single polycistronic mRNA is produced that codes for all of the proteins of the operon. This polycistronic mRNA contains multiple sets of start and stop codons that allow several different proteins to be produced from this single transcript at the translational level. Transcription of the genes in an operon is regulated by the promoter, which is located in the operon at the $5^{\prime}$-end, upstream from the structural genes.

## B. Regulation of RNA Polymerase Binding by Repressors

In bacteria, the principal means of regulating gene transcription is through repressors, which are regulatory proteins that prevent the binding of RNA polymerase
![ma85486325cc](ma85486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 16.2 An operon. The structural genes of an operon are transcribed as one long polycistronic messenger RNA (mRNA). During translation, different start (AUG) and stop (UAA, UGA or UAG) codons lead to several distinct proteins being produced from this single mRNA.

to the promoter and thus act on initiation of transcription (Fig. 16.3). In general, regulatory mechanisms such as repressors, which work through inhibition of gene transcription, are referred to as negative control, and mechanisms that work through stimulation of gene transcription are called positive control.

The repressor is encoded by a regulatory gene (see Fig. 16.3). Although this gene is considered part of the operon, it is not always located near the remainder of the operon. Its product, the repressor protein, diffuses to the promoter and binds to a region of the operon called the operator. The operator is located within the promoter or near its $3^{\prime}$-end, just upstream from the transcription start point. When a repressor is bound to the operator, the operon is not transcribed because the repressor protein either physically blocks the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter or prevents the RNA polymerase from initiating transcription. Two regulatory mechanisms work through controlling repressors: induction (an inducer inactivates the repressor) and repression (a corepressor is required to activate the repressor).

## I. Inducers

Induction involves a small molecule, known as an inducer, which stimulates expression of the operon by binding to the repressor and changing its conformation so that it can no longer bind to the operator (Fig. 16.4). The inducer is either a nutrient or a metabolite of the nutrient. In the presence of the inducer, RNA polymerase can therefore bind to the promoter and transcribe the operon. The key to this mechanism is that in the absence of the inducer, the repressor is active, transcription is repressed, and the genes of the operon are not expressed.

Consider, for example, induction of the lac operon of E. coli by lactose (Fig. 16.5). The enzymes for metabolizing glucose by glycolysis are produced constitutively; that is, they are constantly being made. If the milk sugar lactose is available, the cells adapt and begin to produce the three additional enzymes required for lactose metabolism, which are encoded by the lac operon. A metabolite of lactose (allolactose) serves as an inducer, binding to the repressor and inactivating it. Because the inactive repressor no longer binds to the operator, RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter and transcribe the structural genes of the lac operon, producing a polycistronic mRNA that encodes for the three additional proteins. However, the presence of glucose can prevent activation of the lac operon (see "Stimulation of RNA Polymerase Binding" in Section II.C). It is important to realize that the lac operon is expressed at very low levels (basal levels) even in the absence of repressor. Thus, even in the absence of lactose, a small amount of permease is present in the cellular membrane. Therefore, when lactose does become available in the environment, a few molecules of lactose are able to enter the cell and can be metabolized to allolactose. The few molecules of allolactose produced are sufficient to induce the operon. As the amount of permease increases, more lactose can be transported into the cell to be used as an energy source.

## 2. Corepressors

In a regulatory model called repression, the repressor is inactive until a small molecule called a corepressor (a nutrient or its metabolite) binds to the repressor, activating it (Fig. 16.6). The repressor-corepressor complex then binds to the operator, preventing binding of RNA polymerase and gene transcription. Consider, for example, the trp operon, which encodes the five enzymes required for the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan. When tryptophan is available, E. coli cells save energy by no longer making these enzymes. Tryptophan is a corepressor that binds to the inactive repressor, causing it to change conformation and bind to the operator, thereby inhibiting transcription of the operon. Thus, in the repression model, the repressor is inactive without a corepressor; in the induction model, the repressor is active unless an inducer is present.

## Repressors

FIGURE 16.3 Regulation of operons by repressors. When the repressor protein is bound to the operator (a DNA sequence adjacent to, or within, the promoter), RNA polymerase cannot bind, and transcription therefore does not occur. mRNA, messenger RNA.

FIGURE 16.4 An inducible operon. In the absence of an inducer, the repressor binds to the operator, preventing the binding of RNA polymerase. When the inducer is present, the inducer binds to the repressor, inactivating it. The inactive repressor no longer binds to the operator. Therefore, RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter region and transcribe the structural genes. mRNA, messenger RNA.

FIGURE 16.5 The protein products of the lac operon. Lactose is a disaccharide that is hydrolyzed to glucose and galactose by $\beta$-galactosidase (the $Z$ gene). Both glucose and galactose can be oxidized by the cell for energy. The permease ( $Y$ gene) enables the cell to take up lactose more readily. The $A$ gene produces a transacetylase that acetylates $\beta$-galactosides. The function of this acetylation is not clear. The promoter binds RNA polymerase and the operator binds a repressor protein. Lactose is converted to allolactose, an inducer that binds the repressor protein and prevents it from binding to the operator. Transcription of the lac operon also requires activator proteins that are inactive when glucose levels are high. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $m R N A$, messenger RNA.

# C. Stimulation of RNA Polymerase Binding 

In addition to regulating transcription by means of repressors that inhibit RNA polymerase binding to promoters (negative control), bacteria regulate transcription by means of activating proteins that bind to the promoter and stimulate the binding of RNA polymerase (positive control). Transcription of the lac operon, for example, can be induced by allolactose only if glucose is absent. The presence or absence of glucose is communicated to the promoter by a regulatory protein named the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) (Fig. 16.7). This regulatory protein is also called a catabolite activator protein (CAP). A decrease in glucose levels increases levels of the intracellular second messenger cAMP by a

Co-repressors

FIGURE 16.7 Catabolite repression of stimulatory proteins. The lac operon is used as an example. A. The inducer allolactose (a metabolite of lactose) inactivates the repressor. However, because of the absence of the required coactivator, cAMP-CRP, no transcription occurs unless glucose is absent. B. In the absence of glucose, cAMP levels rise. cAMP forms a complex with the cAMP receptor protein (CRP). The binding of the cAMP-CRP complex to a regulatory region of the operon permits the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter. Now, the operon is transcribed, and the proteins are produced. cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; mRNA, messenger RNA.
mechanism that involves glucose transport into the bacteria. cAMP binds to CRP and the cAMP-CRP complex binds to a regulatory region of the operon, stimulating binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter and transcription. When glucose is present, cAMP levels decrease, CRP assumes an inactive conformation that does not bind to the operon, and the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the promoter is reduced, resulting in inhibition of transcription. Thus, the enzymes encoded by the lac operon are not produced if cells have an adequate supply of glucose, even if lactose is present at very high levels.

# D. Regulation of RNA Polymerase Binding by Sigma Factors 

E. coli has only one RNA polymerase. Sigma factors bind to this RNA polymerase, stimulating its binding to certain sets of promoters, thus simultaneously activating transcription of several operons. The standard sigma factor in E. coli is $\sigma^{70}$, a protein with a molecular weight of 70,000 Da (see Chapter 14). Other sigma factors also exist. For example, $\sigma^{32}$ helps RNA polymerase recognize promoters for the different operons that encode the heat-shock proteins. Thus, increased transcription of the

genes for heat-shock proteins, which prevent protein denaturation at high temperatures, occurs in response to elevated temperatures.

# E. Attenuation of Transcription 

Some operons are regulated by a process that interrupts (attenuates) transcription after it has been initiated (Fig. 16.8). For example, high levels of tryptophan attenuate transcription of the E. coli trp operon as well as repress its transcription. As mRNA is being transcribed from the trp operon, ribosomes bind and rapidly begin to translate the transcript. Near the $5^{\prime}$-end of the transcript are several codons for tryptophan. Initially, high levels of tryptophan in the cell result in high levels of $\operatorname{Trp-tRNA}{ }^{\text {Trp }}$ and rapid translation of the transcript. However, rapid translation generates a hairpin loop in the mRNA that serves as a termination signal for RNA polymerase, and transcription terminates. Conversely, when tryptophan levels are low, levels of $\operatorname{Trp-tRNA}{ }^{\text {Trp }}$ are low, and ribosomes stall at codons for tryptophan. A different hairpin loop forms in the mRNA that does not terminate transcription, and the complete mRNA is transcribed. Attenuation requires coupled transcription and translation, so this mechanism is not applicable to eukaryotic systems.

The tryptophan, histidine, leucine, phenylalanine, and threonine operons are regulated, in part, by attenuation. Repressors and activators also act on the promoters of some of these operons, allowing the levels of these amino acids to be very carefully and rapidly regulated.
![ma92486325cc](ma92486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 16.8 Attenuation of the trp operon. Sequences 2, 3, and 4 in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript can form base pairs ( 2 with 3 or 3 with 4 ) that generate hairpin loops. When tryptophan levels are low, the ribosome stalls at the adjacent Trp codons in sequence I, the $2-3$ loop forms, and transcription continues. When tryptophan levels are high, translation is rapid and the ribosome blocks formation of the $2-3$ loop. Under these conditions, the 3-4 loop forms and terminates transcription.

## III. Regulation of Gene Expression in Eukaryotes

Multicellular eukaryotes are much more complex than single-celled prokaryotes. As the human embryo develops into a multicellular organism, different sets of genes are turned on and different groups of proteins are produced, resulting in differentiation into morphologically distinct cell types that are able to perform different functions. Even beyond development, certain cells within the organism continue to differentiate, such as those that produce antibodies in response to an infection, renew the population of red blood cells, and replace digestive cells that have been sloughed into the intestinal lumen. All of these physiologic changes are dictated by complex alterations in gene expression.

## A. Regulation at Multiple Levels

Differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells result in different mechanisms for regulating gene expression. DNA in eukaryotes is organized into the nucleosomes of chromatin, and genes must be in an active structure to be expressed in a cell. Furthermore, operons are not present in eukaryotes, and the genes that encode proteins that function together are usually located on different chromosomes. For example, the gene for $\alpha$-globin is on chromosome 16, whereas the gene for $\beta$-globin is on chromosome 11. Thus, each gene needs its own promoter. In addition, the processes of transcription and translation are separated in eukaryotes by intracellular compartmentation (nucleus and cytosol, or endoplasmic reticulum [ER]) and by time (eukaryotic heterogeneous nuclear RNA [hnRNA, also known as pre-RNA] must be processed and translocated out of the nucleus before it is translated). Thus, regulation of eukaryotic gene expression occurs at multiple levels:

- DNA and the chromosome, including chromosome remodeling and gene rearrangement
- Transcription, primarily through transcription factors that affect binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter
- Processing of transcripts
- Initiation of translation and stability of mRNA

Once a gene is activated through chromatin remodeling, the major mechanism of regulating expression affects initiation of transcription at the promoter.

## B. Regulation of Availability of Genes for Transcription

Once a haploid sperm and egg combine to form a diploid cell, the number of genes in human cells remains approximately the same. As cells differentiate, different genes are available for transcription. A typical nucleus contains chromatin that is condensed (heterochromatin) and chromatin that is diffuse (euchromatin) (see Chapter 12). The genes in heterochromatin are inactive, whereas those in euchromatin produce mRNA. Long-term changes in the activity of genes occur during development as chromatin goes from a diffuse to a condensed state or vice versa.

The cellular genome is packaged together with histones into nucleosomes, and initiation of transcription is prevented if the promoter region is part of a nucleosome. Thus, activation of a gene for transcription requires changes in the state of the chromatin, called chromatin remodeling. The availability of genes for transcription also can be affected in certain cells, or under certain circumstances, by gene rearrangements, amplification, or deletion. For example, during lymphocyte maturation, genes are rearranged to produce a variety of different antibodies. The term epigenetics is used to refer to changes in gene expression without altering the sequence of the DNA. Chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation are such changes that can be inherited and that contribute to the regulation of gene expression.

## I. Chromatin Remodeling

The remodeling of chromatin generally refers to displacement of the nucleosome from specific DNA sequences so that transcription of the genes in that sequence can

Alteration of gene expression is a common finding in cancer cells. Alterations in HAT or HDAC activity may contribute to dysregulation of cellular proliferation in certain tumors. These alterations in HAT or HDAC activity are usually caused by mutations in transcription factors or coactivators, which have either enhanced, or reduced, their ability to recruit HATs or HDACs to a preinitiation complex at the promoter. HDACs have been shown to be excellent therapeutic targets for drugs that inhibit their activity. Some of these inhibitors display antiproliferative activity on a variety of human cancer cell lines and are currently in clinical trials.

Methylation has been implicated in genomic imprinting, a process that occurs during the formation of the eggs or sperm that blocks the expression of the gene in the fertilized egg. Males methylate a different set of genes than females. This sex-dependent differential methylation has been studied most extensively in two human disorders, Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. Both syndromes, which have very different symptoms, result from deletions of the same region of chromosome 15 (a microdeletion of $<S$ megabases in size). If the deletion is inherited from the father, Prader-Willi syndrome is seen in the child. If the deletion is inherited from the mother, Angelman syndrome is observed. A disease occurs when a gene that is in the deleted region of one chromosome is methylated on the other chromosome. The mother methylates different genes than the father, so different genes are expressed depending on which parent transmitted the intact chromosome. For example, for PraderWilli syndrome, if genes 1, 2, and 3 are deleted in the paternal chromosome and gene 2 is methylated (Me) in the maternal chromosome, only genes I and 3 will be expressed. For Angelman syndrome, genes 1, 2, and 3 are deleted on the maternal chromosome and gene I is methylated on the paternal chromosome, so only genes 2 and 3 are expressed.

FIGURE 16.9 Histone acetylation. CoA, coenzyme A; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase.
be initiated. This occurs through two different mechanisms. The first mechanism is by an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-driven chromatin remodeling complex, which uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind certain sections of DNA from the nucleosome core. The second mechanism is by covalent modification of the histone tails through acetylation (Fig. 16.9). Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) transfer an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) to lysine residues in the histone tails (the amino-terminal ends of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) of the histone octamer. This reaction removes a positive charge from the $\varepsilon$-amino group of the lysine, thereby reducing the electrostatic interactions between the histones and the negatively charged DNA, making it easier for DNA to unwind from the histones. The acetyl groups can be removed by histone deacetylases (HDAC). Each histone has several lysine residues that may be acetylated and, through a complex mixing of acetylated and nonacetylated sites, different segments of DNA can be freed from the nucleosome. Several transcription factors and coactivators contain HAT activity, which facilitates the binding of these factors to the DNA and also facilitates simultaneous activation of the gene and initiation of its transcription.

## 2. Methylation of DNA

Cytosine residues in DNA can be methylated to produce 5-methylcytosine. The methylated cytosines are located in CG-rich sequences (called $C G$ or $C p G$ islands), which are often near or in the promoter region of a gene. In certain instances, genes that are methylated are less readily transcribed than those that are not methylated. For example, globin genes are more extensively methylated in nonerythroid cells (cells that are not a part of the erythroid, or red blood cell, lineage) than in cells in which these genes are expressed (e.g., erythroblasts and reticulocytes). Methylation is a mechanism for regulating gene expression during differentiation, particularly in fetal development.

## 3. Gene Rearrangement

Segments of DNA can move from one location to another in the genome, associating with each other in various ways so that different proteins are produced (Fig. 16.10). The most thoroughly studied example of gene rearrangement occurs in cells that produce antibodies. Antibodies contain two light chains and two heavy chains, each of which contains both a variable region and a constant region (see Chapter 7, Section VIII, Fig. 7.19). Cells called B-cells make antibodies. In the precursors of B-cells, hundreds of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{H}}$ sequences, approximately $20 \mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{H}}$ sequences and approximately 6 $\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{H}}$ sequences, are located in clusters within a long region of the chromosome (see Fig. 16.10). During the production of the immature B-cells, a series of recombinational events occurs that joins one $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{H}}$, one $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{H}}$, and one $\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{H}}$ sequence into a single exon.

![ma95486325cc](ma95486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 16.10 Rearrangement of DNA. The heavy-chain gene from which lymphocytes produce immunoglobulins is generated by combining specific segments from among a large number of potential sequences in the DNA of precursor cells. The variable and constant regions of immunoglobulins (antibodies) are described in Chapter 7.

This exon now encodes the variable region of the heavy chain of the antibody. Given the large number of immature B-cells that are produced, virtually every recombinational possibility occurs, so that all VDJ combinations are represented within this cell population. Later in development, during differentiation of mature B-cells, recombinational events join a VDJ sequence to one of the nine heavy-chain elements. When the immune system encounters an antigen, the one immature B-cell that can bind to that antigen (because of its unique manner of forming the VDJ exon) is stimulated to proliferate (clonal expansion) and to produce antibodies against the antigen.

## 4. Gene Amplification

Gene amplification is not the usual physiologic means of regulating gene expression in normal cells, but it does occur in response to certain stimuli if the cell can obtain a growth advantage by producing large amounts of a protein. In gene amplification, certain regions of a chromosome undergo repeated cycles of DNA replication. The newly synthesized DNA is excised and forms small, unstable chromosomes called double minutes. The double minutes integrate into other chromosomes throughout the genome, thereby amplifying the gene in the process. Normally, gene amplification occurs through errors during DNA replication and cell division, and, if the environmental conditions are appropriate, cells containing amplified genes may have a growth advantage over those without the amplification.

## 5. Gene Deletions

With a few exceptions, the deletion of genetic material is likewise not a normal means of controlling transcription, although such deletions do result in disease. Gene deletions can occur through errors in DNA replication and cell division and are usually noticed only if a disease results. For example, various types of cancers result from the loss of a good copy of a tumor-suppressor gene, leaving the cell with a mutated copy of the gene (see Chapter 18).

## C. Regulation at the Level of Transcription

The transcription of active genes is regulated by controlling assembly of the basal transcription complex containing RNA polymerase and its binding to distinct elements of the promoter, such as the TATA or Inr box (see Chapter 14). The basal transcription complex contains $\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{II}} \mathrm{D}$ (which binds to elements within the promoter, such as the TATA or Inr box), and other proteins called general (basal) transcription factors (such as $\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{II}} \mathrm{A}$ ) that form a complex with RNA polymerase II. Additional transcription factors that are ubiquitous to all promoters bind upstream at various sites in the promoter region. They increase the frequency of transcription and are required for a promoter to function at an adequate level. Genes that are regulated solely by these consensus elements in the promoter region are said to be constitutively expressed.

The control region of a gene also contains DNA regulatory sequences that are specific for that gene and may increase its transcription 1,000-fold or more (Fig. 16.11). Gene-specific transcription factors (also called transactivators or activators) bind to these regulatory sequences and interact with mediator proteins such

Although rearrangements of short DNA sequences are difficult to detect, microscopists have observed major rearrangements for many years. Such major rearrangements, known as translocations, can be observed in metaphase chromosomes under the microscope. Mannie W. has such a translocation, known as the Philadelphia chromosome because it was first observed in that city. The Philadelphia chromosome is produced by a balanced exchange between chromosomes 9 and 22. In this translocation, most of a gene from chromosome 9, the c-dbl gene, is transferred to the $B C R$ gene on chromosome 22. This creates a fused $B C R$-abl gene. The c-dbl gene is a tyrosine kinase (see Chapter 11), and its regulation by the BCR promoter results in uncontrolled growth stimulation rather than differentiation in cells containing this translocation.

$\sigma$Historically, non-Hodgkin lymphoma was treated with methotrexate, and this drug is still used in certain cases of lymphoma. It inhibits cell proliferation by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. Dihydrofolate reductase reduces dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, a cofactor required for synthesis of thymine and purine nucleotides. Methotrexate resistance, however, was frequently observed in patients. Sometimes, rapidly dividing cancer cells treated with methotrexate amplify the gene for dihydrofolate reductase, producing hundreds of copies in the genome. These cells generate large amounts of dihydrofolate reductase, and normal doses of methotrexate are no longer adequate. Gene amplification is one of the mechanisms by which patients become resistant to a drug. Methotrexate is no longer used for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, having been supplanted by specific immunotherapy.

FIGURE I6.II The gene regulatory control region consists of the promoter region and additional gene regulatory sequences, including enhancers and hormone response elements (HRE). In this case, a promoter containing a TATA box is shown. Gene regulatory proteins that bind directly to DNA (regulatory DNA-binding proteins) are usually called specific transcription factors or transactivators; they may be either activators or repressors of the transcription of specific genes. The specific transcription factors bind mediator proteins (coactivators or corepressors) that interact with the general transcription factors of the basal transcription complex. The basal transcription complex contains RNA polymerase and associated general transcription factors ( $\mathrm{TF}_{8}$ factors) and binds, in this case, to the TATA box of the promoter, initiating gene transcription.

In fragile $X$ syndrome, a GCC triplet is amplified on the $5^{\prime}$-side of a gene (fragile $X$ mental retardation I [FMR-I]) associated with the disease. This gene is located on the $X$ chromosome. The disease is named for the finding that when cells containing this triplet repeat expansion are cultured in the absence of folic acid (which impairs nucleotide production and hence the replication of DNA), the $X$ chromosome develops single- and double-strand breaks in its DNA. These were termed fragile sites. It was subsequently determined that the FMR-I gene was located in one of these fragile sites. A normal person has about 30 copies of the GCC triplet, but in affected individuals, thousands of copies can be present. This syndrome, which is a common form of inherited intellectual developmental disorder, affects about I in 3,500 males and I in 4,000 to I in 6,000 females worldwide.
as coactivators. By forming a loop in the DNA, coactivators interact with the basal transcription complex and can activate its assembly at the initiation site on the promoter. These DNA regulatory sequences may be some distance from the promoter and may be either upstream or downstream of the initiation site.

Depending on the system, the terminology used to describe components of gene-specific regulation varies somewhat. For example, in the original terminology, DNA regulatory sequences called enhancers bound transactivators, which bound coactivators. Similarly, silencers bound corepressors. Hormones bound to hormone receptors, which bound to hormone response elements in DNA. Although these terms are still used, they are often replaced by more general terms such as DNA regulatory sequences and specific transcription factors, in recognition of the fact that many transcription factors activate one gene while inhibiting another or that a specific transcription factor may be changed from a repressor to an activator by phosphorylation.

## I. Gene-Specific Regulatory Proteins

The regulatory proteins that bind directly to DNA sequences are most often called transcription factors or gene-specific transcription factors (if it is necessary to distinguish them from the general transcription factors of the basal transcription complex). They also can be called activators (or transactivators), inducers, repressors, or nuclear receptors. In addition to their DNA-binding domain, these proteins usually have a domain that binds to mediator proteins (coactivators, corepressors, or TATA-binding protein-associated factors [TAFs]). Coactivators, corepressors, and

other mediator proteins do not bind directly to DNA but generally bind to components of the basal transcription complex and mediate its assembly at the promoter. They can be specific for a given gene transcription factor or general and bind many different gene-specific transcription factors. Certain coactivators have HAT activity, and certain corepressors have histone deacetylase activity. When the appropriate interactions among the transactivators, coactivators, and the basal transcription complex occur, the rate of transcription of the gene is increased (induction).

Some regulatory DNA-binding proteins inhibit (repress) transcription and may be called repressors. Repression can occur in several ways. A repressor bound to its specific DNA sequence may inhibit binding of an activator to its regulatory sequence. Alternatively, the repressor may bind a corepressor that inhibits binding of a coactivator to the basal transcription complex. The repressor may bind a component of the basal transcription complex directly. Some steroid hormone receptors that are transcription factors bind either coactivators or corepressors, depending on whether the receptor contains bound hormone. Furthermore, a particular transcription factor may induce transcription when it is bound to the regulatory sequence of one gene and may repress transcription when it is bound to the regulatory sequence of another gene.

# 2. Transcription Factors that Are Steroid Hormone/Thyroid Hormone Receptors 

In humans, steroid hormones and other lipophilic hormones activate or inhibit transcription of specific genes through binding to nuclear receptors that are gene-specific transcription factors (Fig. 16.12A). The nuclear receptors bind to DNA regulatory sequences called hormone response elements and induce or repress transcription of

FIGURE 16.12 Steroid hormone receptors. A. Domains of the steroid hormone receptor. The transactivation domain (TAD) binds coactivators; DNA-binding domain (DBD) binds to the hormone response element in DNA; ligand-binding domain (LBD) binds hormone; NLS is the nuclear localization signal; the dimerization sites are the portions of the protein involved in forming a dimer.

In a condition known as androgen insensitivity, patients produce androgens (the male sex steroids), but target cells fail to respond to these steroid hormones because they lack the appropriate intracellular transcription factor receptors (androgen receptors). Therefore, the transcription of the genes responsible for masculinization is not activated. A patient with this condition has an $X Y$ (male) karyotype (set of chromosomes) but has external characteristics of a female. External male genitalia do not develop, but testes are present, usually in the inguinal region or abdomen.

FIGURE 16.13 Activity of the thyroid hormone receptor-retinoid receptor dimer (TRRXR) in the presence and absence of thyroid hormone $\left(\mathrm{T}_{3}\right)$. HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase.
target genes. The receptors contain a hormone (ligand)-binding domain, a DNAbinding domain, and a dimerization domain that permits two receptor molecules to bind to each other, forming characteristic homodimers or heterodimers. A transactivation domain binds the coactivator proteins that interact with the basal transcription complex. The receptors also contain a nuclear localization signal domain that directs them to the nucleus at various times after they are synthesized.

Various members of the steroid hormone/thyroid hormone receptor family work in different ways. The glucocorticoid receptor, which binds the steroid hormone cortisol, resides principally in the cytosol bound to heat-shock proteins. As cortisol binds, the receptor dissociates from the heat-shock proteins, exposing the nuclear localization signal (see Fig. 16.12B). The receptors form homodimers that are translocated to the nucleus, where they bind to the hormone response elements (glucocorticoid response elements [GRE]) in the DNA control region of certain genes. The transactivation domains of the receptor dimers bind mediator proteins, thereby activating transcription of specific genes and inhibiting transcription of others.

Other members of the steroid hormone/thyroid hormone family of receptors are also gene-specific transactivation factors but generally form heterodimers that bind constitutively to a DNA regulatory sequence in the absence of their hormone ligand and repress gene transcription (Fig. 16.13). For example, the thyroid hormone receptor forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) that binds to thyroid hormone response elements and to corepressors (including one with histone deacetylase activity), thereby inhibiting expression of certain genes. When thyroid hormone binds, the receptor dimer changes conformation and the transactivation domain binds coactivators, thereby initiating transcription of the genes.

The RXR, which binds the retinoid 9-cis-retinoic acid, can form heterodimers with at least eight other nuclear receptors. Each heterodimer has a different DNA binding specificity. This allows the RXR to participate in the regulation of a wide variety of genes and to regulate gene expression differently, depending on the availability of other active receptors.

# 3. Structure of DNA-Binding Proteins 

Several unique structural motifs have been characterized for specific transcription factors. Each of these proteins has a distinct recognition site (DNA-binding domain) that binds to the bases of a specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA. Four of the best-characterized structural motifs are zinc fingers, b-zip proteins (including leucine zippers), helix-turn-helix, and helix-loop-helix.

Zinc-finger motifs (commonly found in the DNA-binding domain of steroid hormone receptors) contain a bound zinc chelated at four positions with either histidine or cysteine in a sequence of approximately 20 amino acids (Fig. 16.14). The result is a relatively small, tight, autonomously folded domain. The zinc is required
![ma100486325cc](ma100486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 16.14 Zinc fingers of the estrogen receptor. In each of the two zinc fingers, one zinc ion is coordinated with four cysteine residues, shown in red. The region labeled $\alpha$-helix with NRS forms an $\alpha$-helix that contains a nucleotide recognition signal (NRS). This signal consists of a sequence of amino acid residues that bind to a specific base sequence in the major groove of DNA. Regions enclosed in boxed arrows participate in rigid helices.

![ma101486325cc](ma101486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 16.15 Interaction of DNA-binding proteins with DNA. A. Zinc-finger motifs consist of an $\alpha$-helix and a $\beta$-sheet in which four cysteine and/or histidine residues coordinately bind a zinc ion. The nucleotide recognition signal (contained within the $\alpha$-helix) of at least one zinc finger binds to a specific sequence of bases in the major groove of DNA. B. Leucine-zipper motifs form from two distinct polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide contains a helical region in which leucine residues are exposed on one side. These leucines form hydrophobic interactions with each other, causing dimerization. The remaining helices interact with DNA. C. Helix-turn-helix motifs contain three (or sometimes four) helical regions, one of which binds to DNA, whereas the others lie on top and stabilize the interaction. D. Helix-loop-helix motifs contain helical regions that bind to DNA like leucine zippers. However, their dimerization domains consist of two helices, each of which is connected to its DNA-binding helix by a loop.
to maintain the tertiary structure of this domain. Eukaryotic transcription factors generally have two to six zinc-finger motifs that function independently. At least one of the zinc fingers forms an $\alpha$-helix containing a nucleotide recognition signal, a sequence of amino acids that fits specifically into the major groove of DNA (Fig. 16.15A).

As an example of zinc-finger transcription factors, two estrogen receptors combine to form a dimer that binds to a palindrome in the promoter region of certain genes (see Figs. 16.11 and 16.12). A palindrome is a sequence of bases that is identical on both the parallel and the antiparallel strand, and which could base pair together. For example, the sequence $5^{\prime}$-ATCGCGAT-3' base-pairs to form the sequence $3^{\prime}$-TAGCGCTA-5', which, when written in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction, is ATCGCGAT. Each estrogen receptor is approximately 73 amino acids long and contains two zinc fingers. Each zinc is chelated to two cysteines in an $\alpha$-helix and two cysteines in a $\beta$-sheet region. The position of the nucleotide recognition sequence in an $\alpha$-helix keeps the sequence in a relatively rigid conformation as it fits into the major groove of DNA. The zinc finger that lies closest to the carboxyl terminus is involved in dimerization with the second estrogen receptor, thus inverting the nucleotide recognition sequence to match the other half of the palindrome. The dimer-palindrome requirement enormously enhances the specificity of binding, and, consequently, only those genes with the appropriate DNA sequences are affected. A wide variety of transcription factors contain the zinc-finger motif, including the steroid hormone receptors such as the estrogen and the glucocorticoid receptors. Other transcription factors that contain zinc-finger motifs include Sp1 and polymerase III transcription factor $\mathrm{TF}_{\text {III }} \mathrm{A}$ (part of the basal transcription complex), which has nine zinc-finger motifs.

Leucine zippers also function as dimers to regulate gene transcription (see Fig. 16.15B). The leucine-zipper motif is an $\alpha$-helix of 30 to 40 amino acid residues that contains a leucine every seven amino acids, positioned so that they align on the same side of the helix. Two helices dimerize so that the leucines of one helix align with the other helix through hydrophobic interactions to form a coiled coil. The dimers can be either homodimers or heterodimers (e.g., the transcription factor AP1 is a heterodimer whose subunits are coded by the fos and jun genes). The portions of the dimer adjacent to the zipper "grip" the DNA through basic amino acid residues (arginine and lysine) that bind to the negatively charged phosphate groups. This DNA-binding portion of the molecule also contains a nucleotide recognition signal.

Before the advent of specifically targeted monoclonal antibody therapy, the cytokine interferon was used to treat tumors of blood cell origin. Interferons, cytokines produced by cells that have been infected with a virus, bind to the cytokine family of cell surface receptors. When an interferon binds, JAK (jonus kinase, a receptorassociated tyrosine kinase) phosphorylates a STAT transcription factor (see Chapter II). The phosphorylated STAT proteins are released from the JAKreceptor complex, dimerize, enter the nucleus, and bind to specific gene regulatory sequences. Different combinations of phosphorylated STAT proteins bind to different sequences and activate transcription of a different set of genes. One of the genes activated by interferon produces the oligonucleotide $2^{\prime}$-5'-oligo(A), which is an activator of a ribonuclease. This RNase degrades mRNA, thus inhibiting synthesis of the viral proteins required for its replication. In addition to stimulating degradation of mRNA, interferon also leads to the phosphorylation of $\mathrm{eIF} 2 \alpha$ (a necessary factor for protein synthesis), which inactivates the $\mathrm{eIF} 2 \alpha$ complex. This enables interferon to prevent the synthesis of viral proteins.

In addition to antiviral effects, interferons were shown to have antitumor effects. The mechanisms of the antitumor effects are not well understood but are probably likewise related to stimulation of specific gene expression by STAT proteins. Interferon- $\alpha$, produced by recombinant DNA technology, had been used in the past to treat patients such as Charles F, who have certain types of nodular lymphomas, and patients such as Mannie W, who have chronic myelogenous leukemia. As targeted therapy became available to reduce the side effects of treatments, interferon therapy was reduced in scope.

In the helix-turn-helix motif, one helix fits into the major groove of DNA, making most of the DNA-binding contacts (see Fig. 16.15C). It is joined to a segment containing two additional helices that lie across the DNA-binding helix at right angles. Thus, a very stable structure is obtained without dimerization. An example of helix-turn-helix transcriptions factors is the homeodomain proteins (proteins that play critical roles in the regulation of gene expression during development).

Helix-loop-helix transcription factors are a fourth structural type of DNAbinding protein (see Fig. 16.15D). They also function as dimers that fit around and grip DNA in a manner geometrically similar to leucine-zipper proteins. The dimerization region consists of a portion of the DNA-gripping helix and a loop to another helix. Like leucine zippers, helix-loop-helix factors can function as either hetero- or homodimers. These factors also contain regions of basic amino acids near the amino terminus and are also called basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins. Many of the transcription factors containing the helix-loop-helix motif are involved in cellular differentiation (such as myogenin in skeletal muscle, neurogenin in neurogenesis, and SCL/tal-1 in hematopoiesis and blood cell development).

## 4. Regulation of Transcription Factors

The activity of gene-specific transcription factors is regulated in several different ways. Because transcription factors must interact with a variety of coactivators to stimulate transcription, the availability of coactivators or other mediator proteins is critical for transcription factor function. If a cell upregulates or downregulates its synthesis of coactivators, the rate of transcription can also be increased or decreased. Transcription factor activity can be modulated by changes in the amount of transcription factor synthesized (see Section III.C.5), by binding a stimulatory or inhibitory ligand (e.g., steroid hormone binding to the steroid hormone receptors) and by stimulation of nuclear entry (illustrated by the glucocorticoid receptor). The ability of a transcription factor to influence the transcription of a gene is also augmented or antagonized by the presence of other transcription factors. For example, the thyroid hormone receptor is critically dependent on the concentration of the retinoid receptor to provide a dimer partner. Another example is provided by the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase gene, which is induced or repressed by a variety of hormone-activated transcription factors (see Section III.C.5). Frequently, transcription factor activity is regulated through phosphorylation.

Growth factors, cytokines, polypeptide hormones, and several other signal molecules regulate gene transcription through phosphorylation of specific transcription factors by receptor kinases. Examples include STAT proteins, which are transcription factors phosphorylated by cytokine receptors, and Smad proteins, which are transcription factors phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinase receptors such as the transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ ) receptor (see Chapter 11).

Nonreceptor kinases, such as protein kinase A, also regulate transcription factors through phosphorylation. Many hormones generate the second messenger cAMP, which activates protein kinase A. Activated protein kinase A enters the nucleus and phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB ( $c$ AMP response element-binding protein). CREB is constitutively bound to the DNA response element CRE ( $c$ AMP response element) and is activated by phosphorylation. Other hormone signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, also lead to the phosphorylation of CREB (as well as many other transcription factors).

## 5. Multiple Regulators of Promoters

The same transcription factor inducer can activate transcription of many different genes if the genes each contain a common response element. Furthermore, a single inducer can activate sets of genes in an orderly, programmed manner (Fig. 16.16). The inducer initially activates one set of genes. One of the protein products of this

![ma102486325cc](ma102486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 16.16 Activation of sets of genes by a single inducer. Each gene in a set has a common DNA regulatory element so that one regulatory protein can activate all the genes in the set. In the example shown, the first regulatory protein stimulates the transcription of genes $A$ and $B$, which have a common DNA regulatory sequence in their control regions. The protein product of gene $B$ is itself a transcriptional activator, which in turn stimulates the transcription of genes $E, F$, and $G$, which likewise contain common response elements. mRNA, messenger RNA.
set of genes can then act as a specific transcription factor for another set of genes. If this process is repeated, the net result is that one inducer can set off a series of events that results in the activation of many different sets of genes.

An example of a transcriptional cascade of gene activation is observed during adipocyte (fat cell) differentiation. Fibroblast-like cells can be induced to form adipocytes by the addition of dexamethasone (a steroid hormone), cAMP-elevating agents, and insulin to the cells. These factors induce the transient expression of two similar transcription factors named C/EPB- $\beta$ and C/EPB- $\delta$. The names stand for CCAAT enhancer-binding protein, and $\beta$ and $\delta$ are two forms of these factors that recognize CCAAT sequences in DNA. The C/EPB transcription factors then induce the synthesis of yet another transcription factor, named the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR- $\gamma$ ), which forms heterodimers with RXR to regulate the expression of yet another transcription factor, C/EPB- $\alpha$. The combination of PPAR- $\gamma$ and C/EPB- $\alpha$ then leads to the expression of adipocytespecific genes.

An individual gene contains many different response elements and enhancers, and genes that encode different protein products contain different combinations of response elements and enhancers. Thus, each gene does not have a single unique protein that regulates its transcription. Rather, as different proteins are stimulated to bind to their specific response elements and enhancers in a given gene, they act cooperatively to regulate expression of that gene (Fig. 16.17). Overall, a relatively small number of response elements and enhancers and a relatively small number of regulatory proteins generate a wide variety of responses from different genes.

(2)The enzyme PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK) is required for the liver to produce glucose from amino acids and lactate.
Ann $\mathbf{R}$, who has an eating disorder, needs to maintain a certain blood glucose level to keep her brain functioning normally. When her blood glucose levels drop, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) and glucagon (a polypeptide hormone) are released. In the liver, glucagon increases intracellular cAMP levels, resulting in activation of protein kinase A and subsequent phosphorylation of CREB. Phosphorylated CREB binds to its response element in DNA, as does the cortisol receptor. Both transcription factors enhance transcription of the PEPCK gene (see Fig. 16.17). Insulin, which is released when blood glucose levels rise after a meal, can inhibit expression of this gene, in part by leading to the dephosphorylation of CREB.

FIGURE 16.17 A simplified view of the regulatory region of the PEPCK gene. Boxes represent various response elements in the $5^{\prime}$-flanking region of the gene. Not all elements are labeled. Regulatory proteins bind to these DNA elements and stimulate or inhibit the transcription of the gene. This gene encodes the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), which catalyzes a reaction of gluconeogenesis (the pathway for production of glucose) in the liver. Synthesis of the enzyme is stimulated by glucagon (by a cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP]mediated process), by glucocorticoids, and by thyroid hormone. Synthesis of PEPCK is inhibited by insulin. CRE, cAMP response element; $T R E$, thyroid hormone response element; $G R E$, glucocorticoid response element; $I R E$, insulin response element.

# D. Posttranscriptional Processing of RNA 

After the gene is transcribed (i.e., posttranscription), regulation can occur during processing of the RNA transcript (hnRNA) into the mature mRNA. The use of alternative splice sites or sites for addition of the poly(A) tail (polyadenylation sites) can result in the production of different mRNAs from a single hnRNA and, consequently, in the production of different proteins from a single gene.

## I. Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation Sites

Processing of the primary transcript involves the addition of a cap to the $5^{\prime}$-end, removal of introns, and polyadenylation (the addition of a poly(A) tail to the $3^{\prime}$-end) to produce the mature mRNA (see Chapter 14). In certain instances, the use of alternative splicing and polyadenylation sites causes different proteins to be produced from the same gene. For example, genes that code for antibodies are regulated by alterations in the splicing and polyadenylation sites, in addition to undergoing gene rearrangement (Fig. 16.18). At an early stage of maturation, pre-B-lymphocytes produce immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies that are bound to the cell membrane. Later, a shorter protein (immunoglobulin D [IgD]) is produced that no longer binds to the cell membrane but is secreted from the cell.
![ma104486325cc](ma104486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 16.18 Production of a membrane-bound antibody (immunoglobulin $M$ [IgM]) and a smaller secreted antibody (immunoglobulin $D$ [IgD]) from the same gene. Initially, the lymphocytes produce a long transcript that is cleaved and polyadenylated after the second stop codon. The intron that contains the first stop codon is removed by splicing between the $5^{\prime}$ - and $3^{\prime}$-splice sites. Therefore, translation ends at the second stop codon, and the protein contains a hydrophobic exon at its C-terminal end that becomes embedded in the cell membrane. After antigen stimulation, the cells produce a shorter transcript by using a different cleavage and polyadenylation site. This transcript lacks the $3^{\prime}$-splice site for the intron, so the intron is not removed. In this case, translation ends at the first stop codon. The lgD antibody does not contain the hydrophobic region at its $C$ terminus, so it is secreted from the cell. mRNA, messenger RNA.

![ma105486325cc](ma105486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 16.19 RNA editing. In liver, the apolipoprotein B (ApoB) gene produces a protein that contains 4,563 amino acids. In intestinal cells, the same gene produces a protein that contains only 2,152 amino acids. Conversion of a C to a U (through deamination) in the RNA transcript generates a stop codon in the intestinal messenger RNA (mRNA). Thus, the protein produced in the intestine (named apoB-48) is only $48 \%$ of the length of the protein produced in the liver (named apoB-100).

## 2. RNA Editing

In some instances, RNA is "edited" after transcription. Although the sequence of the gene and the primary transcript (hnRNA) are the same, bases are altered or nucleotides are added or deleted after the transcript is synthesized, so the mature mRNA differs in different tissues (Fig. 16.19). This leads to the synthesis of proteins with different activities in those tissues.

## E. Regulation at the Level of Translation and the Stability of mRNA

Although the regulation of expression of most genes occurs at the level of transcription initiation, some genes are regulated at the level of initiation of translation, whereas others are regulated by altering the stability of the mRNA transcript.

## I. Initiation of Translation

In eukaryotes, regulation of gene expression at the level of translation usually involves the initiation of protein synthesis by eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), which are regulated through mechanisms that involve phosphorylation (see Chapter 15, Section IV). For example, heme regulates translation of globin mRNA in reticulocytes by controlling the phosphorylation of eIF2 $\alpha$ (Fig. 16.20). In reticulocytes (red blood cell precursors), globin is produced when heme levels in the cell are high but not when they are low. Because reticulocytes lack nuclei, globin synthesis must be regulated at the level of translation rather than at transcription. Heme acts by preventing phosphorylation of eIF2 $\alpha$ by a specific kinase (hemeregulated inhibitor kinase) that is inactive when heme is bound. Thus, when heme levels are high, $\mathrm{eIF} 2 \alpha$ is not phosphorylated and is active, resulting in globin synthesis. Similarly, in other cells, conditions such as starvation, heat shock, or viral infections may result in activation of a specific kinase that phosphorylates eIF2 $\alpha$ to an inactive form. Another example is provided by insulin, which stimulates general protein synthesis by inducing the phosphorylation of 4E-BP, a binding protein for eIF4E. When 4E-BP, in its nonphosphorylated state, binds eIF4E, the initiating protein is sequestered from participating in protein synthesis. When 4E-BP is phosphorylated, as in response to insulin binding to its receptor on the cell surface, the 4E-BP dissociates from eIF4E, leaving eIF4E in the active form, and protein synthesis is initiated.
![ma106486325cc](ma106486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 16.20 Heme prevents inactivation of $\mathrm{eIF} 2 \alpha$. When $\mathrm{eIF} 2 \alpha$ is phosphorylated by heme-regulated inhibitor kinase, it is inactive and protein synthesis cannot be initiated. Heme inactivates the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase, thereby preventing phosphorylation of $\mathrm{eIF} 2 \alpha$ and activating translation of the globin messenger RNA (mRNA). IF, initiation factor.

![ma107486325cc](ma107486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 16.21 Translational regulation of ferritin synthesis. The messenger RNA (mRNA) for ferritin has an iron response element (IRE). When the iron response element-binding protein (IRE-BP) does not contain bound iron, it binds to IRE, preventing translation. When IREBP binds iron, it dissociates and the mRNA is translated.
A different mechanism for regulation of translation is illustrated by iron regulation of ferritin synthesis (Fig. 16.21). Ferritin, the protein involved in the storage of iron within cells, is synthesized when iron levels increase. The mRNA for ferritin has an iron response element (IRE), consisting of a hairpin loop near its $5^{\prime}$-end, which can bind a regulatory protein called the iron response elementbinding protein (IRE-BP). When IRE-BP does not contain bound iron, it binds to the IRE and prevents initiation of translation. When iron levels increase and IRE-BP binds iron, it changes to a conformation that can no longer bind to the IRE on the ferritin mRNA. Therefore, the mRNA is translated and ferritin is produced.

## 2. microRNAs

microRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that regulate protein expression at a posttranscriptional level. An miRNA can either induce the degradation of a target mRNA or block translation of the target mRNA. In either event, the end result is reduced expression of the target mRNA.
miRNAs were first discovered in nematodes and have since been shown to be present in plant and animal cells. There are believed to be approximately 1,000 miRNA genes in the human genome, some of which are located within the introns of the genes they regulate. Other miRNA genes are organized into operons, such that certain miRNA families are produced at the same time. It is also evident that one miRNA can regulate multiple mRNA targets and that a particular mRNA may be regulated by more than one miRNA.

The biogenesis of miRNA is shown in Figure 16.22. miRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II and is capped and polyadenylated in the same manner as mRNA. The initial RNA product is designated the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA). The primiRNA is modified in the nucleus by an RNA-specific endonuclease named Drosha, in concert with a double-stranded RNA-binding protein, DGCR9/Pasha. The action of Drosha is to create a stem-loop RNA structure of about 70 to 80 nucleotides in length, which is the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). The pre-miRNA is exported form the nucleus to the cytoplasm (via the protein exportin 5), where it interacts with another RNA endonuclease named Dicer and Dicer's binding partner transactivation response RNA-binding protein (TRBP). Dicer cleaves the pre-miRNA to mature miRNA (a double-stranded RNA with a two-nucleotide overhang at the ends). One of the strands of the miRNA (known as the guide strand) is incorporated into the
![ma108486325cc](ma108486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 16.22 MicroRNA (miRNA) synthesis and action. miRNA genes are transcribed in the nucleus by RNA polymerase II, generating the primary miRNA, processed to a precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), and then exported to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNA is further processed by a ribonuclease (Dicer), and the resulting double-stranded miRNA is strand-selected, with the guide strand (designated in black) entering the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The guide strand of RISC targets the complex to the $3^{\prime}$-untranslated region of the target messenger RNA (mRNA), leading to either degradation of the mRNA or an inhibition of translation.

RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), while the other RNA strand (the passenger strand) is degraded. The major protein in RISC is known as argonaute. It is the RISC that will block translation of the target mRNA.

The guide strand leads the RISC to the target mRNA, as the guide strand forms base pairs within a section of the $3^{\prime}$-untranslated region of the mRNA. If there is a high homology in base pairing, then argonaute, a ribonuclease, will degrade the mRNA. However, if the homology between the guide strand and the target mRNA is poor (owing to mismatches), then translation of the mRNA will be blocked.

The net result of miRNA expression is the loss of target mRNA translation. As miRNAs have multiple targets, and these targets will vary from tissue to tissue, an alteration in miRNA expression will have profound effects on gene expression within cells. As will be discussed in Chapter 18, tumors can result from the loss, or overexpression, of miRNA genes.

## F. Transport and Stability of mRNA

Stability of an mRNA also plays a role in regulating gene expression because mRNAs with long half-lives can generate more protein than can those with shorter half-lives. The mRNA of eukaryotes is relatively stable (with half-lives measured in hours to days), although it can be degraded by nucleases in the nucleus or cytoplasm before it is translated. To prevent degradation during transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, mRNA is bound to proteins that help to prevent its degradation. Sequences at the $3^{\prime}$-end of the mRNA appear to be involved in determining its halflife and binding proteins that prevent degradation. One of these is the poly(A) tail, which protects the mRNA from attack by nucleases. As mRNA ages, its poly(A) tail becomes shorter.

An example of the role of mRNA degradation in control of translation is provided by the transferrin receptor mRNA (Fig. 16.23). The transferrin receptor is a protein located in cell membranes that permits cells to take up transferrin, the protein that transports iron in the blood. The rate of synthesis of the transferrin receptor increases when intracellular iron levels are low, enabling cells to take up more iron. Synthesis of the transferrin receptor, like that of the ferritin receptor, is regulated by the binding of the IRE-BP to the IREs. However, in the case of the transferrin receptor mRNA, the IREs are hairpin loops located at the $3^{\prime}$-end of the mRNA and not at the $5^{\prime}$-end where translation is initiated. When the IRE-BP does not contain bound iron, it has a high affinity for the IRE hairpin loops. Consequently, IRE-BP prevents degradation of the mRNA when iron levels are low, thus permitting synthesis of more transferrin receptor so that the cell can take up more iron. Conversely, when iron levels are elevated, IRE-BP binds iron and has a low affinity for the IRE hairpin loops of the mRNA. Without bound IRE-BP at its $3^{\prime}$-end, the mRNA is rapidly degraded and the transferrin receptor is not synthesized.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Charles F. Follicular lymphomas are one of the most common subsets of non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( $\sim 30 \%$ of cases). Patients with a more aggressive course, as seen in Charles F., die within 3 to 5 years after diagnosis if left untreated. In patients treated with multidrug chemotherapy (in this case, R-CHOP), a positive response rate of $96 \%$ has been reported, with a 5 -year overall survival of approximately $80 \%$.

Mannie W. Mannie W. has chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a hematologic disorder in which the proliferating leukemic cells are believed to originate from a single line of primitive myeloid cells. It is classified as one of the myeloproliferative disorders, and CML is distinguished by the presence of a specific cytogenetic abnormality of the dividing marrow cells known as the

0Follicular lymphoma is one type of nonHodgkin lymphoma. The most frequent form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. A recent study has shown that miRNA expression is different between these two different types of tumors and is different from normal B-cells. miRNA "signatures" are being developed for different tumor types, with the ultimate goal being individualized therapy based on the miRNA expression profile in a particular tumor. For example, in follicular lymphoma (which is the disorder displayed by Charles F.), the majority of misexpressed miRNAs are overexpressed, whereas in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, these genes exhibit reduced expression. Therapeutic treatments are being developed to downregulate expression of the altered miRNAs in follicular lymphoma, which should alter overall gene expression in the tumor cells and perhaps halt their runaway proliferation. Such approaches show promise as molecular medicine becomes an important tool in the physician's arsenal for treating disease.

Transferrin receptor synthesis
![ma109486325cc](ma109486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 16.23 Regulation of degradation of the messenger RNA (mRNA) for the transferrin receptor (TfR). Degradation of the TfR mRNA is prevented by binding of the iron response element-binding protein (IRE-BP) to IREs, which are hairpin loops located at the $3^{\prime}$ end of the transferrin receptor mRNA. When iron levels are high, IRE-BP binds iron and is not bound to the TfR mRNA. The TfR mRNA is rapidly degraded, preventing synthesis of the transferrin receptor.

Omnipotent stem cells in the bone marrow normally differentiate and mature in a highly selective and regulated manner, becoming red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Cytokines stimulate differentiation of the stem cells into the lymphoid and myeloid lineages. The lymphoid lineage gives rise to B- and T-lymphocytes, which are white blood cells that work together to generate antibodies for the immune response. The myeloid lineage gives rise to three types of progenitor cells: erythroid, granulocytic-monocytic, and megakaryocytic. The erythroid progenitor cells differentiate into red blood cells (erythrocytes), and the other myeloid progenitors give rise to nonlymphoid white blood cells and platelets. Various medical problems can affect this process. In Mannie W., who has CML, a single line of primitive myeloid cells undergo the event which leads to the Philadelphia chromosome being generated. This produces leukemic cells that proliferate abnormally, causing a large increase in the number of white blood cells in the circulation. The Philadelphia chromosome is a somatic translocation not found in the germ line. In Lisa N., who has a deficiency of red blood cells caused by her $\beta^{+}$-thalassemia (see Chapter 15), differentiation of precursor cells into mature red blood cells is stimulated to compensate for the anemia.

Ann R. has a hypochromic anemia, which means that her red blood cells are pale because they contain low levels of hemoglobin. Because of her iron deficiency, her reticulocytes do not have sufficient iron to produce heme, the required prosthetic group of hemoglobin. Consequently, eIF2 $\alpha$ is phosphorylated in her reticulocytes and cannot activate initiation of globin translation.

Philadelphia chromosome, found in $>90 \%$ of cases. In most instances, the cause of CML is unknown, but the disease occurs with an incidence of around 1.5 per 100,000 population in Western societies.

Ann R. Ann R.'s iron stores are depleted. Normally, about $16 \%$ to $18 \%$ of total body iron is contained in ferritin, which contains a spherical protein (apoferritin) that is capable of storing as many as 4,000 atoms of iron in its center. When an iron deficiency exists, serum and tissue ferritin levels fall. Conversely, the levels of transferrin (the blood protein that transports iron) and the levels of the transferrin receptor (the cell surface receptor for transferrin) increase.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

$\Rightarrow$ Regulation of Transcription by Iron. A cell's ability to acquire and store iron is a carefully controlled process. Iron obtained from the diet is absorbed in the intestine and released into the circulation, where it is bound by transferrin, the iron transport protein in plasma. When a cell requires iron, the plasma iron-transferrin complex binds to the transferrin receptor in the cell membrane and is internalized into the cell. Once the iron is freed from transferrin, it then binds to ferritin, which is the cellular storage protein for iron. Ferritin has the capacity to store up to 4,000 molecules of iron per ferritin molecule. Both transcriptional and translational controls work to maintain intracellular levels of iron (see Figs. 16.21 and 16.23). When iron levels are low, the IRE-BP binds to specific hairpin structures on both the ferritin and transferrin receptor mRNAs. This binding event stabilizes the transferrin receptor mRNA so that it can be translated and the number of transferrin receptors in the cell membrane increased. Consequently, cells will take up more iron, even when plasma transferrin/iron levels are low. The binding of IRE-BP to the ferritin mRNA, however, blocks translation of the mRNA. With low levels of intracellular iron, there is little iron to store and less need for intracellular ferritin. Thus, the IRE-BP can stabilize one mRNA and block translation from a different mRNA.

What happens when iron levels rise? Iron will bind to the IRE-BP, thereby decreasing its affinity for mRNA. When the IRE-BP dissociates from the transferrin receptor mRNA, the mRNA becomes destabilized and is degraded, leading to less receptor being synthesized. Conversely, dissociation of the IRE-BP from the ferritin mRNA allows that mRNA to be translated, thereby increasing intracellular levels of ferritin and increasing the capacity of the cell for iron storage.

Why does an anemia result from iron deficiency? When an individual is deficient in iron, the reticulocytes do not have sufficient iron to produce heme, the required prosthetic group of hemoglobin. When heme levels are low, eIF2 $\alpha$ (see Fig. 16.20) is phosphorylated and becomes inactive. Thus, globin mRNA cannot be translated because of the lack of heme. This results in red blood cells with inadequate levels of hemoglobin for oxygen delivery, and in an anemia.

## KEY CONCEPTS

- Prokaryotic gene expression is primarily regulated at the level of initiation of gene transcription. In general, there is one protein per gene.
- Sets of genes that encode proteins with related functions are organized into operons.
- Each operon is under the control of a single promoter.
- Repressors bind to the promoter to inhibit RNA polymerase binding.
- Activators facilitate RNA polymerase binding to the repressor.

- Eukaryotic gene regulation occurs at several levels.
- At the DNA structural level, chromatin must be remodeled to allow access for RNA polymerase, which is accomplished, in part, by proteins with histone acetyltransferase activity.
- Transcription is regulated by transcription factors that either enhance or restrict RNA polymerase access to the promoter.
- Transcription factors can bind to promoter-proximal elements, certain response elements, or enhancer regions which are a great distance from the promoter.
- Coactivators (mediator proteins) bind to the transactivation domains of transcription factors to enhance assembly of the basal transcription complex.
- RNA processing (including alternative splicing), transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and translation are also regulated in eukaryotes.
- MicroRNA expression alters translation of expressed mRNAs.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are found in Table 16.1.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is E. Many prokaryotic genes are organized into operons, in which one polycistronic mRNA contains the translational start and stop sites for several related genes. Although each gene within the mRNA can be read from a different reading frame, the reading frame is always consistent within each gene (thus, A is incorrect). Redundancy in codon/tRNA interactions has nothing to do with multiple cistrons within an mRNA (thus, B is incorrect). Operator sequences are in DNA and initiate transcription, not translation (thus, C is incorrect). Alternative splicing occurs only in eukaryotes (which have introns), not in prokaryotes (thus, D is incorrect).
2. The answer is D. In order to transcribe the lac operon, the repressor protein (lac I gene product) must bind allolactose and leave the operator region, and the cAMP-CRP complex must bind to the promoter in order for RNA polymerase to bind. Of the choices offered, only raising cAMP levels can allow transcription of the operon when both lactose and glucose are high. Raising cAMP, even though glucose is present, will allow the cAMP-CRP complex to bind and recruit RNA polymerase. Answers that call for mutations in the repressor (answers A and E) will not affect binding of cAMPCRP. Mutations in the DNA (answers B and C) do not allow CRP binding in the absence of cAMP.
3. The answer is A. The repressor will bind to the operator and block transcription of all genes in the operon unless prevented by the inducer allolactose. If the repressor has lost its affinity for the inducer, it cannot dissociate from the operator and the genes in the operon will not be expressed (thus, E is incorrect). If the repressor has lost its affinity for the operator (answer B), then the operon would be expressed constitutively. Because the question states that there is a mutation in the $I$ (repressor) gene, answer D is incorrect, and mutations in the $I$ gene do not affect trans-acting factors from binding to the promoter, although the only other one for the lac operon is the CRP.
4. The answer is B. The sequence, if read in the $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction, is identical to the complementary sequence read $5^{\prime}$-to-3'. None of the other sequences fits this pattern.
5. The answer is A. All DNA-binding proteins contain an $\alpha$-helix that binds to the major or minor groove in DNA. These proteins do not recognize RNA molecules (thus, B is incorrect), nor do they form bonds between the peptide backbone and the DNA backbone (thus, C is incorrect; if this were correct, how could there be any specificity in protein binding to DNA?). Only zinc fingers contain zinc, and dimers are formed by hydrogen bonding-not by disulfide linkages.
6. The answer is C. Epigenetic events include histone acetylation and DNA methylation-alterations to the DNA which do not involve altering the base-pairing characteristics of the DNA (or causing insertions or deletions within the DNA). Deamination of C or A residues (to U or I, respectively) will lead to altered base pairing when the DNA is replicated (methylation of C does not alter the base-pairing properties of the C). Substitution of one base for another also leads to an alteration in base-pairing properties.
7. The answer is E. The transactivation domain of the receptor is required to recruit other positive acting factors to the promoter region of the gene in order to enhance transcription. Lack of this domain, and reduced recruitment of coactivators, would lead to reduced transcription. The receptor would still be able to bind to DNA (i.e., through a different site on the receptor, the DNA-binding domain), although its affinity for DNA is not enhanced by lack of the transactivation domain. The transactivation domain is not related to the dimerization domain of hormone receptors.
8. The answer is B. A $\beta$-thalassemia refers to a disorder in which the number of $\alpha$-globin chains exceeds that of the $\beta$-globin genes. This can occur because of a stop codon being introduced into an exon of the $\beta$-globin

gene, or loss of a splice site in the $\beta$-globin gene (which could occur in an intron or exon). An imbalance in chain synthesis could also occur because of a mutation in the $\beta$-globin gene promoter, or in the $\alpha$-globin gene promoter that enhanced $\alpha$-globin synthesis relative to $\beta$-globin gene synthesis. A mutation in an intron of the $\alpha$-globin gene would not lead to more $\alpha$-globin protein than $\beta$-globin protein.
9. The answer is E. After the gene is transcribed (posttranscription), the use of alternative splice sites or sites for addition of the poly $(\mathrm{A})$ tail can result in different mRNAs (and therefore different proteins) from a single hnRNA. Introns are inert (noncoding) and would have no effect. Alternative splicing would remove exons, but all introns are removed from the hnRNA. The cap (on the $5^{\prime}$-end) is required for translation but would not alter the reading frame of the protein.
10. The answer is D. Ferritin is the cellular storage protein for iron. Transferrin is the transport protein for iron in plasma. The transferrin receptor binds the irontransferrin complex for transport of iron into the cell.

The synthesis of both the transferrin receptor and ferritin are controlled by the IRE-BP. At the low temperature, the IRE-BP binds to the $3^{\prime}$-end of the transferrin receptor mRNA, stabilizing the mRNA so that it can be translated to produced transferrin receptor proteins. When intracellular iron levels increase, the iron binds to IREBP, displacing the protein from the mRNA, which leads to degradation of the mRNA and reduced synthesis of the transferrin receptor. In a similar fashion, the IRE-BP binds to the $5^{\prime}$-end of the ferritin mRNA, blocking ferritin synthesis. When intracellular iron levels increase, the IRE-BP falls off the mRNA, and ferritin is synthesized to bind the intracellular iron and prevent free iron toxicity in the cell. In this cell line, the IRE-BP is mutated such that at the elevated temperature it cannot bind iron, meaning that the IRE-BP remains bound to the transferrin receptor and ferritin mRNA molecules. This leads to a lack of ferritin and to overexpression of transferrin receptor in the membrane. The cell will accumulate iron but will not have adequate ferritin for the iron to bind to, leading to elevated free iron levels in the cell.

# Use of Recombinant DNA Techniques in Medicine 

The rapid development of techniques in molecular biology is revolutionizing the practice of medicine. The potential uses of these techniques for the diagnosis and treatment of disease are vast.

Clinical Applications. Polymorphisms, inherited differences in DNA base sequences, are abundant in the human population, and many alterations in DNA sequences are associated with diseases. Tests for DNA sequence variations are more sensitive than many other techniques (such as enzyme assays) and permit recognition of diseases at earlier, and therefore potentially more treatable, stages. These tests also can identify carriers of inherited diseases so they can receive appropriate counseling. Because genetic variations are so distinctive, DNA fingerprinting (analysis of DNA sequence differences) can be used to determine family relationships or to help identify the perpetrators of a crime.

Techniques of molecular biology are used in the prevention and treatment of disease. For example, recombinant DNA techniques provide human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, factor VIII for the treatment of hemophilia, and vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis. Although treatment of disease by gene therapy is in the experimental phase of development, the possibilities are limited only by the human imagination and, of course, by ethical considerations. The ability to rapidly analyze the genome and proteome (all expressed proteins) of a cell enables different variants of a particular disease to be identified and treated appropriately.

Techniques. To recognize normal or pathologic genetic variations, DNA must be isolated from the appropriate source, and adequate amounts must be available for study. Techniques for isolating and amplifying genes and studying and manipulating DNA sequences involve the use of restriction enzymes, cloning vectors, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), gel electrophoresis, blotting onto nitrocellulose paper, and the preparation of labeled probes that hybridize to the appropriate target DNA sequences. Techniques to analyze all expressed genes within a cell require gene chip assays, which can lead to a genetic profile of normal versus diseased cells. Gene therapy involves isolating normal genes and inserting them into diseased cells so that the normal genes are expressed, permitting the diseased cells to return to a normal state. Ablation of gene expression is possible using techniques based on small interfering RNA (siRNA). Students should have a general understanding of recombinant DNA techniques to appreciate their current use and the promise they hold for the future. Rapid sequencing of DNA and complementary DNA (cDNA; next-generation sequencing) allows for rapid determination of mutations in the genome and changes in gene expression.

Cystic fibrosis is a disease caused by an inherited deficiency in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which is a chloride channel (see Chapter 10, Fig. 10.9). In the absence of chloride secretion, thick mucus blocks the pancreatic duct, resulting in decreased secretion of digestive enzymes into the intestinal lumen. The resulting malabsorption of fat and other foodstuffs decreases growth and may lead to varying degrees of small-bowel obstruction. Liver and gallbladder secretions may be similarly affected. Eventually, atrophy of the secretory organs or ducts may occur.Thick mucus also blocks the airways, markedly diminishing air exchange and predisposing the patient to stasis of secretions, diminished immune defenses, and increased secondary infections. Defects in the CFTR chloride channel also affect sweat composition, increasing the sodium and chloride content of the sweat, thereby providing a diagnostic tool.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Edna R., a third-year medical student, has started working in the hospital blood bank two nights a week (see Chapter 15 for an introduction to Edna R. and her daughter, Beverly). Because she will be handling human blood products, she must have a series of hepatitis B vaccinations. She has reservations about having these vaccinations and inquires about the efficacy and safety of the vaccines currently in use.

$\square$Susan F. is a 3-year-old Caucasian girl who has been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF). Her growth rate has been in the 30th percentile over the last year. Since birth, she has had occasional episodes of spontaneously reversible and minor small-bowel obstruction. These episodes are superimposed on gastrointestinal symptoms that suggest a degree of dietary fat malabsorption, such as bulky, glistening, foul-smelling stools two or three times per day. She has experienced recurrent flare-ups of bacterial bronchitis/bronchiolitis in the last 10 months, each time caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A quantitative sweat test was unequivocally positive (excessive sodium and chloride were found in her sweat on two occasions). Based on these findings, the pediatrician informed Susan's parents that Susan probably has CF. A sample of her blood was sent to a DNA testing laboratory to confirm the diagnosis and to determine specifically which one of the many potential genetic mutations known to cause CF was present in her cells.

$\square$Carrie S., Will S.'s 19-year-old sister, is considering marriage. Her growth and development have been normal, and she is free of symptoms of sickle cell anemia. Because a younger sister, Amanda, was tested and found to have sickle trait (expressing one normal $\beta$-globin gene and one sickle $\beta$-globin gene), and because of Will's repeated sickle crises, Carrie wants to know whether she also has sickle trait (see Chapters 6 and 7 for Will S.'s history). A hemoglobin electrophoresis is performed that shows the composition of her hemoglobin to be $58 \% \mathrm{HbA}, 39 \% \mathrm{HbS}, 1 \% \mathrm{HbF}$, and $2 \% \mathrm{HbA}_{2}$, a pattern consistent with the presence of sickle cell trait. The hematologist who saw her in the clinic on her first visit is studying the genetic mutations of sickle cell trait and asks Carrie for permission to draw additional blood for more sophisticated analysis of the genetic disturbance that causes her to produce HbS . Carrie informed her fiancé that she has sickle cell trait and that she wants to delay their marriage until he is tested.

$\square$Victoria T. was a 21-year-old woman who was the victim of a rape and murder. Her parents told police that she left her home and drove to the local convenience store. When she had not returned home an hour later, her father went to the store to look for Victoria. He found her car still parked in front of the store and called the police. They searched the area around the store and found Victoria T.'s body in a wooded area behind the building. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled. Medical technologists from the police laboratory collected a semen sample from vaginal fluid and took samples of dried blood from under the victim's fingernails. Witnesses identified three men who spoke to Victoria while she was at the convenience store. DNA samples were obtained from these suspects to determine whether any of them was the perpetrator of the crime.

$\square$Isabel S.'s cough is slightly improved on a multidrug regimen for pulmonary tuberculosis, but she continues to have night sweats. She is tolerating her current HIV therapy well but complains of weakness and fatigue. The man with whom she had shared "dirty" needles to inject drugs accompanies Isabel to the clinic and requests that he be tested for the presence of HIV.

## I. Recombinant DNA Techniques

Techniques for joining DNA sequences into new combinations (recombinant DNA) were originally developed as research tools to explore and manipulate genes and to

produce the gene products (protein). Now, they are also being used to identify mutated genes associated with disease and to correct genetic defects. These techniques will soon replace many current clinical testing procedures. A basic appreciation of recombinant DNA techniques is required to understand how genetic variations among individuals are determined and how these differences can be used to diagnose disease. The first steps in determining individual variations in genes involve isolating the genes (or fragments of DNA) that contain variable sequences and obtaining adequate quantities for study. The Human Genome Project has succeeded in sequencing the 3 billion bases of the human genome and can now be used as a template to discover and understand the molecular basis of disease.

## A. Strategies for Obtaining Fragments of DNA and Copies of Genes

## I. Restriction Fragments

Enzymes called restriction endonucleases enable molecular biologists to cleave segments of DNA from the genome of various types of cells or to fragment DNA obtained from other sources. A restriction enzyme is an endonuclease that specifically recognizes a short sequence of DNA, usually 4 to 6 base pairs (bp) in length, and cleaves a phosphodiester bond in both DNA strands within this sequence (Fig. 17.1). A key feature of restriction enzymes is their specificity. A restriction enzyme always cleaves at the same DNA sequence and cleaves only at that particular sequence. Most of the DNA sequences recognized by restriction enzymes are palindromes, that is, both strands of DNA have the same base sequence when read in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction. The cuts made by these enzymes are usually "sticky" (i.e., the products are single-stranded at the ends, with one strand overhanging the other, so they anneal with complementary sequences to the overhang). However, sometimes they are blunt (the products are double-stranded at the ends, with no overhangs). Hundreds of restriction enzymes with different specificities have been isolated (Table 17.1).

The answer is C. C follows the palindromic sequence CTNAG, where N can be any base. None of the other sequences is this close to a palindrome. Although most restriction enzymes recognize a "perfect" palindrome, in which the sequence of bases in each strand are the same, others may have intervening bases between the regions of identity, as in this example. Note also the specificity of the enzyme MstII in Table I7.I.

FIGURE 17.2 Production of recombinant DNA molecules with restriction enzymes and DNA ligase. The dashes at the $5^{\prime}$ - and $3^{\prime}$-ends indicate that this sequence is part of a longer DNA molecule.

Restriction endonucleases were discovered in bacteria in the late 1960s and 1970s. These enzymes were named for the fact that bacteria use them to "restrict" the growth of viruses (bacteriophage) that infect the bacterial cells. They cleave the phage DNA into smaller pieces so the phage cannot reproduce in the bacterial cells. However, they do not cleave the bacterial DNA, because its bases are methylated at the restriction sites by DNA methylases. Restriction enzymes also restrict uptake of DNA from the environment, and they restrict mating with nonhomologous species.

Restriction fragments of DNA can be used to identify variations in base sequence in a gene. However, they also can be used to synthesize a recombinant DNA (also called chimeric DNA), which is composed of molecules of DNA from different sources that have been recombined in vitro (outside the organism; e.g., in a test tube). The sticky ends of two unrelated DNA fragments can be joined to each other if they have sticky ends that are complementary. Complementary ends are obtained by cleaving the unrelated DNAs with the same restriction enzyme (Fig. 17.2). After the sticky ends of the fragments base-pair with each other, the fragments can be attached covalently by the action of DNA ligase.

## 2. DNA Produced by Reverse Transcriptase

If messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from a gene is isolated, this mRNA can be used as a template by the enzyme reverse transcriptase (see Chapter 12, "Biochemical Comments"), which produces a DNA copy (cDNA) of the RNA. In contrast to DNA fragments cleaved from the genome by restriction enzymes, DNA produced by reverse transcriptase does not contain introns because mRNA, which has no introns, is used as a template. cDNA also lacks the regulatory regions of a gene because those sequences (promoter, promoter-proximal elements, and enhancers) are not transcribed into mRNA.

## 3. Chemical Synthesis of DNA

Automated machines can synthesize oligonucleotides (short molecules of singlestranded DNA) up to 150 nucleotides in length. These machines can be programmed to produce oligonucleotides with a specified base sequence. Although entire genes cannot yet be synthesized in one piece, appropriate overlapping pieces of genes can be made and then ligated together to produce a fully synthetic gene. In addition, oligonucleotides can be prepared that will base-pair with segments of genes. These oligonucleotides can be used in the process of identifying, isolating, and amplifying genes.

![ma112486325cc](ma112486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 17.3 Use of probes to identify DNA sequences. The probe can be either DNA or RNA.

# B. Techniques for Identifying DNA Sequences 

## I. Probes

A probe is a single-strand polynucleotide of DNA or RNA that is used to identify a complementary sequence on a larger single-stranded DNA or RNA molecule (Fig. 17.3). Formation of base pairs with a complementary strand is called annealing or hybridization. Probes can be composed of cDNA (produced from mRNA by reverse transcriptase), fragments of genomic DNA (cleaved by restriction enzymes from the genome), chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, or, occasionally, RNA.

The conditions of hybridization can be manipulated to provide different degrees of stringency. Stringency refers to how exact a match the probe must have to the DNA to which it is hybridizing in order for significant hybridization to occur. Low-stringency conditions allow several mismatches between the two nucleic acid strands to be tolerated (nonstandard base pairs); high stringency requires an exact match of the complementary sequences before hybridization can take place. Stringency can be manipulated by raising or lowering the temperature (increased temperature increases stringency) and raising or lowering the salt concentration in the hybridization reaction (high salt concentration reduces the stringency because it negates the electrostatic repulsion between the phosphates in the DNA backbone of two mismatched DNA strands). Thus, a high-stringency hybridization (looking for an exact match) will be performed at high temperature and low salt concentrations.

To identify the target sequence, the probe must carry a label (see Fig. 17.3). If the probe has a radioactive label such as ${ }^{32} \mathrm{P}$, it can be detected by autoradiography. An autoradiogram is produced by covering the material containing the probe with a sheet of X-ray film. Electrons ( $\beta$-particles) emitted by disintegration of the radioactive atoms expose the film in the region directly over the probe. Several techniques can be used to introduce labels into these probes. Not all probes are radioactive. Some are chemical adducts (compounds that bind covalently to DNA) that can be identified by, for example, fluorescence microscopy.

## 2. Gel Electrophoresis

Gel electrophoresis is a technique that uses an electrical field to separate molecules on the basis of size. Because DNA contains negatively charged phosphate groups, it will migrate in an electrical field toward the positive electrode (Fig. 17.4). Shorter molecules migrate more rapidly through the pores of a gel than do longer molecules, so separation is based on length. Gels composed of polyacrylamide, which can separate DNA molecules that differ in length by only one nucleotide, are used to determine the base sequence of DNA. Agarose gels are used to separate longer DNA fragments that have larger size differences.

The bands of DNA in the gel can be visualized by various techniques. Staining with dyes such as ethidium bromide allows direct visualization of DNA bands under ultraviolet light. Specific sequences are generally detected by means of a labeled probe.

![ma113486325cc](ma113486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 17.5 Identification of bacterial colonies containing specific DNA sequences. The autoradiogram can be used to identify bacterial colonies on the original agar plate that contain the desired DNA sequence. Note that an orientation marker is placed on the nitrocellulose and the agar plate so the results of the autoradiogram can be properly aligned with the original plate of bacteria.

Western blots are one of the tests for the AIDS virus. Antibodies to HIV proteins in the blood are detected by using the blood to probe a nitrocellulose filter that has HIV proteins on it. A positive result would show that the blood contains antibodies to HIV proteins, indicating that the individual has been infected with HIV. Tests performed on Isabel S.'s friend showed that he was HIV-positive.
![ma114486325cc](ma114486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 17.4 Gel electrophoresis of DNA. A. DNA samples are placed into depressions ("wells") at one end of a gel, and an electrical field is applied. The DNA migrates toward the positive electrode at a rate that depends on the size of the DNA molecules. As the gel acts as a sieve, shorter molecules migrate more rapidly than longer molecules. B. The gel is removed from the apparatus. The bands are not visible until techniques are performed to visualize them (see Fig. 17.6).

## 3. Detection of Specific DNA Sequences

To detect specific sequences, DNA is usually transferred to a solid support, such as a sheet of nitrocellulose paper. For example, if bacteria are growing on an agar plate, cells from each colony will adhere to a nitrocellulose sheet pressed against the agar, and an exact replica of the bacterial colonies can be transferred to the nitrocellulose paper (Fig. 17.5). A similar technique is used to transfer bands of DNA from electrophoretic gels to nitrocellulose sheets. After bacterial colonies or bands of DNA are transferred to nitrocellulose paper, the paper is treated with an alkaline solution and then heated. Alkaline solutions denature DNA (i.e., separate the two strands of each double helix), and the heating fixes the DNA on the filter paper such that it will not move from its position during the rest of the blotting procedure. The single-stranded DNA is then hybridized with a probe, and the regions on the nitrocellulose blot containing DNA that base-pairs with the probe are identified.
E. M. Southern developed the technique, which bears his name, for identif ying DNA sequences on gels. Southern blots are produced when DNA on a nitrocellulose blot of an electrophoretic gel is hybridized with a DNA probe. Molecular biologists decided to continue with this geographic theme as they named two additional techniques. Northern blots are produced when RNA on a nitrocellulose blot is hybridized with a DNA probe. A slightly different but related technique, known as a Western blot, involves separating proteins by gel electrophoresis and probing with labeled antibodies for specific proteins (Fig. 17.6).

## 4. DNA Sequencing

The most common procedure for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a DNA strand was developed by Frederick Sanger and involves the use of dideoxynucleotides. Dideoxynucleotides (see Chapter 13) lack a 3 '-hydroxyl group (in addition to lacking the $2^{\prime}$ 'hydroxyl group that is normally absent from DNA deoxynucleotides). Thus, once they are incorporated into a replicating DNA chain, the next nucleotide cannot add, and polymerization is terminated. In this procedure, only one of the four dideoxynucleotides (dideoxyadenosine triphosphate [ddATP], dideoxythymidine triphosphate [ddTTP], dideoxyguanosine triphosphate [ddGTP], or dideoxycytidine triphosphate [ddCTP]) is added to a tube containing all four normal deoxynucleotides, DNA polymerase, a primer, and the template strand for the DNA that is being sequenced (Fig. 17.7). As DNA polymerase catalyzes the sequential addition of complementary bases to the $3^{\prime}$-end, the dideoxynucleotide competes with its corresponding normal nucleotide for insertion. Whenever the dideoxynucleotide is incorporated,

![ma115486325cc](ma115486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 17.6 Southern, Northern, and Western blots. For Southern blots, DNA molecules are separated by electrophoresis, denatured, transferred to nitrocellulose paper (by "blotting"), and hybridized with a DNA probe. For Northern blots, RNA is electrophoresed and treated similarly except that alkali is not used (first, because alkali hydrolyzes RNA, and second, because RNA is already singlestranded). For Western blots, proteins are electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a specific antibody.

FIGURE 17.7 The Sanger method of DNA sequencing. A. A reaction mixtures contain one of the dideoxynucleotides, such as ddATP, and some of the normal nucleotide, dATP, which compete for incorporation into the growing polynucleotide chain. When a $T$ is encountered on the template strand (position 10), some of the molecules will incorporate a ddATP and the chain will be terminated. Those that incorporate a normal dATP will continue growing until position 15 is reached, where they will incorporate either a ddATP or the normal dATP. Only those that incorporate a dATP will continue growing to position 17. Thus, strands of different length from the $5^{\prime}$-end are produced, corresponding to the position of a T in the template strand. B. DNA sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide method. Four tubes are used. Each one contains DNA polymerase, a DNA template hybridized to a primer, plus dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP. Either the primer or the nucleotides must have a radioactive label, so bands can be visualized on the gel by autoradiography. Only one of the four dideoxyribonucleotides (ddNTPs) is added to each tube. Termination of synthesis occurs where the ddNTP is incorporated into the growing chain. The template is complementary to the sequence of the newly synthesized strand. Automated DNA sequencers use fluorescentlabeled ddNTPs and a column to separate the oligonucleotides by size. As samples leave the column, their fluorescence is analyzed to determine which base has terminated synthesis of that fragment. dATP, deoxyadenosine triphosphate; dTTP, deoxythymidine triphosphate; dGTP, deoxyguanosine triphosphate; dCTP, deoxycytidine triphosphate; ddATP, dideoxyadenosine triphosphate; ddTTP, dideoxythymidine triphosphate; ddGTP, dideoxyguanosine triphosphate; ddCTP, dideoxycytidine triphosphate.

One of the drugs used to treat HIV is didanosine, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). This drug is a purine nucleoside composed of the base hypoxanthine linked to dideoxyribose. In cells, didanosine is phosphorylated to form a nucleotide that adds to growing DNA strands. Because dideoxynucleotides lack both $2^{\prime}$ - and $3^{\prime}$-hydroxyl groups, DNA synthesis is terminated. Reverse transcriptase has a higher affinity for the dideoxynucleotides than does the cellular DNA polymerase, so the use of this drug will affect reverse transcriptase to a greater extent than the cellular enzyme.
further polymerization of the strand cannot occur, and synthesis is terminated. Some of the chains will terminate at each of the locations in the template strand that is complementary to the dideoxynucleotide. Consider, for example, a growing polynucleotide strand in which adenine (A) should add at positions 10, 15, and 17. Competition between ddATP and dATP for each position results in some chains terminating at position 10 , some at 15 , and some at 17 . Thus, DNA strands of varying lengths are produced from a template. The shortest strands are closest to the $5^{\prime}$-end of the growing DNA strand because the strand is synthesized in a $5^{\prime}$-to-3' direction.

Four separate reactions are performed, each with only one of the dideoxynucleotides present (ddATP, ddTTP, ddGTP, ddCTP), plus a complete mixture of normal nucleotides (see Fig. 17.7B). In each tube, some strands are terminated whenever the complementary base for that dideoxynucleotide is encountered. If these strands are subjected to gel electrophoresis, the sequence $5^{\prime} \rightarrow 3^{\prime}$ of the DNA strand complementary to the template can be determined by "reading" from the bottom to the top of the gel; that is, by noting the lanes (A, G, C, or T) in which bands appear, starting at the bottom of the gel and moving sequentially toward the top.

# 5. Next-Generation DNA Sequencing 

The original limitation in the traditional Sanger method of sequencing DNA was speed; it took an extended period of time to generate significant amounts of sequence data. Improvements in the speed of sequencing have led to next-generation sequencing, which allow for sequencing of an entire genome in less than 1 day.

This technique involves mechanical fractionation of the genome, followed by the addition of known sequences of DNA to the ends of the unknown DNA (Fig. 17.8). The fractionated DNA, with known ends, is added to a glass slide which contains bound DNA complementary to the added ends of the unknown DNA. The DNA samples are amplified (see Section I.C. 3 on PCR) and then sequenced using a primer that is complementary to the known sequence of DNA on the ends of the unknown DNA. Many thousands of pieces of DNA are sequenced simultaneously
![ma118486325cc](ma118486325cc.jpg)

Clusters of templates undergo new DNA synthesis with 4 flourescent-labeled reversible terminators, primers, and DNA polymerase to identify the first base of each cluster after laser excitation and imaging.

FIGURE 17.8 A simplified depiction of next-generation sequencing. See text for details. (From Ross JS, Cronin M. Whole cancer genome sequencing by next-generation methods. Am J Clin Path. 2011;136[4]:527-539.)

on the slide. In this case, one sequences the unknown fragments one nucleotide at a time. Each deoxynucleotide in the reaction mixture is linked to a different fluorophore as well as to a chemical blocking agent at the $3^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group on the ribose. After the first nucleotide has been added to the primer, a computer analyzes the fluorescence of all the DNA sequences on the slide and stores the data. Chemicals are then added to remove both the blocking groups from the $3^{\prime}$-hydroxyl groups and the fluorophores from the nucleotides already incorporated into the DNA. DNA synthesis is then initiated to add the next base to the primer, and the process is repeated. This continues for up to 100 bases, such that 100 -base-long sequences are stored in the computer for each piece of unknown DNA on the slide. The computer then analyzes these sequences, looks for overlaps in sequence, and can generate an entire sequence of the DNA being analyzed. Multiple variations of this procedure have been developed and have begun to revolutionize clinical testing.

## C. Techniques for Amplifying DNA Sequences

To study genes or other DNA sequences, adequate quantities of material must be obtained. It is often difficult to isolate significant quantities of DNA from the original source. For example, an individual cannot usually afford to part with enough tissue to provide the amount of DNA required for clinical testing. Therefore, the available quantity of DNA has to be amplified.

## I. Cloning of DNA

The first technique developed for amplifying the quantity of DNA is known as cloning (Fig. 17.9). The DNA that you want amplified (the "foreign" DNA) is attached to a vector (a carrier DNA), which is introduced into a host cell that makes multiple copies of the DNA. The foreign DNA and the vector DNA are usually cleaved with the same restriction enzyme, which produces complementary sticky ends in both DNAs. The foreign DNA is then added to the vector. Base pairs form between the complementary single-stranded regions, and DNA ligase joins the molecules to produce a chimera, or recombinant DNA. As the host cells divide, they replicate their own DNA, and they also replicate the DNA of the vector, which includes the foreign DNA.

If the host cells are bacteria, commonly used vectors are bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria), plasmids (extrachromosomal pieces of circular DNA that are taken up by bacteria), or cosmids (plasmids that contain DNA sequences from the lambda bacteriophage). When eukaryotic cells are used as the host, the vectors are often retroviruses, adenoviruses, free DNA, or DNA coated with a lipid layer (liposomes). The foreign DNA sometimes integrates into the host-cell genome, or it exists as episomes (extrachromosomal fragments of DNA) (see Section III.E).

Host cells that contain recombinant DNA are called transformed cells if they are bacteria or transfected (or transduced, if the vector is a virus) cells if they are eukaryotes. Markers in the vector DNA are used to identify cells that have been transformed, and probes for the foreign DNA can be used to determine that the host cells actually contain the foreign DNA. If the host cells containing the foreign DNA are incubated under conditions in which they replicate rapidly, large quantities of the foreign DNA can be isolated from the cells. With the appropriate vector and growth conditions that permit expression of the foreign DNA, large quantities of the protein produced from this DNA can be isolated.

## 2. Libraries

Specific collections of DNA fragments are known as libraries. A genomic library is a set of host cells (or phage) that collectively contain all of the DNA sequences from the genome of another organism. Thus, a genomic library contains promoter and intron sequences of every gene. A cDNA library is a set of host cells that collectively contain all the DNA sequences produced by reverse transcriptase from the mRNA obtained from cells (or tissue) of a particular type. Therefore, a cDNA library contains complementary DNA for all the genes expressed in that cell type,

(1)Noninvasive prenatal testing is based on next-generation sequencing and is used to determine, early in a pregnancy, if certain chromosomal abnormalities are present (trisomies or monosomies) as well as the sex of the fetus. Fetal DNA can be found in the mother's blood, and through analysis of the DNA, and determining chromosome ratios by sequencing, it can be determined if multiple copies of a particular chromosome are present in the fetus. This is currently used only as a screening procedure; positive results require confirmation by an invasive technique such as amniocentesis.

(2)In the early studies on CF, DNA sequencing was used to determine the type of defect in patients. Buccal cells were obtained from washes of the mucous membranes of the mouth, DNA isolated from these cells was amplified by PCR, and DNA sequencing of the CF gene was performed. A sequencing gel for the region in which the normal gene differs from the mutant gene is shown here. What is the difference between the normal and the mutant CF gene sequence shown on the gel, and what effect would this difference have on the protein produced from this gene?
![ma119486325cc](ma119486325cc.jpg)

In individuals of northern European descent, $70 \%$ of the cases of CF are caused by a deletion of three bases in the CF gene. In the region of the gene shown on the gels, the base sequence (read from the bottom to the top of the gel) is the same for the normal and mutant gene for the first 6 positions, and the bases in positions 10 through 16 of the normal gene are the same as the bases in positions 7 through 13 of the mutant gene. Therefore, a three-base deletion in the mutant gene corresponds to bases 7 through 9 of the normal gene.

CF sequence: TATCAT-.-TGG T

Loss of 3 bp (indicated by the clashes) maintains the reading frame, so only the single amino acid phenylalanine ( $F$ ) is lost. Phenylalanine would normally appear as residue 508 in the protein. Therefore, the deletion is referred to as $\Delta F_{508}$. The rest of the amino acid sequence of the normal and the mutant proteins is identical.
![ma120486325cc](ma120486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 17.9 Simplified scheme for cloning of DNA in bacteria. A plasmid is a specific type of vector, or carrier, which can contain inserts of foreign DNA of up to 2.0 kilobase pairs in size. For clarity, the sizes of the pieces of DNA are not drawn to scale (e.g., the bacterial chromosomal DNA should be much larger than the plasmid DNA).
corresponding to the particular stage of differentiation of the cell when the mRNA was isolated. Because cDNA libraries are generated by reverse transcription of mRNA, promoter and intron sequences of genes are not present in those libraries.

The DNA fragments that are used to construct genomic libraries are much larger than those needed to construct cDNA libraries (for humans, a genomic library would need to represent all 3 billion bp in the haploid genome; the average mRNA is about 2,500 bases in size). Thus, different vectors are used to construct genomic libraries compared to cDNA libraries. Bacteriophage, which can handle up to 20 kilobase pairs [kb] of foreign DNA; bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), which can handle up to 150 kb of foreign DNA; and yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), which can handle up to $1,000 \mathrm{~kb}$ of foreign DNA are often used in construction of genomic libraries. For cDNA libraries, plasmids (which can accept up to 2 kb of foreign DNA) are usually the vector of choice.

To clone a gene, a suitable probe must be developed (derived from either an amino acid sequence within a protein or from a similar DNA sequence obtained

from another species); the library is then screened with the probe (using techniques described previously) to find host cells that harbor DNA sequences complementary to the probe. Obtaining sufficient clones enable the complete cDNA, or gene, to be obtained and sequenced.

## 3. Polymerase Chain Reaction

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an in vitro method that can be used for rapid production of very large amounts of specific segments of DNA. It is particularly suited for amplifying regions of DNA for clinical or forensic testing procedures because only a very small sample of DNA is required as the starting material. Regions of DNA can be amplified by PCR from a single strand of hair or a single drop of blood or semen.

First, a sample of DNA containing the segment to be amplified must be isolated. Large quantities of primers, the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and a heatstable DNA polymerase are added to a solution in which the DNA is heated to separate the strands (Fig. 17.10). The primers are two synthetic oligonucleotides; one oligonucleotide is complementary to a short sequence in one strand of the DNA to be amplified, and the other is complementary to a sequence in the other DNA strand. As the solution is cooled, the oligonucleotides form base pairs with the DNA and serve as primers for the synthesis of DNA strands by a heat-stable DNA polymerase (this polymerase is isolated from Thermus aquaticus, a bacterium that grows in hot springs). The process of heating, cooling, and new DNA synthesis is repeated many times until a large number of copies of the DNA is obtained. The process is automated, so each round of replication takes only a few minutes, and in 20 heating and cooling cycles the DNA is amplified more than a million-fold.

Although only small amounts of semen were obtained from Victoria T. 5 body, the quantity of DNA in these specimens was able to be amplified by PCR. This technique provided sufficient amounts of DNA for comparison with DNA samples from the three suspects.
![ma121486325cc](ma121486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 17.10 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Strand I and strand 2 are the original DNA strands. The short dark blue fragments are the primers. After multiple heating and cooling cycles, the original strands remain, but most of the DNA consists of amplified copies of the segment (shown in lighter blue) synthesized by the heat-stable DNA polymerase.

The mutation that causes sickle cell anemia abolishes a restriction site for the enzyme MstII in the $\beta$-globin gene. The consequence of this mutation is that the restriction fragment produced by MstII that includes the $5^{\prime}$-end of the $\beta$-globin gene is larger ( 1.3 kb ) for individuals with sickle cell anemia than for normal individuals (I.I kb). Analysis of restriction fragments provides a direct test for the mutation. In Will S.'s case, both alleles for $\beta$-globin lack the MstII site and produce 1.3-kb restriction fragments; thus, only one band is seen in a Southern blot.
![ma122486325cc](ma122486325cc.jpg)
(no MstII site)

C
Southern blot of DNA cut with MstII and hybridized with $\beta$-globin probe
![ma124486325cc](ma124486325cc.jpg)

Carriers of sickle cell trait have both a normal and a mutant allele. Therefore, their DNA will produce both the larger and the smaller MstII restriction fragments. When Will S.'s sister, Carrie S. was tested, she was found to have both the small and the large restriction fragments, and her status as a carrier of sickle cell anemia, initially made on the basis of protein electrophoresis, was confirmed.

## II. Use of Recombinant DNA Techniques for Diagnosis of Disease

## A. DNA Polymorphisms

Polymorphisms are variations among individuals of a species in DNA sequences of the genome. They serve as the basis for using recombinant DNA techniques in the diagnosis of disease. The human genome probably contains millions of different polymorphisms. Some polymorphisms involve point mutations, the substitution of one base for another. Deletions and insertions are also responsible for variations in DNA sequences. Some polymorphisms occur within the coding region of genes. Others are found in noncoding regions that are closely linked to genes involved in the cause of inherited disease, in which case they can be used as a marker for the disease. Because only about $1.5 \%$ of the human genome codes for genes, most polymorphisms are present in noncoding regions of the genome.

## B. Detection of Polymorphisms

## I. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms

Occasionally, a point mutation occurs in a recognition site for one of the restriction enzymes. The restriction enzyme, therefore, can cut at this restriction site in DNA from most individuals but not in DNA from individuals with this mutation. Consequently, the restriction fragment that binds a probe for this region of the genome will be larger for a person with the mutation than for most members of the population. Mutations also can create restriction sites that are not normally present. In this case, the restriction fragment from this region of the genome will be smaller for a person with the mutation than for most individuals. These variations in the length of restriction fragments are known as restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs).

In some cases, the mutation that causes a disease affects a restriction site within the coding region of a gene. In many cases, however, the mutation does not alter a restriction site within the gene of interest. In some cases, an RFLP close to the gene may be discovered (tightly linked; i.e., physically close on the DNA molecule). This RFLP can still serve as a biologic marker for the disease. Both types of RFLPs can be used for genetic testing to determine whether an individual has the disease.

## 2. Detection of Mutations by Allele-Specific Oligonucleotide Probes

Other techniques have been developed to detect mutations because many mutations associated with genetic diseases do not occur within restriction enzyme recognition sites or cause detectable restriction fragment length differences when digested with restriction enzymes. For example, oligonucleotide probes (containing 15 to 20 nucleotides) can be synthesized that are complementary to a DNA sequence that includes a mutation. Different probes are produced for alleles that contain mutations and for those that have a normal DNA sequence. The region of the genome that contains the abnormal gene is amplified by PCR, and the samples of DNA are placed in narrow bands on nitrocellulose paper ("slot blotting"). The paper is then treated with the radioactive probe for either the normal or the mutant sequence. Appropriate manipulation of the hybridization conditions (e.g., high temperature and low salt concentration) will allow probes with only a one-base difference to distinguish between normal and mutant alleles, making this test a very sensitive technique. Autoradiograms indicate whether the normal or mutant probe has preferentially base-paired (hybridized) with the DNA-that is, whether the alleles are normal or mutated. Carriers, of course, have two different alleles: one that binds to the normal probe and one that binds to the mutant probe.

## 3. Testing for Mutations by Polymerase Chain Reaction

If an oligonucleotide that is complementary to a DNA sequence containing a mutation is used as a primer for PCR, the DNA sample used as the template will be

amplified only if it contains the mutation. If the DNA is normal (does not contain the mutation), the primer will not hybridize because of the one-base difference, and the DNA will not be amplified. This concept is extremely useful for clinical testing. In fact, several oligonucleotides, each specific for a different mutation and each containing a different label, can be used as primers in a single PCR reaction. This procedure results in rapid and relatively inexpensive testing for multiple mutations.

## 4. Detection of Polymorphisms Caused by Repetitive DNA

Human DNA contains many sequences that are repeated in tandem a variable number of times at certain loci in the genome. These regions are called highly variable regions because they contain a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). Digestion with restriction enzymes that recognize sites that flank the VNTR region produces fragments containing these loci, which differ in size from one individual to another, depending on the number of repeats that are present. Probes used to identify these restriction fragments bind to or near the sequence that is repeated (Fig. 17.11).

The restriction fragment patterns produced from these loci can be used to identify individuals as accurately as the traditional fingerprint. In fact, this restriction fragment technique has been called DNA fingerprinting and is gaining widespread use in forensic analysis. Family relationships can be determined by this method, and it can be used to help acquit or convict suspects in criminal cases.

Individuals who are closely related genetically will have restriction fragment patterns (DNA fingerprints) that are more similar than those who are more distantly related. Only monozygotic twins will have identical patterns.
![ma125486325cc](ma125486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 17.II Restriction fragments produced from a gene with a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). Each individual has two homologs of every somatic chromosome and thus two genes each containing this region with a VNTR. Cleavage of each individual's genomic DNA with a restriction enzyme produces two fragments containing this region. The length of the fragments depends on the number of repeats they contain. Electrophoresis separates the fragments, and a labeled probe that binds to the fragments allows them to be visualized. Each short blue block represents one repeat.

(1)How does one determine the DNA sequence of a gene that contains a mutation to develop specific probes to that mutation? First, the gene that causes the disease must be identified. This is done by a process known as positional cloning, which involves linking polymorphic markers to the disease. Individuals who express the disease will exhibit a specific subset of polymorphic markers, whereas individuals who do not express the disease will not express the same subset of polymorphic markers. Once such polymorphic markers are identified, identification of the disease gene can occur using these markers, in either of two ways. The first way is to use the polymorphic markers as probes to screen a human genomic library. This will identify pieces of human DNA that contain the polymorphic marker. These pieces of DNA can then be used as probes to expand the region of the genome surrounding this marker (chromosome walking). Potential genes within this region are identified (using data available from the sequencing of the human genome), and the sequence of bases within each gene is compared with the sequence of bases in the genes of individuals who have the disease. The one gene that shows an altered sequence in disease-carrying individuals compared with normal individuals is the tentative disease gene. The second method to identify the disease gene is to screen the already sequenced human genome via database searching for genes near the identified polymorphic markers. Once identified, such genes would need to be sequenced in normal and afflicted individuals to identify the disease gene. Through the sequencing of genes from many people afflicted with the disease, the types of mutations that lead to this disease can be characterized and specific tests developed to determine whether individuals express these particular mutations.

Testing for CF by DNA sequencing is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, another technique that uses allele-specific oligonucleotide probes has been developed. Susan $\mathbf{F}$, and her family were tested using this method. Oligonucleotide probes, complementary to the region where the three-base deletion is located, have been synthesized. One probe binds to the mutant ( $\Delta F_{508}$ ) gene and the other to the normal gene.

DNA was isolated from Susan, her parents, and two siblings and was amplified by PCR. Samples of the DNA were spotted on nitrocellulose paper and treated with the oligonucleotide probes, and the following results were obtained. (Dark spots indicate binding of the probe.)

Which members of Susan's family have CF, which are normal, and which are carriers?

Gene chips have been used to answer the question of whether there are changes in gene expression during dieting. Gene chips containing approximately 47,000 unique genes were used, and the probes were cDNA prepared from adipose tissue of control and calorie-restricted overweight women. Upon caloric restriction, 334 transcripts were upregulated, whereas 342 transcripts were reduced in expression, as compared to the control group. As expected, many of the genes corresponded to those involved in metabolism and metabolic regulation. Increased use of these techniques will, in the future, enable development of pharmaceutic agents that specifically target transcripts involved in weight regulation, with the goal being the development and implementation of new and improved weight loss drugs.

## 5. DNA Chips (Microarrays)

Over the past 15 years, a technique has been developed that permits screening many genes simultaneously to determine which alleles of these genes are present in samples obtained from patients. The surface of a small chip is dotted with thousands of pieces of single-stranded DNA, each representing a different gene or segment of a gene. The chip is then incubated with a sample of a patient's DNA, and the pattern of hybridization is determined by computer analysis. The results of the hybridization analysis can be used, for example, to determine which one of the many known mutations for a particular genetic disease is the specific defect underlying a patient's problem. An individual's gene chip also may be used to determine which alleles of drug-metabolizing enzymes are present and, therefore, the likelihood of that individual having an adverse reaction to a particular drug.

Another use for a DNA chip is to determine which genes are being expressed in cells. If the mRNA from a tissue specimen is used to produce cDNA by reverse transcriptase, the cDNA will hybridize with only those genes being expressed in that tissue. In the case of a cancer patient, this technique could be used to determine the classification of the cancer much more rapidly and more accurately than the methods traditionally used by pathologists. The treatment then could be tailored more specifically to the individual patient. This technique also can be used to identify the genes required for tissue specificity (e.g., the difference between a muscle cell and a liver cell) and differentiation (the conversion of precursor cells into the different cell types). Experiments using gene chips are helping us to understand differentiation and may open the opportunity to artificially induce differentiation and tissue regeneration in the treatment of disease.

The advent of next-generation sequencing has led to a technique known as RNASEQ, which enables an investigator to determine which mRNA is being expressed in a particular tissue and also how much mRNA is present in the cell. As an overview, mRNA is isolated from a cell and converted to cDNA, and the cDNA molecules are sequenced using next-generation techniques. The intensity of the fluorescent signals during sequencing can quantitate the amount of starting cDNA, and comparing sequences obtained with genomic databases can identify the genes that have produced the mRNA under analysis. RNA-SEQ avoids using gene chips and does not restrict the results to only those genes that are represented on the gene chip.

As another example of the myriad uses of gene chips, a gene chip has been developed for the diagnosis of infectious disease. This gene chip contains 29,445 distinct oligonucleotides ( 60 bases long) that correspond to vertebrate viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Patient samples (nose aspirates, urine, blood, or tissue samples) are used as a source of RNA, which is converted to cDNA. Specific regions of the cDNA are amplified by PCR (the products of the PCR are fluorescent because of the incorporation of fluorescent primers in the procedure). Hybridization of the fluorescent probe with the chip allows identification of the infectious agent. The possibilities for gene chip applications in the future are virtually limitless.

The huge amount of information now available from the sequencing of the human genome, and the results available from gene chip experiments, has greatly expanded the field of bioinformatics. Bioinformatics can be defined as the gathering, processing, data storage, data analysis, information extraction, and visualization of biologic data. Bioinformatics also provides scientists with the capability to organize vast amounts of data in a manageable form that allows easy access and retrieval. Powerful computers are required to perform these analyses. As an example of an experiment that requires these tools, suppose you want to compare the effects of two different immunosuppressant drugs on gene expression in lymphocytes. Lymphocytes would be treated with either nothing (the control) or with the drugs individually (experimental samples). RNA would be isolated from the cells during drug treatment and the RNA converted to fluorescent cDNA using the enzyme reverse transcriptase and a fluorescent nucleotide analog. The cDNA produced from your

three samples would be used as probes for a gene chip containing DNA fragments from more than 5,000 human genes. The samples would be allowed to hybridize to the chips, and you would then have 15,000 results to interpret (the extent of hybridization of each cDNA sample with each of the 5,000 genes on the chip). Computers are used to analyze the fluorescent spots on the chips and to compare the levels of fluorescent intensity from one chip to another. In this way, you could group genes showing similar levels of stimulation or inhibition in the presence of the drugs and compare the two drugs with respect to which genes have had their levels of expression altered by drug treatment.

## III. Use of Recombinant DNA Techniques for the Prevention and Treatment of Disease

## A. Vaccines

Before the advent of recombinant DNA technology, vaccines were made exclusively from infectious agents that had been either killed or attenuated (altered so that they can no longer multiply in an inoculated individual). Both types of vaccines were potentially dangerous because they could be contaminated with the live infectious agent. In fact, in a small number of instances, disease has actually been caused by vaccination. For the vaccine to be successful in preventing future infections, the human immune system must respond to the antigenic proteins on the surface of an infectious agent. The immune system is then prepared if the body is exposed to the infectious agent in the future. By recombinant DNA techniques, these antigenic proteins can be solely produced in large quantities, completely free of the infectious agent, and used in a vaccine. Thus, any risk of infection by the vaccine is eliminated. The first successful recombinant DNA vaccine to be produced was for the hepatitis B virus (HBV).

More recently, DNA vaccines have been used to achieve similar results. The theory behind DNA vaccines is to allow DNA to enter cells within a tissue, which then transcribe and translate the protein product encoded by the gene. This protein is an antigen from the organism against which antibody production is desired. The host then generates an immune response to the antigen, generating protection for the host. Although this therapy has been successful in rats, it has not yet evolved to the point of being successful in humans, perhaps as a result of insufficient cells accepting and expressing the DNA vaccine. Ongoing research is geared toward increasing the number of cells that receive the DNA, thereby enhancing immunogenicity.

## B. Production of Therapeutic Proteins

## I. Insulin and Growth Hormone

Recombinant DNA techniques are used to produce proteins that have therapeutic properties. One of the first such proteins to be produced was human insulin. Recombinant DNA corresponding to the A-chain of human insulin was prepared and inserted into plasmids that were used to transform Escherichia coli cells. The bacteria then synthesized the insulin chain, which was purified. A similar process was used to obtain B-chains. The A- and B-chains were then mixed and allowed to fold and form disulfide bonds, producing active insulin molecules (Fig. 17.12). Insulin is not glycosylated, so there was no problem with differences in glycosyltransferase activity between E. coli and human cell types.

Human growth hormone has also been produced in E. coli and is used to treat children with growth-hormone deficiencies. Before production of recombinant growth hormone, growth hormone isolated from cadaver pituitary tissue was used, which was in short supply.

$\square$Individuals to which both probes hybridize are carriers (because they contain one normal allele and one mutant allele). Thus, the father and mother are both carriers of the defective allele, as is one of the two siblings (child 2). Susan has the disease (expressing only the mutant allele), and the other sibling (child I) is not a carrier for the disease (expressing only the normal allele).

$\square$A current method for forensic analysis of DNA samples is to take advantage of the presence of short tandem repeat (STR) sequences in the DNA. The number of repeats differs among alleles, so an analysis of 8 to 16 STRs is usually sufficient for a statistically valid match. The DNA to be analyzed is amplified in a PCR reaction with all of the primers (for all 8 to 16 STR regions) simultaneously (a process known as multiplexing). The primers are labeled with a fluorescent nucleotide, and they have been designed such that each STR amplification will yield a different-sized amplification product. After the PCR has been completed, the fluorescent DNA samples are analyzed by size via capillary electrophoresis and a fluorescent detector. The sizes of the fragments are determined using time of elution from the column (and comparison to known size standards). If the multiplex PCR analyzed 8 STR regions, it is possible for 16 different-sized bands (two alleles for each STR) to be generated from each individual donating DNA. These products are compared to the products obtained from the unknown sample, and matches (or nonmatches) can be determined. These procedures are now automated and are very precise.

FIGURE 17.12 Production of human insulin in Escherichia coli. Amp $^{R}$ is the gene for ampicillin resistance. The presence of $A m p^{R}$ allows bacterial cells that contain the vector to grow in the presence of ampicillin. Cells that lack the Amp ${ }^{R}$ gene die in the presence of ampicillin. Because E. coli cannot process preproinsulin, a synthetic scheme was developed whereby each individual chain of insulin was expressed, produced, and purified, and then the two chains were linked together in a test tube.

# 2. Complex Human Proteins 

More complex proteins have been produced in mammalian cell culture using recombinant DNA techniques. The gene for factor VIII, a protein involved in blood clotting, is defective in individuals with hemophilia. Before genetically engineered factor VIII became available, several patients with hemophilia died of AIDS or hepatitis that they contracted from transfusions of contaminated blood or from factor VIII isolated from contaminated blood.

Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is a protease in blood that converts plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin is a protease that cleaves fibrin (a major component of blood clots), so administered TPA dissolves blood clots. Recombinant TPA, produced in mammalian cell cultures, can be administered during or immediately after a heart attack to dissolve the thrombi that occlude coronary arteries and prevent oxygen from reaching the heart muscle. It can also be used to treat other serious conditions caused by blood clots, including stroke and pulmonary embolism.

Hematopoietic growth factors also have been produced in mammalian cell cultures by recombinant DNA techniques. Erythropoietin can be used in certain types of anemias to stimulate the production of red blood cells. Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) and interleukins (ILs) can be used after bone marrow transplants and after chemotherapy to stimulate white blood cell production and decrease the risk of infection. Recombinant $\beta$-interferon is the first drug known to decrease the frequency and severity of episodes resulting from the effects of demyelination in patients with multiple sclerosis.

A method for producing human proteins that has proven to be successful involves transgenic animals. These animals (usually goat or sheep) have been genetically engineered to produce human proteins in the mammary gland and secrete them into milk. The gene of interest is engineered to contain a promoter that is only active in the mammary glands under lactating conditions. The vector containing the gene and promoter is inserted into the nucleus of a freshly fertilized egg, which is then implanted into a foster mother. The female animal progeny are tested for the presence of this transgene, and milk from the positive animals is collected. Large quantities of the protein of interest can then be isolated from the relatively small number of proteins present in milk.

## C. Small Interfering RNA

In several disorders, it would be advantageous to reduce the expression of a particular gene. This has, in the past, been very difficult to do, but a recently discovered series of reactions will allow this to occur, and the technique is already showing promise as a therapeutic tool. One way to reduce expression of a particular protein is to reduce the level of mRNA within the cell that codes for the protein. This can occur by either specifically degrading this mRNA or by blocking translation from the mRNA of interest. It turns out that eukaryotic cells have a built-in system to silence gene expression via reduction of mRNA levels, a process known as gene silencing. Gene silencing comes about via the transcription of genes known as microRNAs (miRNA; see Chapter 16). The miRNAs are processed to form a small ( 21 to 24 bp ) double-stranded RNA molecule. The double-stranded RNA is separated into single strands, and the strand that is complementary to a specific mRNA is guided to the mRNA, which is either degraded or inhibited from participation in translation, depending on the miRNA. If the miRNA pairing is exact with its target, mRNA degradation is initiated. If the miRNA pairing with the target is inexact, inhibition of translation results (see Fig. 16.21).

Since this expression-ablation pathway was first discovered, it has been shown that the introduction of chemically synthesized double-stranded RNA molecules into cells will generate small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to inhibit production of a cellular protein. Although this technique holds great promise for antiviral and anticancer therapies, a great deal of work still needs to be done to optimize delivery of the double-stranded RNA to the target tissue and to optimize the stability of the agent. Alternative approaches include the induction, or inhibition, of certain miRNA genes.

## D. Genetic Counseling

One means of preventing disease is to avoid passing defective genes to offspring. If individuals are tested for genetic diseases, particularly members of families that are known to carry a defective gene, genetic counselors can inform the individuals of their risks and options. With this information, people can decide in advance whether to have children.

Screening tests based on the recombinant DNA techniques outlined in this chapter have been developed for many inherited diseases. Although these tests are currently expensive, particularly if entire families have to be screened, the cost may be trivial compared with the burden of raising children with severe disabilities. Obviously, cost and ethical considerations must be taken into account, but recombinant DNA technology has provided individuals with the ability to make choices.

Screening can be performed on the prospective parents before conception. If they decide to conceive, the fetus can be tested for the genetic defect. In some cases, if the fetus has the defect, treatment can be instituted at an early stage, even in utero. For certain diseases, early therapy leads to a more positive outcome.

When Edna R. began working with patients, she received the hepatitis B vaccine. The HBV infects the liver, causing severe damage. The virus contains a surface antigen ( HBsAg ) or coat protein for which the gene has been isolated. However, because the protein is glycosylated, it could not be produced in E. coli. (Bacteria, because they lack subcellular organelles, cannot produce glycosylated proteins.) Therefore, a yeast (eukaryotic) expression system was used that produced a glycosylated form of the protein. The viral protein, separated from the small amount of contaminating yeast protein, is used as a vaccine for immunization against HBV infection.

1Dianne A. is using a recombinant human insulin called lispro (Humalog) (see Chapter 6, Fig. 6.12). Lispro was genetically engineered so that lysine is at position 28 and proline is at position 29 of the B-chain (the reverse of their positions in normal human insulin). Dianne injects lispro right before each meal to help keep her blood sugars controlled. The switch of position of the two amino acids leads to a faster acting insulin homolog. The lispro is absorbed from the site of injection much more quickly than other forms of insulin, and it acts to lower blood glucose levels much more rapidly than the other insulin forms.

(2)Carrie S.'s fiancé decided to be tested for the sickle cell gene. He was found to have both the I.3-4b and the I.I-4b MstII restriction fragments that include a portion of the $\beta$-globin gene. Therefore, like Carrie, he also is a carrier for the sickle cell gene.

A defect in the adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene causes severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID). When ADA is defective, deoxyadenosine and dATP accumulate in rapidly dividing cells, such as lymphocytes, and prove toxic to these cells. Cells of the immune system cannot proliferate at a normal rate. When an appropriate donor is available, bone marrow transplantation can be performed in the first 3 months of life with a reasonable degree of success. Without this, children with SCID usually die at an early age because they cannot combat infections. To survive, they must be confined to a sterile environmental "bubble."
I: 1990, a 4-year-old girl, for whom no donor was available, was treated with infusions of her own lymphocytes that had been treated with a retrovirus containing a normal ADA gene. Although she had not responded to previous therapy, she improved significantly after this attempt at gene therapy. This disease is still being treated with gene therapy in combination with replacement enzyme infusion.

## E. Gene Therapy

The ultimate cure for genetic diseases is to introduce normal genes into individuals who have defective genes. Currently, gene therapy is being attempted in animals, cell cultures, and human subjects. It is not possible at present to replace a defective gene with a normal gene at its usual location in the genome of the appropriate cells. However, as long as the gene is expressed at the appropriate time and produces adequate amounts of the protein to return the person to a normal state, the gene does not have to integrate into the precise place in the genome. Sometimes, the gene does not even have to be in the cells that normally contain it.

Retroviruses were the first vectors used to introduce genes into human cells. Normally, retroviruses enter target cells, their RNA genome is copied by reverse transcriptase, and the double-stranded DNA copy is integrated into the host-cell genome (see Fig. 14.22). If the retroviral genes (e.g., gag, pol, and env) are first removed and replaced with the therapeutic gene, the retroviral genes integrated into the host-cell genome will produce the therapeutic protein rather than the viral proteins (Fig. 17.13).
![ma128486325cc](ma128486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 17.13 Use of retroviruses for gene therapy. The retrovirus carries an RNA copy of the therapeutic gene into the cell. The endosome that contains the virus dissolves, and the RNA and viral reverse transcriptase are released. This enzyme copies the RNA, making a double-stranded DNA that integrates into the host-cell genome. Transcription and translation of this DNA (the therapeutic gene) produces the therapeutic protein. (The virus does not multiply because its genes were removed and replaced by the RNA copy of the therapeutic gene.)

This process works only when the human host cells are undergoing division, so it has limited applicability. Other problems with this technique are that it can only be used with small genes ( $\leq 8 \mathrm{~kb}$ ), and it may disrupt other genes because the insertion point is random, thereby possibly resulting in cancer.

Adenoviruses, which are natural human pathogens, can also be used as vectors. As in retroviral gene therapy, the normal viral genes required for synthesis of viral particles are replaced with the therapeutic genes. The advantages to using an adenovirus are that the introduced gene can be quite large ( $\sim 36 \mathrm{~kb}$ ), and infection does not require division of host cells. The disadvantage is that genes carried by the adenovirus do not integrate stably into the host genome, resulting in only transient expression of the therapeutic proteins (but preventing disruption of host genes and the complications that may arise from it). Thus, the treatment must be repeated periodically. Another problem with adenoviral gene therapy is that the host can mount an immune response to the pathogenic adenovirus, causing complications, including death.

To avoid the problems associated with viral vectors, researchers are employing treatment with DNA alone or with DNA coated with a layer of lipid (i.e., in liposomes). Adding a ligand for a receptor located on the target cells could aid delivery of the liposomes to the appropriate host cells. Many problems still plague the field of gene therapy. In many instances, the therapeutic genes must be targeted to the cells where they normally function-a difficult task at present. Deficiencies in dominant genes are more difficult to treat than those in recessive genes, and the expression of the therapeutic genes often needs to be carefully regulated. Although the field is moving forward, progress is slow. As mentioned previously, current research is exploring the use of siRNA to block expression of oncogenes in tumor cells, although significant clinical impact is most likely years away.

## F. Transgenic Animals

The introduction of normal genes into somatic cells with defective genes corrects the defect only in the treated individuals, not in their offspring. To eliminate the defect for future generations, the normal genes must be introduced into the germ cell line (the cells that produce sperm in males or eggs in females). Experiments with animals indicate that gene therapy in germ cells is feasible. Genes can be introduced into fertilized eggs from which transgenic animals develop, and these transgenic animals can produce apparently normal offspring.

In fact, if the nucleus isolated from the cell of one animal is injected into the enucleated egg from another animal of the same species and the egg is implanted in a foster mother, the resulting offspring is a "clone" of the animal from which the nucleus was derived. Clones of sheep and pigs have been produced, and similar techniques could be used to clone humans. Obviously, these experiments raise many ethical questions that will be difficult to answer.

## IV. Proteomics

The techniques described previously have concentrated on nucleic acid identification, but there have also been rapid advances in analyzing all proteins expressed by a cell at a particular stage of development. The techniques are sophisticated enough to allow comparisons between two different samples, such as normal cells and cancer cells from the same tissue. An abbreviated view of this technique is shown in Figure 17.14. Proteins from the two different cell types (A and B) are isolated and labeled with different fluorescent dyes. The proteins are then separated by twodimensional gel electrophoresis (the first dimension, or separation, is by charge, and the second dimension is by size), which generates a large number of spots that can be viewed under a fluorescent imaging device; each of these spots corresponds to an individual protein. A computer aligns the spots from the two samples and can determine, by the level of fluorescence expressed at each protein spot, if a protein

(1)Another form of SCID is X-linked and is known as X-SCID. This disease results from mutations in a common subunit protein of multiple cytokine receptors. The cDNA corresponding to this subunit was delivered to patient lymphocytes using a retroviral vector, and the success rate of reconstituting the immune system was high for patients who received this gene therapy. The enthusiasm concerning the treatment was tempered, however, by the development of leukemia in three of the patients who were part of the initial trial. Retroviruses randomly insert their DNA copy of their genome into the host chromosome. In the patients who developed leukemia, it has been determined that the vector inserted near the LMO2 gene, a known proto-oncogene (see Chapter 18). The insertional event triggered activation (or overexpression) of LMO2, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Current research is now directed to attempt to target areas of insertion for vectors used in gene therapy.

(2)Adenoviral vectors have been used in an aerosol spray to deliver normal copies of the CFTR gene to cells of the lung in patients with CF. Some cells took up this gene, and the patients experienced moderate improvement. However, stable integration of the gene into the genome did not occur, and cells affected by the disease other than those in the lung (e.g., pancreatic cells) did not benefit. Nevertheless, this approach marked a significant forward step in the development of gene therapy. Adenoviral vectors were also used in an attempt to treat ornithine transcarbamoylase deficiency (a disorder of nitrogen metabolism). In this trial, a volunteer died following a severe immune response to the adenoviral vector. This unfortunate result has led to a reevaluation of the safety of viral vectors for gene therapy.

FIGURE I 7.I4 Using proteomics to determine if a protein is up- or downregulated. See text for more details. 2D, two-dimensional.
has been up- or downregulated in one sample compared to the other. Proteins whose expression levels change can then be identified by sensitive techniques involving protein mass spectrometry.

The proteomics approach holds great promise in molecularly fingerprinting particular tumors and for discovering novel targets for drug development that are only expressed in the cancerous state. A physician's knowledge of the markers expressed by a particular tumor should allow for specific drug regimens to be used; no longer will one treatment be the norm for a particular tumor. Depending on a patient's proteome, treatments for the patient's specific tumor can be devised and prescribed.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Edna R. In reading about development of the hepatitis B vaccine, Edna R. learned that the first vaccine available for HBV, marketed in 1982, was a purified and "inactivated" vaccine containing HBV virus that had been chemically killed. The virus was derived from the blood of known HBV carriers. Later, "attenuated" vaccines were used, in which the virus remained live but was altered so that it no longer multiplied in the inoculated host. Both the inactivated and the attenuated vaccines are potentially dangerous because they can be contaminated with live infectious HBV.

The modern "subunit" vaccines, first marketed in 1987, were made by recombinant DNA techniques described earlier in this chapter. Because this vaccine consists solely of the viral surface protein or antigen to which the immune system responds, there is no risk for infection with HBV.

Susan F. CF is a genetically determined autosomal-recessive disease that can be caused by a variety of mutations within the CF gene located on chromosome 7. Susan F. was found to have a 3-bp deletion at residue 508 of the CF gene (the mutation present in $\sim 85 \%$ of white patients with CF in the United States). This mutation is generally associated with a more severe clinical course than many other mutations that cause the disease. However, other genes and environmental factors may modify the clinical course of the disease, so it is not currently possible to counsel patients accurately about prognosis based on their genotype.

CF is a relatively common genetic disorder in the United States, with a carrier rate of approximately $5 \%$ in Caucasians. The disease occurs in 1/3,000 Caucasian births in the country ( $1 / 17,000$ in African Americans and 1/31,000 in Asians).

Carrie S. After learning the results of their tests for the sickle cell gene, Carrie S. and her fiancé consulted a genetic counselor. The counselor informed them that, because they were both carriers of the sickle cell gene, their chance of having a child with sickle cell anemia was fairly high ( $\sim 1$ in 4). She told them that prenatal testing was available with fetal DNA obtained from cells by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. If these tests indicated that the fetus had sickle cell disease, abortion was a possibility. Carrie, because of her religious background, was not sure that abortion was an option for her. Nonetheless, having witnessed her brother's sickle cell crises for many years, she also was not sure that she wanted to risk having a child with the disease. Her fiancé also felt that, at 25 years of age, he was not ready to deal with such difficult problems. They mutually agreed to cancel their marriage plans.

Victoria T. DNA fingerprinting represents an important advance in forensic medicine. Before development of this technique, identification of criminals was far less scientific. The suspect in the rape and murder of Victoria T. was arrested and convicted, mainly on the basis of the results of DNA fingerprint analysis.

This technique has been challenged in some courts on the basis of technical problems in statistical interpretation of the data and sample collection. It is absolutely necessary for all of the appropriate controls to be run, including samples from the victim's DNA as well as the suspect's DNA. Another challenge to the fingerprinting procedure has been raised because PCR is such a powerful technique that it can amplify minute amounts of contaminating DNA from a source unrelated to the case.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

Mapping of the Human Genome. The Human Genome Project began in 1990, and by the summer of 2000, the entire human genome had been mapped. This feat was accomplished in far less than the expected time as a result of both cooperative and competitive interactions of laboratories in the private as well as public sectors.

The human genome contains $>3 \times 10^{9}$ (3 billion) bp. A large percentage of this genome ( $<95 \%$ ) does not code for the amino acid sequences of proteins or for functional RNA (such as ribosomal RNA [rRNA] or transfer RNA [tRNA]) but is composed of repetitive sequences, introns, and other noncoding elements of unknown function. The human genome is estimated to contain only about 20,000 to 25,000 genes; however, significantly more proteins are produced than there are genes. This arises from alternative splicing and various posttranslational modifications. Further analysis of the proteome may prove to be more informative than the genome.

Analysis of the genome has led to the identification of a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which refer to a single nucleotide change within a given DNA sequence as compared between individuals. For such a change to be considered an SNP (as opposed to a random mutation), the polymorphism must be

What are the statistical issues relating to DNA fingerprinting? Through the analysis of a large number of individuals of different ethnicities, one can determine the frequency of a particular DNA polymorphism within that distinct population. By matching 8 to 16 polymorphisms (using multiplexed PCR for polymorphic STRs) from DNA at the crime scene with DNA from a suspect, one can determine the odds of that match happening by chance. For example, let us assume that a suspect's DNA was compared with DNA found at the crime scene for four unique polymorphisms within the suspect's ethnic group. The frequency of polymorphism $A$ in that population is 1 in 20 ; of polymorphism B, I in 30; of polymorphism C, I in 50; and of polymorphism D, I in 100. The odds of the suspect's DNA matching the DNA found at the crime scene for all four polymorphisms would be the product of each individual probability, or $(1 / 20) \times(1 / 30) \times(1 / 50) \times$ $(1 / 100)$. This comes out to a 1 in 3 million chance that an individual would have the same polymorphisms in his or her DNA as that found at the crime scene. The question left to the courts is whether the I in 3 million match is sufficient to convict the suspect of the crime. Given that there may be 30 million individuals in the United States within the same ethnic group as the suspect, there would then be 30 people within the country who would match the DNA polymorphisms found at the scene of the crime. Can the court be sure that the suspect is the correct individual? Clearly, the use of DNA fingerprinting is much clearer when a match is not made, for that immediately indicates that the suspect was not at the scene of the crime.

Over the past few years, a revolutionary new technique, based on a rudimentary immune system found in microbes and archaea, has enabled scientists to knock out, or insert, targeted genes in cells. The technique is known as CRISPR/Cas, for clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)associated system (Cas represents nucleases and helicases). Within the clustered repeats of these regions of the bacterial genome were found DNA sequences from bacteriophage. If a similar phage were to infect the bacteria, the host cell would use a defense mechanism that would recognize the invading DNA and degrade it using the Cas genes. Scientists have used the specificity of this system to successfully alter genes in cultured cells, either by knocking them out (destroying their ability to code for a functional protein) or by replacing the gene with a modified one. This technique has matured enough to enable a strain of mosquitoes to be created which would render females unable to breed, and this would have the potential to eliminate certain strains of mosquitoes (e.g., those that carry the malaria parasite) from existence. Scientists in China have successfully altered the $\beta$-globin gene in human embryos as a test to see if thalassemia can be treated with CRISPR/Cas technology. These early experiments have demonstrated that there are still technical issues concerning nonspecific gene integration to work out, but the potential for this technique is enormous. There also are significant ethical issues associated with this technique, including the ability to remove a species from existence and altering the human genome before birth. The medical implications for this technique are endless, but it is not clear that the ethical issues will be resolved as easily as the scientific technique.
present within $1 \%$ of the population. SNPs are plentiful in the human genome, occurring every 100 to 300 bp ; therefore, SNPs are useful tools for mapping disease genes within the chromosome. SNPs are also being used in place of STR sequences in forensic DNA analysis.

When identification of a wayward gene is announced on the morning news, the average citizen may expect a cure for the genetic disease to be available that evening. Although knowledge of the chromosomal location and the sequence of genes will result in the rapid development of tests to determine whether an individual carries a defective gene, the development of a treatment for the genetic disease caused by the defective gene is not that easy or that rapid. As outlined in the section on gene therapy, many technical problems need to be solved before gene therapy becomes common. In addition to solving the molecular puzzles involved in gene therapy, we also will have to deal with many difficult ethical as well as technical questions.

Is it appropriate to replace defective genes in somatic cells to relieve human suffering? Many people may agree with this goal. But there is a related question: Is it appropriate to replace defective genes in the germ cell line to relieve human suffering? Fewer people may agree with this goal. Genetic manipulation of somatic cells affects only one generation; these cells die with the individual. Germ cells, however, live on, producing each successive generation.

The techniques developed to explore the human genome could be used for many purposes. What are the limits for the application of the knowledge gained by advances in molecular biology? Who should decide what the limits are, and who should serve as the "genetic police"? If we permit experiments that involve genetic manipulation of the human germ cell line, however nobly conceived, could we, in our efforts to "improve" ourselves, genetically engineer the human race into extinction?

## KEY CONCEPTS

- Techniques for isolating and amplifying genes and studying and manipulating DNA sequences are currently being used in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disease.
- These techniques require an understanding of the following tools and processes:
- Restriction enzymes
- Cloning vectors
- Polymerase chain reaction
- Dideoxy DNA sequencing
- Gel electrophoresis
- Nucleic acid hybridization
- Expression vectors
- Recombinant DNA molecules produced by these techniques can be used as diagnostic probes, in gene therapy, or for the large-scale production of proteins for the treatment of disease.
- Identified genetic polymorphisms, inherited differences in DNA base sequences between individuals, can be used for both diagnosis of disease and the generation of an individual's molecular fingerprint.
- Genetic treatment of disease is possible, using either gene therapy or geneablation techniques. Technical difficulties currently restrict the widespread use of these treatments.
- Proteomics is the study of proteins expressed by a cell. Differences in protein expression between normal and cancer cells can be used to identify potential targets for future therapy.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 17.2.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is B. All DNA fragments are negatively charged and will migrate toward the positive electrode. The only difference between the fragments is their size, and the smaller fragments will move faster than the larger fragments because of their ability to squeeze through the gel at a faster rate.
2. The answer is E. The enzyme recognizes six bases, and the probability that the correct base is in each position is 1 in 4 , so the overall probability is $(1 / 4)^{6}$, or 1 in 4,096 bases.
3. The answer is B. The Sanger technique requires both deoxyribonucleotides and dideoxyribonucleotides and a template DNA. It does not use Taq polymerase (which is for PCR), nor does it need reverse transcriptase (which is required for producing DNA from RNA).
4. The answer is A. PCR experiments, using primers that flank the repeat area, can determine the number of repeats in a gene as compared to a gene with no or few repeats (the PCR product would be larger for a region containing multiple repeats as compared to a region with few repeats). Similarly, using restriction endonuclease recognition sites that flank the repeat, one
will see RFLPs, the length of the restriction fragment being dependent on the number of repeats in the gene. SNP analysis, however, examines SNPs, not multiple triplet repeats, and would not be a suitable method for determining a region of the genome that contained multiple triplet nucleotide repeats. Most individuals will have a certain number of repeats, and PCR and RFLP will enable expanded repeat regions to be distinguished from small repeat regions relatively easily.
5. The answer is C. A Northern blot allows one to determine which genes are being transcribed in a tissue at the time of mRNA isolation. The mRNA is run on a gel, transferred to filter paper, and then analyzed with a probe. If albumin is being transcribed, then a probe for albumin should give a positive result in the Northern blot. A library screening will not indicate if a particular gene is being transcribed, nor will a Southern blot. Those techniques will only allow one to determine that the gene is present in the genome. A Western blot analyzes protein content, not mRNA content. Analysis of VNTRs does not provide information about whether a gene is transcribed.

6. The answer is A. A polymorphism in the DNA may lead to altered restriction sites, which would be detected by Southern blots. The polymorphism, if it involved expansion of repeat sequences, would be detectable by Southern blots or PCR across the expanded region. Polymorphisms may be as small as a single nucleotide difference, which would be detectable by SNP analysis. Northern blots examine the transcript from the genes and would be the least likely technique to provide information concerning the polymorphism. The polymorphism may not be expressed within the exons of the genes, so a Northern blot would not show an extended, or truncated, mRNA. SNPs would also not be evident in Northern blots.
7. The answer is E. Certain primary transcripts have the capability to be spliced in alternative fashion, depending on the composition of the spliceosome in the tissues. In this case, the liver can splice in three ways, creating three different-sized transcripts, whereas all other tissues only splice in one way, creating just a single size of transcript. Because the genome is constant for all tissues, if the liver contained three genes for this transcript, the other tissues would as well. RNA editing will alter one base in a transcript but does not alter the overall size of the transcript. Posttranslational modifications occur to proteins after they are synthesized but not to RNA molecules (that would be posttranscriptional modifications). The loss of a restriction endonuclease recognition site within the liver gene would not alter the overall size of the transcript because this would be a mutation in the DNA. It is possible that this change created one alternative splicing event but not the three that are observed via the Northern blot.
8. The answer is B. If 245 genes are being upregulated in the cancer cells as compared to the normal cells, the mRNA levels for those 245 genes should be increased in the cancer cells as compared to the nontumor cells. One can therefore perform Northern blots, using cDNA corresponding to the genes as probes, of RNA from nontumor and tumor cells to determine if mRNA levels actually do increase after transformation. A Southern blot will not show expression of genes just that the gene is present in the cells. SNP analysis will determine polymorphisms in DNA but cannot determine gene expression levels. Similarly, RFLP looks at differences in DNA structure but not at gene expression levels. PCR analyzes DNA as well, not gene expression. (RT-PCR, however, in which the mRNA is converted to DNA by reverse transcriptase, can determine mRNA levels between two different samples.)
9. The answer is E. The Western blot is used to determine if a patient's blood contains antibodies against HIV proteins (which would mean that the patient is infected with the HIV virus). In order to make this determination, purified HIV proteins are run through a polyacrylamide gel and transferred to filter paper, and the filter paper is blotted with a sample of the patient's blood. If the patient's blood has antibodies to the HIV proteins, these antibodies will bind to the filter and can be detected by second antibodies that recognize human antibodies and contain a fluorescent tag for detection. This test does not use DNA or RNA in the gel (a Western blot is the running of proteins through a gel), nor is the patient's blood run through a gel or antibodies to HIV proteins.
10. The answer is E. Restriction endonucleases were discovered in bacteria, and they are used to protect the bacteria from invasion by foreign DNA. Recombinant DNA refers to the generation of a piece of DNA from two other pieces of DNA in a test tube, and the DNA can be from the same or different species. Recombinant DNA techniques have been used to generate therapeutic proteins (such as factor VIII, growth hormone, and insulin). The use of recombinant DNA techniques has also allowed variants of therapeutic proteins to be synthesized (such as long- and short-acting variants of insulin). Gene therapy requires the use of recombinant DNA techniques to generate a gene, with appropriate promoter regions, to deliver to cells with an inability to produce the protein encoded by the recombinant DNA.

FIGURE 18.1 Development of cancer. Accumulation of mutations in a number of genes results in transformation. Cancer cells change morphologically, proliferate, invade other tissues, and metastasize.

## The Molecular Biology of Cancer

The term cancer applies to a group of diseases in which cells grow abnormally and form a malignant tumor. Malignant cells can invade nearby tissues and metastasize (i.e., travel to other sites in the body, where they establish secondary areas of growth). This aberrant growth pattern results from mutations in genes that regulate proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells in a multicellular organism. Because of these genetic changes, cancer cells no longer respond to the signals that govern growth of normal cells (Fig. I8.1.)

Oncogenes and Tumor-Suppressor Genes. The genes involved in the development of cancer are classified as oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. Oncogenes are mutated derivatives of normal genes (proto-oncogenes) whose function is to promote proliferation or cell survival. These genes can code for growth factors, growth-factor receptors, signal transduction proteins, intracellular kinases, and transcription factors. The process of transformation into a malignant cell may begin with a gain-of-function mutation in only one copy of a proto-oncogene. As the mutated cell proliferates, additional mutations can occur. Tumor-suppressor genes (normal growth-suppressor genes) encode proteins that inhibit proliferation, promote cell death, or repair DNA; both alleles need to be inactivated for transformation (a loss of function). Growth-suppressor genes have been called the guardians of the cell.

Cell Cycle Suppression and Apoptosis. Normal cell growth depends on a balanced regulation of cell-cycle progression and apoptosis (programmed cell death) by proto-oncogenes and growth-suppressor genes. At checkpoints in the cell cycle, products of tumor-suppressor genes slow growth in response to signals from the cell's environment, including external growth-inhibitory factors, or to allow time for repair of damaged DNA, or in response to other adverse circumstances in cells. Alternatively, cells with damaged DNA are targeted for apoptosis so that they will not proliferate. Many growth-stimulatory pathways involving proto-oncogenes, and growth-inhibitory controls involving a variety of tumor-suppressor genes, converge to regulate the activity of some key protein kinases, the cyclin-dependent kinases. These kinases act to control progression at specific points in the cell growth cycle. Apoptosis is initiated by either death-receptor activation or intracellular signals leading to release of the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c.

Mutations. Mutations in DNA that give rise to cancer may be inherited or may be caused by chemical carcinogens, radiation, viruses, and by replication errors that are not repaired. A cell population must accumulate multiple mutations for transformation to malignancy.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Mannie W. has chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a disease in which a single line of myeloid cells in the bone marrow proliferates abnormally, causing a large increase in the number of nonlymphoid white blood cells (see Chapter 16). His myeloid cells contain the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome, which increases their proliferation. He has recently complained of pain and tenderness in various areas of his skeleton, possibly stemming from the expanding mass of myeloid cells within his bone marrow. He also reports a variety of hemorrhagic signs, including bruises (ecchymoses), bleeding gums, and the appearance of small red spots (petechiae caused by release of red cells into the skin).

$\square$Michael T. was diagnosed with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung (see Chapter 13) after resection of a concerning nodule seen on a computed tomography (CT) scan of his chest. He survived the surgery and was recovering uneventfully until 6 months later, when he complained of an increasingly severe right temporal headache. A CT scan of his brain was performed. Results indicated that the cancer, which had originated in his lungs, had metastasized to his brain.

$\square$Clark T. has had an intestinal adenocarcinoma resected, as well as several small metastatic nodules in his liver (see Chapters 12). He completed his second course of chemotherapy with 5 -fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin and had no serious side effects. He assured his physician at his most recent checkup that, this time, he intended to comply with any instructions his physicians gave him. He ruefully commented that he wished he had returned for regular examinations after his first colonoscopy.

Calvin A. returned to his physician after observing a brownish-black irregular mole on his forearm (see Chapter 13). His physician thought the mole looked suspiciously like a malignant melanoma and referred him to a dermatologist who performed an excision biopsy (surgical removal for cytological analysis).

## I. Causes of Cancer

The term cancer applies to a group of diseases in which cells grow abnormally and form a malignant tumor. Malignant cells can invade nearby tissues and metastasize (i.e., travel to other sites in the body where they establish secondary areas of growth). This aberrant growth pattern results from mutations in genes that regulate proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells in a multicellular organism. Because of these genetic changes, cancer cells no longer respond to the signals that govern growth of normal cells.

Normal cells in the body respond to signals, such as cell-cell contact (contact inhibition), that direct them to stop proliferating. Cancer cells do not require growthstimulatory signals, and they are resistant to growth-inhibitory signals. They are also resistant to apoptosis, the programmed cell death process whereby unwanted or irreparably damaged cells self-destruct. They have an infinite proliferative capacity and do not become senescent (i.e., they are immortalized). Furthermore, they can grow independent of structural support, such as the extracellular matrix (loss of anchorage dependence).

The study of cells in culture was, and continues to be, a great impetus for the study of cancer. Tumor development in animals can take months, and it was difficult to conduct experiments with tumor growth in animals. Once cells could be removed from an animal and propagated in a tissue culture dish, the onset of transformation (the normal cell becoming a cancer cell) could be seen in days.

Once cells were available to study, it was important to determine the criteria that distinguish transformed cells from normal cells in culture. Three criteria

Determination of abnormal chromosome structures is done by karyotype analysis (see Fig. 12.14). Karyotypes are created by arresting cells in mitotic metaphase, a stage at which the chromosomes are condensed and visible under the light microscope. Nuclei are isolated and placed on a microscope slide, and the chromosomes are stained. Pictures of the chromosomes are obtained through the microscope, and the homologous chromosomes are paired. Through this type of analysis, translocations between chromosomes can be determined, as can trisomies and monosomies. As seen in the figure, this karyotype indicates a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (a piece of chromosome 22 is now attached to chromosome 9; note the arrows in the figure). This is known as the Philadelphia chromosome, and it gives rise to CML, the disease exhibited by Mannie W.
![ma131486325cc](ma131486325cc.jpg)

Patients with leukemia can experience a variety of hemorrhagic (bleeding) manifestations caused by a decreased number of platelets. Platelets are small cells that initiate clot formation at the site of endothelial injury. Because of the uncontrolled proliferation of white cells within the limited space of the marrow, the normal platelet precursor cells (the megakaryocytes) in the marrow are "squeezed" or crowded and fail to develop into mature platelets. Consequently, the number of mature platelets (thrombocytes) in the circulation falls, and a thrombocytopenia develops. Because there are fewer platelets to contribute to clot formation, bleeding problems are common.

Malignant neoplasms (new growth, a tumor) of epithelial cell origin (including the intestinal lining, cells of the skin, and cells lining the airways of the lungs) are called carcinomas. If the cancer grows in a glandlike pattern, it is an adenocarcinoma. Thus, Michael T. and ClarkT. have adenocarcinomas. Calvin A. had a carcinoma arising from melanocytes, which is technically a melanocarcinoma but is usually referred to as a melanoma.

Moles (also called nevi) are tumors of the skin. They are formed by melanocytes that have been transformed from highly dendritic single cells interspersed among other skin cells to round oval cells that grow in aggregates or "nests." Melanocytes produce the dark pigment melanin, which protects against sunlight by absorbing UV light. Additional mutations may transform the mole into a malignant melanoma.

The first experiments to show that oncogenes were mutant forms of proto-oncogenes in human tumors involved cells cultured from a human bladder carcinoma. The DNA sequence of the ras oncogene cloned from these cells differed from the normal c-ras proto-oncogene. Similar mutations were subsequently found in the ras gene of lung and colon tumors. Clark T.'s malignant polyp had a mutation in the ras proto-oncogene.
were established. The first is the requirement for serum in the cell culture medium to stimulate cell growth. Serum is the liquid fraction of clotted blood, and it contains many factors that stimulate cell proliferation. Transformed cells have, in general, a reduced requirement for serum: approximately $10 \%$ of that required for normal cells to grow. The second criterion is the ability to grow without attachment to a supporting matrix (anchorage dependence). Normal cells (such as fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells) require adherence to a substratum (in this case, the bottom of the plastic dish) and will not grow if suspended in a soft agar mixture. Transformed cells, however, have lost this anchorage dependence. The third and most stringent criterion used to demonstrate that cells are truly transformed is the ability of cells to form tumors when they are injected into mice that lack an immune system. Transformed cells will do so, whereas normal cells will not.

Drs. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus demonstrated that cancer is not caused by unusual and novel genes but rather by mutation within existing cellular genes, and that for every gene that causes cancer (an oncogene), there is a corresponding cellular gene, called the proto-oncogene. Although this concept seems straightforward today, it was a significant finding when it was first announced and, in 1989, Drs. Bishop and Varmus were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.

A single cell that divides abnormally eventually forms a mass called a tumor. A tumor can be benign and harmless; the common wart is a benign tumor formed from a slowly expanding mass of cells. In contrast, a malignant neoplasm (malignant tumor) is a proliferation of rapidly growing cells that progressively infiltrate, invade, and destroy surrounding tissue. Tumors develop angiogenic potential, which is the capacity to form new blood vessels and capillaries. Thus, tumors can generate their own blood supply to bring in oxygen and nutrients. Cancer cells also can metastasize, separating from the growing mass of the tumor and traveling through the blood or lymph to unrelated organs, where they establish new growths of cancer cells.

The transformation of a normal cell to a cancer cell begins with damage to DNA (base changes or strand breaks) caused by chemical carcinogens, ultraviolet (UV) light, viruses, or replication errors (see Chapter 13). Mutations result from the damaged DNA if it is not repaired properly or if it is not repaired before replication occurs. A mutation that can lead to transformation also may be inherited. When a cell with one mutation proliferates, this clonal expansion (proliferation of cells arising from a single cell) results in a substantial population of cells containing this one mutation, from which one cell may acquire a second mutation relevant to control of cell growth or death. With each clonal expansion, the probability of another transforming mutation increases. As mutations accumulate in genes that control proliferation, subsequent mutations occur even more rapidly, until the cells acquire the multiple mutations (in the range of four to seven) necessary for full transformation.

The transforming mutations occur in genes that regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation (proto-oncogenes), suppress growth (tumor-suppressor genes), target irreparably damaged cells for apoptosis, or repair damaged DNA. The genes that regulate cellular growth are called proto-oncogenes, and their mutated forms are called oncogenes. The term oncogene is derived from the Greek word onkos, meaning bulk or tumor. A transforming mutation in a proto-oncogene increases the activity or amount of the gene product (a gain-of-function mutation). Tumor-suppressor genes (normal growth-suppressor genes) and repair enzymes protect against uncontrolled cell proliferation. A transforming mutation in these protective genes results in a loss of activity or a decreased amount of the gene product.

In summary, cancer is caused by the accumulation of mutations in the genes involved in normal cellular growth and differentiation. These mutations give rise to cancer cells that are capable of unregulated, autonomous, and infinite proliferation. As these cancer cells proliferate, they impinge upon normal cellular functions, leading to the symptoms exhibited by individuals with the tumors.

## II. Damage to DNA Leading to Mutations

## A. Chemical and Physical Alterations in DNA

An alteration in the chemical structure of DNA, or of the sequence of bases in a gene, is an absolute requirement for the development of cancer. The function of DNA depends on the presence of various polar chemical groups in DNA bases, which are capable of forming hydrogen bonds between DNA strands or other chemical reactions. The oxygen and nitrogen atoms in DNA bases are targets for a variety of electrophiles (electron-seeking chemical groups). A typical sequence of events leading to a mutation is shown for dimethylnitrosamine in Figure 18.2. Chemical carcinogens (compounds that can cause transforming mutations) found in the environment and ingested in foods are generally stable lipophilic compounds that, like dimethylnitrosamine, must be activated by metabolism in the body to react with DNA (see also benzo[a]pyrene; Chapter 13, Section III.A and Fig. 13.12). Many chemotherapeutic agents, which are designed to kill proliferating cells by interacting with DNA, may also act as carcinogens and cause new mutations and tumors while eradicating the old. Structural alterations in DNA also occur through radiation and through UV light, which causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers. More than $90 \%$ of skin cancers occur in sunlight-exposed areas. UV rays derived from the sun induce an increased incidence of all skin cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma of the skin. The wavelength of UV light that is most associated with skin cancer is UVB ( 280 to 320 nm ), which forms pyrimidine dimers in DNA. This type of DNA damage is repaired by nucleotide excision repair pathways that require products of at least 20 genes. With excessive exposure to the sun, the nucleotide excision repair pathway is overwhelmed, and some damage remains unrepaired.

Each chemical carcinogen or reactant creates a characteristic modification in a DNA base. The DNA damage, if not repaired, introduces a mutation into the next generation when the cell proliferates.

## B. Gain-of-Function Mutations in Proto-oncogenes

Proto-oncogenes are converted to oncogenes by mutations in the DNA that cause a gain in function; that is, the protein can now function better in the absence of the normal activating events. Several mechanisms that lead to the conversion of protooncogenes to oncogenes are known:

- Radiation and chemical carcinogens act (1) by causing a mutation in the regulatory region of a gene, increasing the rate of production of the protooncogene protein; or (2) by producing a mutation in the coding portion of the oncogene that results in the synthesis of a protein of slightly different amino acid composition capable of transforming the cell (Fig. 18.3A).
- The entire proto-oncogene or a portion of it may be transposed or translocated; that is, moved from one position in the genome to another (see Fig. 18.3B). In its new location, the proto-oncogene may be under the control of a promoter that is regulated in a manner different from the promoter that normally regulates this gene. This may allow the gene to be expressed in a tissue where it is not normally expressed or at higher-than-normal levels of expression. If only a portion of the proto-oncogene is translocated, it may be expressed as a truncated protein with altered properties, or it may fuse with another gene and produce a fusion protein containing portions of what are normally two separate proteins. The truncated or fusion protein may be hyperactive and cause inappropriate cell growth.
- The proto-oncogene may be amplified (see Fig. 18.3C), so that multiple copies of the gene are produced in a single cell. If more genes are active, more proto-oncogene protein will be produced, increasing the growth rate of the cells. As examples, the oncogene N -myc (a cell proliferation transcription
![ma132486325cc](ma132486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 18.2 Mutations in DNA caused by nitrosamines. Nitrosamines are consumed in many natural products and are produced in the stomach from nitrites used as preservatives and secondary amines found in foods such as fish. They are believed to be responsible for the high incidence of gastric cancer in Japan and Iceland, where salt-preserved fish is a major dietary item. Nitrosamine metabolites methylate guanine (the transferred methyl group is shown in red).

FIGURE 18.3 Transforming mutations in proto-oncogenes. A. Effect of radiation or chemical carcinogens on proto-oncogenes or their promoters. The mutations may be point mutations, deletions, or insertions. B. Gene rearrangements as caused by transposition or translocation of a proto-oncogene or proto-oncogene fragment. C. Amplification of a proto-oncogene allows more protein to be produced.

Burkitt lymphoma is a B-cell malignancy which usually results from a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14. The translocation of genetic material moves the proto-oncogene transcription factor c-myc (normally found on chromosome 8) to another chromosome, usually chromosome 14. The translocated gene is now under the control of the promoter region for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, which leads to inappropriate and overexpression of c-myc. The result may be uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor development. All subtypes of Burkitt lymphoma contain this translocation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of B-cells is also associated with certain types of Burkitt lymphoma.
factor, related to $c-m y c$ ) is amplified in some neuroblastomas, and amplification of the $e r b$-b2 oncogene (a growth-factor receptor) is associated with several breast carcinomas.

- If an oncogenic virus infects a cell, its oncogene may integrate into the hostcell genome, permitting production of the abnormal oncogene protein. The cell may be transformed and exhibit an abnormal pattern of growth. Rather than inserting an oncogene, a virus may simply insert a strong promoter into the host-cell genome. This promoter may cause increased or untimely expression of a normal proto-oncogene.
The important point to remember is that transformation results from abnormalities in the normal growth-regulatory program caused by gain-of-function mutations in proto-oncogenes. However, loss-of-function mutations also occur in the tumorsuppressor genes, repair enzymes, or activators of apoptosis, and a combination of both types of mutations is usually required for full transformation to a cancer cell.


## C. Mutations in Repair Enzymes

Repair enzymes are the first line of defense preventing conversion of chemical damage in DNA to a mutation (see Chapter 13, Section III.B). DNA repair enzymes are tumor-suppressor genes in the sense that errors repaired before replication do not

become mutagenic. DNA damage is constantly occurring from exposure to sunlight, background radiation, toxins, and replication errors. If DNA repair enzymes are absent, mutations accumulate much more rapidly, and once a mutation develops in a growth-regulatory gene, a cancer may arise. As an example, inherited mutations in the tumor-suppressor genes brcal and brca2 predispose women to the development of breast cancer (see "Biochemical Comments" at the end of this chapter). The protein products of these genes play roles in DNA repair, recombination, and regulation of transcription. A second example, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), was introduced in Chapter 13. It results from inherited mutations in enzymes involved in the DNA mismatch repair system.

## III. Oncogenes

Proto-oncogenes control normal cell growth and division. These genes encode proteins that are growth factors, growth-factor receptors, signal transduction proteins, transcription factors, cell-cycle regulators, and regulators of apoptosis (Table 18.1). (The name representing the gene of an oncogene is referred to in lowercase letters and italics [e.g., myc], but the name of the protein product is capitalized and italics are not used [e.g., Myc]). The mutations in oncogenes that give rise to transformation are usually gain-of-function mutations; either a more active protein is produced or an increased amount of the normal protein is synthesized.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can also behave as oncogenes. If an miRNA is overexpressed (increased function), it can act as an oncogene if its target (which would exhibit reduced expression under these conditions) is a protein that is involved in inhibiting, or antagonizing, cell proliferation.

## A. Oncogenes and Signal Transduction Cascades

All of the proteins in growth-factor signal transduction cascades are coded for by proto-oncogenes (Fig. 18.4).

## I. Growth Factors and Growth-Factor Receptors

The genes for both growth factors and growth-factor receptors are proto-oncogenes.
Growth factors generally regulate growth by serving as ligands that bind to cellular receptors located on the plasma membrane (cell-surface receptors) (see Chapter 11). Binding of ligands to these receptors stimulates a signal transduction pathway in the cell that activates the transcription of certain genes. If too much of a growth factor or a growth-factor receptor is produced, the target cells may respond by proliferating inappropriately. Growth-factor receptors may also become oncogenic through translocation or point mutations in domains that affect binding of the growth factor, dimerization, kinase activity, or some other aspect of their signal transmission. In such cases, the receptor transmits a proliferative signal even though the growth factor normally required to activate the receptor is absent. In other words, the receptor is stuck in the "on" position.

## 2. Signal Transduction Proteins

The genes that encode proteins involved in growth-factor signal transduction cascades may also be proto-oncogenes. Consider, for example, the monomeric G-protein Ras. Binding of growth factor leads to the activation of Ras (see Fig. 11.11). When Ras binds guanosine triphosphate (GTP), it is active, but Ras slowly inactivates itself by hydrolyzing its bound GTP to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{i}\right)$. This controls the length of time that Ras is active. Ras is converted to an oncogenic form by point mutations that decrease the activity of the GTPase domain of Ras, thereby increasing the length of time it remains in the active form.

Ras, when it is active, activates the serine-threonine kinase Raf (a mitogenactivated protein [MAP] kinase kinase kinase), which activates MEK (a MAP kinase

## 6

Mannie W: bone marrow cells contain the Philadelphia chromosome, typical of CML. The Philadelphia chromosome results from a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosome 9 and 22. As a consequence, a fusion protein is produced that contains the N -terminal region of the Bcr protein from chromosome 22 and the C -terminal region of the Abl protein from chromosome 9. Abl is a proto-oncogene, and the resulting fusion protein (Bcr-Abl) has lost its regulatory region and is constitutively active, resulting in deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. When it is active, Abl stimulates the Ras pathway of signal transduction, leading to cell proliferation.

The gene for the human epidermal growth-factor receptor (HER2, c-erb-b2) is overexpressed in about $20 \%$ of breast cancer cases. Several drugs have been developed that recognize and blocks the receptor's action. The drug most studied, trastuzumab (Herceptin), has been shown to have survival benefits when used in combination with other chemotherapy. However, some tumors that overexpress HER2 show resistance to Herceptin. Thus, it appears that a complete genotyping of breast cancer cells may be necessary (using the microarray or RNA-SEQ techniques described in Chapter 17) to develop an effective therapy for each patient with the disease, leading to individualized therapy.

kinase), which activates MAP kinase (Fig. 18.5). Activation of MAP kinase results in the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, followed by increased transcription of the transcription-factor proto-oncogenes $m y c$ and fos (see the next section). Note that mutations in the genes for any of the proteins that regulate MAP kinase activity, as well as those proteins induced by MAP kinase activation, can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation.

## 3. Transcription Factors

Many transcription factors, such as Myc and Fos, are proto-oncoproteins (the products of proto-oncogenes). MAP kinase, in addition to inducing myc and fos, also directly activates the AP-1 transcription factor through phosphorylation (see Fig. 18.5).

![ma134486325cc](ma134486325cc.jpg)

(IV) G-proteins, and their regulators, which are also signal transduction proteins. (V) Nonreceptor protein kinase cascades, which lead to phosphorylation of transcription factors. (VI) Nuclear transcription factors that are normally activated through phosphorylation or binding of a ligand.

AP-1 is a heterodimer formed by the protein products of the fos and jun families of proto-oncogenes. The targets of AP-1 activation are genes involved in cellular proliferation and progression through the cell cycle, as are the targets of the myc transcription factor. The synthesis of the transcription factor $c-m y c$ is tightly regulated in normal cells, and it is expressed only during the S phase of the cell cycle. In a large number of tumor types, this regulated expression is lost, and $c-m y c$ becomes inappropriately expressed or overexpressed throughout the cell cycle, driving cells continuously to proliferate.

The net result of alterations in the expression of transcription factors is the increased production of the proteins that carry out the processes required for proliferation.

## B. Oncogenes and the Cell Cycle

Growth factors, hormones, and other messengers activate the growth of human cells, involving DNA replication and cell division in the cell cycle. These activators work through cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that control progression from one phase of the cycle to another (Fig. 18.6). For quiescent cells to proliferate, they must leave $\mathrm{G}_{0}$ and enter the $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ phase of the cell cycle (see Chapter 13, Fig. 13.7). If the proper sequence of events occurs during $G_{1}$, the cells enter the $S$ phase and are committed to DNA replication and cell division. Similarly, during $\mathrm{G}_{2}$, cells make a commitment to mitotic division. CDKs are made constantly throughout the cell cycle but require binding of a specific cyclin to be active. Different cyclins made at different times in the cell cycle control each of the transitions $\left(\mathrm{G}_{1} / \mathrm{S}, \mathrm{S} / \mathrm{G}_{2}, \mathrm{G}_{2} / \mathrm{M}\right)$.

The activity of the cyclin-CDK complex is further regulated through phosphorylation and through inhibitory proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) (Fig. 18.7). CKIs slow cell-cycle progression by binding and inhibiting

the CDK-cyclin complexes. CDKs are also controlled through activating phosphorylation by cyclin-activating kinases (CAKs) and inhibitory hyperphosphorylation kinases.

To illustrate the role of these proteins, consider some of the events that occur at the $G_{1} / S$ checkpoint (Fig. 18.8). Because the cell is committed to DNA replication and division once it enters the $S$ phase, multiple regulatory proteins are involved in determining whether the cell is ready to pass this checkpoint. These regulatory proteins include Cdk4 and Cdk6 (which are constitutively produced throughout the cell cycle), cyclin D (whose synthesis is induced only after growth-factor stimulation of a quiescent cell), the retinoblastoma gene product ( Rb ), and a class of transcription factors known collectively as E2F. In quiescent cells, Rb is complexed with E2F, resulting in inhibition of these transcription factors. Upon growth-factor stimulation, the cyclin Ds are induced (there are three types of cyclin D: D1, D2, and D3). They bind to Cdk4 and Cdk6, converting them to active protein kinases. One of the targets of cyclin/CDK phosphorylation is the Rb protein. Phosphorylation of Rb releases it from E2F, and E2F is then free to activate the transcription of genes required for entry into S phase. The Rb protein is a tumor-suppressor gene (more to follow).

The proteins induced by E2F include cyclin E, cyclin A, cdc25A (an activating protein phosphatase), and proteins required to bind at origins of replication to initiate DNA synthesis. The synthesis of cyclin E allows it to complex with Cdk2, forming another active cyclin complex that retains activity into S phase (see Fig. 18.6). One of the major functions of the cyclin E1-Cdk2 complex is hyperphosphorylation of the Rb protein, thereby keeping Rb in its inactive state. Cyclin A also complexes with Cdk2, and it phosphorylates, and inactivates, the E2F family of transcription factors. This ensures that the signals are not present for extended periods of time. Thus, each phase of the cell cycle activates the next through cyclin synthesis. The cyclins are removed by regulated proteolysis.
![ma138486325cc](ma138486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 18.8 Control of the $G_{1} / S$ transition in the cell cycle. The genes that encode cyclins and CDKs are oncogenes, and the gene that encodes the retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) is a tumor-suppressor gene. CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.

Progression through the cell cycle is opposed by the CKIs (see Fig. 18.8). The CKIs regulating cyclin/CDK expression in the $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ phase of the cell cycle fall into two categories: the Cip/Kip family and the INK4 (inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase-4) family. The Cip/Kip family members (p21, p27, and p57) have a broad specificity and inhibit all cyclin-CDK complexes. The INK4 family, which consists of p15, p16, p18, and p19, are specific for the cyclin D-Cdk4/6 family of complexes. The regulation of synthesis of different CKIs is complex, but some are induced by DNA damage to the cell and halt cell-cycle progression until the damage can be repaired. For example, the CKI p21 (a protein of $21,000 \mathrm{Da}$ ) is a key member of this group that responds to specific signals to block cell proliferation. If the damage cannot be repaired, an apoptotic pathway is selected and the cell dies.

## IV. Tumor-Suppressor Genes

Like the oncogenes, the tumor-suppressor genes encode molecules involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Table 18.2 provides several examples. The normal function of tumor-suppressor proteins is generally to inhibit proliferation in response to certain signals such as DNA damage. The signal is removed when the cell is fully equipped to proliferate; the effect of the elimination of tumorsuppressor genes is to remove the brakes on cell growth. They affect cell-cycle regulation, signal transduction, transcription, and cell adhesion. The products of tumor-suppressor genes frequently modulate pathways that are activated by the products of proto-oncogenes.

Tumor-suppressor genes contribute to the development of cancer when both copies of the gene are inactivated. This is different from the case of proto-oncogene mutations because only one allele of a proto-oncogene needs to be converted to an oncogene to initiate transformation. As with the oncogenes, this is also applicable to miRNAs. If the expression of a particular miRNA is lost, the messenger RNA (mRNA) it regulates would be overexpressed, which could lead to enhanced cellular proliferation. Thus, miRNAs can be classified as either oncogenes (overexpression) or tumor suppressors (loss of function), depending on the genes that they regulate.

## A. Tumor-Suppressor Genes that Regulate the Cell Cycle Directly

The two best-understood cell-cycle regulators that are also tumor suppressors are the retinoblastoma $(R b)$ and $p 53$ genes.

(3)In addition to sunlight and a preexisting nevus, hereditary factors also play a role in the development of malignant melanoma. Ten percent of melanomas tend to run in families. Some of the suspected melanoma-associated genes include the tumor-suppressor gene p16 (an inhibitor of Cdk4) and cdk4. Calvin A. was the single child of parents who died in a car accident in their 50 s, and thus, a familial tendency could not be assessed.

![ma139486325cc](ma139486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 18.9 Mutations in the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene. A. Sporadic retinoblastoma. B. Familial retinoblastoma.

Inheritance of a mutation in p53 leads to Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which is characterized by multiple types of tumors. Mutations in p53 are present in $>50 \%$ of human tumors. These are secondary mutations within the cell, and if p 53 is mutated, the overall rate of cellular mutation will increase because there is no p53 to check for DNA damage, to initiate the repair of the damaged DNA, or to initiate apoptosis if the damage is not repaired. Thus, damaged DNA is replicated, and the frequency of additional mutations within the same cell increases remarkably.

## I. The Retinoblastoma Gene

As discussed previously, the retinoblastoma gene product, Rb , functions in the transition from $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ to S phase and regulates the activation of members of the E2F family of transcription factors (see Fig. 18.8). If an individual inherits a mutated copy of the Rb allele, there is a $100 \%$ chance of that individual developing retinoblastoma because of the high probability that the second allele of Rb will gain a mutation (Fig.18.9). This is considered familial retinoblastoma. Individuals who do not inherit mutations in Rb, but who develop retinoblastoma, are said to have sporadic retinoblastoma and acquire two specific mutations, one in each Rb allele of the retinoblast, during their lifetime.

## 2. p53, The Guardian of the Genome

The p53 protein is a transcription factor that regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis, which is programmed cell death. Loss of both p53 alleles is found in $>50 \%$ of human tumors. p53 acts as the "guardian of the genome" by halting replication in cells that have suffered DNA damage and targeting unrepaired cells to apoptosis.

In response to DNA-damaging mutagens, ionizing radiation, or UV light, the level of p53 rises (Fig. 18.10, circle 1). p53, acting as a transcription factor, stimulates transcription of p21 (a member of the Cip/Kip family of CKIs), as shown in Figure 18.10, circle 2. The p21 gene product inhibits the cyclin-CDK complexes, which prevents the phosphorylation of Rb and release of E2F proteins. The cell is thus prevented from entering S phase. p53 also stimulates the transcription of a number of DNA repair enzymes (including growth arrest and DNA damage [GADD45]) (Fig. 18.10, circle 3). If the DNA is successfully repaired, p53 induces its own downregulation through the activation of the $m d m 2$ gene. If the DNA repair was not successful, p53 activates several genes involved in apoptosis, including bax (discussed in the next section) and insulinlike growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGF-BP3) (Fig. 18.10, circle 4). The IGF-BP3 protein product binds the receptor for insulinlike growth factor, which presumably induces apoptosis by blocking the

Mechanisms that recognize DNA damage stop p53 degradation and modify the p53 protein (circle I). p53 stimulates the transcription of p2I (circle 2) and GADD45 (circle 3). p2I blocks the cyclin/CDK phosphorylation of Rb, which continues to inhibit the E2F family of transcription factors, thereby blocking cell progression through the cell cycle. GADD45 allows the DNA damage to be repaired. If the damage is not repaired, apoptotic genes are activated (circle 4). CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma; UV, ultraviolet.
antiapoptotic signaling by growth factors, and the cell enters a growth factor deprivation mode.

## B. Tumor-Suppressor Genes that Affect Receptors and Signal Transduction

Tumor-suppressor genes may encode receptors, components of the signaling transduction pathway, or transcription factors.

## I. Regulators of Ras

The Ras family of proteins is involved in signal transduction for many hormones and growth factors (see Section III.A.2) and is therefore oncogenic. The activity of these pathways is interrupted by GTPase-activating proteins [GAPs]; see Chapter 10, (Section III.E.1), which vary among cell types. Neurofibromin, the product of the tumor-suppressor gene $N F-1$, is a nervous system-specific GAP that regulates the activity of Ras in neuronal tissues. The growth signal is transmitted so long as the Ras protein binds GTP. Binding of NF-1 to Ras activates the GTPase domain of Ras, which hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, thereby inactivating Ras. Without a functional neurofibromin molecule, Ras is perpetually active.

## 2. Patched and Smoothened

A good example of tumor suppressors and oncogenes working together is provided by the coreceptor genes patched and smoothened, which encode the receptor for the hedgehog class of signaling peptides. (The strange names of some of the tumorsuppressor genes arose because they were first discovered in Drosophila [fruit fly], and the names of Drosophila mutations are often based on the appearance of a fly that expresses the mutation. Once the human homolog is found, it is given the same name as the Drosophila gene.) These coreceptors normally function to control growth during embryogenesis and illustrate the importance of maintaining a balance between oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. The Patched receptor protein inhibits Smoothened, its coreceptor protein. Binding of a hedgehog ligand to Patched releases the inhibition of Smoothened, which then transmits an activating signal to the nucleus, stimulating new gene transcription (Fig. 18.11). Smoothened is a protooncogene, and patched is a tumor-suppressor gene. If patched loses its function (definition of a tumor suppressor), then Smoothened can signal the cell to proliferate, even in the absence of a hedgehog signal. Conversely, if smoothened undergoes a gain-of-function mutation (definition of an oncogene), it can signal in the absence of the hedgehog signal, even in the presence of Patched. Inherited mutations in either smoothened or patched will lead to an increased incidence of basal cell carcinoma.

(1)An inherited mutation in NF-I can lead to neurofibromatosis, a disease primarily of numerous benign, but painful, tumors of the nervous system. The movie Elephant Man was based on an individual who was believed to have had this disease. Recent analysis of the patient's remains, however, indicates that he may have suffered from the rare Proteus syndrome, not neurofibromatosis.

The APC complex activates $\beta$-catenin for proteolytic degradation. If APC is inactivated, $\beta$-catenin levels increase. It acts as a transcription factor that increases synthesis of myc and other genes that regulate cell cycle progression.
![ma143486325cc](ma143486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 18.11 The Patched/Smoothened signaling system. A. In the absence of a hedgehog (HH) signal, Smoothened is inactive owing to inhibition by the HH receptor Patched, and the GLI transcription factor complex acts as a repressor of transcription. B. When a ligand binds to the Patched receptor, the inhibition of Smoothened is repressed, leading to an activation of the GLI complex and active transcription of the target genes.

## C. Tumor-Suppressor Genes that Affect Cell Adhesion

The cadherin family of glycoproteins mediates calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Cadherins form intercellular complexes that bind cells together (Fig. 18.12A). They are anchored intracellularly by catenins, which bind to actin filaments. Loss of E-cadherin expression may contribute to the ability of cancer cells to detach and migrate in metastasis. Individuals who inherit a mutation in E-cadherin (this mutation is designated $C D H 1$ ) are sharply predisposed to developing diffuse-type gastric cancer.

The catenin proteins have two functions: In addition to anchoring cadherins to the cytoskeleton, they act as transcription factors (see Fig. 18.12B). $\beta$-Catenin also binds to a complex that contains the regulatory protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), which targets it for degradation. When the appropriate signal inactivates APC, $\beta$-catenin levels increase and it travels to the nucleus, where it activates myc and cyclin D1 transcription, leading to cell proliferation. APC is a tumor-suppressor gene. If it is inactivated, it cannot bind $\beta$-catenin and inhibit cell proliferation. Mutations in APC or proteins that interact with it are found in the vast majority of sporadic human colon cancer. Inherited mutations in APC lead to one of the most common form of hereditary colon cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

## V. Cancer and Apoptosis

In the body, superfluous or unwanted cells are destroyed by a pathway called apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Apoptosis is a regulated energy-dependent sequence of events by which a cell self-destructs. In this suicidal process, the

cell shrinks, the chromatin condenses, and the nucleus fragments. The cell membrane forms blebs (outpouches), and the cell breaks up into membrane-enclosed apoptotic vesicles (apoptotic bodies) containing varying amounts of cytoplasm, organelles, and DNA fragments. Phosphatidylserine, a lipid on the inner leaflet of the cell membrane, is exposed on the external surface of these apoptotic vesicles. It is one of the phagocytic markers recognized by macrophages and other nearby phagocytic cells that engulf the apoptotic bodies.

Apoptosis is a normal part of multiple processes in complex organisms: embryogenesis, the maintenance of proper cell number in tissues, the removal of infected or otherwise injured cells, the maintenance of the immune system, and aging. It can be initiated by injury, radiation, free radicals or other toxins, withdrawal of growth factors or hormones, binding of proapoptotic cytokines, or interactions with cytotoxic T-cells in the immune system. Apoptosis can protect organisms from the negative effects of mutations by destroying cells with irreparably damaged DNA before they proliferate. Just as an excess of a growth signal can produce an excess of unwanted cells, the failure of apoptosis to remove excess or damaged cells can contribute to the development of cancer.

## A. Normal Pathways to Apoptosis

Apoptosis can be divided into three general phases: an initiation phase, a signal integration phase, and an execution phase. Apoptosis can be initiated by external signals that work through death receptors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or deprivation of growth hormones (Fig. 18.13). It can also be initiated by intracellular events that affect mitochondrial integrity (e.g., oxygen deprivation, radiation) and irreparably damaged DNA. In the signal integration phase, these proapoptotic signals are balanced against antiapoptotic cell survival signals by several pathways, including members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The execution phase is carried out by proteolytic enzymes called caspases.

## I. Caspases

Caspases are cysteine proteases that cleave peptide bonds next to an aspartate residue. They are present in the cell as procaspases, zymogen-type enzyme precursors that are activated by proteolytic cleavage of the inhibitory portion of their polypeptide chain. The different caspases are generally divided into two groups according to their function: initiator caspases, which specifically cleave other procaspases; and execution caspases, which cleave other cellular proteins involved in maintaining cellular integrity (see Fig. 18.13). The initiator caspases are activated through two major signaling pathways: the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial integrity pathway. They activate the execution caspases, which cleave protein kinases involved in cell adhesion, lamins that form the inner lining of the nuclear envelope, actin and other proteins required for cell structure, and DNA repair enzymes. They also cleave an inhibitor protein of the endonuclease caspase-activated $D$ Nase (CAD), thereby activating CAD to initiate the degradation of cellular DNA. With destruction of the nuclear envelope, additional endonucleases $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right.$ - and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ dependent) also become activated.

## 2. The Death Receptor Pathway to Apoptosis

The death receptors are a subset of TNF-1 receptors, which includes Fas/CD95, TNFreceptor 1 (TNF-R1), and death receptor 3 (DR3). These receptors form a trimer that binds TNF-1 or another death ligand on its external domain and binds adaptor proteins to its intracellular domain (Fig.18.14). The activated TNF-receptor complex forms the scaffold for binding two molecules of procaspase 8 (or procaspase 10), which autocatalytically cleave each other to form active caspase 8 (or caspase 10). Caspases 8 and 10 are initiator caspases that activate execution caspases 3, 6, and 7. Caspase 3 also cleaves a Bcl-2 protein, Bid, to a form that activates the mitochondrial integrity pathway to apoptosis.
![ma144486325cc](ma144486325cc.jpg)

FIGURE 18.13 Major components in apoptosis. The release of cytochrome c (cytC) from mitochondria, or activation of death receptors, can lead to the initiation of apoptosis.

The ligand (either a free ligand or a cell surface-associated protein from another cell) binds to the death receptor, which makes a scaffold for autocatalytic activation of caspase 8 (and sometimes 10). Active caspase 8 (and sometimes 10) cleave apoptotic execution caspases directly. However, the pathway also activates Bid, which acts on mitochondrial membrane integrity.

FIGURE 18.15 The mitochondrial integrity pathway releases cytochrome c, which binds to Apaf and forms a multimeric complex called the apoptosome. The apoptosome converts procaspase 9 to active caspase 9, an initiator caspase, which is released by the apoptosome into the cytosol. ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

# 3. The Mitochondrial Integrity Pathway to Apoptosis 

Apoptosis is also induced by intracellular signals indicating that cell death should occur. Examples of these signals include growth-factor withdrawal, cell injury, the release of certain steroids, and an inability to maintain low levels of intracellular calcium. All of these treatments, or changes, lead to release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (Fig. 18.15). Cytochrome c is a necessary protein component of the mitochondrial electron-transport chain that is loosely bound to the outside of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Its release initiates apoptosis.

In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds proapoptotic protease-activating factor (Apaf). The Apaf/cytochrome c complex binds caspase 9, an initiator caspase, to form an active complex called the apoptosome. The apoptosome, in turn, activates execution caspases ( 3,6 , and 7 ) by zymogen cleavage.

## 4. Integration of Pro- and Antiapoptotic Signals by the Bcl-2 Family of Proteins

The Bcl-2 family members are decision makers that integrate pro-death and antideath signals to determine whether the cell should commit suicide. Both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family exist (Table 18.3). Bcl-2 family members contain regions of homology, known as Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains. There are four such domains. The antiapoptotic factors contain all four domains (BH1 to BH 4 ). The channel forming proapoptotic factors contain just three domains (BH1 to BH3), whereas the proapoptotic BH3 only family members contain just one BH domain, BH3.

The antiapoptotic Bcl-2-type proteins (including Bcl-2, Bcl-L, and Bcl-w) have at least two ways of antagonizing death signals. They insert into the outer mitochondrial membrane to antagonize channel-forming proapoptotic factors, thereby decreasing cytochrome c release. They may also bind cytoplasmic Apaf so that it cannot form the apoptosome complex (Fig. 18.16).

These antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are opposed by proapoptotic family members that fall into two categories: ion-channel-forming members and BH3-only members.

TABLE 18.3 Examples of Bcl-2 Family Members

| Antiapoptotic |
| :-- |
| Bcl-2 |
| Bcl-x |
| Bcl-w |
| Proapoptotic (Channel-forming) |
| Bax |
| Bak |
| Bok |
| Proapoptotic (BH3-only) |
| Bad |
| Bid |
| Bim |

Roughly 30 Bcl-2 family members are currently known. These proteins play tissue-specific as well as signal pathway-specific roles in regulating apoptosis. The tissue specificity is overlapping. For example, Bcl-2 is expressed in hair follicles, kidney, small intestines, neurons, and the lymphoid system, whereas Bcl-x is expressed in the nervous system and hematopoietic cells.

The pro-death, ion-channel-forming members, such as Bax, are very similar to the antiapoptotic family members, except that they do not contain the binding domain for Apaf. They have the other structural domains, however, and when they dimerize with proapoptotic BH3-only members in the outer mitochondrial membrane, they form an ion channel that promotes cytochrome c release rather than inhibiting it (see Fig. 18.16). The pro-death BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bim and Bid) contain only the structural domain that allows them to bind to other Bcl-2 family members (the BH3 domain), and not the domains for binding to the membrane, forming ion channels, or binding to Apaf. Their binding activates the pro-death family members and inactivates the antiapoptotic members. When the cell receives a signal from a pro-death agonist, a BH3 protein like Bid is activated (see Fig. 18.16). The BH3 protein activates Bax (an ion-channel-forming proapoptotic channel member), which stimulates release of cytochrome c. Normally, Bcl-2 acts as a death antagonist by binding Apaf and keeping it in an inactive state. However, at the same time that Bid is activating Bax, Bid also binds to Bcl-2, thereby disrupting the Bcl-2-Apaf complex and freeing Apaf to bind to released cytochrome c to form the apoptosome.

FIGURE 18.16 Roles of the Bcl-2 family members in regulating apoptosis. Bcl-2, which is antiapoptotic, binds Bid (or truncated Bid [tBid]) and blocks formation of channels that allow cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Death signals result in activation of a BH3-only protein such as Bid, which can lead to mitochondrial pore formation, swelling, and release of cytochrome c. Bid binds to and activates the membrane ion-channel proapoptotic protein Bax, activating cytochrome c release, which binds to Apaf and leads to formation of the apoptosome.

When Bcl-2 is mutated and oncogenic, it is usually overexpressed; for example, in follicular lymphoma and CML. Overexpression of Bcl-2 disrupts the normal regulation of pro- and antiapoptotic factors and tips the balance to an antiapoptotic stand. This leads to an inability to destroy cells with damaged DNA, such that mutations can accumulate within the cell. Bcl-2 is also a multidrug-resistant transport protein, and if it is overexpressed, it will block the induction of apoptosis by antitumor agents by rapidly removing them from the cell. Thus, strategies are being developed to reduce Bcl-2 levels in tumors that overexpress it before initiating drug or radiation treatment.

FIGURE 18.17 Possible steps in the development of colon cancer. The changes do not always occur in this order, but the most benign tumors have the lowest frequency of mutations, and the most malignant have the highest frequency.

## B. Cancer Cells Bypass Apoptosis

Apoptosis should be triggered by several stimuli such as withdrawal of growth factors, elevation of p53 in response to DNA damage, monitoring of DNA damage by repair enzymes, or release of TNF or other immune factors. However, mutations in oncogenes can create apoptosis-resistant cells.

One of the ways this occurs is through activation of growth-factor-dependent signaling pathways that inhibit apoptosis, such as the PDGF/Akt/BAD pathway. Nonphosphorylated BAD acts like Bid in promoting apoptosis (see Fig. 18.16). Binding of the platelet-derived growth factor to its receptor activates PI-3 kinase, which phosphorylates and activates the serine-threonine kinase Akt (protein kinase B; see Chapter 11, Section III.B.3). Activation of Akt results in the phosphorylation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein BAD, which inactivates it. The PDGF/Akt/BAD pathway illustrates the requirement of normal cells for growth-factor stimulation to prevent cell death. One of the features of neoplastic transformation is the loss of growthfactor dependence for survival. The MAP kinase pathway is also involved in regulating apoptosis and sends cell-survival signals. MAP kinase kinase phosphorylates and activates another protein kinase known as RSK. Like Akt, RSK phosphorylates BAD and inhibits its activity. Thus, BAD acts as a site of convergence for the PI-3 kinase/ Akt and MAP kinase pathways in signaling cell survival. Gain-of-function mutations in the genes that control these pathways, such as ras, create apoptosis-resistant cells.

## C. MicroRNAs and Apoptosis

Recent work has identified a number of miRNAs which regulate apoptotic factors. Bcl-2, for example, is regulated by at least two miRNAs, designated as miR-15 and miR-16. Expression of these miRNAs will control Bcl-2 (an antiapoptotic factor) levels in the cell. If, for any reason, the expression of these miRNAs is altered, Bcl-2 levels will also be altered, promoting either apoptosis (if Bcl-2 levels decrease) or cell proliferation (if Bcl-2 levels increase). Loss of both of these miRNAs is found in $68 \%$ of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, most often caused by a deletion on chromosome 13q14. Loss of miR-15 and -16 expression would lead to an increase in Bcl-2 levels, favoring increased cell proliferation.

Other miRNA species have been identified which regulate factors involved in apoptosis. miR-21 regulates the expression of the programmed cell death 4 gene (PDCD4). PDCD4 is upregulated during apoptosis and functions to block translation. Loss of miR-21 activity would lead to cell death because PDCD4 would be overexpressed. However, overexpression of miR-21 would be antiapoptotic because PDCD4 expression would be ablated.

The miR-17 cluster regulates the protein kinase B/Akt pathway by modulating the levels of PTEN (the enzyme that converts phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate $\left[\mathrm{PIP}_{3}\right]$ to phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate $\left[\mathrm{PIP}_{2}\right]$ ), as well as the levels of the E2F family of transcription factors. An upregulation of miR-17, acting as an oncogene, would decrease PTEN levels such that cellular proliferation is favored over apoptosis, resulting from the constant activation of the Akt pathway.

## VI. Cancer Requires Multiple Mutations

Cancer takes a long time to develop in humans because multiple genetic alterations are required to transform normal cells into malignant cells (see Fig. 18.1). A single change in one oncogene or tumor-suppressor gene in an individual cell is not adequate for transformation. For example, if cells derived from biopsy specimens of normal cells are not already "immortalized"-that is, able to grow in culture indefinitelyaddition of the ras oncogene to the cells is not sufficient for transformation. However, additional mutations in a combination of oncogenes-for example, ras and $m y c$-can result in transformation (Fig. 18.17). Epidemiologists have estimated that four to seven mutations are required for normal cells to be transformed.

Cells accumulate multiple mutations through clonal expansion. When DNA damage occurs in a normally proliferative cell, a population of cells with that mutation is produced. Expansion of the mutated population enormously increases the probability of a second mutation in a cell containing the first mutation. After one or more mutations in proto-oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes, a cell may proliferate more rapidly in the presence of growth stimuli and with further mutations grow autonomously; that is, independent of normal growth controls. Enhanced growth increases the probability of further mutations. Some families have a strong predisposition to cancer. Individuals in these families have inherited a mutation or deletion of one allele of a tumor-suppressor gene, and as progeny of that cell proliferate, mutations can occur in the second allele, leading to a loss of control of cellular proliferation. These familial cancers include familial retinoblastoma, FAPs of the colon, and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), one form of which involves tumors of the thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal medulla (MEN type II).

Studies of benign and malignant polyps of the colon show that these tumors have a number of different genetic abnormalities. The incidence of these mutations increases with the level of malignancy. In the early stages, normal cells of the intestinal epithelium proliferate, develop mutations in the APC gene, and polyps develop (see Fig. 18.17). This change is associated with a mutation in the ras proto-oncogene that converts it to an active oncogene. Progression to the next stage is associated with a deletion or alteration of a tumor-suppressor gene on chromosome 5. Subsequently, mutations occur in chromosome 18, inactivating a gene that may be involved in cell adhesion, and in chromosome 17, inactivating the p53 tumor-suppressor gene. The cells become malignant, and further mutations result in growth that is more aggressive and metastatic. This sequence of mutations is not always followed precisely, but an accumulation of mutations in these genes is found in a large percentage of colon carcinomas.

## VII. At the Molecular Level, Cancer Is Many Different Diseases

More than 20\% of the deaths in the United States each year are caused by cancer, with tumors of the lung, large intestine, and breast being the most common (Fig. 18.18). Different cell types typically use different mechanisms through which they lose the ability to control their own growth. An examination of the genes involved in the

A treatment for CML based on rational drug design has been developed. The fusion protein Bcr-Abl is found only in transformed cells that express the Philadelphia chromosome and not in normal cells. Once the structure of Bcr-Abl was determined, the drug imatinib (Gleevec) was designed to specifically bind to and inhibit only the active site of the fusion protein and not the normal protein. Imatinib was successful in blocking Bcr-Abl function, thereby stopping cell proliferation, and in some cells inducing apoptosis, so the cells would die. Because normal cells do not express the hybrid protein, they were not affected by the drug. The problem with this treatment is that some patients suffered relapses, and when their Bcr-Abl proteins were studied it was found that in some patients, the fusion protein had a single amino acid substitution near the active site that prevented imatinib from binding to the protein. Other patients had an amplification of the Bcr-Abl gene product. Other TKIs (such as dasatinib and nilotinib) can also be used in treating CML if a resistance to imatinib (Gleevec) is encountered.
development of cancer shows that a particular type of cancer can arise in multiple ways. For example, Patched and Smoothened are the receptor and coreceptor for the signaling peptide sonic hedgehog. Either mutation of smoothened, an oncogene, or inactivation of patched, a tumor-suppressor gene, can give rise to basal cell carcinoma. Similarly, TGF- $\beta$ and its signal transduction proteins Smad4/DPC are part of the same growth-inhibiting pathway, and either may be absent in colon cancer. Thus, treatments that are successful for one patient with colon cancer may not be successful in a second patient with colon cancer because of the differences in the molecular basis of each individual's disease (this now appears to be the case with breast cancer as well). Medical practice in the future will require identifying the molecular lesions involved in a particular disease and developing appropriate treatments accordingly. The use of proteomics, RNA-SEQ, and gene chip technology (see Chapter 17) to genotype tumor tissues, and to understand which proteins they express, will aid greatly in allowing patient-specific treatments to be developed.

# VIII. Viruses and Human Cancer 

Three RNA retroviruses are associated with the development of cancer in humans: human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), HIV, and hepatitis C. There are also DNA viruses associated with cancer, such as hepatitis B, EBV, human papillomavirus (HPV), and herpesvirus (HHV-8).

HTLV-1 causes adult T-cell leukemia. The HTLV-1 genome encodes a protein, Tax, which is a transcriptional coactivator. The cellular proto-oncogenes $c$-sis and $c$-fos are activated by Tax, thereby altering the normal controls on cellular proliferation and leading to malignancy. Thus, tax is a viral oncogene without a counterpart in the host-cell genome.

Infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, leads to the development of neoplastic disease through several mechanisms. HIV infection leads to immunosuppression and, consequently, loss of immune-mediated tumor surveillance. HIV-infected individuals are predisposed to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which results from an overproduction of T-cell lymphocytes. The HIV genome encodes a protein, Tat, a transcription factor that activates transcription of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) genes in infected T-cells. IL-6 and IL-10 are growth factors that promote proliferation of T-cells, and thus, their increased production may contribute to the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Tat can also be released from infected cells and act as an angiogenic (blood vessel-forming) growth factor. This property is thought to contribute to the development of Kaposi sarcoma.

DNA viruses also cause human cancer, but by different mechanisms. Chronic hepatitis B infections will lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. A vaccine currently is available to prevent hepatitis B infections. EBV is associated with B- and T-cell lymphomas, Hodgkin disease, and other tumors. The EBV encodes a Bcl-2 protein that restricts apoptosis of the infected cell. HHV-8 has been associated with Kaposi sarcoma. Certain strains of papillomavirus are the major cause of cervical cancer, and a vaccine has been developed against those specific papillomavirus strains.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Mannie W. The treatment of a symptomatic patient with CML whose white blood cell count is in excess of 50,000 cells $/ \mathrm{mL}$ is initiated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). If one type is not tolerated or successful, another one is tried. In addition, both $\gamma$ - and $\beta$-interferon have shown promise in increasing survival in these patients if they are intolerant to the TKI. Interestingly, the interferons have been associated with the disappearance of the Philadelphia chromosome in dividing marrow cells of some patients treated in this way. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can also be an option for treatment.

![ma150486325cc](ma150486325cc.jpg)

Michael T. Surgical resection of the lung nodule with an attempt at cure was justified in Michael T., who had a good prognosis with a $\mathrm{T}_{1}, \mathrm{~N}_{0}, \mathrm{M}_{0}$ staging classification preoperatively. Because of his history and the characteristics of the nodule, there was a high probability it was a malignant nodule and a preoperative positron emission tomography (PET) scan did not show obvious signs of metastasis.

Unfortunately, Michael developed a metastatic lesion in the right temporal cortex of his brain 6 months later. Because metastases were almost certainly present in other organs, Michael's brain tumor was not treated surgically. In spite of palliative radiation therapy to the brain, Michael T. succumbed to his disease just 9 months after its discovery, an unusually virulent course for this malignancy. On postmortem examination, it was found that his body was riddled with metastatic disease.

Clark T. Clark T. requires regular colonoscopies to check for new polyps in his intestinal tract. It is recommended he initially has a colonoscopy 1 year after the surgery, and if no polyps are found, the next colonoscopy can be at 3 years. Because the development of a metastatic adenoma requires a number of years (because of the large numbers of mutations that must occur), frequent checks will enable new polyps to be identified and removed before malignant tumors develop.

Calvin A. The biopsy of Calvin A.'s excised mole showed that it was not malignant. The most important clinical sign of a malignant melanoma are changes in color or variation in color and irregular borders. Unlike benign (nondysplastic) nevi, melanomas exhibit striking variations in pigmentation, appearing in shades of black, brown, red, dark blue, and gray. Additional clinical warning signs of a melanoma are enlargement of a preexisting mole, itching or pain in a preexisting mole, or development of a new pigmented lesion during adult life. Calvin A. was advised to conduct a monthly self-examination, to have a clinical skin examination once or twice yearly, to avoid sunlight, and to use appropriate sunscreens.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

HNPCC and hereditary breast cancer both result from inherited mutations in genes involved in DNA repair.

HNPCC is estimated to account for between $2 \%$ and $3 \%$ of all colon cancer cases. These syndromes are heterogeneous, most likely owing to the finding that mutations in any of five genes could lead to colon cancer. The disease genes include $h M S H 2, h M L H 1, h P M S 1, h P M S 2$, and $h M S H 6$. These genes all play a role in DNA mismatch repair, and all act as tumor suppressors (a loss of function is required for the tumor to develop).

It is important to understand that the lack of a DNA mismatch repair enzyme actually does not directly lead to cancer (such as an activating mutation in myc would do, for example). However, the lack of a functional mismatch repair system increases the frequency at which new mutations are introduced into somatic cells (particularly rapidly proliferating cells such as the colonic epithelium), such that eventually a mutation will result in a gene necessary for proper growth control. Once that mutation occurs, tumors can begin to develop.

Five percent to $10 \%$ of all breast cancer cases have been traced to inherited mutations in either one of two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. BRCA1 maps to chromosome 17 and acts as a tumor suppressor. The biochemical function of BRCA1 is to participate in the response to DNA damage. BRCAI is phosphorylated by a variety of kinases, each of which is activated by a different form of DNA damage. BRCA1 is primarily involved in repairing double-strand breaks in DNA, and in transcriptioncoupled repair. Once BRCA1 is phosphorylated, it will signal for cell cycle arrest in order to allow the DNA damage to be repaired.

Women who carry a BRCA1 mutation have a $55 \%$ to $65 \%$ risk of developing breast cancer, and about a $40 \%$ risk of ovarian cancer, by the age of 70 years. Men who carry BRCA1 mutations have been shown to have a slight increase in breast cancer and prostate cancer.

The TNM system is a cancer staging system that standardizes the classification of tumors. The $T$ stands for the size and extent of the primary tumor (the higher number stands for a larger and more extensive tumor), the $N$ stands for the amount of regional lymph nodes that are affected by the tumor (again, the higher the number, the worse the prognosis), and $M$ stands for the presence of metastasis ( 0 for none, I for the presence of metastatic cells).

Mutations associated with malignant melanomas include ras (gain of function in growth signal-transduction oncogene), p53 (loss of function of tumor-suppressor gene), p16 (loss of function in cdk inhibitor tumor suppressor gene), cdk4 (gain of function in a cell-cycle progression oncogene), and cadherin/ $\beta$-catenin regulation (loss of regulation that requires attachment).

The other gene involved in hereditary breast cancer is BRCA2, located on chromosome 13. BRCA2 is required for DNA double-strand break repair, which is usually caused by ionizing radiation. As such, loss of BRCA2 activity is required for cancer to develop, classifying BRCA2 as a tumor suppressor. BRCA2 is also required for homologous recombination between sister chromatids during meiosis and mitosis. BRCA2 mutations have also been liked to increased incidence of breast and ovarian cancer in women, and breast cancer and prostate cancer in men. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations account for about $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of all hereditary breast cancer cases.

An understanding of the roles of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in repairing double-strand breaks in DNA has led to the development of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) inhibitors for the treatment of BRCA1- or BRCA2-induced breast cancers. Doublestrand break repair occurs either by homologous recombination (requiring the activities of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins) or through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which is an error-prone process, owing to trimming of the DNA ends before ligation.

Single-strand breaks in DNA are more common than double-strand breaks. The cellular mechanism for repairing single-strand breaks is dependent on PARP-1. PARP-1 produces large branched chains of poly(ADP-ribose), derived from $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, at the site of damage, which acts as a docking station for proteins involved in repairing the single-strand break. Inhibiting PARP-1 would lead to an accumulation of single-strand breaks in the DNA.

PARP-1 inhibitors are effective in killing BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutated cells in that when single-strand breaks are not repaired, they of ten are converted to doublestrand breaks when the replisome tries to replicate through the break. In a cell lacking BRCA1 or BRCA2 activity, the only way the DNA can be repaired is by NHEJ, which is an error-prone process. This leads to the cells accumulating a large number of mutations, eventually leading to cell death. Cells with functional BRCA1 or BRCA2 activity will not undergo that fate. Drugs which inhibit PARP-1 activity in cell culture are now in clinical trials, with very promising results.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Cancer is the term applied to a group of diseases in which cells no longer respond to normal constraints on growth.
- Cancer arises owing to mutations in the genome (either inherited or formed in somatic cells).
- The mutations that lead to cancer occur in certain classes of genes, including:
- Those that regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation
- Those that suppress growth
- Those that target cells for apoptosis
- Those that repair damaged DNA
- Mutations that lead to cancer can be either gain-of-function mutations or loss of activity within a protein.
- Gain-of-function mutations occur in proto-oncogenes, resulting in oncogenes.
- Loss-of-function mutations occur in tumor-suppressor genes.
- Examples of proto-oncogenes are those involved in signal transduction and cell cycle progression:
- Growth factors and growth-factor receptors
- Ras (a GTP-binding protein)
- Transcription factors
- Cyclins and proteins that regulate them
- microRNAs which regulate growth-inhibitory proteins
- Examples of tumor-suppressor genes include the following:
- Retinoblastoma ( Rb$)$ gene product, which regulates the $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{i}}$-to-S phase of the cell cycle
- p53, which monitors DNA damage and arrests cell-cycle progression until the damage has been repaired

- Regulators of ras
- microRNAs that regulate growth-promoting signals
- Apoptosis (programmed cell death) leads to the destruction of damaged cells that cannot be repaired, and it consists of three phases:
- Initiation phase (external signals or mitochondrial release of cytochrome c)
- Signal integration phase
- Execution phase
- Apoptosis is regulated by a group of proteins of the Bcl-2 family, which consists of both pro- and antiapoptotic factors.
- Cancer cells have developed mechanisms to avoid apoptosis.
- Multiple mutations are required for a tumor to develop in a patient, acquired over a number of years.
- Both RNA and DNA viruses can cause a normal cell to become transformed.
- Exploitation of DNA repair mechanisms may provide a novel means for regulating tumor cell growth.
- The diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 18.4.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is C. The ras oncogene has a point mutation in codon 12 (position 35 of the DNA chain) in which T replaces G. This changes the codon from one that specifies glycine to one that specifies valine. Thus, there is a single amino acid change in the protooncogene (a valine for a glycine) that changes ras to an oncogene.
2. The answer is C. Ras, when it is oncogenic, has lost its GTPase activity and thus remains active for a longer time. Answer A is incorrect because GAP proteins activate the GTPase activity of Ras and this mutation would make Ras less active. cAMP does not interact directly with Ras (thus, B is incorrect), and if Ras could no longer bind GTP, it would not be active (hence, D is also incorrect). Ras is not phosphorylated by the MAP kinase (thus, E is incorrect).
3. The answer is C. Cancers develop from mutations in normal cellular genes (the proto-oncogenes) that convert the genes to oncogenes. The oncogenes then alter cellular proliferation because they are not regulated in the same way as their corresponding proto-oncogene. Whereas a small number of tumors use recombination events to create a novel gene, this is not the usual mechanism for most tumors to develop. The proto-oncogenes need multiple mutations (4 to 7) for full transformation into oncogenes (clonal expansion of just a single mutation is usually not sufficient to form a tumor in vivo).
4. The answer is A. The p53 protein is a transcription factor that regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis. It has been named the "guardian of the genome" because it halts DNA replication in cells that have suffered DNA damage and, if the damage is too difficult to repair, targets such cells for apoptosis. Repaired cells are not targeted for apoptosis by p53. The p53 protein stimulates production of proteins that inhibit cyclin-CDK complexes, which prevents the phosphorylation of Rb and stops cells from further replicating their DNA.
5. The answer is B. Tumor-suppressor genes balance cell growth and quiescence. When they are not expressed (via loss-of-function mutations), the balance shifts to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (thus, A is incorrect). Answer C is incorrect because tumor-suppressor genes do not act on viral genes, answer D is incorrect
because tumor-suppressor genes are not specifically targeted to just one aspect of the cell cycle, and answer E is incorrect because a loss of expression of tumorsuppressor genes leads to tumor formation, not expression of these genes.
6. The answer is B. Growth factor deprivation can lead to apoptosis owing to the action of BH3-only domain members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The BH3only domain proteins dimerize with channel-forming proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane, allowing cytochrome c to leave the mitochondria and bind to Apaf, to form the apoptosome to initiate the apoptotic pathway. Growth factors, via activation of the Akt/ protein kinase B pathway, lead to the phosphorylation of the BH3-only domain proteins and inactivate them, such that apoptosis is blocked. Because the cell in question is always expressing active Akt, the cell will be in a constant antiapoptotic state. Increased expression of cytochrome c will not lead to apoptosis or cell growth; it will not affect cellular proliferation. Bcl-2 is an antiapoptotic factor, but it is not phosphorylated by the Akt pathway. Increased expression of Apaf might lead to apoptosis if cytochrome c were released; its increased expression would not lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Decreased expression of caspases would hinder apoptosis, but the Akt pathway does not alter the expression level of these proteases. Caspases are also not phosphorylated by Akt.
7. The answer is E. In order for a mutation in a DNA mismatch repair enzyme to be fully manifest, both alleles that code for this protein must be mutated; otherwise, $50 \%$ of the protein made would be functional, and that is often sufficient to allow for normal DNA repair. Mutating the corresponding normal allele would reduce the functional enzyme level to zero, and the lack of mismatch repair would eventually lead to mutations in genes involved in growth regulation, resulting in uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 involve DNA repair of double-strand breaks, not mismatches. A mutation in the PDGF receptor may lead to transformation as a dominant oncogene, but it does not affect mismatch repair. A mutation in a p53 gene would have no effect because $p 53$ is also a tumor

suppressor, and both copies of $p 53$ would need to be mutated for a tumor to develop. A mutation in $p 53$ would not, in combination with one mutation in a mismatch repair gene, lead to uncontrolled proliferation. A mutation in the ras gene, by itself, would lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation because ras is a dominant oncogene, but the mechanism would not be by inability to repair DNA mismatches.
8. The answer is C. If $m y c$, a proto-oncogene, is overexpressed, increased cell proliferation would result. One way $m y c$ could be overexpressed is if the miRNA regulating its expression were no longer expressed. In that case, $m y c$ mRNA levels would increase, and $m y c$ would be inappropriately expressed in the cell. For this to occur, the miRNA would have a loss of function, which is what defines a tumor-suppressor gene. The miRNA is downregulating, not upregulating, the expression of $m y c$. A gain of function (such as overexpression of the miRNA) would define an oncogene. The miRNA is not acting as a dominant-negative effector, which is when one mutated copy of a protein (or RNA) interferes with the functioning of a functional protein produced by a normal allele. Myc is a transcription factor and not an enzyme needed for DNA repair.
9. The answer is E. The girl has retinoblastoma, which is caused by a mutation in the $R b$ gene, which is a tumor suppressor. The normal Rb protein binds to the E2F family of transcription factors, and when it does, transcription is inhibited. Phosphorylation of the Rb
protein by cyclin-CDK complexes at the $\mathrm{G}_{1} / \mathrm{S}$ interface of the cell cycle inactivates Rb , it dissociates from E2F, and transcription is now initiated, allowing cells to enter the S phase of the cycle. Because the mutation is in a tumor-suppressor gene, a loss of function is leading to tumor growth. Loss of Rb function leads to constant E2F activity, and the cell is always stimulated to proliferate (the checks and balances at the $\mathrm{G}_{1} / \mathrm{S}$ boundary are lost). Loss of function of a cyclin, or a CDK, would stop cell growth (mutations in those genes would need to be gain-of-function mutations in order for a tumor to form). The CKIs are inhibitors, and loss of their function could lead to tumor growth, but such mutations would not be specific for retinoblastoma, as are mutations in the Rb protein.
10. The answer is D. Cadherins are membrane-bound glycoproteins involved in intracellular adhesion. Loss of function of a specific cadherin (E-cadherin) allows cell migration within the stomach, owing to the loss of intracellular adhesion. This allows tumor cells to leave their site of origin and move to other areas within the stomach (giving rise to the diffuse type of cancer found). p53 proteins and the Rb protein help regulate cell-cycle completion and cell reproduction, but these proteins do not regulate the ability of tumor cells to migrate. The protein produced by the $N F-1$ gene (neurofibromin) binds to Ras and activates its GTPase activity, thereby reducing the amount of time that Ras is in its active state. Caspases are cysteine proteases involved in the apoptotic response.

# Carbohydrate Metabolism, Fuel Oxidation, and the Generation of Adenosine Triphosphate 

Glucose is central to all of metabolism. It is the universal fuel for human cells and the source of carbon for the synthesis of most other compounds. Every human cell type uses glucose to obtain energy. The release of insulin and glucagon by the pancreas aids in the body's use and storage of glucose. Other dietary sugars (mainly fructose and galactose) are converted to glucose or to intermediates of glucose metabolism.

Glucose is the precursor for the synthesis of an array of other sugars that are required for the production of specialized compounds such as lactose, cell surface antigens, nucleotides, or glycosaminoglycans. Glucose is also the fundamental precursor of noncarbohydrate compounds; it can be converted to lipids (including fatty acids, cholesterol, and steroid hormones), amino acids, and nucleic acids. Only those compounds that are synthesized from vitamins, essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids cannot be synthesized from glucose in humans.

All physiologic processes in living cells require energy transformation. Cells convert the chemical bond energy in foods into other forms, such as an electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane, or the movement of muscle fibers in an arm, or assembly of complex molecules such as DNA. These energy transformations can be divided into three principal phases: (1) oxidation of fuels (fat, carbohydrate, and protein), (2) conversion of energy from fuel oxidation into the high-energy phosphate bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and (3) use of ATP phosphate bond energy to drive energy-requiring processes.

More than $40 \%$ of the calories in the typical diet in the United States are obtained from starch, sucrose, and lactose. These dietary carbohydrates are converted to glucose, galactose, and fructose in the digestive tract (Fig. IV.1). Monosaccharides are absorbed from the intestine, enter the blood, and travel to the tissues, where they are metabolized.

After glucose is transported into cells, it is phosphorylated by a hexokinase to form glucose 6-phosphate. Glucose 6-phosphate can then enter a number of metabolic pathways. The three that are common to all cell types are glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and glycogen synthesis (Fig. IV.2). In tissues, fructose and galactose are converted to intermediates of glucose metabolism. Thus, the fate of these sugars parallels that of glucose (Fig. IV.3).

The major fate of glucose 6-phosphate is oxidation via the pathway of glycolysis (see Chapter 22), which provides a source of ATP (the major energy currency of the cell) for all cell types. Cells that lack mitochondria cannot oxidize other fuels. They produce ATP from anaerobic glycolysis (the conversion of glucose to lactic acid). Cells that contain mitochondria oxidize glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ via glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Fig. IV.4). Some tissues, such as the brain, depend on the oxidation of glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ for energy because they have a limited capacity to use other fuels.
