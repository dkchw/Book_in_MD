# Fuel Metabolism 

In order to survive, humans must meet two basic metabolic requirements: We must be able to synthesize everything our cells need that is not supplied by our diet, and we must be able to protect our internal environment from toxins and changing conditions in our external environment. To meet these requirements, we metabolize our dietary components through four basic types of pathways: fuel oxidative pathways, fuel storage and mobilization pathways, biosynthetic pathways, and detoxification or waste disposal pathways. Cooperation between tissues and responses to changes in our external environment are communicated through transport pathways and intercellular signaling pathways (Fig. I.1).

The foods in our diet are the fuels that supply us with energy in the form of calories. This energy is used for carrying out such diverse functions as moving, thinking, and reproducing. Thus, several of our metabolic pathways are fuel oxidative pathways that convert fuels into energy that can be used for biosynthetic and mechanical work. But what is the source of energy when we are not eating, such as between meals, and while we sleep? How does a person on a hunger strike that you read about in the morning headlines survive so long? We have other metabolic pathways that are fuel storage pathways. The fuels that we store can be mobilized during periods when we are not eating or when we need increased energy for exercise.

Our diet also must contain the compounds we cannot synthesize, as well as all the basic building blocks for compounds we do synthesize in our biosynthetic pathways. For example, we have dietary requirements for some amino acids, but we can synthesize other amino acids from our fuels and a dietary nitrogen precursor. The compounds required in our diet for biosynthetic pathways include certain amino acids, vitamins, and essential fatty acids.

Detoxification pathways and waste disposal pathways are metabolic pathways devoted to removing toxins that can be present in our diets or in the air we breathe, introduced into our bodies as drugs, or generated internally from the metabolism of dietary components. Dietary components that have no value to the body, and must be disposed of, are called xenobiotics.

In general, biosynthetic pathways (including fuel storage) are referred to as anabolic pathways; that is, pathways that synthesize larger molecules from smaller components. The synthesis of proteins from amino acids is an example of an anabolic pathway. Catabolic pathways are those pathways that break down larger molecules into smaller components. Fuel oxidative pathways are examples of catabolic pathways.

In humans, the need for different cells to carry out different functions has resulted in cell and tissue specialization in metabolism. For example, our adipose tissue is a specialized site for the storage of fat and contains the metabolic pathways that allow it to carry out this function. However, adipose tissue is lacking many of the pathways that synthesize required compounds from dietary precursors. To enable our cells to cooperate in meeting our metabolic needs during changing conditions of diet, sleep, activity, and health, we need transport pathways into the blood and between tissues and intercellular signaling pathways. One means of communication is for hormones to carry signals to tissues about our dietary state. For example, a message that we have just had a meal, carried by the hormone insulin, signals adipose tissue to store fat.

FIGURE I.I An overview of the general metabolic routes for dietary components in the body. The types of pathways are named in red.

In the following section, we will provide an overview of various types of dietary components and examples of the pathways involved in using these components. We will describe the fuels in our diet, the compounds produced by their digestion, and the basic patterns of fuel metabolism in the tissues of our bodies. We will describe how these patterns change when we eat, when we fast for a short time, and when we starve for prolonged periods. Patients with medical problems that involve an inability to deal normally with fuels will be introduced. These patients will appear repeatedly throughout the book and will be joined by other patients as we delve deeper into biochemistry.

It is important to note that this section of the book contains an overview of basic metabolism, which allows patients to be presented at an elementary level and to whet students' appetites for the biochemistry to come. The goal is to enable the student to taste and preview what biochemistry is all about. It is not designed to be all-inclusive, as all of these topics will be discussed in greater detail in Sections IV through VII of the text. The next section of the text (Section II) begins with the basics of biochemistry and the relationship of basic chemistry to processes that occur in all living cells.

# Metabolic Fuels and Dietary Components 

Fuel Metabolism. We obtain our fuel primarily from the macronutrients (i.e., carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) in our diet. As we eat, our foodstuffs are digested and absorbed. The products of digestion circulate in the blood, enter various tissues, and are eventually taken up by cells and oxidized to produce energy. To completely convert our fuels to carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ and water $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, molecular oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ is required. We breathe to obtain this oxygen and to eliminate the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that is produced by the oxidation of our foodstuffs.

Fuel Stores. Any dietary fuel that exceeds the body's immediate energy needs is stored, mainly as triacylglycerol (fat) in adipose tissue, as glycogen (a carbohydrate) in muscle, liver, and other cells, and, to some extent, as protein in muscle. When we are fasting, between meals and overnight while we sleep, fuel is drawn from these stores and is oxidized to provide energy (Fig. I.I).

Fuel Requirements. We require enough energy each day to drive the basic functions of our bodies and to support our physical activity. If we do not consume enough food each day to supply that much energy, the body's fuel stores supply the remainder and we lose weight. Conversely, if we consume more food than required for the energy we expend, our body's fuel stores enlarge and we gain weight.

Other Dietary Requirements. In addition to providing energy, the diet provides precursors for the biosynthesis of compounds necessary for cellular and tissue structure, function, and survival. Among these precursors are the essential fatty acids and essential amino acids (those that the body needs but cannot synthesize). The diet must also supply vitamins, minerals, and water.

Waste Disposal. Dietary components that we can use are referred to as nutrients. However, both the diet and the air we breathe contain xenobiotic compounds, compounds that have no use or value in the human body and may be toxic. These compounds are excreted in the urine and feces together with metabolic waste products.

FIGURE I. 3 Generation of ATP from fuel components during respiration. Glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids are oxidized to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), a substrate for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In the TCA cycle, they are completely oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. As fuels are oxidized, electrons $\left(\mathrm{e}^{-}\right)$are transferred to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by the electron transport chain, and the energy is used to generate ATP.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Percy V. is a 59-year-old school teacher who was in good health until his wife died suddenly. Since that time, he has experienced an increasing degree of fatigue and has lost interest in many of the activities he previously enjoyed. Shortly after his wife's death, one of his married children moved far from home. Since then, Mr. V. has had little appetite for food. When a neighbor found Mr. V. sleeping in his clothes, unkempt, and somewhat confused, she called an ambulance. Mr. V. was admitted to the hospital psychiatry unit with a diagnosis of mental depression associated with dehydration and malnutrition.

$\square$Otto S. is a 25-year-old medical student who was very athletic during high school and college but is now out of shape. Since he started medical school, he has been gaining weight. He is 5 ft 10 in tall and began medical school weighing 154 lb , within his ideal weight range. By the time he finished his last examination in his first year, he weighed 187 lb . He has decided to consult a physician at the student health service before the problem gets worse, as he would like to reduce his weight (at 187 lb , his body mass index [BMI] is 27] to his previous level of 154 lb (which would reduce his BMI to 23 , in the middle of the healthy range of BMI values).

$\square$Ivan A. is a 56-year-old accountant who has been obese for a number of years. He exhibits a pattern of central obesity, called an "apple shape," which is caused by excess adipose tissue being disproportionally deposited in the abdominal area. His major recreational activities are watching TV while drinking scotch and soda and doing occasional gardening. At a company picnic, he became very "winded" while playing softball and decided it was time for a general physical examination. At the examination, he weighed 264 lb at 5 ft 10 in tall. His blood pressure was elevated, 155 mm Hg systolic and 95 mm Hg diastolic (for Ivan's age, hypertension is defined as $>140$ mm Hg systolic and $>90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ diastolic). For a male of these proportions, a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 would correspond to a weight between 129 and 173 lb . Mr. A. is almost 100 lb overweight, and his BMI of 37.9 is in the range defined as obesity.

$\square$Ann R. is a 23-year-old buyer for a woman's clothing store. Despite the fact that she is 5 ft 7 in tall and weighs 99 lb , she is convinced she is overweight. Two months ago, she started a daily physical activity program that consists of 1 hour of jogging every morning and 1 hour of walking every evening. She also decided to consult a physician about weight loss. If patients are above (like Ivan A.) or below (like Ann R.) their ideal weight, the physician, often in consultation with a registered dietitian, prescribes a diet designed to bring the weight into the ideal range.

## I. Dietary Fuels

The major fuels we obtain from our diet are the macronutrients-namely, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. When these fuels are oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in our cells (the process of catabolism), energy is released by the transfer of electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. The energy from this oxidation process generates heat and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (Fig. 1.2). $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ travels in the blood to the lungs where it is expired, and water is excreted in urine, sweat, and other secretions. Although the heat that is generated by fuel oxidation is used to maintain body temperature, the main purpose of fuel oxidation is to generate ATP. ATP provides the energy that drives most of the energy-consuming processes in the cell, including biosynthetic reactions (anabolic pathways), muscle contraction, and active transport across membranes. As these processes use energy, ATP is converted back to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$. The generation and use of ATP is referred to as the ATP$A D P$ cycle.

The oxidation of fuels to generate ATP is called respiration (Fig. 1.3). Prior to oxidation, carbohydrates are converted principally to glucose, fat to fatty acids,

![ma052581432b](ma052581432b.jpg)

FIGURE I. 4 Structure of starch and glycogen. Starch, our major dietary carbohydrate, and glycogen, the body's storage form of glucose, have similar structures. They are polysaccharides (many sugar units) composed of glucose, which is a monosaccharide (one sugar unit).
and protein to amino acids. The pathways for oxidizing glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids have many features in common. They first oxidize the fuels to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), a precursor of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The TCA cycle is a series of reactions that completes the oxidation of fuels to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (see Chapter 23). Electrons lost from the fuels during oxidative reactions are transferred to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by a series of proteins in the electron transport chain (see Chapter 24). The energy of electron transfer is used to convert ADP and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ to ATP by a process known as oxidative phosphorylation.

In discussions of metabolism and nutrition, energy is often expressed in units of calories. A calorie in this context (nutritional calorie) is equivalent to 1 kilocalorie (kcal) in energy terms. "Calorie" was originally spelled with a capital C, but the capitalization was dropped as the term became popular. Thus, a 1-cal soft drink actually has 1 kcal of energy. Energy is also expressed in joules. One kilocalorie equals 4.18 kilojoules ( kJ ). Physicians tend to use units of calories, in part because that is what their patients use and understand. One kilocalorie of energy is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 L of water by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

# A. Carbohydrates 

The major carbohydrates in the human diet are starch, sucrose, lactose, fructose, maltose, galactose, and glucose. The polysaccharide starch is the storage form of carbohydrates in plants. Sucrose (table sugar), maltose, and lactose (milk sugar) are disaccharides, and fructose, galactose, and glucose are monosaccharides. Digestion converts the larger carbohydrates to monosaccharides, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Glucose, a monosaccharide, is the predominant sugar in human blood (Fig. 1.4).

Oxidation of carbohydrates to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in the body produces approximately $4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ (Table 1.1). In other words, every gram of carbohydrate we eat yields approximately 4 kcal of energy. Note that carbohydrate molecules contain a significant amount of oxygen and are already partially oxidized before they enter our bodies (see Fig. 1.4).

TABLE I.I Caloric Content of Fuels

|  | $\mathbf{k c a l} / \mathbf{g}$ |
| :-- | :--: |
| Carbohydrate | 4 |
| Fat | 9 |
| Protein | 4 |
| Alcohol | 7 |

![ma062581432b](ma062581432b.jpg)

FIGURE I. 5 General structure of proteins and amino acids. Each amino acid in this figure is indicated by a different color. $R=$ side chain. Different amino acids have different side chains. For example, $R_{1}$ might be $-\mathrm{CH}_{3} ; \mathrm{R}_{3},-\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{OH} ; \mathrm{R}_{3},-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{COO}^{-}$. In a protein, the amino acids are linked by peptide bonds.

# B. Proteins 

Proteins are composed of amino acids that are joined to form linear chains (Fig. 1.5). In addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, proteins contain approximately $16 \%$ nitrogen by weight. The digestive process breaks down proteins to their constituent amino acids, which enter the blood. The complete oxidation of proteins to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$in the body yields approximately $4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ (see Table 1.1).

## C. Fats

Fats are lipids composed of triacylglycerols (also called triglycerides). A triacylglycerol molecule contains three fatty acids esterified to one glycerol moiety (Fig. 1.6).

Fats contain much less oxygen than is contained in carbohydrates or proteins. Therefore, fats are more reduced and yield more energy when oxidized. The complete oxidation of triacylglycerols to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in the body releases approximately $9 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$, more than twice the energy yield from an equivalent amount of carbohydrate or protein (see Table 1.1).
![ma072581432b](ma072581432b.jpg)

FIGURE I. 6 Structure of a triacylglycerol. Palmitate and stearate are saturated fatty acids (i.e., they have no double bonds in the carbon chain). Oleate is monounsaturated (one double bond). Polyunsaturated fatty acids have more than one double bond.

## D. Alcohol

Alcohol (ethanol, in the context of the diet) has considerable caloric content. Ethanol $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{OH}\right)$ is oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in the body and yields approximately $7 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$; that is, more than carbohydrate or protein but less than fat.

## II. Body Fuel Stores

Humans carry supplies of fuel within their bodies (Table 1.2), which are similar to the fuel supplies in the plants and animals we eat. These fuel stores are light in weight, large in quantity, and readily converted into oxidizable substances. Most of us are familiar with fat, our major fuel store, which is located in adipose tissue. Although fat is distributed throughout our bodies, it tends to increase in quantity in our hips, thighs, and abdomens as we advance into middle age. In addition to our fat stores, we also have important, although much smaller, stores of carbohydrate in the form of glycogen located primarily in our liver and muscles. Glycogen consists of glucose molecules joined together to form a large, branched polysaccharide (see Fig. 1.4). Body protein, particularly the protein of our large muscle masses, also serves to some extent as a fuel store, and we draw on it for energy when we fast.

## A. Fat

Our major fuel store is adipose triacylglycerol (triglyceride), a lipid more commonly known as fat. The average $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man has approximately 15 kg of stored triacylglycerol, which accounts for approximately $85 \%$ of his total stored calories (see Table 1.2).

Two characteristics make adipose triacylglycerol a very efficient fuel store: the fact that triacylglycerol contains more calories per gram than carbohydrate or protein ( $9 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ vs. $4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ ) and the fact that adipose tissue does not contain much water. Adipose tissue contains only about $15 \%$ water, compared to tissues such as muscle that contain about $80 \%$. Thus, the $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man with 15 kg of stored triacylglycerol has only about 18 kg of adipose tissue.

## B. Glycogen

Our stores of glycogen in liver, muscle, and other cells are relatively small in quantity but are nevertheless important. Liver glycogen is used to maintain blood glucose levels between meals, which is necessary for optimal functioning of the nervous system. Thus, the size of this glycogen store fluctuates during the day; an average $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man might have 200 g or more of liver glycogen after a meal but only 80 g after an overnight fast. Muscle glycogen supplies energy for muscle contraction during exercise. At rest, the $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man has approximately 150 g of muscle glycogen. Almost all cells, including neurons, maintain a small emergency supply of glucose as glycogen.

TABLE 1.2 Fuel Composition of the Average 70-kg Man after an Overnight Fast

| FUEL | AMOUNT (kg) | PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL STORED CALORIES |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Glycogen |  |  |
| Muscle | 0.15 | 0.4 |
| Liver | 0.08 | 0.2 |
| Protein | 6.0 | 14.4 |
| Triglyceride | 15 | 85 |

[^0]Miss R. consumed
$100 \times 4=400$ calories as carbohydrate
$20 \times 4=80$ calories as protein
$15 \times 9=135$ calories as fat
for a total of 615 calories/day.

3Ivan A. ate 585 g of carbohydrate, 150 g of protein, and 95 g of fat each day. In addition, he drank 45 g of alcohol daily. How many calories did he consume per day?


[^0]:    ${ }^{a}$ In biochemistry and nutrition, the standard reference is often the $70-\mathrm{kg}$ ( 154 lb ) man. This standard was probably chosen because in the first half of the 20th century, when many nutritional studies were performed, young healthy medical and graduate students (who were mostly men) volunteered to serve as subjects for these experiments.

Mr.A. consumed
$585 \times 4=2,340$ calories as carbohydrate
$150 \times 4=600$ calories as protein
$95 \times 9=855$ calories as fat
$45 \times 7=315$ calories as alcohol
for a total of 4,110 calories/day.

It is not practical to store all of the energy in triacylglycerol as glycogen because glycogen is a polar molecule with hydroxyl groups and binds approximately 4 times its weight as water. Storage of energy as triacylglycerol contains much less water weight.

## C. Protein

Protein serves many important roles in the body; unlike fat and glycogen, it is not solely a fuel store like fat or glycogen. Muscle protein is essential for body movement. Other proteins serve as enzymes (catalysts of biochemical reactions) or as structural components of cells and tissues. Only a limited amount of body protein can be degraded, approximately 6 kg in the average $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man, before our body functions are compromised.

## III. Daily Energy Expenditure

If we want to stay in energy balance, neither gaining nor losing weight, we must, on average, consume an amount of food equal to our daily energy expenditure. The daily energy expenditure (DEE) includes the energy to support our basal metabolism (basal metabolic rate [BMR] or resting metabolic rate [RMR]) and our physical activity, plus the energy required to process the food we eat (diet-induced thermogenesis [DIT]). Thus, the DEE, in kilocalories per day, $=$ BMR (or RMR) + the energy needed for physical activity + DIT.

## A. Basal Metabolic Rate

Two terms have been used to define the energy required by the body, the BMR and the RMR. The BMR is a measure of the energy required to maintain life: the functioning of the lungs, kidneys, and brain; the pumping of the heart; the maintenance of ionic gradients across membranes; the reactions of biochemical pathways; and so forth. The BMR was originally defined as the energy expenditure of a person mentally and bodily at rest in a thermoneutral environment 12 to 18 hours after a meal. However, when a person is awakened and their heat production or oxygen consumption is measured, they are no longer sleeping or totally at mental rest, and their metabolic rate is called the resting metabolic rate (RMR). It is also sometimes called the resting energy expenditure (REE). The RMR and BMR differ very little in value, and for the purposes of this text, we will focus on the BMR.

The BMR, which is usually expressed in kilocalories per day, is affected by body size, age, sex, and other factors (Table 1.3). It is proportional to the amount of metabolically active tissue (including the major organs) and to the lean (or fat-free) body mass. Obviously, the amount of energy required for basal functions in a large person is greater than the amount required in a small person. However, the BMR is usually lower for women than for men of the same weight because women usually have more metabolically inactive adipose tissue. Body temperature also affects the BMR, which increases by $12 \%$ with each degree centigrade ( $7 \%$ with each degree

TABLE 1.3 Factors Affecting BMR Expressed per Kilogram of Body Weight
Gender (males higher than females)
Body temperature (increased with fever)
Environmental temperature (increased in cold)
Thyroid status (increased in hyperthyroidism)
Pregnancy and lactation (increased)
Age (decreased with age)
Body composition (increased with muscle mass)

Fahrenheit) increase in body temperature (i.e., "feed a fever; starve a cold"). The ambient temperature affects the BMR, which increases slightly in colder climates as thermogenesis is activated. Excessive secretion of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) causes the BMR to increase, whereas diminished secretion (hypothyroidism) causes it to decrease. The BMR increases during pregnancy and lactation. Growing children have a higher BMR per kilogram body weight than adults because a greater proportion of their bodies is composed of brain, muscle, and other more metabolically active tissues. The BMR declines in aging individuals because their metabolically active tissue is shrinking and body fat is increasing. In addition, large variations exist in BMR from one adult to another, determined by genetic factors.

A rough estimate of the BMR may be obtained by assuming it is either 24 or $21.6 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day $/ \mathrm{kg}$ body weight (for men or for women, respectively) and multiplying by the body weight. An easy way to remember this is $1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$ for men and $0.9 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$ for women. This estimate works best for young individuals who are near their healthy weight. More accurate methods for calculating the BMR use empirically derived equations for different gender and age groups (Table 1.4). Even these calculations do not take into account variation among individuals.

## B. Physical Activity

In addition to the BMR, the energy required for physical activity contributes to the DEE. The difference in physical activity between a student and a lumberjack is enormous, and a student who is relatively sedentary during the week may be much more active during the weekend. Table 1.5 gives factors for calculating the approximate energy expenditures associated with typical activities.

| TABLE 1.5 Typical Activities with Corresponding Hourly Activity Factors* |  |
| :--: | :--: |
| ACTIVITY CATEGORY | HOURLY ACTIVITY FACTOR (FOR TIME INACTIVITY) |
| Resting: sleeping, reclining | 1.0 |
| Very light: seated and standing activities, driving, laboratory work, typing, sewing, ironing, cooking, playing cards, playing a musical instrument | 1.5 |
| Light: walking on a level surface at 2.5-3 mph, garage work, electrical trades, carpentry, restaurant trades, house cleaning, golf, sailing, table tennis | 2.5 |
| Moderate: walking 3.5-4 mph, weeding and hoeing, carrying loads, cycling, skiing, tennis, dancing | 5.0 |
| Heavy: walking uphill with a load, tree felling, heavy manual digging, mountain climbing, basketball, football, soccer | 7.0 |

mph, miles per hour.
*The hourly activity factor is multiplied by the BMR per hour times the number of hours engaged in the activity to give the caloric expenditure for that activity. If this is done for all of the hours in a day, the sum over 24 hours will approximately equal the daily energy expenditure.

0What are Ivan A.'s and Ann R.'s BMR? (Compare the method for a rough estimate to values obtained with equations in Table 1.4.)

$\mathbf{M}$Registered dietitians often use extensive tables for calculating energy requirements, which are based on height, weight, age, gender, and activity level. A more accurate calculation is based on the fat-free mass (FFM), which is equal to the total body mass minus the mass of the person's adipose tissue. With FFM, the BMR is calculated using the equation $\mathrm{BMR}=186+$ FFM $\times$ $23.6 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day. This formula eliminates differences between sexes and between elderly versus young individuals that are attributable to differences in relative adiposity. However, determining FFM is relatively cumbersome-one technique requires weighing the patient underwater and measuring the residual lung volume. More recently, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is an equally accurate, but simpler, technique that is used to determine the patient's total amount of fat and FFM.

Indirect calorimetry, a technique that measures $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production, can be used when more accurate determinations of energy need are required for hospitalized patients. A portable indirect calorimeter is used to measure oxygen consumption and the respiratory quotient ( $R Q$ ), which is the ratio of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumed to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced. The $R Q$ is 1.00 for individuals oxidizing carbohydrates, 0.83 for protein, and 0.71 for fat. From these values, the DEE can be determined.

A simplified method to measure the DEE also uses indirect calorimetry but only measures $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ production. Because the oxidation of nutrients requires molecular oxygen, through the measurement of the volume of total inspired and expired air, and the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in that air, a very good estimate of the BMR can be determined. The device required for this method is less cumbersome than the device that measures both oxygen and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ consumption and is easier to use, but it is less accurate.

Mr. A. weighs 264 lb or 120 kg ( 264 lb divided by $2.2 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{kg}$ ). His estimated BMR $=24$ calories $/ \mathrm{kg} /$ day $\times 120=$ 2,880 calories/day. His BMR calculated from Table I. 4 is only 1,992 calories ( $10 \times$ weight $+6.25 \times$ height $-5 \times$ age +5 , where the weight is in kilograms, the height in centimeters, and the age in years). Ms. R. weighs 99 b or 45 kg ( 99 divided by $2.2 \mathrm{lb} /$ kg ). Her estimated BMR $=(21.6$ calories $/ \mathrm{kg} /$ day $) \times$ $(45 \mathrm{~kg})=972$ calories/day. Her BMR from Table I. 4 is above this value ( $10 \times$ weight $+6.25 \times$ height $-5 \times$ age $-161=1,238$ calories/day). Thus, for Ms. R. the rough estimate is $78 \%$ of the more accurate calculation. For Mr. A. his caloric needs are only $70 \%$ that of the rough estimate because a disproportionately larger proportion of his body weight (his adipose tissue) is relatively inactive metabolically.

2
Based on the activities listed in Table I.5, the average US citizen is rather sedentary. Sedentary habits correlate strongly with risk for cardiovascular disease, so it is not surprising that cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in this country.

What are reasonable estimates for Ivan A.'s and Ann R.'s DEE?

Are Ivan A. and Ann R. in a healthy weight range?

A rough estimate of the energy required per day for physical activity can be made by using a value of $30 \%$ of the BMR (per day) for a very sedentary person (such as a medical student who does little but study) and a value of $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ of the BMR (per day) for a person who engages in about 2 hours of moderate physical activity per day (see Table 1.5). A value of $100 \%$ or more of the BMR is used for a person who does several hours of vigorous physical activity per day.

## C. Diet-Induced Thermogenesis

Our DEE includes a component related to the intake of food known as dietinduced thermogenesis or the thermic effect of food (TEF). DIT was formerly called the specific dynamic action (SDA). After the ingestion of food, our metabolic rate increases because energy is required to digest, absorb, distribute, and store nutrients.

The energy required to process the types and quantities of food in the typical American diet is probably equal to approximately $10 \%$ of the kilocalories ingested. This amount is roughly equivalent to the error involved in rounding off the caloric content of carbohydrate, fat, and protein to 4,9 , and 4 , respectively. Therefore, DIT is often ignored and calculations are based simply on the BMR and the energy required for physical activity.

## D. Calculations of Daily Energy Expenditure

The total DEE is usually calculated as the sum of the BMR (in kilocalories per day) plus the energy required for the amount of time spent in each of the various types of physical activity (see Table 1.5). An approximate value for the DEE can be determined from the BMR and the appropriate percentage of the BMR required for physical activity (given earlier). For example, a very sedentary medical student would have a DEE equal to the RMR plus $30 \%$ of the BMR (or $1.3 \times$ BMR), and an active person's daily expenditure could be two times the BMR.

## E. Healthy Body Weight

Ideally, we should strive to maintain a weight consistent with good health. The BMI, calculated as weight divided by height ${ }^{2}\left(\mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}\right)$, is currently the preferred method for determining whether a person's weight is in the healthy range. This formula, in the English system, is (weight [in pounds] $\times 704$ )/height ${ }^{2}$ (with height in inches).

In general, adults with BMI values $<18.5$ are considered underweight. Those with BMIs between 18.5 and 24.9 are considered to be in the healthy weight range, between 25 and 29.9 are in the overweight or preobese range, and 30 and above are in the obese range. Class I obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 to 34.9 , class II as a BMI of 35 to 39.9 , and class III (or extreme obesity) as a BMI of 40 or greater. Degrees of protein-calorie malnutrition (marasmus) are classified according to the BMI. A BMI of 17.0 to 18.4 is degree I; values of 16.0 to 16.9 is degree II; and any value less than 16.0 is degree III, the most severe form of protein-energy malnutrition.

## F. Weight Gain and Loss

To maintain our body weight, we must stay in caloric balance. We are in caloric balance if the calories in the food we eat equal our DEE. If we eat less food than we require for our DEE, our body fuel stores supply the additional calories and we lose weight. Conversely, if we eat more food than we require for our energy needs, the excess fuel is stored (mainly in our adipose tissue) and we gain weight.

When we draw on our adipose tissue to meet our energy needs, we lose approximately 1 lb whenever we expend approximately 3,500 calories more than we consume. In other words, if we eat 1,000 calories less than we expend per day, we will lose about $2 \mathrm{lb} /$ week. Because the average individual's food intake is only about

2,000 to 3,000 calories/day, eating one-third to one-half the normal amount will cause a person to lose weight rather slowly. Fad diets that promise a loss of weight much more rapid than this have no scientific merit. In fact, the rapid initial weight loss the fad dieter typically experiences is attributable largely to loss of body water. This loss of water occurs in part because muscle tissue protein and liver glycogen are degraded rapidly to supply energy during the early phase of the diet. When muscle tissue (which is approximately $80 \%$ water) and glycogen (approximately $70 \%$ water) are broken down, this water is excreted from the body.

## IV. Dietary Requirements

In addition to supplying us with fuel and with general purpose building blocks for biosynthesis, our diet also provides us with specific nutrients that we need to remain healthy. We must have a regular supply of vitamins and minerals and of the essential fatty acids and essential amino acids. Essential means that they are essential in the diet; the body cannot synthesize these compounds from other molecules and therefore must obtain them from the diet. Nutrients that the body requires in the diet only under certain conditions are called conditionally essential.

The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and the Adequate Intake (AI) provide quantitative estimates of nutrient requirements. The RDA for a nutrient is the average daily dietary intake level necessary to meet the requirement of nearly all ( $97 \%$ to $98 \%$ ) healthy individuals in a particular gender and life stage group. Life stage group is a certain age range or physiologic status (i.e., pregnancy or lactation). The RDA is intended to serve as a goal for intake by individuals. The AI is a recommended intake value that is used when not enough data are available to establish an RDA.

## A. Carbohydrates

The RDA for carbohydrate is $130 \mathrm{~g} /$ day for children and adults and is based on the amount of carbohydrate needed to provide the brain with an adequate supply of glucose. Another value, the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) is the recommended range of intake for a macronutrient that is associated with a reduced risk of disease while providing adequate intake of essential nutrients. The AMDR is expressed as a percentage of caloric intake. For example, according to its AMDR, carbohydrate should provide $45 \%$ to $65 \%$ of total calories.

Carbohydrates can be synthesized from amino acids, and we can convert one type of carbohydrate to another. However, health problems are associated with the complete elimination of carbohydrate from the diet, partly because a low-carbohydrate diet must contain higher amounts of fat to provide us with the energy we need. High-fat diets are associated with obesity, atherosclerosis, and other health problems.

## B. Essential Fatty Acids

The recommended range (AMDR) for dietary fat is $20 \%$ to $35 \%$ of total calories. Although most lipids required for cell structure, fuel storage, or hormone synthesis can be synthesized from carbohydrates or proteins, we need a minimal level of certain dietary lipids for optimal health. These lipids, known as essential fatty acids, are required in our diet because we cannot synthesize fatty acids with these particular arrangements of double bonds. The essential fatty acids $\alpha$-linoleic and $\alpha$-linolenic acid are supplied by dietary plant oils, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are supplied in fish oils. They are the precursors of the eicosanoids (a set of hormone-like molecules that are secreted by cells in small quantities and have numerous important effects on neighboring cells). The eicosanoids include the prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and other related compounds.

Mr. A.'s BMR is 1,992 calories/day. He is sedentary, so he only requires approximately $30 \%$ more calories for his physical activity. Therefore, his daily expenditure is approximately $1,992+(0.3 \times 1,992)$ or $1.3 \times 1,992$ or $2,590 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day. Ms. R.'s BMR is 1,238 calories/day. She performs 2 hours of moderate physical activity per day (jogging and walking), so she requires approximately $65 \%$ more calories for her physical activity. Therefore, her daily expenditure is approximately $1,238+(0.65 \times 1,238)$ or $1.65 \times 1,238$ or 2,043 calories/day.

4Ivan A.'s weight is classified as obese. His BMI is $(3.64 \mathrm{lb} \times 704) /(70 \mathrm{in})^{2}=$ 37.9. Ann R. is underweight. Her BMI is $(99 \mathrm{lb} \times 704) /(67 \mathrm{in})^{2}=15.5$.

To evaluate a patient's weight, physicians need standards of obesity applicable in a genetically heterogeneous population. Life insurance industry statistics have been used to develop tables, such as the Metropolitan Height and Weight Tables, giving the weight ranges, based on gender, height, and body frame size, that are associated with the greatest longevity. However, these tables are considered inadequate for a number of reasons (e.g., they reflect data from upper-middleclass white groups). The BMI is the classification that is currently used clinically. It is based on two simple measurements, height without shoes and weight with minimal clothing.
![ma082581432b](ma082581432b.jpg)

Patients can be shown their BMI in a nomogram and need not use calculations. The healthy weight range coincides with the mortality data derived from life insurance tables. The BMI also shows a good correlation with independent measures of body fat. The major weakness of the use of the BMI is that some very muscular individuals may be classified as obese when they are not. There are also some differences in BMI and risk of certain diseases that vary by race or ethnicity. Other measurements to estimate body fat and other body compartments, such as weighing individuals underwater, are more difficult, expensive, and time-consuming and have generally been confined to research purposes.

If patients are above or below the healthy BMI range (such as Ivan A. or Ann $\mathbf{R}_{\mathbf{1}}$ ), the physician, often in consultation with a registered dietitian, prescribes a diet designed to bring the weight into the healthy range.

Are Ivan A. and Ann R. gaining or losing weight?

## C. Protein

The RDA for protein is approximately 0.8 g of high-quality protein per kilogram of healthy body weight, or approximately $56 \mathrm{~g} /$ day for a $154-\mathrm{lb}$ man and $46 \mathrm{~g} /$ day for a 126-lb woman. "High-quality" protein contains all of the essential amino acids in adequate amounts for health. Proteins derived from animal sources (milk, egg, and meat products) and soy are high quality. Most proteins in plant foods are of lower quality, which means they are low in one or more of the essential amino acids. Vegans may obtain adequate amounts of the essential amino acids by eating mixtures of plant-based proteins that complement each other in terms of their amino acid composition. According to its recommended AMDR, protein should contribute $10 \%$ to $35 \%$ of total caloric intake.

## I. Essential Amino Acids

Different amino acids are used in the body as precursors for the synthesis of proteins and other nitrogen-containing compounds. Of the 20 amino acids commonly required in the body for synthesis of protein and other compounds, 9 amino acids are essential in the diet of an adult human because they cannot be synthesized in the body. These are lysine, isoleucine, leucine, threonine, valine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, methionine, and histidine.

Certain amino acids are conditionally essential-that is, required in the diet only under certain conditions. Children and pregnant women have a high rate of protein synthesis to support growth and require some arginine in the diet, although it can be synthesized in the body. Histidine is essential in the adult diet in very small quantities because adults efficiently recycle histidine. The increased requirement of children and pregnant women for histidine is therefore much larger than their increased requirement of other essential amino acids. Tyrosine and cysteine are examples of conditionally essential amino acids. Tyrosine is synthesized from phenylalanine, and it is required in the diet if phenylalanine intake is inadequate or if an individual is congenitally deficient in an enzyme required to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine (the congenital disease phenylketonuria). Cysteine is synthesized by using sulfur from methionine, and it also may be required in the diet under conditions of low methionine intake or malabsorption disorders.

## 2. Nitrogen Balance

The proteins in the body undergo constant turnover; that is, they are constantly being degraded to amino acids and resynthesized. When a protein is degraded, its amino acids are released into the pool of free amino acids in the body. The amino acids from dietary proteins also enter this pool. Free amino acids can have one of three fates: They are used to make proteins, they serve as precursors for synthesis of essential nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g., heme, DNA, RNA), or they are oxidized as fuel to yield energy. When amino acids are oxidized, their nitrogen atoms are excreted in the urine, principally in the form of urea. The urine also contains smaller amounts of other nitrogenous excretory products (uric acid, creatinine, and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$) derived from the degradation of amino acids and compounds synthesized from amino acids. Some nitrogen is also lost in sweat, feces, and cells that slough off.

Nitrogen balance is the difference between the amount of nitrogen taken into the body each day (mainly in the form of dietary protein) and the amount of nitrogen in compounds lost (Table 1.6). If more nitrogen is ingested than excreted, a person

TABLE 1.6 Nitrogen Balance

| Positive nitrogen balance | Growth (e.g., childhood, pregnancy) | Dietary N > Excreted N |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Nitrogen balance | Normal healthy adult | Dietary N $=$ Excreted N |
| Negative nitrogen balance | Dietary deficiency of total protein or <br> amino acids: catabolic stress | Dietary N $<$ Excreted N |

N refers to nitrogen.

is said to be in positive nitrogen balance. Positive nitrogen balance occurs in growing individuals (e.g., children, adolescents, pregnant women), who are synthesizing more protein than they are breaking down. On the other hand, if less nitrogen is ingested than excreted, a person is said to be in negative nitrogen balance. A negative nitrogen balance develops in a person who is eating either too little protein or protein that is deficient in one or more of the essential amino acids. Amino acids are continuously being mobilized from body proteins. If the diet is lacking an essential amino acid or if the intake of protein is too low, new protein cannot be synthesized and the unused amino acids will be degraded, with the nitrogen appearing in the urine. If a negative nitrogen balance persists for too long, bodily function will be impaired by the net loss of critical proteins. In contrast, healthy adults are in nitrogen balance (neither positive nor negative), and the amount of nitrogen consumed in the diet equals its loss in urine, sweat, feces, and other excretions.

## D. Vitamins

Vitamins are a diverse group of organic molecules required in very small quantities in the diet for health, growth, and survival (Latin vita, life). The absence of a vitamin from the diet or an inadequate intake results in characteristic deficiency signs and, ultimately, death. Table 1.7 lists the signs or symptoms of deficiency for each vitamin, its RDA or AI for young adults, and common food sources. The amount of each vitamin required in the diet is small (in the microgram or milligram range), compared with essential amino acid requirements (in the gram range). The vitamins of ten are divided into two classes, water-soluble vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins. This classification has little relationship to their function but is related to the absorption and transport of fat-soluble vitamins with lipids.

Most vitamins are used for the synthesis of coenzymes, complex organic molecules that assist enzymes in catalyzing biochemical reactions, and the deficiency symptoms reflect an inability of cells to carry out certain reactions. However, some vitamins also act as hormones. We will consider the roles played by individual vitamins as we progress through the subsequent chapters of this text.

Although the RDA or AI for each vitamin varies with age and sex, the difference is usually not very large once adolescence is reached. For example, the RDA for riboflavin is $0.9 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for males between 9 and 13 years of age, $1.3 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for males 19 to 30 years of age, still $1.3 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for males older than 70 years, and $1.1 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for females 19 to 30 years. The largest requirements occur during lactation ( $1.6 \mathrm{mg} /$ day).

Vitamins, by definition, cannot be synthesized in the body or are synthesized from a very specific dietary precursor in insufficient amounts. For example, we can synthesize the vitamin niacin from the essential amino acid tryptophan, but not in sufficient quantities to meet our needs. Niacin is therefore still classified as a vitamin.

Excessive intake of many vitamins, both fat-soluble and water-soluble, may cause deleterious effects. For example, high doses of vitamin A, a fat-soluble vitamin, can cause desquamation of the skin and birth defects. High doses of vitamin C cause diarrhea and gastrointestinal disturbances. One of the sets of values of the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) is the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL), which is the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects to almost all individuals in the general population. As intake increases above the UL, the risk of adverse effects increases. Table 1.7 includes the UL for vitamins known to pose a risk at high levels. Intake above the UL occurs most of ten with dietary or pharmacologic supplements of single vitamins and not from foods.

## E. Minerals

Many minerals are required in the diet. They are generally divided into macro or major minerals and micro or trace minerals. Electrolytes (inorganic ions that are

Mr.A. expends about 2,590 calories/day and consumes 4,110 calories/day. By this calculation, he consumes 1,520 kcal more than he expends each day and is gaining weight. Ms. R. expends 2,043 calories/day while she consumes only 615 calories/day. Therefore, she expends 1,428 calories more than she consumes each day, so she is losing weight.

(1)Malnutrition, which is deficient or excess intake of energy or nutrients, occurs in the United States principally among children of families with incomes below the poverty level, the elderly, individuals whose diet is influenced by alcohol and drug use, and those who make poor food choices. More than 13 million children in the United States live in families with incomes below the poverty level. Of these, approximately $10 \%$ have clinical malnutrition, most often anemia resulting from inadequate iron intake. A larger percentage have mild protein and energy malnutrition and exhibit growth retardation, sometimes as a result of parental neglect. Childhood malnutrition also may lead to learning failure and chronic illness later in life. A weight-for-height measurement is one of the best indicators of childhood malnourishment because it is easy to measure, and weight is one of the first parameters to change during malnutrition.

The term kwashiorkor refers to a disease originally seen in African children suffering from a protein deficiency (although overall energy intake may be normal). It is characterized by marked hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin in the blood), anemia, edema (buildup of fluids in the interstitial spaces), pot belly, loss of hair, and other signs of tissue injury. The term marasmus is used for prolonged protein and energy malnutrition, particularly in young children. Marasmus is characterized by loss of weight and body fat, muscle wasting, and poor growth. Children with marasmus usually do not develop edema. The term protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) can be used to describe both disorders. The term severe acute malnutrition (SAM) includes inadequate intake of vitamins and minerals, as well as energy and protein.

Multiple vitamin deficiencies accompanying malnutrition are far more common in the United States than the characteristic deficiency diseases associated with diets lacking just one vitamin because we generally eat a variety of foods. The characteristic deficiency diseases arising from single vitamin deficiencies often were identified and described in humans through observations of populations consuming a restricted diet because that was all that was available. For example, thiamin deficiency was discovered by a physician in Java who related the symptoms of beriberi to diets composed principally of polished rice. Today, single vitamin deficiencies usually occur as a result of conditions that interfere with the uptake or use of a vitamin or as a result of poor food choices or a lack of variety in the diet. For example, peripheral neuropathy associated with vitamin E deficiency can occur in children with fat malabsorption, and alcohol consumption can result in beriberi.Vegans, individuals who consume diets lacking all animal products, can develop deficiencies in vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$.

In the hospital, it was learned that Mr. Percy V. had lost 32 b in the 8 months since his last visit to his family physician. On admission, his hemoglobin (the ironcontaining compound in the blood, which carries $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the lungs to the tissues) was $10.7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range, males $=12$ to $15.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), his serum ferritin was $4 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ (reference range, males $=40$ to $200 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ ), and other hematologic indices that reflect nutritional status were also abnormal. These values are indicative of an iron deficiency anemia. His serum folic acid level was $0.9 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ (reference range $=3$ to $20 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ ), indicating a low intake of this vitamin. His vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ level was $190 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ (reference range $=180$ to $914 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ ). A low blood vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ level can be caused by decreased intake, absorption, or transport, but it takes a long time to develop. His serum albumin was $32 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range $=35$ to $5.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), which is an indicator of protein malnutrition or liver disease.

dissolved in the fluid compartments of the body) are macrominerals. Macrominerals are required in relatively large quantities, whereas microminerals are required in much lower amounts (Table 1.8).

Sodium $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$, potassium $\left(\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)$, and chloride $\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$are the major electrolytes (ions) in the body. They establish ion gradients across membranes, maintain water balance, and neutralize positive and negative charges on proteins and other molecules.

Calcium and phosphorus serve as structural components of bones and teeth and are thus required in relatively large quantities. Calcium $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right)$ plays many other roles in the body; for example, it is involved in hormone action and blood clotting. Phosphorus is required for the formation of ATP and of phosphorylated intermediates in metabolism. Magnesium activates many enzymes and also forms a complex with ATP. Iron is a particularly important mineral because it functions as a component of hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in the blood) and is part of many enzymes. Other minerals, such as zinc or molybdenum, are required in very small quantities (trace or ultratrace amounts).

Sulfur is ingested principally in the amino acids cysteine and methionine. It is found in connective tissue, particularly in cartilage and skin. It has important functions in metabolism, which we will describe when we consider the action of

A dietary deficiency of calcium can lead to osteoporosis and osteomalacia, a disorder in which bones are insufficiently mineralized and consequently are fragile and easily fractured. Osteoporosis is a particularly common problem among elderly women. Deficiency of phosphorus results in bone loss along with weakness, anorexia, malaise, and pain. Iron deficiencies lead to anemia, a decrease in the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood.

coenzyme A, a compound used to activate carboxylic acids. Sulfur is excreted in the urine as sulfate.

Minerals, like vitamins, have adverse effects if ingested in excessive amounts. Problems associated with dietary excesses or deficiencies of minerals are described in subsequent chapters in conjunction with their normal metabolic functions.

## F. Water

Water constitutes one-half to four-fifths of the weight of the human body. The intake of water required per day depends on the balance between the amount produced by body metabolism and the amount lost through the skin, through expired air, and in the urine and feces.

## V. Dietary Guidelines

Dietary guidelines or goals are recommendations for food choices that can reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases while maintaining an adequate intake of nutrients. Many studies have shown an association between diet and physical activity and decreased risk of certain diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, stroke, diabetes, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Thus, the American Heart Institute and the American Cancer Institute, as well as several other groups, have developed diet and physical activity recommendations to decrease the risk of these diseases. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2015-2020) are prepared by an advisory committee of researchers appointed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to review the current evidence and revise the guidelines accordingly every 5 years (you can view these at the Web site listed in the references). Recommended servings of different food groups can be customized for individuals accessing the USDA MyPlate Web site (see references). Physicians and dietitians can tailor the dietary guidelines to meet the needs of their patients with specific medical conditions.

## A. General Recommendations

- Choose a healthy eating pattern at an appropriate calorie level to help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. For maintenance of weight, energy intake should balance energy expenditure. Accumulate at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity (such as walking at a pace of 3 to 4 miles per hour) daily and engage in muscle strengthening exercises at least 2 days per week. A regular physical activity program helps in achieving and maintaining healthy weight, cardiovascular fitness, and strength.

- Choose nutrient-dense foods in the amounts recommended by your personalized plan from MyPlate, including a daily variety of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; fat-free or low-fat dairy products; and lean protein foods.
- Practice food safety by frequently cleaning hands, cutting boards, and countertops; cooking foods to safe temperatures; and refrigerating leftovers promptly.


## B. Carbohydrates

- A diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and grain products should be chosen, providing $45 \%$ to $65 \%$ of its calories as carbohydrates. A variety of vegetables from all of the subgroups (i.e., dark green, red and orange, legumes, starchy, and other) and whole fruits should be included in a healthy eating pattern. In regard to grains (e.g., starches and other complex carbohydrates in the form of breads, fortified cereals, rice, and pasta), at least half should be whole grains. In addition to energy, vegetables, fruits, and grains supply vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals (protective compounds such as carotenoids, flavonoids, and lycopene), and fiber. Fiber, the indigestible part of plant food, has various beneficial effects, including relief of constipation.
- The consumption of added sugars in foods and beverages should be limited to less than $10 \%$ of total calories. Added sugars have no nutritional value other than calories, and they promote tooth decay.


## C. Fats

- Dietary fat should account for $20 \%$ to $35 \%$ of total calories, and saturated fatty acids should account for $<10 \%$ of total calories. Fats derived from fish, nuts, and vegetables, which are primarily polyunsaturated and monosaturated fatty acids, are preferred. Owing to their saturated fat content, meats such as fatty beef, lamb, pork, and poultry with skin and full-fat dairy products such as cheese, whole milk, butter, and ice cream should be limited. Trans-fatty acids, such as the partially hydrogenated vegetable oils found in stick margarines, baked goods, and fried foods, should be avoided.
- Although saturated and trans fats have a greater impact than dietary cholesterol on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, many organizations recommend that cholesterol intake be $<300 \mathrm{mg} /$ day in persons without atherosclerotic disease and $<200 \mathrm{mg} /$ day in those with established atherosclerosis. Major sources of dietary cholesterol in the American diet include beef, poultry, processed meats, eggs, cheese, and ice cream.


## D. Proteins

- Protein intake for adults should be approximately $0.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ healthy body weight per day. The protein should be of high quality and should be obtained from sources low in saturated fat (e.g., fish, poultry, beans, lentils, low-fat/ fat-free dairy products, soy products). Vegans should eat a mixture of plant proteins that ensures the intake of adequate amounts of the essential amino acids.


## E. Alcohol

- Alcohol consumption should not exceed moderate drinking and should only be consumed by adults of legal drinking age. Moderation is defined as no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men. A drink is defined as 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine (a little over 0.5 cup), or 1.5 oz of an 80 -proof liquor such as whiskey. Pregnant women should drink no alcohol. The ingestion of alcohol by pregnant women can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is marked by prenatal and postnatal

Folate is found in fruits and vegetables: citrus fruits (e.g., oranges), green leafy vegetables (e.g., spinach and broccoli), fortified cereals, and legumes (e.g., peas) (see Table 1.7). Conversely, vitamin $B_{12}$ is found only in foods of animal origin, including meats, eggs, and milk.

Cholesterol is obtained from the diet and is synthesized in most cells of the body. It is a component of cell membranes and the precursor of steroid hormones and of the bile salts used for fat absorption. High concentrations of cholesterol in the blood, particularly the cholesterol in lipoprotein particles called low-density lipoproteins (LDL), contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques inside the lumen of arterial vessels, particularly in the heart and brain. These plaques (fatty deposits on arterial walls) can obstruct blood flow to these vital organs, causing heart attacks and strokes. A high content of saturated fat and trans fat in the diet tends to increase circulatory levels of LDL cholesterol and contributes to the development of atherosclerosis.

The high content of sodium (in table salt) in the average American diet appears to be related to the development of hypertension (high blood pressure) in individuals who are genetically predisposed to this disorder.
growth deficiency; developmental delay; and craniofacial, limb, and cardiovascular defects.

## F. Vitamins and Minerals

- Sodium intake should be decreased in most individuals. Sodium is usually consumed as salt, NaCl . Less than 2.3 g of sodium should be consumed daily, which is equivalent to the sodium in 1 tbsp of salt.
- Many of the required vitamins and minerals can be obtained from eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains (particularly whole grains). Low-fat or fat-free dairy products are an excellent source of calcium; some dark green leafy vegetables provide available calcium. Lean meats, shellfish, poultry, dark meat, cooked dry beans, and some leafy green vegetables provide good sources of iron. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is found only in animal sources.
- Dietary supplementation in excess of the recommended amounts (e.g., megavitamin regimens) should be avoided.
- Fluoride should be present in the diet, at least during the years of tooth formation, as a protection against dental caries.


## VI. Xenobiotics

In addition to nutrients, our diet also contains a large number of chemicals called xenobiotics, which have no nutritional value, are of no use in the body, and can be harmful if consumed in excessive amounts. These compounds occur naturally in foods, can enter the food chain as contaminants, or can be deliberately introduced as food additives.

Dietary guidelines of the American Cancer Society and the American Institute for Cancer Research make recommendations relevant to the ingestion of xenobiotic compounds, particularly carcinogens. The dietary advice that we eat a variety of food helps to protect us against the ingestion of a toxic level of any one xenobiotic compound. It is also suggested that we reduce consumption of salt-cured, smoked, and charred foods, which contain chemicals that can contribute to the development of cancer. Other guidelines encourage the ingestion of fruits and vegetables that contain protective phytochemicals that act as antioxidants.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Otto S. Otto S. sought help in reducing his weight of 187 lb (BMI of 27) to his previous level of 154 lb (BMI of 22, in the middle of the healthy range). Otto S. is 5 ft 10 in tall, and he calculated that his maximum healthy weight was 173 lb . He planned on becoming a family physician, and he knew that he would be better able to counsel patients in healthy lifestyle behaviors such as diet and physical activity if he practiced them himself. With this information and assurances from the physician that he was otherwise in good health, Otto embarked on a weight loss program. One of his strategies involved recording all the food he ate and the portions. To analyze his diet for calories, saturated fat, and nutrients, he used the MyPlate personalized Plan (see references), available online from the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP). As part of his program, Otto met with a registered dietitian who provided the following: tips for buying and cooking nutrient-dense foods at a reasonable cost, tips for modifying eating behavior (e.g., slowing down the pace of eating), the setting of realistic achievable goals (e.g., loss of $10 \%$ of initial body weight within 6 months), and tips for dealing with relapse into prior habits.

Ivan A. Ivan A. weighed 264 lb and was 70 in tall with a heavy skeletal frame. For a male of this height, a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 would correspond to a weight between 129 lb and 173 lb . He is currently almost 100 lb overweight, and his BMI of 37.9 is in the obese range.

Mr. A.'s physician cautioned him that exogenous obesity (caused by overeating) represents a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, particularly when the distribution of fat is primarily "central" or in the abdominal region (apple shape, in contrast to the pear shape, in which adipose tissue is deposited in the buttocks and hips). In addition, obesity may lead to other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperlipidemia (high blood lipid levels), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (characterized by hyperglycemia). Mr. A. already has elevated blood pressure. Furthermore, his total serum cholesterol level was $296 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, well above the desired normal value ( $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ).

Mr. A. was referred to the hospital's weight reduction center, where a team of physicians, dietitians, and psychologists could assist him in reaching a healthy BMI.

Ann R. Because of her history and physical examination, Ann R. was diagnosed as having early anorexia nervosa, a psychiatric illness involving a disturbance in body image, which results in low body weight, malnutrition, and other medical complications. Miss R. was referred to a multidisciplinary team that included a psychiatrist with expertise in anorexia nervosa, and a program of psychotherapy and behavior modification was initiated.

Percy V. Percy V. weighed 125 lb and was 71 in tall (without shoes) with a medium frame. His BMI was 17.5 , which is significantly underweight. At the time his wife died, he weighed 147 lb . For his height, a BMI in the healthy weight range corresponds to weights between 132 lb and 178 lb .

Mr. V.'s malnourished state was reflected in his admission laboratory profile. The results of hematologic studies were consistent with an iron deficiency anemia complicated by low levels of folic acid and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, two vitamins that can affect the development of normal red blood cells. His low serum albumin level was caused by insufficient protein intake and a shortage of essential amino acids, which result in a reduced ability to synthesize body proteins. The psychiatrist requested a consultation with a hospital dietitian to evaluate the extent of Mr. V.'s severe acute malnutrition caused by inadequate intake of protein, energy, vitamins, and minerals.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

Dietary Reference Intakes. DRIs are quantitative estimates of nutrient intakes that can be used in evaluating and planning diets for healthy people. They are prepared by the Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) of the Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, and the National Academy of Science, with active input of Health Canada. The four reference intake values are the RDA, the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), the AI, and the UL. Practitioners use the RDA, AI, and UL values for evaluating patients' nutrient intakes. Researchers and policymakers use the EAR values as an estimate of nutrient intakes of populations rather than individuals. For each nutrient, the Committee has reviewed available literature on studies with humans and established criteria for adequate intake, such as prevention of certain deficiency symptoms, prevention of developmental abnormalities, or decreased risk of chronic degenerative disease. The criteria are not always the same for each life stage group. A requirement is defined as the lowest continuing intake level of a nutrient able to satisfy these criteria. The EAR is the daily intake value that is estimated to meet the requirement in half of the apparently healthy individuals in a life stage or gender group. The RDA is the EAR plus 2 standard deviations of the mean, which is the amount that should satisfy the requirement in $97 \%$ to $98 \%$ of the population. The AI level instead of an RDA is set for nutrients when there is not enough data to determine the EAR.

The prevalence of obesity in the US population is increasing. In 1962, 12.8\% of the population had a $\mathrm{BMI} \geq 30$ and therefore were clinically obese. That number increased to $14.5 \%$ by 1980 and to $22.5 \%$ by 1998. An additional $30 \%$ were overweight in 1998 ( $\mathrm{BMI}=25.0$ to 29.9 ). In 2012, based on BMI values, $35.1 \%$ of adults were classified as obese, and an additional $33.9 \%$ were classified as overweight. It is apparent, therefore, that more than two-thirds of the population is currently overweight or obese.

An elevated BMI increases cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and alterations in blood lipid levels. It also increases the risk for respiratory problems, gallbladder disease, and certain types of cancer.

When Mr.A. met with the dietitian to discuss his weight loss plans, he received the following advice: tips for devising a meal plan that provides consistent amounts of complex carbohydrates throughout the day for glucose control while limiting calories, saturated and trans fat, and sodium and tips for small, incremental dietary changes to achieve a diet that is lower in trans fat, sodium, and refined carbohydrates while high in essential nutrients via whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and nonfat/low-fat dairy products. Mr.A. was also counseled in a manner similar to Otto S. with an emphasis on the importance of losing $10 \%$ of initial body weight for improvement in blood pressure, blood lipids, and glucose control.

The UL refers to the highest level of daily nutrient intake consumed over time that is likely to pose no risks of adverse effects for almost all healthy individuals in the general population. Adverse effects are defined as any significant alteration in the structure or function of the human organism. The UL does not mean that most individuals who consume more than the UL will suffer adverse health effects but that the risk of adverse effects increases as intake increases above the UL.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Fuel is provided in the form of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in our diet.
- Energy is obtained from the fuel by oxidizing it to carbon dioxide and water.
- Unused fuel can be stored as triacylglycerol (fat) or glycogen (carbohydrate) within the body.
- Weight gain or loss is a balance between the energy consumed in our diet and the energy required each day to drive the basic functions of our body and our physical activity. The daily energy expenditure (DEE) is the amount of fuel consumed in a 24 -hour period.
- The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is a measure of the energy required to maintain involuntary bodily functions such as respiration, contraction of the heart muscle, biosynthetic processes, and establishment of ion gradients across neuronal membranes.
- The DEE is determined by the BMR and the individual's activity level while awake.
- The body mass index (BMI) is a ratio of weight to height that is used to determine a healthy weight for an individual and to classify a person as underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese.
- In addition to macronutrients, the diet provides vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, and essential amino acids.
- The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and the Adequate Intake (AI) provide quantitative estimates of nutrient requirements.
- The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) indicates the highest level of daily nutrient uptake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects.
- A summary of the diseases/disorders discussed in this chapter are presented in Table 1.9.

# ANSWERS TO REVIEW QUESTIONS 

1. The answer is B. In the process of respiration, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is consumed and fuels are oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The energy from the oxidation reactions is used to generate ATP from ADP and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$. However, a small amount of energy is also released as heat (thus, C is incorrect). Although fuels can be stored as triacylglycerols, this is not part of respiration (thus, A is incorrect). Respiration is a catabolic pathway (fuels are degraded), as opposed to an anabolic pathway (compounds combine to make larger molecules) (thus, E is incorrect).
2. The answer is D. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin, and it is absorbed from the small intestine in the presence of lipids. If lipids cannot be absorbed, the fatsoluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) also will not be absorbed. The other vitamins listed (vitamins $\mathrm{B}_{1}, \mathrm{C}$, folic acid, $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ ) are all water-soluble vitamins that do not require the presence of lipid for absorption from the intestinal lumen.
3. The answer is A. Mrs. Jones's diet lacks fruits and vegetables, both of which are good sources of vitamin C. Her diet is adequate in protein, as eggs, milk, cheese and cream contain significant levels of protein. Her calcium levels should be fine owing to the milk, cream, and cheese in her diet. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is derived from foods of animal origin, such as eggs, milk, and cheese. As the patient's weight has been stable for a year, her diet contains sufficient calories to allow her to maintain this weight, which is in the normal range for a patient who is 5 ft 4 in tall, as her BMI is 21.5 .
4. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The BMR is the calories being expended by a recently awakened resting person who has fasted 12 to 18 hours and is at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. It is equivalent to the energy expenditure of our major organs and resting skeletal muscle. Women generally have a lower BMR per kilogram of body weight because more of their body weight is usually metabolically less-active adipose tissue. Children have a higher BMR per kilogram of body weight because more of their body weight is metabolically active organs like the brain. The BMR increases in a cold environment because more energy is being
expended to generate heat. The BMR is not equivalent to our DEE, which includes BMR, physical activity, and DIT.
5. The answer is D. The RDA of a nutrient is determined from the EAR plus 2 standard deviations of the mean (SD) and should meet the needs for $97 \%$ to $98 \%$ of the healthy population. It is therefore a reasonable goal for the intake of a healthy individual. The EAR is the amount that prevents development of established signs of deficiency in $50 \%$ of the healthy population. Although data with laboratory animals have been used to establish deficiency symptoms, RDAs are based on data collected on nutrient ingestion by humans.
6. The answer is B. The recommended total fat intake is $<30 \%$ of total calories. His total caloric consumption was 4,110 calories/day (carbohydrate, $4 \times 585=$ 2,340 calories; protein $150 \times 4=600$ calories; fat, $95 \times$ $9=855$ calories; alcohol, $45 \times 7=315$ calories) (thus, A is incorrect). His fat intake was $21 \%(855 \div 4,110)$ of his total caloric intake. His alcohol intake was $7.7 \%$ (315 $\div 4,110$ ) (thus, C is incorrect). His protein intake was well above the RDA of $0.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight (thus, D is incorrect). His BMR is roughly 24 calories/day/kg body weight, or 2,880 calories/day (it will actually be less because he is obese and has a greater proportion of metabolically less-active tissue than the average $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man). His DEE is about 3,744 calories/day $(1.3 \times 2,880)$ or less. Thus, his intake is greater than his expenditure, and he is in positive caloric balance and is gaining weight (thus, E is incorrect).
7. The answer is B. The man weighs 75 kg , so a rough estimate of his daily caloric need (to maintain his weight) is $75 \times 24 \times 1.3=2,340$ calories/day ( 1.3 is the sedentary activity factor). The man has reduced his daily intake by 240 calories ( 10 g of carbohydrates is 40 calories; 10 g of protein is 40 calories; 10 g of lipid is 90 calories; 10 g of ethanol is 70 calories; $40+40+$ $90+70=240$ ). Thus, the man has reduced his daily intake by approximately $10 \%$ of that needed to maintain his weight $(240 / 2,340)$.

8. The answer is D. Warfarin acts by inhibiting the ability of vitamin K to participate in reactions required by clotting factors. If one's diet contains additional vitamin K, the efficacy of the warfarin could be reduced. Green leafy vegetables are an excellent source of vitamin K, and their consumption should be limited while on warfarin therapy.
9. The answer is D. The patient's DEE is calculated as $70 \times 21.6 \times 1.6=2,420(70 \mathrm{~kg}$ weight, times $21.6 \mathrm{kcal} /$ $\mathrm{kg} /$ day, times 1.6 activity factor for being moderately active). Because the patient is currently consuming 2,700 calories/day, she is gaining weight despite
her activity. To lose 1 lb of weight, a loss of 3,500 calories must occur. Over a 1-week period, that is 500 calories/day. Thus, the patient should be consuming 1,920 calories/day to lose 1 lb per week, which is approximately 800 fewer calories/day based on her current consumption.
10. The answer is C. Ethanol, lipids (triglycerides), and carbohydrates do not contain a nitrogen group that is converted to ammonia during its catabolism-only proteins do. Water-soluble vitamins are present at low levels and are not appreciably catabolized, so their contribution to ammonia production is low as compared to protein catabolism.

FIGURE 2.I Major fates of fuels in the fed state. TG, triacylglycerol.

## The Fed or Absorptive State

The Fed State. During a meal, we ingest carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, which are subsequently digested and absorbed. Some of this food is oxidized to meet the immediate energy needs of the body. The amount consumed in excess of the body's energy needs is transported to the fuel depots, where it is stored. During the period from the start of absorption until absorption is completed, we are in the fed, or absorptive, state. Whether a fuel is oxidized or stored in the fed state is determined principally by the concentration of two endocrine hormones in the blood, insulin and glucagon.

Fate of Carbohydrates. Dietary carbohydrates are digested to monosaccharides, which are absorbed into the blood. The major monosaccharide in the blood is glucose (Fig. 2.I). After a meal, glucose is oxidized by various tissues for energy, enters biosynthetic pathways, and is stored as glycogen, mainly in liver and muscle. Glucose is the major biosynthetic precursor in the body, and the carbon skeletons of most of the compounds we synthesize can be synthesized from glucose. Glucose is also converted to triacylglycerols. The liver packages triacylglycerols, made from glucose or from fatty acids obtained from the blood, into very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and releases them into the blood. The fatty acids of theVLDL are stored mainly as triacylglycerols in adipose tissue, but some may be used to meet the energy needs of cells.

Fate of Proteins. Dietary proteins are digested to amino acids, which are absorbed into the blood. In cells, the amino acids are converted to proteins or used to make various nitrogen-containing compounds such as neurotransmitters and heme. The carbon skeleton may also be oxidized for energy directly or converted to glucose.

Fate of Fats. Triacylglycerols are the major lipids in the diet. They are digested to fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerols, which are resynthesized into triacylglycerols in intestinal epithelial cells, packaged in chylomicrons, and secreted by way of the lymph into the blood. The fatty acids of the chylomicron triacylglycerols are stored mainly as triacylglycerols in adipose cells. They are subsequently oxidized for energy or used in biosynthetic pathways, such as synthesis of membrane lipids.

## THE WAITING ROOM

Ivan A. returned to his doctor for a second visit. His initial efforts to lose weight and follow the dietitian's recommendations had failed dismally. In fact, he now weighed 270 lb , an increase of 6 lb since his first visit 2 months ago (see Chapter 1). He reported that the recent death of his 45 -year-old brother of a heart attack had made him realize that he must pay more attention to his health. Because Mr. A.'s brother had a history of hypercholesterolemia and because Mr. A.'s serum total cholesterol had been significantly elevated ( $296 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) at his first visit, his blood lipid profile was determined, he was screened for type 2 diabetes, and a few other blood tests were ordered. (The blood lipid profile is a test that measures the content of the various triacylglycerol- and cholesterol-containing particles in the blood.) His blood pressure was 162 mm Hg systolic and 98 mm Hg diastolic, or $162 / 98 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (normal is $\leq 120 / 80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, with prehypertension 120 to $139 / 80$ to 89 mm Hg and hypertension is defined as $>140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ). His waist circumference was 48 in (healthy values for men, $<40$ in; for women, $<35$ in).

## I. Digestion and Absorption

## A. Carbohydrates

Dietary carbohydrates are converted to monosaccharides. Starch, a polymer of glucose, is the major carbohydrate of the diet. It is digested by the enzyme salivary $\alpha$-amylase and then by pancreatic $\alpha$-amylase, which acts in the small intestine. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions (usually they increase the speed at which the reactions occur). Di-, tri-, and oligosaccharides (disaccharide refers to two linked sugars; a trisaccharide to three linked sugars, and an oligosaccharide to $n$ linked sugars) produced by these $\alpha$-amylases are cleaved to glucose by digestive enzymes located on the surface of the brush border of the intestinal epithelial cells. Dietary disaccharides also are cleaved by enzymes in this brush border. Sucrase converts the disaccharide sucrose (table sugar) to glucose and fructose, and lactase converts the disaccharide lactose (milk sugar) to glucose and galactose. Monosaccharides produced by digestion and dietary monosaccharides are absorbed by the intestinal epithelial cells and released into the hepatic portal vein, which carries them to the liver.

## B. Proteins

Proteins contain amino acids that are linked through peptide bonds (see Chapter 1). Dipeptides contain two amino acids, tripeptides contain three amino acids, and so on. Dietary proteins are cleaved to amino acids by enzymes known as proteases (Fig. 2.2, circle 3), which cleave the peptide bond between amino acids (see Fig. 1.5). Pepsin acts in the stomach, and the proteolytic enzymes produced by the pancreas (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and the carboxypeptidases) act in the lumen of the small intestine. Aminopeptidases and di- and tripeptidases associated with the intestinal epithelial cells complete the conversion of dietary proteins to amino acids, which are absorbed into the intestinal epithelial cells and released into the hepatic portal vein.

## C. Fats

The digestion of fats is more complex than that of carbohydrates or proteins because fats are not very soluble in water. The triacylglycerols of the diet are emulsified in the intestine by bile salts, which are synthesized in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. The enzyme pancreatic lipase converts the triacylglycerols in the lumen of the intestine to fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerols (glycerol with a fatty acid esterified at carbon 2), which interact with bile salts to form tiny microdroplets called micelles. The fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerols are absorbed from these micelles into the intestinal epithelial cells, where they are resynthesized

The body can make fatty acids from a caloric excess of carbohydrate and protein. These fatty acids, together with the fatty acids of chylomicrons (derived from dietary fat), are deposited in adipose tissue as triacylglycerols. Thus, Ivan A.'s increased adipose tissue is coming from his intake of all fuels in excess of his caloric need.

![ma102581432b](ma102581432b.jpg)

FIGURE 2.2 The fed state. The circled numbers indicate the approximate order in which the processes occur. TG, triacylglycerols; FA, fatty acid; $A A$, amino acid; $R B C$, red blood cell; VLDL, very low-density lipoprotein; I, insulin; CHO, carbohydrate; acetyl CoA, acetyl coenzyme A;ATP, adenosine triphosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; $\oplus$, stimulated by.
into triacylglycerols. The triacylglycerols are packaged with proteins, phospholipids, cholesterol, and other compounds into the lipoprotein complexes known as chylomicrons, which are secreted into the lymph and ultimately enter the bloodstream (see Fig. 2.2, circle 2). Fats must be transported in the blood bound to protein or in lipoprotein complexes because they are insoluble in water. Thus, both triacylglycerols and cholesterol are found in lipoprotein complexes.

# II. Changes in Hormone Levels after a Meal 

After a typical high-carbohydrate meal, the pancreas is stimulated to release the hormone insulin, and release of the hormone glucagon is inhibited (see Fig. 2.2, circle 4). Endocrine hormones are released from endocrine glands, such as the pancreas, in response to a specific stimulus. They travel in the blood, carrying messages between tissues concerning the overall physiologic state of the body. At their target tissues, they adjust the rate of various metabolic pathways to meet the changing conditions. The endocrine hormone insulin, which is secreted from the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas in response to a high-carbohydrate meal, carries the message that dietary glucose is available and can be transported into the cell, used, and stored. The release of another hormone, glucagon, from the $\alpha$-cells of the pancreas, is suppressed by glucose and insulin. Glucagon carries the message that glucose must be generated

from endogenous fuel stores. The subsequent changes in circulating hormone levels cause changes in the body's metabolic patterns, involving several different tissues and metabolic pathways.

## III. Fate of Glucose

## A. Conversion to Glycogen, Triacylglycerols, and Carbon Dioxide in the Liver

Because glucose leaves the intestine via the hepatic portal vein (a blood vessel that carries blood from the intestine to the liver), the liver is the first tissue it passes through. The liver extracts a portion of this glucose from the blood. Some of the glucose that enters hepatocytes (liver cells) is oxidized in adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-generating pathways to meet the immediate energy needs of these cells, and the remainder is converted to glycogen and triacylglycerols or used for biosynthetic reactions. In the liver, insulin promotes the uptake of glucose by increasing its use as a fuel and its storage as glycogen and triacylglycerols (see Fig. 2.2, circles 5 to 7).

As glucose is being oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, it is first oxidized to pyruvate in the pathway of glycolysis (discussed in more detail in Chapter 22) and consists of a series of reactions common to the metabolism of many carbohydrates. Pyruvate is then oxidized to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). The acetyl group enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, where it is completely oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Energy from the oxidative reactions is used to generate ATP. The ATP that is generated is used for anabolic and other energy-requiring processes in the cell. Coenzyme A (CoA), which makes the acetyl group more reactive, is a cofactor derived from the vitamin pantothenic acid.

Liver glycogen stores reach a maximum of approximately 200 to 300 g after a high-carbohydrate meal, whereas the body's fat stores are relatively limitless. As the glycogen stores begin to fill, the liver also begins converting some of the excess glucose it receives to triacylglycerols. Both the glycerol and the fatty acid moieties of the triacylglycerols can be synthesized from glucose. The fatty acids are also obtained preformed from the blood (these are the dietary fatty acids). The liver does not store triacylglycerols, however, but packages them along with proteins, phospholipids, and cholesterol into the lipoprotein complexes known as VLDL, which are secreted into the bloodstream. Some of the fatty acids from the VLDL are taken up by tissues for their immediate energy needs, but most are stored in adipose tissue as triacylglycerols.

## B. Glucose Metabolism in Other Tissues

The glucose from the intestine that is not metabolized by the liver travels in the blood to peripheral tissues (most other tissues), where it can be oxidized for energy. Glucose is the one fuel that can be used by all tissues. Many tissues store small amounts of glucose as glycogen. Muscle has relatively large glycogen stores.

Insulin greatly stimulates the transport of glucose into the two tissues that have the largest mass in the body, muscle and adipose tissue. It has much smaller effects on the transport of glucose into other tissues.

Fuel metabolism often is discussed as though the body consisted only of brain, skeletal and cardiac muscle, liver, adipose tissue, red blood cells, kidney, and intestinal epithelial cells ("the gut"). These are the dominant tissues in terms of overall fuel economy, and they are the tissues we describe most often. Of course, all tissues require fuels for energy, and many have very specific fuel requirements.

## I. Brain and Other Neural Tissues

The brain and other neural tissues are very dependent on glucose for their energy needs. They generally oxidize glucose, via glycolysis and the TCA cycle, completely to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, generating ATP (see Fig. 2.2, circle 8). Except under conditions of starvation, glucose is their only major fuel. Glucose is also a major precursor of

The laboratory studies ordered at the time of his second office visit show that Ivan A. has hyperglycemia, an elevation of blood glucose above normal values. At the time of this visit, his blood glucose determined after an overnight fast was $162 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (normal, 80 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Because this blood glucose measurement was significantly above normal, a hemoglobin A1c (glycosylated hemoglobin) level was ordered, which was also elevated. This led to a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this disease, liver, muscle, and adipose tissue are relatively resistant to the action of insulin in promoting glucose uptake into cells and storage as glycogen and triacylglycerols. Therefore, more glucose remains in his blood. The registered dietitian met with Ivan to assess his current nutrient intake and to counsel him about a heart-healthy diet with a moderate amount of carbohydrate and an emphasis on high-fiber, minimally processed foods. Based on Ivan's metabolic needs, the dietitian then developed a meal plan that allowed for four to five carbohydrate portions at each meal, and two carbohydrate portions each for an afternoon and evening snack. Note that a carbohydrate portion equals 15 g of carbohydrate $(60 \mathrm{kcal})$.

neurotransmitters, the chemicals that convey electrical impulses (as ion gradients) between neurons. If our blood glucose drops much below normal levels, we become dizzy and light-headed. If blood glucose continues to drop, we become comatose and ultimately die. Under normal, nonstarving conditions, the brain and the rest of the nervous system require roughly 150 g of glucose each day.

# 2. Red Blood Cells 

Glucose is the only fuel used by red blood cells because they lack mitochondria. Fatty acid oxidation, amino acid oxidation, the TCA cycle, the electron-transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation (ATP generation that is dependent on oxygen and the electron-transport chain) occur principally in mitochondria. Glucose, in contrast, generates ATP from anaerobic glycolysis in the cytosol, and thus, red blood cells obtain all their energy by this process. In anaerobic glycolysis, the pyruvate formed from glucose is converted to lactate and then released into the blood (see Fig. 2.2, circle 9).

Without glucose, red blood cells could not survive. Red blood cells carry $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the lungs to the tissues. Without red blood cells, most of the tissues of the body would suffer from a lack of energy because they require $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to completely convert their fuels to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

## 3. Muscle

Exercising skeletal muscles can use glucose from the blood or from their own glycogen stores, converting glucose to lactate through glycolysis or oxidizing it completely to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Muscle also uses other fuels from the blood, such as fatty acids (Fig. 2.3). After a meal, glucose is used by muscle to replenish the glycogen stores that were depleted during exercise. Glucose is transported into muscle cells and converted to glycogen by processes that are stimulated by insulin.

## 4. Adipose Tissue

Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose into adipose cells as well as into muscle cells. Adipocytes oxidize glucose for energy, and they also use glucose as the source of the glycerol moiety of the triacylglycerols they store (see Fig. 2.2, circle 10).

FIGURE 2.3 Oxidation of fuels in exercising skeletal muscle. Exercising muscle uses more energy than resting muscle, and therefore fuel use is increased to supply more adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Acetyl CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.

## IV. Lipoproteins

Two types of lipoproteins, chylomicrons and VLDL, are produced in the fed state. The major function of these lipoproteins is to provide a blood transport system for triacylglycerols, which are very insoluble in water. However, these lipoproteins also contain the lipid cholesterol, which is also somewhat insoluble in water. The triacylglycerols of chylomicrons are formed in intestinal epithelial cells from the products of digestion of dietary triacylglycerols. The triacylglycerols of VLDL are synthesized in the liver.

When these lipoproteins pass through blood vessels in adipose tissue, their triacylglycerols are degraded to fatty acids and glycerol (see Fig. 2.2, circle 12). The fatty acids enter the adipose cells and combine with a glycerol moiety that is produced from blood glucose. The resulting triacylglycerols are stored as large fat droplets in the adipose cells. The remnants of the chylomicrons are cleared from the blood by the liver. The remnants of the VLDL can be cleared by the liver, or they can form low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is cleared by the liver or by peripheral cells.

Most of us have not even begun to reach the limits of our capacity to store triacylglycerols in adipose tissue. The ability of humans to store fat appears to be limited only by the amount of tissue we can carry without overloading the heart.

## V. Amino Acids

The amino acids derived from dietary proteins travel from the intestine to the liver in the hepatic portal vein (see Fig. 2.2, circle 3). The liver uses amino acids for the synthesis of serum proteins as well as its own proteins, and for the biosynthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds that need amino acid precursors, such as the nonessential amino acids, heme, hormones, neurotransmitters, and purine and pyrimidine bases (which are required for the synthesis of the nucleic acids RNA and DNA). The liver also may oxidize the amino acids or convert them to glucose or ketone bodies and dispose of the nitrogen as the nontoxic compound urea.

Many of the amino acids will go into the peripheral circulation, where they can be used by other tissues for protein synthesis and various biosynthetic pathways, or they can be oxidized for energy (see Fig. 2.2, circle 14). Proteins undergo turnover; they are constantly being synthesized and degraded. The amino acids released by protein breakdown enter the same pool of free amino acids in the blood as the amino acids from the diet. This free amino acid pool in the blood can be used by all cells to provide the right ratio of amino acids for protein synthesis or for biosynthesis of other compounds. In general, each individual biosynthetic pathway using an amino acid precursor is found in only a few tissues in the body.

## VI. Summary of the Fed (Absorptive) State

After a meal, the macronutrients that we eat are oxidized to meet our immediate energy needs. Glucose is the major fuel for most tissues. Excess glucose and fatty acids are stored as glycogen mainly in muscle and liver and as triacylglycerols in adipose tissue. Amino acids from dietary proteins are converted to body proteins or oxidized as fuels.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Ivan A. Mr. A. was advised that his obesity represents a risk factor for future heart attacks and strokes. He was told that his body has to maintain a larger volume of circulating blood to service his extra fat tissue. This expanded blood volume not only contributes to his elevated blood pressure

3Ivan A.'s total cholesterol level is now $315 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, slightly higher than his previous level of $296 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. His triacylglycerol level is $250 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (normal, between 60 and $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), LDL is $210 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, and HDL is $27 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (normal for a male, $>40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). These lipid levels clearly indicate that Mr.A. has a hyperlipidemia (high level of lipoproteins in the blood) and therefore is at risk for the future development of atherosclerosis and its consequences such as heart attacks and strokes.

Ivan A.'s waist circumference indicates that he has the android pattern of obesity (apple shape). Fat stores are distributed in the body in two different patterns-android and gynecoid. After puberty, men tend to store fat within their abdominal cavity (an android pattern), whereas women tend to store fat subcutaneously in their hips and thighs (a gynecoid pattern). Thus, the typical overweight male tends to have more of an apple shape than the typical overweight female, who is more pear-shaped. Abdominal fat carries a greater risk for hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperinsulinemia, diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, stroke, and cancer of the breast and endometrium. It also carries a greater risk of overall mortality. Because more men than women have the android distribution, they are more at risk for most of these conditions. Likewise, women who deposit their excess fat in a more android manner have a greater risk than women whose fat distribution is more gynecoid.

Upper-body fat deposition tends to occur more by hypertrophy of the existing cells, whereas lowerbody fat deposition is by differentiation of new fat cells (hyperplasia). This may partly explain why many women with lower-body obesity have difficulty losing weight.

The constellation of symptoms exhibited by Mr.A.—abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and high blood pressure-can all be related to the disorder known as metabolic syndrome or "syndrome X." We will discuss more aspects of metabolic syndrome as Mr. A.'s case progresses.

To obtain reliable measures of SFT, procedures are carefully defined. For example, in the triceps measurement, a fold of skin in the posterior aspect of the nondominant arm midway between shoulder and elbow is grasped gently and pulled away from the underlying muscle. The SFT reading is taken at a precise time. 4 seconds after applying the caliper, because the caliper compresses the skin. Even when these procedures are performed by trained dietitians, reliable measurements are difficult to obtain.
(itself a risk factor for vascular disease) but also puts an increased workload on his heart. This increased load will cause his heart muscle to thicken and eventually to fail.

Mr. A.'s increasing adipose mass has also contributed to his development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels). The mechanism behind this breakdown in his ability to maintain normal levels of blood glucose is, at least in part, a resistance by his triacylglycerol-rich adipose cells to the action of insulin.

In addition to type 2 diabetes mellitus, Mr. A. has a hyperlipidemia (high blood lipid level—elevated cholesterol and triacylglycerols), another risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A genetic basis for Mr. A.'s disorder is inferred from a positive family history of hypercholesterolemia and premature coronary artery disease in a brother.

At this point, the first therapeutic steps should be nonpharmacologic. Mr. A.'s obesity should be treated with caloric restriction and a carefully monitored program of exercise. A reduction of dietary fat (particularly saturated fat and trans fat) and sodium would be advised in an effort to correct his hyperlipidemia and his hypertension, respectively. He should also control his carbohydrate intake because of his type 2 diabetes.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

Anthropometric Measurements. Anthropometry uses body measurements to monitor growth and nutritional health in individuals and to detect nutritional inadequacies or excesses. In adults, the measurements most commonly used are height, weight, triceps skinfold thickness (SFT), arm muscle circumference (AMC), and waist circumference. In infants and young children, length and head circumference are also measured.

Weight and Height. Weight should be measured by using a calibrated beam, lever-balance-type scale, or electronic scale, and the patient should be in minimal clothing (i.e., gown or underwear). Height for adults should be measured while the patient stands against a straight surface, without shoes, with the heels together, and with the head erect and level. The weight and height are used in calculation of the body mass index (BMI).

Skinfold Thickness. Over half of the fat in the body is deposited in subcutaneous tissue under the skin, and the percentage increases with increasing weight. To provide an estimate of the amount of total body fat, a standardized caliper is used to pinch a fold of the skin, usually at more than one site (e.g., the thigh, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac areas). Obesity by this physical anthropometric technique is defined as a fatfold thickness greater than the 85th percentile for young adults; that is, 18.6 mm for males and 25.1 mm for females.

Midarm Anthropometry. The AMC, also called the mid-upper arm muscle circumference (MUAMC), reflects both caloric adequacy and muscle mass and can serve as a general index of marasmic-type malnutrition. The AMC is measured at the midpoint of the left upper arm by a flexible fiberglass-type tape. The AMC can be calculated from a formula that subtracts a factor related to the SFT from the AMC:

$$
\mathrm{MUAMC}(\mathrm{~cm})=\mathrm{AMC}(\mathrm{~cm})-(3.14 \times \mathrm{SFT}[\mathrm{~mm}]) / 10
$$

where MUAMC is the mid-upper arm muscle circumference in centimeters and SFT is the skinfold thickness expressed in millimeters.

MUAMC values can be compared with reference graphs available for both sexes and all ages. Protein-calorie malnutrition and negative nitrogen balance induce muscle wasting and decrease muscle circumference.

Waist Circumference. The waist circumference is another anthropometric measurement that serves as an indicator of body composition but is used as a

measure of obesity and body fat distribution (the "apple shape"), not malnutrition. The measurement is made by placing a measuring tape around the abdomen at the level of the iliac crest of a standing individual. A high-risk waistline is larger than 35 in ( 88 cm ) for women and larger than 40 in ( 102 cm ) for men.

## KEY CONCEPTS

- During a meal, we ingest carbohydrate, lipids, and proteins.
- Two endocrine hormones-insulin and glucagon-primarily regulate fuel storage and retrieval.
- The predominant carbohydrate in the blood is glucose. Blood glucose levels regulate the release of insulin and glucagon from the pancreas.
- Under the influence of insulin (fed state), glucose can be used as a fuel and also as a precursor for storage via conversion to glycogen or triacylglycerol.
- Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose into adipose and muscle cells.
- Triacylglycerol obtained from the diet is released into circulation in the form of chylomicrons. Triacylglycerol synthesized from glucose in the liver is released as VLDL. Adipose tissue is the storage site for triacylglycerol.
- The brain and red blood cells use glucose as their primary energy source under normal conditions.
- Amino acids obtained from the diet are used for the biosynthesis of proteins and nitrogen-containing molecules and as an energy source.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 2.1.

The waist-to-hip ratio has been used instead of the waist circumference as a measure of abdominal obesity in an attempt to correct for differences between individuals with respect to body type or bone structure. In this measurement, the waist circumference is divided by the hip circumference (measured at the iliac crest). The average waist-to-hip ratio for men is 0.93 (range $=0.75$ to 1.10 ), and the average for women is 0.83 (range $=0.70$ to 1.00 ). However, the waist circumference may actually correlate better with intra-abdominal fat and the associated risk factors than the waist-to-hip ratio.

# A NS WERS 

1. The answer is E. During digestion of a mixed meal, starch and other carbohydrates, proteins, and dietary triacylglycerols are broken into their monomeric units (carbohydrates into simple monosaccharides, protein into amino acids, and triacylglycerols into fatty acids and 2-monacylglycerol) in the small intestine. Glucose is the principal sugar in dietary carbohydrates,
and thus, it increases in the blood. Amino acids and monosaccharides enter the portal vein and go to the liver first. After digestion of fats and absorption of the fatty acids by the intestinal epithelial cells, most of the fatty acids are converted back into triacylglycerols and subsequently into chylomicrons by the intestinal cells. Chylomicrons go through lymphatic vessels to

reach the blood, where the triacylglycerol content is principally stored in adipose tissue.
2. The answer is C. After a high-carbohydrate meal, glucose is the major fuel for most tissues, including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver. The increase in blood glucose levels stimulates the release of insulin, not glucagon. Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, not brain. Liver, not skeletal muscle, converts glucose to fatty acids. Although the red blood cell uses glucose as its only fuel at all times, it generates ATP from conversion of glucose to lactate, not $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. When the muscle totally depletes its glycogen stores through exercise and then a meal containing carbohydrate is ingested, the muscle and liver will synthesize glycogen to replete those stores; in the case of muscle, the amount of glycogen synthesized is greater than normal, leading to higher-than-normal glycogen stores in the muscle and an advantage for the muscle during exercise.
3. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. In the fed state, and in the presence of insulin, glucose transport into both the adipocyte and muscle cell will be increased. Insulin will also stimulate the liver to synthesize both glycogen and fatty acids, which leads to enhanced triglyceride synthesis and VLDL production to deliver the fatty acids to other tissues of the body. Insulin will stimulate glucose uptake in fat cells but does not stimulate fatty acid synthesis in the fat cells (that is unique to the liver) but will lead to enhanced triglyceride synthesis in the fat cells.
4. The answer is B. Chylomicrons are the lipoprotein particles formed in intestinal epithelial cells from dietary fats and contain principally triacylglycerols formed from components of dietary triacylglycerols. A decreased intake of calories in general would include a decreased consumption of fat, carbohydrate, and protein, which might not lower chylomicron levels. Dietary cholesterol, although found in chylomicrons, is not their principal component.
5. The answer is A. The patient's BMI is in the obese range, with large abdominal fat deposits. He needs to decrease his intake of total calories because an excess of calories ingested as carbohydrate, fat, or protein results in deposition of triacylglycerols in adipose tissue. If he keeps his total caloric intake the same, substitution of one type of food for another will help very little with weight loss. (However, a decreased intake of fat may be advisable for other reasons.) Limited food diets, such as the ice cream and sherry diet or a high-protein diet of shrimp, work if they decrease appetite and therefore ingestion of total calories.
6. The answer is D. Milk contains lactose (milk sugar) that is converted by the enzyme lactase (located on the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells) to glucose and galactose. The salivary glands produce amylase, which digests starch but not lactose. The pancreas also produces amylase but not an enzyme that can
digest lactose. The pancreas does produce insulin, which is not needed for the absorption of lactose but is needed for the absorption of glucose into muscle and fat cells. The stomach produces hydrochloric acid and pepsin for protein digestion but does not digest disaccharides. The liver does not synthesize any enzymes that digest dietary carbohydrates.
7. The answer is D. The purpose of fasting is to measure circulating triglycerides and cholesterol without complication from recently ingested food. Upon eating a mixed meal (protein, lipid, and carbohydrate), the intestine synthesizes chylomicrons to distribute the recently ingested lipid throughout the body. Upon fasting, chylomicrons are not present, and what the lipid panel is measuring is the cholesterol content of the blood, the subset of particles carrying the cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein [HDL] and LDL), and the triglyceride content (primarily from VLDL). Serum albumin is the major serum protein and will bind to free fatty acids, but its levels are not measured in a lipid panel (measurement of albumin is done to check liver function). The fatty acids are a part of the triacylglycerol in the circulating lipoprotein particles in the blood and would not be reduced under fasting conditions.
8. The answer is A. Bread and potatoes are high in starch/ carbohydrates. A high-carbohydrate meal stimulates the release of insulin from the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas to help use and store this available glucose. Glucose and insulin suppress the release of glucagon from the $\alpha$-cells of the pancreas. Glucagon helps to generate glucose from endogenous stores, which is unnecessary with such high levels of glucose from dietary sources. Salivary and pancreatic amylase are both required in the breakdown of dietary starches to glucose. Lactase is required to convert lactose to glucose and galactose (from the milk sugar in the meal).
9. The answer is A. The 400 -meter dash is primarily an anaerobic activity, and the major source of energy for the muscle is glucose from its own glycogen stores (this pathway is also the one that produces energy at the fastest rate). The muscle does not store triacylglycerol (adipose tissue does). During the exercise, the muscle will generate lactic acid, which will be secreted in the blood. The muscle will not use lactate as an energy source. The muscle will not degrade its own proteins to generate amino acids to use as an energy source.
10. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Insulin is required for glucose transport into both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue but is not required for glucose uptake into the red blood cells or brain (nervous tissue). The tissues that cannot transport glucose will be unable to metabolize it under these conditions. The inability of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue to take up glucose in the absence of insulin contributes to the high blood glucose levels seen in people with type 1 diabetes who have neglected to take their insulin.

# Fasting 

The Fasting State. Fasting begins approximately 2 to 4 hours after a meal, when blood glucose levels return to basal levels, and continues until blood glucose levels begin to rise after the start of the next meal. Within about I hour after a meal, blood glucose levels begin to fall. Consequently, insulin levels decline and glucagon levels rise. These changes in hormone levels trigger the release of fuels from the body stores. Liver glycogen is degraded by the process of glycogenolysis, which supplies glucose to the blood. Adipose triacylglycerols are mobilized by the process of lipolysis, which releases fatty acids and glycerol into the blood. Use of fatty acids as a fuel increases with the length of the fast; they are the major fuel oxidized during overnight fasting.

Fuel Oxidation. During fasting, glucose continues to be oxidized by glucosedependent tissues such as the brain and red blood cells, and fatty acids are oxidized by tissues such as muscle and liver. Muscle and most other tissues oxidize fatty acids completely to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. However, the liver partially oxidizes fatty acids to smaller molecules called ketone bodies, which are released into the blood. Muscle, kidney, and certain other tissues derive energy from completely oxidizing ketone bodies in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Maintenance of Blood Glucose. As fasting progresses, the liver produces glucose not only by glycogenolysis (the release of glucose from glycogen) but also by a second process called gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of glucose from noncarbohydrate compounds). The major sources of carbon for gluconeogenesis are lactate, glycerol, and amino acids. When the carbons of the amino acids are converted to glucose by the liver, their nitrogen is converted to urea.

Starvation. When we fast for 3 or more days, we are in the starved state. Muscle continues to burn fatty acids but decreases its use of ketone bodies. As a result, the concentration of ketone bodies rises in the blood to a level at which the brain begins to oxidize them for energy. The brain then needs less glucose, so the liver decreases its rate of gluconeogenesis. Consequently, less protein in muscle and other tissues is degraded to supply amino acids for gluconeogenesis. Protein sparing preserves vital functions for as long as possible. Because of these changes in the fuel use patterns of various tissues, humans can survive for extended periods without ingesting food.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Percy V. had been admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of mental depression associated with malnutrition (see Chapter 1). At the time of admission, his body weight of 125 lb gave him a body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 (healthy range $=18.5$ to 24.9 ). His serum albumin was $10 \%$ below the low end of the normal range, and he exhibited signs of iron and vitamin deficiencies.

Additional tests were made to help evaluate Mr. V.'s degree of malnutrition and his progress toward recovery. His arm circumference and triceps skinfold were measured, and his mid-upper arm muscle circumference (MUAMC) was calculated (see Chapter 2, Anthropometric Measurements). His serum prealbumin and serum albumin levels were measured. Fasting blood glucose and serum ketone body concentration were determined on blood samples drawn the next day before breakfast. A 24-hour urine specimen was collected to determine ketone body excretion and creatinine excretion for calculation of the creatinine-height index (CHI), a measure of protein depletion from skeletal muscle.

Ann R. was receiving psychological counseling for anorexia nervosa but with little success (see Chapter 1). She continues to want to lose weight despite being underweight. She saw her gynecologist because she had not had a menstrual period for 5 months. She also complained of becoming easily fatigued. The physician recognized that Ann's body weight of 85 lb was now $<65 \%$ of her ideal weight, and he calculated that her BMI was now 13.7. The physician recommended immediate hospitalization. The admission diagnosis was severe malnutrition (grade III protein-energy malnutrition [PEM]) secondary to anorexia nervosa. Clinical findings included decreased body core temperature, blood pressure, and pulse (adaptive responses to malnutrition). Her physician ordered measurements of blood glucose as well as other blood tests to check electrolytes and her kidney function and an electrocardiogram to see any effects on the electrical activity of the heart.

## I. The Fasting State

Blood glucose levels peak at about 1 hour after eating (the postprandial state) and then decrease as tissues oxidize glucose or convert it to storage forms of fuel. By 2 hours after a meal, the level returns to the fasting range (between 80 and $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). This decrease in blood glucose causes the pancreas to decrease its secretion of insulin and the serum insulin level decreases. The liver responds to this hormonal signal by starting to degrade its glycogen stores (glycogenolysis) and release glucose into the blood.

If we eat another meal within a few hours, we return to the fed state. However, if we continue to fast for a 12-hour period, we enter the basal state (also known as the postabsorptive state). A person is generally considered to be in the basal state after an overnight fast, when no food has been eaten since dinner the previous evening. By this time, the serum insulin level is low and glucagon is rising. Figure 3.1 illustrates the main features of the basal state.

## A. Blood Glucose and the Role of the Liver during Fasting

The liver maintains blood glucose levels during fasting, and its role is thus critical. Glucose is the major fuel for tissues such as the brain and neural tissue and is the sole fuel for red blood cells. Most neurons lack enzymes required for oxidation of fatty acids, but they can use ketone bodies to a limited extent. Red blood cells lack mitochondria, which contain the enzymes of fatty acid and ketone body oxidation, and can use only glucose as a fuel. Therefore, it is imperative that blood glucose not decrease too rapidly nor fall too low.

$\square$Percy V. has grade I PEM. At his height of 71 inches, his body weight would have to be $>132$ lb to achieve a BMI $>18.5$.

Ann R. has grade III malnutrition. At 67 inches, she needs a body weight $>118 \mathrm{lb}$ to achieve a BMI of 18.5. Degrees of PEM are classified as grades I, II, and III, according to BMI. Grade I refers to a BMI in the range of 17.0 to 18.4 , grade II to a BMI in the range of 16.0 to 16.9 , and grade III is designated for a BMI $<16.0$.

$\square$Creatinine is usually released from the muscles at a constant rate, and it is proportional to muscle mass. The creatinine is removed from the circulation by the kidneys and appears in the urine. Thus, elevated creatinine in the blood relates to impaired renal function. To measure creatinine in biologic specimens, the jaffe reaction is used. Creatinine is reacted with picric acid in an alkaline solution to form a red-orange product, which can be quantitated via spectrophotometry. To increase specificity, a kinetic jaffe reaction is run and the rate of formation of the product is determined. Creatinine can be measured in plasma, serum, and urine.

FIGURE 3.2 The structure of urea, the highly soluble nitrogen disposal molecule.
Initially, liver glycogen stores are degraded to supply glucose to the blood, but these stores are limited. This pathway is known as glycogenolysis (the lysis, or splitting, of glycogen, to form glucose subunits). Although liver glycogen levels may increase to 200 to 300 g after a meal, only approximately 80 g remain after an overnight fast. Fortunately, the liver has another mechanism for producing blood glucose, known as gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis means formation (genesis) of new (neo) glucose and, by definition, converts new (noncarbohydrate) precursors to glucose. In gluconeogenesis, lactate, glycerol, and amino acids are used as carbon sources to synthesize glucose. As fasting continues, gluconeogenesis progressively adds to the glucose produced by glycogenolysis in the liver.

Lactate is a product of glycolysis in red blood cells and exercising muscle, glycerol is obtained from lipolysis of adipose triacylglycerols, and amino acids are generated by the breakdown of protein. Because our muscle mass is so large, most of the amino acid is supplied from degradation of muscle protein. These compounds travel in the blood to the liver, where they are converted to glucose by gluconeogenesis. Because the nitrogen of the amino acids can form ammonia, which is toxic to the body, the liver converts this nitrogen to urea. Urea has two amino groups for just one carbon (Fig. 3.2). It is a very soluble, nontoxic compound that can be readily excreted by the kidneys and thus is an efficient means for disposing of excess ammonia.

As fasting progresses, gluconeogenesis becomes increasingly more important as a source of blood glucose. After a day or so of fasting, liver glycogen stores are depleted and gluconeogenesis is the only source of blood glucose.

## B. Role of Adipose Tissue during Fasting

Adipose triacylglycerols are the major source of energy during fasting. They supply fatty acids, which are quantitatively the major fuel for the human body. Fatty acids are oxidized not only directly by various tissues of the body, but they are also partially oxidized in the liver to four-carbon products called ketone bodies. Ketone bodies are subsequently oxidized as a fuel by other tissues.

As blood insulin levels decrease and blood glucagon levels rise, adipose triacylglycerols are mobilized by a process known as lipolysis (lysis of triacylglycerol). They are converted to fatty acids and glycerol, which enter the blood.

It is important to recognize that most fatty acids cannot provide carbon for gluconeogenesis. Thus, of the vast store of food energy in adipose tissue triacylglycerols, only the small glycerol portion travels to the liver to enter the gluconeogenic pathway.

Fatty acids serve as a fuel for muscle, kidney, and most other tissues. They are oxidized to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and subsequently to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in the TCA cycle, producing energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In addition to the ATP required to maintain cellular integrity, muscle uses ATP for contraction and the kidney uses it for urinary transport processes.

Most of the fatty acids that enter the liver are converted to ketone bodies rather than being completely oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The process of conversion of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA produces a considerable amount of energy (ATP), which drives the reactions of the liver under these conditions. The acetyl-CoA is converted to the ketone bodies acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, which are released into the blood (Fig. 3.3).

The liver lacks an enzyme required for ketone body oxidation. However, ketone bodies can be further oxidized by most other cells with mitochondria, such as muscle and kidney. In these tissues, acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate are converted to acetyl-CoA and then oxidized in the TCA cycle, with subsequent generation of ATP.

## C. Summary of the Metabolic Changes during a Brief Fast

In the initial stages of fasting, stored fuels are used for energy (see Fig. 3.1). The liver plays a key role by maintaining blood glucose levels in the range of 80 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, first by glycogenolysis (Fig. 3.1, circle 2) and subsequently by gluconeogenesis (Fig. 3.1, circles 9, 11, and 12). Lactate, glycerol, and amino acids serve as carbon sources for gluconeogenesis. Amino acids are supplied by muscle (via proteolysis, lysis of proteins to individual amino acids). Their nitrogen is converted in the liver to urea (Fig. 3.1, circle 10), which is excreted by the kidneys.

Fatty acids, which are released from adipose tissue by the process of lipolysis (Fig. 3.1, circle 5), serve as the body's major fuel during fasting. The liver oxidizes most of its fatty acids only partially, converting them to ketone bodies (Fig. 3.1, circle 7), which are released into the blood. Thus, during the initial stages of fasting, blood levels of fatty acids and ketone bodies begin to increase. Muscle uses fatty acids, ketone bodies (Fig. 3.1, circles 6 and 8), and (when exercising and while supplies last) glucose from muscle glycogen. Many other tissues use either fatty acids or ketone bodies. However, red blood cells, the brain, and other neural tissues use mainly glucose (Fig. 3.1, circles 3 and 4). The metabolic capacities of different tissues with respect to pathways of fuel metabolism are summarized in Table 3.1.

## II. Metabolic Changes during Prolonged Fasting

If the pattern of fuel use that occurs during a brief fast were to persist for an extended period, the body's protein would be quite rapidly consumed to the point at which critical functions would be compromised. Fortunately, metabolic changes occur during prolonged fasting that conserve (spare) muscle protein by causing muscle protein turnover to decrease. Figure 3.4 shows the main features of metabolism during prolonged fasting (starvation).

PercyV, had not eaten much on his first day of hospitalization. His fasting blood glucose determined on the morning of his second day of hospitalization was $72 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (normal, overnight fasting $=80$ to 100 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Thus, in spite of his malnutrition and his overnight fast, his blood glucose was being maintained at nearly normal levels through gluconeogenesis using amino acid precursors. If his blood glucose had decreased to $<50$ to $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ during fasting, his brain would have been unable to absorb glucose fast enough to obtain the glucose needed for energy and neurotransmitter synthesis, resulting in coma and eventual death. Although many other tissues, such as red blood cells, are also totally or partially dependent on glucose for energy, they are able to function at lower concentrations of blood glucose than is the brain.
(2)On his second day of hospitalization, Percy V's serum ketone body level was $110 \mu \mathrm{M}$ (normal value after a 12-hour fast is $\sim 70 \mu \mathrm{M}$ ). No ketone bodies were detectable in his urine. At this early stage of PEM, Mr.V. still has remaining fat stores. After 12 hours of fasting, most of his tissues are using fatty acids as a major fuel and the liver is beginning to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids. As these ketone bodies increase in the blood, their use as a fuel will increase.

FIGURE 3.3 The ketone bodies $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone. $\beta$-Hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate are formed in the liver. Acetone is produced by nonenzymatic decarboxylation of acetoacetate. However, acetone is expired in the breath and is not metabolized to a significant extent in the body, whereas $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate are used by muscle and the nervous system as an energy source.

The liver synthesizes several serum proteins and releases them into the blood. The synthesis of these proteins decreases during protein malnutrition, leading to a decrease in their concentration in the blood. Two of these serum proteins, albumin and prealbumin (a liver-derived protein that transports thyroid hormone), are often measured to assess the state of protein malnutrition. A measurement of serum albumin levels is the traditional standard used to assess protein malnutrition, but serum albumin levels respond slowly to changes in protein status because of its relatively long half-life of 14 to 20 days. Prealbumin, however, has a half-life of 2 to 3 days and its levels are a more sensitive indicator of changes in protein status. Neither measurement is specific for protein malnutrition. Serum albumin and prealbumin levels decrease with hepatic disease (although prealbumin levels are less affected by liver disease than are albumin levels), certain renal diseases, surgery, and several other conditions, in addition to protein malnutrition. Percy V.5 values were below the normal range for both of these proteins, indicating that his muscle mass was unable to supply sufficient amino acids to sustain both gluconeogenesis and the synthesis of serum proteins by the liver.

Ann R.'s admission laboratory studies revealed a blood glucose level of $65 \mathrm{mg} /$ d. (normal fasting blood glucose $=80$ to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). If checked, her serum ketone body concentration would be elevated and her urine ketones would be positive. In her starved state, ketone body use by her brain instead of glucose is helping to conserve protein in her muscles and vital organs.

## A. Role of Liver during Prolonged Fasting

After 3 to 5 days of fasting, when the body enters the starved state, muscle decreases its use of ketone bodies and depends mainly on fatty acids for its fuel. The liver, however, continues to convert fatty acids to ketone bodies. The result is that the concentration of ketone bodies rises in the blood (Fig. 3.5). The brain begins to take up these ketone bodies from the blood and to oxidize them for energy. Therefore, the brain needs less glucose than it did after an overnight fast (Table 3.2).

Glucose is still required, however, as an energy source for red blood cells, and the brain continues to use a limited amount of glucose, which it oxidizes for energy and uses as a source of carbon for the synthesis of neurotransmitters. Overall, however, glucose is "spared" (conserved). Less glucose is used by the body, and therefore, the liver needs to produce less glucose per hour during prolonged fasting than during shorter periods of fasting.

Because the stores of glycogen in the liver are depleted by approximately 30 hours of fasting, gluconeogenesis is the only process by which the liver can supply glucose to the blood if fasting continues. The amino acid pool, produced by the breakdown of protein, continues to serve as a major source of carbon for gluconeogenesis. A fraction of this amino acid pool is also used for biosynthetic functions (e.g., synthesis of heme and neurotransmitters) and new protein synthesis, processes that must continue during fasting. However, as a result of the decreased rate of gluconeogenesis during prolonged fasting, protein is "spared"; less protein is degraded to supply amino acids for gluconeogenesis.

While converting amino acid carbon to glucose in gluconeogenesis, the liver also converts the nitrogen of these amino acids to urea. Consequently, because glucose production decreases during prolonged fasting compared with early fasting, urea production also decreases.

## B. Role of Adipose Tissue during Prolonged Fasting

During prolonged fasting, adipose tissue continues to break down its triacylglycerol stores, providing fatty acids and glycerol to the blood. These fatty acids serve as the major source of fuel for the body. The glycerol is converted to glucose, whereas the fatty acids are oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ by tissues such as muscle. In the liver, fatty

acids are converted to ketone bodies that are oxidized by many tissues, including the brain.

Several factors determine how long we can fast and still survive. The amount of adipose tissue is one factor because adipose tissue supplies the body with its major source of fuel. However, body protein levels can also determine the length of time we can fast. Glucose is still used during prolonged fasting (starvation) but in significantly reduced amounts. Although we degrade protein to supply amino acids for gluconeogenesis at a slower rate during starvation than during the first days of a fast, we are still losing protein that serves vital functions for our tissues. Protein can become so depleted that the heart, kidney, and other vital tissues stop functioning, or we can develop an infection and not have adequate reserves to mount an

Death by starvation occurs with loss of roughly $40 \%$ of body weight, when approximately $30 \%$ to $50 \%$ of body protein, or $70 \%$ to $95 \%$ of body fat stores, has been lost. Generally, this occurs at BMI of approximately 13 for men and II for women.

Creatinine-height index. The most widely used biochemical marker for estimating body muscle mass is the 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion. Creatinine is a degradation product formed in active muscle at a constant rate, in proportion to the amount of muscle tissue present in a patient. In a protein-malnourished individual, urinary creatinine will decrease in proportion to the decrease in muscle mass. To assess depletion of muscle mass, the amount of creatinine excreted is expressed relative to the height of the patient, yielding a CHI. The amount of creatinine (in milligrams) excreted by the subject in 24 hours is divided by the amount of creatinine excreted by a normal, healthy subject of the same height and sex. The resulting ratio is multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage. Percy V's CHI was $85 \%$ ( $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of normal indicates a mild deficit, $60 \%$ to $80 \%$ of normal indicates a moderate deficit, and $<60 \%$ of normal indicates a severe deficit of muscle mass).
immune response. In addition to fuel problems, we are also deprived of the vitamin and mineral precursors of coenzymes and other compounds necessary for tissue function. Because of either a lack of ATP or a decreased intake of electrolytes, the electrolyte composition of the blood or cells could become incompatible with life. Ultimately, we die of starvation.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Percy V. As a result of his severely suppressed appetite for food, Percy V, developed a mild degree (grade I) of PEM. When prolonged, this type of protein malnutrition can cause changes in the villi of the small intestine that reduce its absorptive capacity for what little food is ingested.

Despite his insufficient intake of dietary carbohydrates, Mr. V.'s blood glucose level was $72 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, close to the lower limit $(80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$ of the normal range for a well-nourished, healthy person after a 12-hour fast. This is the finding you would expect; it reflects the liver's capacity to maintain adequate levels of blood glucose by means of gluconeogenesis, even during prolonged and moderately severe caloric restriction. Amino acids from degradation of protein, principally in skeletal muscle, supply most of the precursors for gluconeogenesis.

Percy V. had several indicators of his protein malnutrition: His serum albumin and prealbumin levels were below normal, his MUAMC was at the 12th percentile, and his CHI was at $85 \%$. The low levels of serum proteins reflect a low dietary protein intake and possibly diminished capacity to absorb dietary amino acids. Consequently, amino acids were being mobilized from degradation of protein in muscle and other tissues to supply precursors for new protein synthesis as well as gluconeogenesis. The result was a loss of muscle mass, indicated by the MUAMC and the CHI, and decreased levels of serum proteins.

Fatty acids mobilized from adipose tissue are the major source of energy for most tissues. Because Percy was eating, and not in total starvation, his ketone bodies were only moderately elevated in the blood ( $110 \mu \mathrm{M}$ vs. normal of $70 \mu \mathrm{M}$ ) and did not appear in the urine.

Percy had several psychological counseling sessions as well as several discussions with a registered dietitian to help him improve and maintain his nutrient uptake. The dietitian suggested that Percy add nutritional drinks (such as Boost [Nestlé S.A., Vevey, Switzerland], Ensure [Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, Illinois], or an instant breakfast drink) to provide essential nutrients. Percy was advised that small frequent feedings (three meals and two snacks) can provide adequate calories, proteins, and other nutrients throughout the day. The dietitian also suggested that Percy (1) use frozen dinners in combination with a fresh salad and a glass of milk and (2) engage in physical activity to enhance mood and increase appetite.

After several psychological counseling sessions, and the promise of an extended visit from his grandchild, Mr. V. resumed his normal eating pattern.

Ann R. Ann R. meets the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. She has low body weight with continual fear of gaining weight. Patients with anorexia nervosa also have body image disturbance or a lack of recognition of the seriousness of their illness.
Amenorrhea (lack of menses) usually develops during anorexia nervosa and other conditions when a woman's body fat content falls to approximately $22 \%$ of her total body weight. The immediate cause of amenorrhea is a reduced production of the gonadotropic protein hormones (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) by the anterior pituitary; the connection between this hormonal change and body fat content is not yet understood.

Ms. R. is suffering from the consequences of prolonged and severe protein and caloric restriction. Fatty acids, released from adipose tissue by lipolysis, are being converted to ketone bodies in the liver, and the level of ketone bodies in the blood

can be extremely elevated. The fact that her kidneys are excreting ketone bodies can be reflected in a positive urine test for ketone bodies.

Although Ms. R.'s blood glucose is below the normal fasting range ( $65 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ vs. normal of $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), she is experiencing only a moderate degree of hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) despite her severe, near-starvation diet. Her blood glucose level reflects the ability of the brain to use ketone bodies as a fuel when they are elevated in the blood, thereby decreasing the amount of glucose that must be synthesized from amino acids provided by protein degradation.

Ms. R.'s BMI showed that she is close to death through starvation (grade III PEM). She was therefore hospitalized and placed on enteral nutrition (nutrients provided through tube feeding). The general therapeutic plan, outlined in Chapter 1, of nutritional restitution and identification and treatment of those emotional factors leading to the patient's anorectic behavior was continued. She slowly started to eat small amounts of food while hospitalized. As part of Ann's eating disorder team, the dietitian's role included helping the patient to recognize and address disordered eating patterns and guiding Ann to focus on health rather than weight gain. The dietitian also determined the proper amount of calories needed for a slow, gradual weight gain to prevent the complications of refeeding syndrome and devised an individualized eating plan for Ann to reach her target goals.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Clinical Use of Metabolite Measurements in Blood and Urine. When a patient develops a metabolic problem, it is difficult to examine cells to determine the cause. To obtain tissue for metabolic studies, biopsies must be performed. These procedures can be difficult, dangerous, or even impossible, depending on the tissue. Cost is an additional concern. However, both blood and urine can be obtained readily from patients, and measurements of substances in the blood and urine can help in diagnosing a patient's problem. Concentrations of substances that are higher or lower than normal indicate which tissues are malfunctioning. For example, if blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are low, a problem centered in the liver might be suspected because urea is produced in the liver. Conversely, high blood levels of urea suggest that the kidney is not excreting this compound normally. Decreased urinary and blood levels of creatinine indicate diminished production of creatinine by skeletal muscle. However, high blood creatinine levels could indicate an inability of the kidney to excrete creatinine, resulting from renal disease. If high levels of ketone bodies are found in the blood or urine, the patient's metabolic pattern is that of the starved state. If the high levels of ketone bodies are coupled with elevated levels of blood glucose, the problem is most likely a deficiency of insulin; that is, the patient probably has type 1 diabetes (these patients are usually young). Without insulin, fuels are mobilized from tissues rather than being stored.

These relatively easy and inexpensive tests on blood and urine can be used to determine which tissues need to be studied more extensively to diagnose and treat the patient's problem. A solid understanding of fuel metabolism helps in the interpretation of these simple tests.

## KEY CONCEPTS

- During fasting, when blood glucose levels drop, glucagon is released from the $\alpha$-cells of the pancreas. Glucagon signals the liver to use its stored carbohydrate to release glucose into the circulation, primarily for use by the brain and red blood cells.
- After fasting for about 3 days, the liver releases ketone bodies (derived from fat oxidation) as an alternative fuel supply for the brain. Liver glycogen stores are depleted and gluconeogenesis provides glucose to the body.

- Glucagon also signals the fat cells to degrade triacylglycerol, supplying the body with fatty acids for energy and glycerol for gluconeogenesis.
- The substrates for liver gluconeogenesis are lactate (from the red blood cells), amino acids (from muscle protein degradation), and glycerol.
- In prolonged starvation, the brain can adapt to using ketone bodies for energy, which reduces the body's demand for glucose. This reduces the rate of muscle protein degradation to provide precursors for gluconeogenesis and allows extended survival times under starvation conditions.
- The major disease discussed in this chapter is summarized in Table 3.3.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is A. By 24 hours after a meal, hepatic (liver) gluconeogenesis is the major source of blood glucose because hepatic glycogen stores have been nearly depleted. Muscle and other tissues lack an enzyme necessary to convert glycogen or amino acids to glucose for export (thus, B is incorrect). The liver is the only significant source of blood glucose. Glucose is synthesized in the liver from amino acids (provided by protein degradation), from glycerol (provided by hydrolysis of triacylglycerols in adipose tissue), and from lactate (provided by anaerobic glycolysis in red blood cells and other tissues). Glucose cannot be synthesized from fatty acids or ketone bodies (thus, D and E are incorrect).
2. The answer is A. The liver will produce ketone bodies when fatty acid oxidation is increased, which occurs when glucagon is the predominant hormone (glucagon leads to fatty acid release from the fat cells for oxidation in the liver and muscle). This would be the case in an individual who cannot produce insulin and is not taking insulin injections. However, in this situation, the ketone bodies are not being used by the nervous system (brain) because of the high levels of glucose in the circulation. This leads to severely elevated ketone levels because of non-use. The glucose is high because, in the absence of insulin, muscle and fat cells are not using the glucose in circulation as an energy source. Recall that although the liver produces ketone bodies, it lacks a necessary
enzyme to use ketone bodies as an energy source. There is no relation between BUN levels and the rate of ketone body production. The muscle reduces its use of ketone bodies under these conditions but not its use of fatty acids.
3. The answer is C. The major change during prolonged fasting is that as muscles decrease their use of ketone bodies, ketone bodies increase enormously in the blood and are used by the brain as a fuel. However, even during starvation, glucose is still required by the brain, which cannot oxidize fatty acids to an appreciable extent (thus, D is incorrect). Red blood cells can use only glucose as a fuel (thus, B is incorrect). Because the brain, red blood cells, and certain other tissues are glucosedependent, the liver continues to synthesize glucose, and blood glucose levels are maintained at only slightly less than fasting levels (thus, A is incorrect). Adipose tissue stores ( $\sim 135,000 \mathrm{kcal}$ ) are not depleted in a wellnourished individual after 1 week of fasting (thus, E is incorrect).
4. The answer is A. Decreased serum albumin could have several causes, including hepatic disease, which decreases the ability of the liver to synthesize serum proteins; protein malnutrition; marasmus; or diseases that affect the ability of the intestine to digest protein and absorb amino acids. However, his BMI is in the healthy weight range (thus, B and D are incorrect). His normal

CHI indicates that he has not lost muscle mass and is therefore not suffering from protein malnutrition (thus, B, C, D, and E are incorrect).
5. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. His protein intake of 150 calories is about 37 g of protein ( 150 calories $\div 4$ calories $/ \mathrm{g}=37 \mathrm{~g}$ ), below the RDA of 0.8 g of protein $/ \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight (thus, A is incorrect because Otto weighs $\sim 88 \mathrm{~kg}$ ). His carbohydrate intake of 150 calories is below the glucose requirements of his brain and red blood cells ( $\sim 150 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{day}$; see Chapter 2) (thus, B is incorrect). Therefore, he will be breaking down muscle protein to synthesize glucose for the brain and other glucose-dependent tissues and adipose tissue mass to supply fatty acids for muscle and tissues able to oxidize fatty acids. Because he will be breaking down muscle protein to amino acids and converting the nitrogen from both these amino acids and his dietary amino acids to urea, his nitrogen excretion will be greater than his intake and he will be in negative nitrogen balance (thus, D is incorrect). It is unlikely that he will develop hypoglycemia while he is able to supply gluconeogenic precursors.
6. The answer is B. Blood glucose levels peak approximately 1 hour after eating and return to the fasting range by about 2 hours. If the blood glucose levels remain elevated for an extended period of time, it is an indication of impaired glucose transport (insulin stimulates glucose transport into muscle and adipose tissue). If the blood glucose levels are $<140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ at 2 hours after the test, the result is considered normal. If the levels are between 140 and $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, the patient is considered to have "impaired glucose tolerance." If the levels are $>200 \mathrm{mg} /$ dL after 2 hours, a diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.
7. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Blood glucose levels return to the fasting range about 2 hours after a meal. The decrease in blood glucose causes a decrease in insulin and an increase in glucagon production. Glucagon stimulates the liver to degrade its glycogen stores (glycogenolysis) and release glucose into the bloodstream. If the patient eats another meal within a few hours, the patient returns to the fed state. Glycogenesis is the synthesis of glycogen. While the muscle contains glycogen stores, degradation of muscle glycogen only benefits the muscle; the muscle cannot export glucose to maintain blood glucose levels. Adipose tissue does not contain significant levels of glycogen.
8. The answer is B. After 24 to 48 hours of the fast, the activist's liver has run out of glycogen and all glucose is being produced from gluconeogenesis. The liver is
oxidizing fatty acids as an energy source and producing ketone bodies as an alternative fuel source for the nervous system (brain). Muscle continues to use fatty acids as a fuel source but decreases its use of ketone bodies, thereby raising the blood concentration of ketone bodies. At the higher concentration of ketone bodies in the blood, the brain can use the ketone bodies and does not need as much glucose. Up to $40 \%$ of the brain's energy needs can be met by ketone bodies, but the other $60 \%$ still needs to be met by glucose as an energy source. As the brain uses ketone bodies, the liver can reduce gluconeogenesis, thereby reducing the need for amino acids as precursors and preserving muscle protein. Red blood cells have no mitochondria so they must use glucose only as an energy source (ketone bodies are oxidized in mitochondria). The liver cannot use ketone bodies because it lacks a key enzyme for their degradation, and the heart uses lactate as an energy source along with fatty acids.
9. The answer is $\mathbf{E}$. As blood glucose levels begin to drop, glucagon is released from the pancreas, which stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver. The glucose produced from liver glycogen is used initially to maintain blood glucose levels during the early stages of a fast. Gluconeogenesis will kick in later because this process requires more energy than glycogenolysis, and fatty acid oxidation must be under way before glucose can be produced from lactate, glycerol, and amino acids. Ketone bodies will not be evident after initiating a fast (the levels of ketones will not be significant until 24 to 48 hours after a fast is initiated). Significant protein degradation will not occur until the liver runs out of glycogen, about 24 to 36 hours after the start of the fast (and without protein degradation, urea synthesis will remain normal). The red blood cells will still be metabolizing glucose, so blood lactate levels (the end product of red cell glucose metabolism) will remain relatively constant.
10. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. As a fast increases in length, the liver will begin to produce ketone bodies from the oxidation of fatty acids obtained from the adipocyte. As the ketone bodies are released from the liver, the brain will begin to use them, reducing its need for glucose by approximately $40 \%$. This, in turn, reduces the need of the liver to produce glucose by gluconeogenesis (recall that glycogen stores are depleted by 36 hours of the fast), which, in turn, reduces the rate of protein degradation in the muscle. The overall effect is to spare muscle protein for as long as possible.

# Chemical and Biologic Foundations of Biochemistry 

The discipline of biochemistry developed as chemists began to study the molecules of cells, tissues, and body fluids and physicians began to look for the molecular basis of various diseases. Today, the practice of medicine depends on understanding the roles and interactions of the enormous number of different chemicals that enable our bodies to function. The task is less overwhelming if one knows the properties, nomenclature, and functions of classes of compounds, such as carbohydrates and enzymes. The intent of this section is to review some of this information in a context relevant to medicine. Students enter medical school with different scientific backgrounds, and some of the information in this section will therefore be familiar to many students.

We begin by discussing the relationship of metabolic acids and buffers to blood pH in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 focuses on the nomenclature, structure, and some of the properties of the major classes of compounds found in the human body. The structure of a molecule determines its function and its fate, and the common name of a compound can often tell you something about its structure.

Proteins are linear chains of amino acids that fold into complex threedimensional structures. They function in the maintenance of cellular and tissue structure and the transport and movement of molecules. Some proteins are enzymes, which are catalysts that enormously increase the rate of chemical reactions in the body. Chapters 6 and 7 describe the amino acids and their interactions within proteins that provide proteins with a flexible and functional three-dimensional structure. Chapters 8 and 9 describe the properties, functions, and regulation of enzymes.

Our proteins and other compounds function within a specialized environment defined by their location in cells or body fluids. Their ability to function is partially dependent on membranes that restrict the free movement of molecules. Chapter 10 includes a brief review of the components of cells, their organization into subcellular organelles, and the manner in which various types of molecules move into cells and between compartments within a cell.

In a complex organism such as a human, different cell types carry out different functions. This specialization of function requires cells to communicate with each other. One of the ways they communicate is through secretion of chemical messengers that carry a signal to another cell. In Chapter 11, we consider some of the principles of cell signaling and describe some of the chemical messenger systems.

Both in this book and in medical practice, you will need to interconvert different units used for the weight and size of compounds and for their concentration in blood and other fluids. Table II. 1 provides definitions of some of the units used for these interconversions.

The nomenclature used to describe patients may include the name of a class of compounds. For example, a patient with diabetes mellitus who has hyperglycemia has hyper (h:gh) concentrations of carbohydrates (glyc) in her blood (emia).

(1)From a biochemist's point of view, most metabolic diseases are caused by enzymes and other proteins that malfunction, and the pharmacologic drugs used to treat these diseases correct that malfunction. For example, individuals with atherosclerosis, who have elevated blood cholesterol levels, are treated with a drug that inhibits an enzyme in the pathway for cholesterol synthesis. Even a bacterial infection can be considered a disease of protein function, if one considers the bacterial toxins that are proteins, the enzymes in our cells affected by these toxins, and the proteins involved in the immune response when we try to destroy these bacteria.
