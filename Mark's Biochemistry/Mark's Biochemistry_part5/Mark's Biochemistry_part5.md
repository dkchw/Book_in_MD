# Carbohydrate Metabolism, Fuel Oxidation, and the Generation of Adenosine Triphosphate 

Glucose is central to all of metabolism. It is the universal fuel for human cells and the source of carbon for the synthesis of most other compounds. Every human cell type uses glucose to obtain energy. The release of insulin and glucagon by the pancreas aids in the body's use and storage of glucose. Other dietary sugars (mainly fructose and galactose) are converted to glucose or to intermediates of glucose metabolism.

Glucose is the precursor for the synthesis of an array of other sugars that are required for the production of specialized compounds such as lactose, cell surface antigens, nucleotides, or glycosaminoglycans. Glucose is also the fundamental precursor of noncarbohydrate compounds; it can be converted to lipids (including fatty acids, cholesterol, and steroid hormones), amino acids, and nucleic acids. Only those compounds that are synthesized from vitamins, essential amino acids, and essential fatty acids cannot be synthesized from glucose in humans.

All physiologic processes in living cells require energy transformation. Cells convert the chemical bond energy in foods into other forms, such as an electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane, or the movement of muscle fibers in an arm, or assembly of complex molecules such as DNA. These energy transformations can be divided into three principal phases: (1) oxidation of fuels (fat, carbohydrate, and protein), (2) conversion of energy from fuel oxidation into the high-energy phosphate bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and (3) use of ATP phosphate bond energy to drive energy-requiring processes.

More than $40 \%$ of the calories in the typical diet in the United States are obtained from starch, sucrose, and lactose. These dietary carbohydrates are converted to glucose, galactose, and fructose in the digestive tract (Fig. IV.1). Monosaccharides are absorbed from the intestine, enter the blood, and travel to the tissues, where they are metabolized.

After glucose is transported into cells, it is phosphorylated by a hexokinase to form glucose 6-phosphate. Glucose 6-phosphate can then enter a number of metabolic pathways. The three that are common to all cell types are glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and glycogen synthesis (Fig. IV.2). In tissues, fructose and galactose are converted to intermediates of glucose metabolism. Thus, the fate of these sugars parallels that of glucose (Fig. IV.3).

The major fate of glucose 6-phosphate is oxidation via the pathway of glycolysis (see Chapter 22), which provides a source of ATP (the major energy currency of the cell) for all cell types. Cells that lack mitochondria cannot oxidize other fuels. They produce ATP from anaerobic glycolysis (the conversion of glucose to lactic acid). Cells that contain mitochondria oxidize glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ via glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Fig. IV.4). Some tissues, such as the brain, depend on the oxidation of glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ for energy because they have a limited capacity to use other fuels.

ATP requires electron transfer through components of the inner mitochondrial membrane known as the electron-transport chain (ETC).

Glucose produces the intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA cycle that are used for the synthesis of amino acids and both the glycerol and fatty acid moieties of triacylglycerols (Fig. IV.5).

Another important fate of glucose 6-phosphate is oxidation via the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The reducing equivalents of NADPH are used for biosynthetic reactions and for the prevention of oxidative damage to cells (see Chapter 25). In this pathway, glucose undergoes oxidation and decarboxylation to five-carbon sugars (pentoses), which may reenter the glycolytic pathway. They also may be used for nucleotide synthesis (Fig. IV.6). There are also nonoxidative reactions, which can interconvert six- and five-carbon sugars.

Glucose 6-phosphate is also converted to UDP-glucose, which has many functions in the cell (Fig. IV.7). The major fate of UDP-glucose is the synthesis of glycogen, the storage polymer of glucose. Although most cells have glycogen to provide emergency supplies of glucose, the largest stores are in muscle and liver. Muscle glycogen is used to generate ATP during muscle contraction. Liver glycogen is used to maintain blood glucose during fasting and during exercise or periods of enhanced need. UDP-glucose is also used for the formation of other sugars, and galactose and glucose are interconverted while attached to UDP. UDP-galactose is used for lactose synthesis in the mammary gland. In the liver, UDP-glucose is oxidized to UDP-glucuronate, which is used to convert bilirubin and other toxic compounds to glucuronides for excretion (see Fig. IV.7).

Nucleotide sugars are also used for the synthesis of proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids (see Fig. IV.7). Proteoglycans are major carbohydrate components of the extracellular matrix, cartilage, and extracellular fluids (such as the synovial fluid of joints), and they are discussed in more detail in Chapter 47.

Most extracellular proteins are glycoproteins; that is, they contain covalently attached carbohydrates. For cell membrane glycoproteins and for glycolipids, the carbohydrate portion extends into the extracellular space.

All cells are continuously supplied with glucose under normal circumstances; the body maintains a relatively narrow range of glucose concentration in the blood ( $\sim 70$ to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) in spite of the changes in dietary supply and tissue demand as we sleep and exercise. This process is called glucose homeostasis. Low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia) are prevented by a release of glucose from the large glycogen stores in the liver (glycogenolysis); by synthesis of glucose from lactate, glycerol, and amino acids in liver (gluconeogenesis) (Fig. IV.8); and to a limited extent by a release of fatty acids from adipose tissue stores (lipolysis) to provide an alternate fuel when glucose is in short supply. High blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) are prevented both by the conversion of glucose to glycogen and by its conversion to triacylglycerols in liver and adipose tissue. Thus, the pathways for glucose use as a fuel cannot be considered as totally separate from pathways involving amino acid and fatty acid metabolism (Fig. IV.9).

Intertissue balance in the use and storage of glucose during fasting and feeding is accomplished principally by the actions of the hormones of metabolic homeostasis-insulin and glucagon (Fig. IV.10). However, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and other hormones are also involved in intertissue adjustments of supply and demand in response to changes of physiologic state.

The oxidation of our food is an energy-generating process. The first two phases of energy transformation are part of cellular respiration, the overall process of using $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and energy derived from oxidizing fuels to generate ATP. We need to breathe principally because our cells require $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to generate adequate amounts of ATP from the oxidation of fuels to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Cellular respiration uses $>90 \%$ of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ we inhale.

In phase 1 of respiration, energy is conserved from fuel oxidation by enzymes that transfer electrons from the fuels to the electron-accepting coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are reduced to NADH and FAD(2H), respectively (Fig. IV.11). The pathways for the oxidation of most fuels (glucose, fatty acids, ketone bodies, and many amino acids) converge in the generation of the activated 2-carbon acetyl group in acetyl

coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). The complete oxidation of the acetyl group to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ occurs in the TCA cycle, which collects the energy mostly as NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$.

In phase 2 of cellular respiration, the energy derived from fuel oxidation is converted to the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP by the process of oxidative phosphorylation (see Fig. IV.11). Electrons are transferred from NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by the ETC, a series of electron-transfer proteins that are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Oxidation of NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ generates an electrochemical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane in the form of a transmembrane proton gradient $(\Delta \mathrm{p})$. This electrochemical potential drives the synthesis of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ by a transmembrane enzyme called ATP synthase (or $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPase).

FIGURE IV. 10 Pathways regulated by the release of glucagon (in response to a lowering of blood glucose levels) and insulin (released in response to an elevation of blood glucose levels).

FIGURE IV.I2 Oxidative metabolism in mitochondria. The inner mitochondrial membrane forms infoldings, called cristae, which enclose the mitochondrial matrix. Most of the enzymes for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids, and for mitochondrial DNA synthesis are found in the matrix. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and the protein complexes of the electron-transport chain are embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The outer mitochondrial membrane is permeable to small ions, but the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to almost all molecules.

In phase 3 of cellular respiration, the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP are used for processes such as muscle contraction (mechanical work), maintaining low intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentrations (transport work), synthesis of larger molecules such as DNA in anabolic pathways (biosynthetic work), or detoxification (biochemical work). As a consequence of these processes, ATP is either directly or indirectly hydrolyzed to ADP and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$, or to AMP and pyrophosphate $\left(\mathrm{PP}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$.

Cellular respiration occurs in mitochondria (Fig. IV.12). The mitochondrial matrix, which is the compartment enclosed by the inner mitochondrial membrane, contains almost all of the enzymes for the TCA cycle and oxidation of fatty acids, ketone bodies, and most amino acids. The inner mitochondrial membrane contains the protein complexes of the ETC and ATP synthase, the enzyme complex that generates ATP from ADP and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$. Some of the subunits of these complexes are encoded by mitochondrial DNA, which resides in the matrix. ATP is generated in the matrix, but most of the energy-using processes in the cell occur outside of the mitochondrion. As a consequence, newly generated ATP must be continuously transported to the cytosol by protein transporters in the impermeable inner mitochondrial membrane and by diffusion through pores in the more permeable outer mitochondrial membrane.

The rates of fuel oxidation and ATP use are tightly coordinated through feedback regulation of the ETC and the pathways of fuel oxidation. Thus, if less energy is required for work, more fuel is stored as glycogen or fat in adipose tissue. The basal metabolic rate (BMR), caloric balance, and $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ (the change in Gibbs free energy, which is the amount of energy available to do useful work) are quantitative ways of describing energy requirements and the energy that can be derived from fuel oxidation. The various types of enzyme regulation described in Chapter 9 are all used to regulate the rate of oxidation of different fuels to meet energy requirements.

Fatty acids are a major fuel in the body. After eating, we store excess fatty acids and carbohydrates that are not oxidized as fat (triacylglycerols) in adipose tissue. Between meals, these fatty acids are released and circulate in blood

bound to albumin. In muscle, liver, and other tissues, fatty acids are oxidized to acetyl-CoA in the pathway of $\beta$-oxidation. NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ generated from $\beta$-oxidation are reoxidized by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the ECT, thereby generating ATP (see Fig. IV.11). Small amounts of certain fatty acids are oxidized through other pathways that convert them to either oxidizable fuels or urinary excretion products (e.g., peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation).

Not all acetyl-CoA generated from $\beta$-oxidation enters the TCA cycle. In the liver, acetyl-CoA generated from $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids can also be converted to the ketone bodies acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate. Ketone bodies are taken up by muscle and other tissues, which convert them back to acetyl-CoA for oxidation in the TCA cycle. They become a major fuel for the brain during prolonged fasting. The discussion of fatty acid oxidation and ketone body production occurs in Section V of this text.

Amino acids derived from dietary or body proteins are also potential fuels that can be oxidized to acetyl-CoA or converted to glucose and then oxidized (see Fig. IV.11). These oxidation pathways, like those of fatty acids, generate NADH or $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$. Ammonia, which can be formed during amino acid oxidation, is toxic. It is therefore converted to urea in the liver and excreted in the urine. There are more than 20 different amino acids, each with a somewhat different pathway for oxidation of the carbon skeleton and conversion of its nitrogen to urea. Because of the complexity of amino acid metabolism, use of amino acids as fuels is considered separately in Section VII, Tissue Metabolism.

Glucose is a universal fuel used to generate ATP in every cell type in the body (Fig. IV.13). In glycolysis, 1 mole of glucose is converted to 2 moles of pyruvate and 2 moles of NADH by cytosolic enzymes. Small amounts of ATP are generated when high-energy pathway intermediates transfer phosphate to ADP in a process termed substrate-level phosphorylation. In aerobic glycolysis, the NADH produced from glycolysis is reoxidized by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ via the ETC, and pyruvate enters the TCA cycle. In anaerobic glycolysis, the NADH is reoxidized by conversion of pyruvate to lactate, which enters the blood. Although anaerobic glycolysis has a low ATP yield, it is important for tissues with a low oxygen supply and few mitochondria (e.g., the kidney medulla) or for tissues that are experiencing diminished blood flow (ischemia).

All cells continuously use ATP and require a constant supply of fuels to provide energy for the generation of ATP. Chapters 1 through 3 of this text outlined the basic patterns of fuel use in humans and provided information about dietary components.

The pathologic consequences of metabolic problems in fuel oxidation can be grouped into one of two categories: (1) lack of a required product or (2) excess of a substrate or pathway intermediate. The product of fuel oxidation is ATP, and an inadequate rate of ATP production occurs under a wide variety of medical conditions. Extreme conditions that interfere with ATP generation from oxidative phosphorylation, such as complete oxygen deprivation (anoxia) or cyanide poisoning, are fatal. A myocardial infarction is caused by a lack of adequate blood flow to regions of the heart (ischemia), thereby depriving cardiomyocytes of oxygen and fuel. Hyperthyroidism is associated with excessive heat generation from fuel oxidation, and in hypothyroidism, ATP generation can decrease to a fatal level. Conditions such as malnutrition, anorexia nervosa, or excessive alcohol consumption may decrease availability of thiamin, $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$, and other vitamins and minerals required by the enzymes of fuel oxidation. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA result in deficient ATP generation from oxidative metabolism.

In contrast, problems arising from an excess of substrate or fuel are seen in diabetes mellitus, which may result in a potentially fatal ketoacidosis. Lactic acidosis occurs with a reduction in oxidative metabolism.

FIGURE 19.1 Maintenance of fuel supplies to tissues. Glucagon release activates the pathways shown. ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

## Basic Concepts in the Regulation of Fuel Metabolism by Insulin, Glucagon, and Other Hormones

All cells use adenosine triphosphate (ATP) continuously and require a constant supply of fuels to provide energy for ATP generation. Insulin and glucagon are the two major hormones that regulate fuel mobilization and storage. Their function is to ensure that cells have a constant source of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids for ATP generation and for cellular maintenance (Fig. 19.1).

Because most tissues are partially or totally dependent on glucose for generation of ATP and for production of precursors of other pathways, insulin and glucagon maintain blood glucose levels near 80 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(90 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ is the same as 5 mM ) despite the fact that carbohydrate intake varies considerably over the course of a day. The maintenance of constant blood glucose levels (glucose homeostasis) requires these two hormones to regulate carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism in accordance with the needs and capacities of individual tissues. Basically, the dietary intake of all fuels in excess of immediate need is stored, and the appropriate fuel is mobilized when a demand occurs. For example, when dietary glucose is not available to cells in sufficient quantities, fatty acids are mobilized and used by skeletal muscle as a fuel (see Chapters 2 and 30). Under these circumstances, the liver can also convert fatty acids to ketone bodies that can be used by the brain. The fatty acids that are mobilized under these conditions spare glucose for use by the brain and other glucose-dependent tissues (such as red blood cells).

Insulin and glucagon are important for the regulation of fuel storage and fuel mobilization (Fig. 19.2). Insulin, released from the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas in response to carbohydrate ingestion, promotes glucose use as a fuel and glucose storage as fat and glycogen. Insulin, therefore, is a major anabolic hormone. In addition to its storage function, insulin increases protein synthesis and cell growth. Blood insulin levels decrease as glucose is taken up by tissues and used. Glucagon, the major insulin counterregulatory hormone, is decreased in response to a carbohydrate meal and elevated during fasting. Its concentration in the blood increases as circulating levels of glucose fall, a response that promotes glucose production via glycogenolysis (glycogen degradation) and gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis from amino acids and other noncarbohydrate precursors). Increased levels of circulating glucagon relative to insulin also stimulate the mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue. Epinephrine (the fight-or-flight hormone) and cortisol (a glucocorticoid released from the adrenal cortex in response to fasting and chronic stress) have effects on fuel metabolism that oppose those of insulin. Therefore, epinephrine and cortisol are considered to be insulin counterregulatory hormones.

Insulin and glucagon are polypeptide hormones synthesized as prohormones in the pancreatic $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ - and $\alpha$-cells, respectively. Proinsulin is cleaved into mature insulin and a connection peptide (C-peptide) in storage vesicles and precipitated with $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$. Insulin secretion is regulated principally by changes in blood glucose levels. Glucagon is also synthesized as a prohormone and cleaved into mature glucagon within storage vesicles. Its release is regulated principally through changes in the level of glucose and insulin bathing the $\alpha$-cells located in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans.

Glucagon exerts its effects on cells by binding to a receptor located on the plasma membrane of target cells for this hormone. The binding to these specific receptors by glucagon stimulates the synthesis of the intracellular second messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (Fig. 19.3). cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates key regulatory enzymes, thereby activating some while inhibiting others. Insulin, on the other hand, promotes the dephosphorylation of these key enzymes, leading to their activation or deactivation, depending on the enzyme. Changes of cAMP levels also induce or repress the synthesis of several enzymes.

Insulin binds to a receptor on the cell surface of insulin-sensitive tissues and initiates a cascade of intracellular events that differs from those stimulated by glucagon. Insulin binding activates both autophosphorylation of the receptor and the phosphorylation of other enzymes by the receptor's tyrosine kinase domain (see Chapter II, Section IIIB.3). The complete routes for signal transduction between this point and the final effects of insulin on the regulatory enzymes of fuel metabolism have not yet been fully established.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Deborah S. returned to her physician for her monthly office visit. She has been seeing her physician for more than a year because of obesity and elevated blood glucose levels. She still weighed 198 lb , despite trying to adhere to her diet. Her blood glucose level at the time of the visit, 2 hours after lunch, was $221 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range $=80$ to $140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Deborah suffers from type 2 diabetes, an impaired response to insulin. Understanding the actions of insulin and glucagon are critical for understanding this disorder.

$\square$Connie C. is a 46-year-old woman who 6 months earlier began noting episodes of fatigue and confusion in the morning before eating and sometimes after jogging. These episodes were occasionally accompanied by blurred vision and an unusually urgent sense of hunger. The ingestion of food relieved all of her symptoms within 25 to 30 minutes. In the last month, these attacks have occurred more frequently throughout the day, and she has learned to diminish their occurrence by eating between meals. As a result, she has recently gained 8 lb .

A random serum glucose level done at 4:30 P.M. during her first office visit was subnormal at $67 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Her physician, suspecting she was having episodes of hypoglycemia, ordered a series of fasting serum glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels. In addition, he asked Connie to keep a careful diary of all of the symptoms that she experienced when her attacks were most severe.

## I. Metabolic Homeostasis

Living cells require a constant source of fuels from which to derive ATP for the maintenance of normal cell function and growth. Therefore, a balance must be achieved among carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake; their rates of oxidation; and their rates of storage when they are present in excess of immediate need. Alternatively, when the demand for these substrates increases, the rate of mobilization from storage sites and the rate of their de novo synthesis also require balanced regulation. The control of the balance between substrate need and substrate availability is referred to as metabolic homeostasis (Fig. 19.4). The intertissue integration required for metabolic homeostasis is achieved in three principal ways:

- The concentration of nutrients or metabolites in the blood affects the rate at which they are used or stored in different tissues.
- Hormones carry messages to their individual tissues about the physiologic state of the body and the nutrient supply or demand.
- The central nervous system uses neural signals to control tissue metabolism, either directly or through the release of hormones.

![ma17181198a6](ma17181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 19.4 Metabolic homeostasis. The balance between fuel availability and the needs of tissues for different fuels is achieved by three types of messages: the level of the fuel or nutrients in the blood, the level of one of the hormones of metabolic homeostasis, or nerve impulses that affect tissue metabolism or the release of hormones.

Fatty acids provide an example of the influence that the level of a compound in the blood has on its own rate of metabolism. The concentration of fatty acids in the blood is the major factor determining whether skeletal muscles will use fatty acids or glucose as a fuel (see Chapter 30). In contrast, hormones are (by definition) intravascular carriers of messages between their sites of synthesis and their target tissues. Epinephrine, for example, is a flight-or-fight hormone that in times of stress signals an immediate need for increased fuel availability. Its level is regulated principally through the activation of the sympathetic nervous system.

Insulin and glucagon, however, are the two major hormones that regulate fuel storage and mobilization (see Fig. 19.2). Insulin is the major anabolic hormone of the body. It promotes the storage of fuels and the use of fuels for growth. Glucagon is the major hormone of fuel mobilization (Fig. 19.5). Other hormones, such as epinephrine, are released as a response of the central nervous system to hypoglycemia, exercise, or other types of physiologic stress. Epinephrine and other stress hormones also increase the availability of fuels (see Fig. 19.5). The major hormones of fuel homeostasis, insulin and glucagon, fluctuate continuously in response to our daily eating pattern.

Glucose has a special role in metabolic homeostasis. Many tissues (e.g., the brain, red blood cells, kidney medulla, exercising skeletal muscle) are dependent on glycolysis for all or a part of their energy needs. As a consequence, these tissues require uninterrupted access to glucose to meet their rapid rate of ATP use. In the adult, a minimum of 190 g glucose is required per day—approximately 150 g for the brain and 40 g for other tissues. Significant decreases of blood glucose $<60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ limit glucose metabolism in the brain and may elicit hypoglycemic symptoms (as experienced by Connie C.), presumably because the overall process of glucose flux through the blood-brain barrier, into the interstitial fluid, and subsequently into the neuronal cells is slow at low blood glucose levels because of the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ values of the glucose transporters required for this to occur (see Chapter 21).

The continuous efflux of fuels from their storage depots—during exercise, for example-is necessitated by the high amounts of fuel required to meet the need for ATP under these conditions. Disastrous results would occur if even a day's

supply of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids could not enter cells normally and were instead left circulating in the blood. Glucose and amino acids would be at such high concentrations in the circulation that the hyperosmolar effect would cause progressively severe neurologic deficits and even coma. The concentration of glucose and amino acids would rise above the renal tubular threshold for these substances (the maximal concentration in the blood at which the kidney can completely resorb metabolites), and some of these compounds would be wasted as they spilled over into the urine. Nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins would increase at higher blood glucose levels, altering the function of tissues in which these proteins reside. Triacylglycerols, present primarily in chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), would rise in the blood, increasing the likelihood of atherosclerotic vascular disease. These potential metabolic derangements emphasize the need to maintain a normal balance between fuel storage and fuel use.

## II. Major Hormones of Metabolic Homeostasis

The hormones that contribute to metabolic homeostasis respond to changes in the circulating levels of fuels that, in part, are determined by the timing and composition of our diet. Insulin and glucagon are considered the major hormone of metabolic homeostasis because they continuously fluctuate in response to our daily eating pattern. They provide good examples of the basic concept of hormonal regulation. Certain features of the release and action of other insulin counterregulatory hormones, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol, will be described and compared with insulin and glucagon.

Insulin is the major anabolic hormone that promotes the storage of nutrients: glucose storage as glycogen in liver and muscle, conversion of glucose to triacylglycerols in liver and their storage in adipose tissue, and amino acid uptake and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle (Fig. 19.6). It also increases the synthesis of albumin and other proteins by the liver. Insulin promotes the use of glucose as a fuel by facilitating its transport into muscle and adipose tissue. At the same time, insulin acts to inhibit fuel mobilization.

0Hyperglycemia may cause a constellation of symptoms such as polyuria and subsequent polydipsia (increased thirst). The inability to move glucose into cells necessitates the oxidation of lipids as an alternative fuel. As a result, adipose stores are used, and a patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus loses weight in spite of a good appetite. Extremely high levels of serum glucose can cause a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Such patients usually have sufficient insulin responsiveness to block fatty acid release and ketone-body formation, but they are unable to significantly stimulate glucose entry into peripheral tissues. The severely elevated levels of glucose in the blood compared with those inside the cell leads to an osmotic effect that causes water to leave the cells and enter the blood. Because of the osmotic diuretic effect of hyperglycemia, the kidney produces more urine, leading to dehydration, which, in turn, may lead to even higher levels of blood glucose. If dehydration becomes severe, further cerebral dysfunction occurs and the patient may become comatose. Chronic hyperglycemia also produces pathologic effects through the nonenzymatic glycosylation of a variety of proteins. Hemoglobin A (HbA), one of the proteins that becomes glycosylated, forms $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 \text { c }}$ (see Chapter 7). Deborah S.'s high levels of $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}(9.5 \%$ of the total HbA, compared with the reference range of $4.7 \%$ to $6.4 \%$ ) indicate that her blood glucose has been significantly elevated over the last 12 to 14 weeks, the half-life of hemoglobin in the bloodstream.

All membrane and serum proteins exposed to high levels of glucose in the blood or interstitial fluid are candidates for nonenzymatic glycosylation. This process distorts protein structure and slows protein degradation, which leads to an accumulation of these products in various organs, thereby adversely affecting organ function. These events contribute to the long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus, which include diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy (microvascular), in addition to coronary artery, cerebral artery, and peripheral artery disease and atherosclerosis (macrovascular).

FIGURE 19.7 Major sites of glucagon action in fuel metabolism. $\oplus$, pathways stimulated by glucagon; $\ominus$, pathways inhibited by glucagon.

Glucagon acts to maintain fuel availability in the absence of dietary glucose by stimulating the release of glucose from liver glycogen (see Chapter 26); by stimulating gluconeogenesis from lactate, glycerol, and amino acids (see Chapter 28); and, in conjunction with decreased insulin, by mobilizing fatty acids from adipose triacylglycerols to provide an alternate source of fuel (see Chapter 30 and Fig. 19.7). Its sites of action are principally the liver and adipose tissue; it has no influence on skeletal muscle metabolism because muscle cells lack glucagon receptors. The message carried by glucagon is that "glucose is gone"; that is, the current supply of glucose is inadequate to meet the immediate fuel requirements of the body.

The release of insulin from the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas is dictated primarily by the level of glucose in the blood bathing the $\beta$-cells in the islets of Langerhans. The highest levels of insulin occur approximately 30 to 45 minutes after a highcarbohydrate meal (Fig. 19.8). They return to basal levels as the blood glucose concentration falls, approximately 2 hours after the meal. The release of glucagon from the $\alpha$-cells of the pancreas, conversely, is controlled principally through a reduction of glucose and/or a rise in the concentration of insulin in the blood bathing the $\alpha$-cells in the pancreas. Therefore, the lowest levels of glucagon occur after a highcarbohydrate meal. Because all of the effects of glucagon are opposed by insulin, the simultaneous stimulation of insulin release and suppression of glucagon secretion by a high-carbohydrate meal provides integrated control of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism.

Insulin and glucagon are not the only regulators of fuel metabolism. The intertissue balance between the use and storage of glucose, fat, and protein is also accomplished by the circulating levels of metabolites in the blood, by neuronal signals, and by the other hormones of metabolic homeostasis (epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and others) (Table 19.1). These hormones oppose the actions of insulin by mobilizing fuels. Like glucagon, they are insulin counterregulatory hormones (Fig. 19.9). Of all these hormones, only insulin and glucagon are synthesized and released in direct response to changing levels of fuels in the blood. The release of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine is mediated by neuronal signals. Rising levels of the insulin counterregulatory hormones in the blood reflect, for the most part, a current increase in the demand for fuel.

## III. Synthesis and Release of Insulin and Glucagon

## A. Endocrine Pancreas

Insulin and glucagon are synthesized in different cell types of the endocrine pancreas, which consists of microscopic clusters of small glands, the islets of Langerhans, scattered among the cells of the exocrine pancreas. The $\alpha$-cells secrete glucagon and the $\beta$-cells secrete insulin into the hepatic portal vein via the pancreatic veins.
![ma22181198a6](ma22181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 19.9 Major insulin counterregulatory hormones. The stress of a low blood glucose level mediates the release of the major insulin counterregulatory hormones through neuronal signals. Hypoglycemia is one of the stress signals that stimulates the release of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is released from the pituitary and stimulates the release of cortisol (a glucocorticoid) from the adrenal cortex. Neuronal signals stimulate the release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla and norepinephrine from nerve endings. Neuronal signals also play a minor role in the release of glucagon. Although norepinephrine has counterregulatory actions, it is not a major counterregulatory hormone.

(1)Connie C.'s studies confirmed that her fasting serum glucose levels were below normal, with an inappropriately high insulin level. She continued to experience the fatigue, confusion, and blurred vision she had described on her first office visit. These symptoms are referred to as the neuroglycopenic manifestations of severe hypoglycemia (neurologic symptoms resulting from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain for the generation of ATP).

Connie also noted the symptoms that are part of the adrenergic response to hypoglycemic stress. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (because of the low levels of glucose reaching the brain) results in the release of epinephrine, a stress hormone, from the adrenal medulla. Elevated epinephrine levels cause tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), palpitations, anxiety, tremulousness, pallor, and sweating.

In addition to the symptoms described by Connie C., individuals may experience confusion, light-headedness, headache, aberrant behavior, blurred vision, loss of consciousness, or seizures. When severe and prolonged, death may occur.

![ma23181198a6](ma23181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 19.10 Cleavage of proinsulin to insulin. Proinsulin is converted to insulin by proteolytic cleavage, which removes the C-peptide and a few additional amino acid residues. Cleavage occurs at the arrows. (From Murray RK, Granner DK, Mayes PA, et al. Harper's Biochemistry. 23rd ed. Stanford, CT:Appleton \& Lange; 1993:560.)

The message that insulin carries to tissues is that glucose is plentiful and can be used as an immediate fuel or can be converted to storage forms such as triacylglycerol in adipocytes or glycogen in liver and muscle.

Because insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose into tissues where it may be immediately oxidized or stored for later oxidation, this regulatory hormone lowers blood glucose levels. Therefore, one of the possible causes of Connie C/s hypoglycemia is an insulinoma, a tumor that produces excessive insulin.

Whenever an endocrine gland continues to release its hormone in spite of the presence of signals that normally would suppress its secretion, this persistent inappropriate release is said to be "autonomous." Secretory neoplasms of endocrine glands generally produce their hormonal product autonomously in a chronic fashion.

## B. Synthesis and Secretion of Insulin

Insulin is a polypeptide hormone. The active form of insulin is composed of two polypeptide chains (the A-chain and the B-chain) linked by two interchain disulfide bonds. The A-chain has an additional intrachain disulfide bond (Fig. 19.10).

Insulin, like many other polypeptide hormones, is synthesized as a preprohormone that is converted in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) to proinsulin. The "pre" sequence, a short hydrophobic signal sequence at the N-terminal end, is cleaved as it enters the lumen of the RER. Proinsulin folds into the proper conformation, and disulfide bonds are formed between the cysteine residues. It is then transported in microvesicles to the Golgi complex. It leaves the Golgi complex in storage vesicles, where a protease removes the biologically inactive "connecting peptide" (C-peptide) and a few small remnants, resulting in the formation of biologically active insulin (see Fig. 19.10). Zinc ions are also transported in these storage vesicles. Cleavage of the C-peptide decreases the solubility of the resulting insulin, which then coprecipitates with zinc. Exocytosis of the insulin storage vesicles from the cytosol of the $\beta$-cell into the blood is stimulated by rising levels of glucose in the blood bathing the $\beta$-cells.

Glucose enters the $\beta$-cell via specific glucose transporter proteins known as GLUT 2 (see Chapter 21). Glucose is phosphorylated through the action of glucokinase to form glucose 6-phosphate, which is metabolized through glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. These reactions result in an increase in ATP levels within the $\beta$-cell (circle 1 in Fig. 19.11). As the $\beta$-cell ATP/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ratio increases, the activity of a membrane-bound, ATP-dependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel $\left(\mathrm{K}^{+}{ }_{\text {ATP }}\right)$ is inhibited (i.e., the channel is closed) (circle 2 in Fig. 19.11). The closing of this channel leads to a membrane depolarization (because the membrane is normally hyperpolarized; see circle 3 in Fig. 19.11), which activates a voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel that allows $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to enter the $\beta$-cell such that intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ levels increase significantly

![ma24181198a6](ma24181198a6.jpg)

(Fig. 19.11, circle 4). The increase in intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stimulates the fusion of insulin-containing exocytotic vesicles with the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin secretion (Fig. 19.11, circle 5). Thus, an increase in glucose levels within the $\beta$-cells initiates insulin release.

Other intracellular metabolites, particularly nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), have been proposed to play important roles in insulin release in response to glucose. This will be discussed further in later chapters.

## C. Stimulation and Inhibition of Insulin Release

The release of insulin occurs within minutes after the pancreas is exposed to a high glucose concentration. The threshold for insulin release is approximately 80 mg of glucose/dL. Above $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, the rate of insulin release is not an all-or-nothing response but is proportional to the glucose concentration up to approximately $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. As insulin is secreted, the synthesis of new insulin molecules is stimulated, so that secretion is maintained until blood glucose levels fall. Insulin is rapidly removed from the circulation and degraded by the liver (and, to a lesser extent, by kidney and skeletal muscle), so blood insulin levels decrease rapidly once the rate of secretion slows.

Several factors other than the blood glucose concentration can modulate insulin release (Table 19.2). The pancreatic islets are innervated by the autonomic nervous system, including a branch of the vagus nerve. These neural signals help to coordinate insulin release with the secretory signals initiated by the ingestion of fuels. However, signals from the central nervous system are not required for insulin secretion.

0Dianne A. has type I diabetes mellitus. This metabolic disorder is usually caused by antibody-mediated (autoimmune) destruction of the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas. Susceptibility to type I diabetes mellitus is, in part, conferred by a genetic defect in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region of $\beta$-cells that codes for the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II). This protein presents an intracellular antigen to the cell surface for "self-recognition" by the cells involved in the immune response. Because of this defective protein, a cell-mediated immune response leads to varying degrees of $\beta$-cell destruction and eventually to dependence on exogenous insulin administration to control the levels of glucose in the blood.

0Autonomous hypersecretion of insulin from a suspected pancreatic $\beta$-cell tumor (an insulinoma) can be demonstrated in several ways. The simplest test is to simultaneously draw blood for the measurement of both glucose and insulin at a time when the patient is spontaneously experiencing the characteristic adrenergic or neuroglycopenic symptoms of hypoglycemia. During such a test, Connie C.'s glucose levels fell to $45 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (normal $=80$ to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), and her ratio of insulin to glucose was far higher than normal. The elevated insulin levels markedly increased glucose uptake by the peripheral tissues, resulting in a dramatic lowering of blood glucose levels. In normal individuals, as blood glucose levels drop, insulin levels also drop. Insulin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay; see the "Biochemical Comments" in Chapter 41 for a description of this method.

A rare form of diabetes known as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) results from mutations in either pancreatic glucokinase or specific nuclear transcription factors. MODY type 2 is caused by a glucokinase mutation that results in an enzyme with reduced activity because of either an elevated $K_{m}$ for glucose or a reduced $V_{\max }$ for the reaction. Because insulin release depends on normal glucose metabolism within the $\beta$-cell that yields a critical ATP/ADP ratio in the $\beta$-cell, individuals with this glucokinase mutation cannot significantly metabolize glucose unless glucose levels are higher than normal. Thus, although these patients can release insulin, they do so at higher than normal glucose levels and are, therefore, almost always in a hyperglycemic state. Interestingly, however, these patients are somewhat resistant to the long-term complications of chronic hyperglycemia. The mechanism for this seeming resistance is not well understood.

Neonatal diabetes is a very rare inherited disorder in which newborns develop diabetes within the first 3 months of life. The diabetes may be permanent, requiring lifelong insulin treatment, or transient. The most common mutation leading to permanent neonatal diabetes is in the KCNJII gene, which encodes a subunit of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}{ }_{\text {ATP }}$ channel in various tissues including the pancreas. This is an activating mutation, which keeps the $\mathrm{K}^{+}{ }_{\text {ATP }}$ channel open, and less susceptible to ATP inhibition. If the $\mathrm{K}^{+}{ }_{\text {ATP }}$ channel cannot be closed, activation of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel will not occur and insulin secretion will be impaired.

Deborah S. is taking a sulfonylurea compound known as glipizide to treat her diabetes. The sulfonylureas act on the $\mathrm{K}^{+}{ }_{\text {ATP }}$ channels on the surface of the pancreatic $\beta$-cells. The $\mathrm{K}^{+}{ }_{\text {ATP }}$ channels contain pore-forming subunits (encoded by the KCNJII gene) and regulatory subunits (the subunit to which sulfonylurea compounds bind, encoded by the ABCC8 gene). The binding of the drug to the sulfonylurea receptor closes $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (as do elevated ATP levels), which, in turn, increases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ movement into the interior of the $\beta$-cell. This influx of calcium modulates the interaction of the insulin storage vesicles with the plasma membrane of the $\beta$-cell, resulting in the release of insulin into the circulation.

Patients have been described who have an activating mutation in the ABCC8 gene (which would make it difficult to close the $\mathrm{K}^{+}{ }_{\text {ATP }}$ channel), and, among other symptoms, the patients displayed neonatal diabetes. Activating mutations in the KCNJII gene also have the same effect.

Certain amino acids also can stimulate insulin secretion, although the amount of insulin released during a high-protein meal is very much lower than that released by a high-carbohydrate meal. Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP-1), gut hormones released after the ingestion of food, also aid in the onset of insulin release. Epinephrine, secreted in response to fasting, stress, trauma, and vigorous exercise, decreases the release of insulin. Epinephrine release signals energy use, which indicates that less insulin needs to be secreted, because insulin stimulates energy storage.

## D. Synthesis and Secretion of Glucagon

Glucagon, a polypeptide hormone, is synthesized in the $\alpha$-cells of the pancreas by cleavage of the much larger preproglucagon, a 160-amino acid peptide. Like insulin, preproglucagon is produced on the RER and is converted to proglucagon as it enters the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteolytic cleavage at various sites produces the mature 29-amino acid glucagon (molecular weight $=3,500 \mathrm{Da}$ ) and larger glucagon-containing fragments (named GLP-1 and GLP-2). Glucagon is rapidly metabolized, primarily in the liver and kidneys. Its plasma half-life is only about 3 to 5 minutes.

Glucagon secretion is regulated principally by circulating levels of glucose and insulin. Increasing levels of each inhibit glucagon release. Glucose probably has both a direct suppressive effect on secretion of glucagon from the $\alpha$-cell as well as an indirect effect, the latter being mediated by its ability to stimulate the release of insulin. The direction of blood flow in the islets of the pancreas carries insulin from the $\beta$-cells in the center of the islets to the peripheral $\alpha$-cells, where it suppresses glucagon secretion.

Conversely, certain hormones stimulate glucagon secretion. Among these are the catecholamines (including epinephrine) and cortisol (Table 19.3).

Many amino acids also stimulate glucagon release (Fig. 19.12). Thus, the high levels of glucagon that would be expected in the fasting state do not decrease after a high-protein meal. In fact, glucagon levels may increase, stimulating gluconeogenesis in the absence of dietary glucose. The relative amounts of insulin and glucagon in the blood after a mixed meal depend on the composition of the meal because glucose stimulates insulin release, and amino acids stimulate glucagon release. However, amino acids also induce insulin secretion but not to the same extent that glucose does. Although this may seem paradoxical, it actually makes good sense. Insulin release stimulates amino acid uptake by tissues and enhances protein synthesis. However, because glucagon levels also increase in response to a protein meal, and the critical factor is the insulin-to-glucagon ratio, sufficient glucagon is released that gluconeogenesis is enhanced (at the expense of protein synthesis), and the amino acids that are taken up by the tissues serve as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. The synthesis of glycogen and triglycerides is also reduced when glucagon levels rise in the blood.

FIGURE 19.12 Release of insulin and glucagon in response to a high-protein meal. This figure shows the increase in the release of insulin and glucagon into the blood after an overnight fast followed by the ingestion of 100 g of protein (equivalent to a slice of roast beef). Insulin levels do not increase nearly as much as they do after a high-carbohydrate meal (see Fig. 19.8). The levels of glucagon, however, significantly increase above those present in the fasting state.

In fasting subjects, the average level of immunoreactive glucagon in the blood is $75 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ and does not vary as much as insulin during the daily fasting-feeding cycle. However, only $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ of the measured immunoreactive glucagon is mature pancreatic glucagon. The rest is composed of larger immunoreactive fragments that are also produced in the pancreas or in the intestinal L-cells.

## IV. Mechanisms of Hormone Action

For a hormone to affect the flux of substrates through a metabolic pathway, it must be able to change the rate at which that pathway proceeds by increasing or decreasing the rate of the slowest step(s). Either directly or indirectly, hormones affect the activity of specific enzymes or transport proteins that regulate the flux through a pathway. Thus, ultimately, the hormone must either cause the amount of the substrate for the enzyme to increase (if substrate supply is a rate-limiting factor), change the conformation at the active site by phosphorylating the enzyme, change the concentration of an allosteric effector of the enzyme, or change the amount of the protein by inducing or repressing its synthesis or by changing its turnover rate or location. Insulin, glucagon, and other hormones use all of these regulatory mechanisms to determine the rate of flux in metabolic pathways. The effects mediated by phosphorylation or changes in the kinetic properties of an enzyme occur rapidly, within minutes. In contrast, it may take hours for induction or repression of enzyme synthesis to change the amount of an enzyme in the cell.

The details of hormone action were described in Chapter 11 and are only summarized here.

## A. Signal Transduction by Hormones that Bind to Plasma Membrane Receptors

Hormones initiate their actions on target cells by binding to specific receptors or binding proteins. In the case of polypeptide hormones (such as insulin and glucagon)

0Measurements of proinsulin and the connecting peptide between the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains of insulin (C-peptide) in Connie C.'s blood during her hospital fast provided confirmation that she had an insulinoma. Insulin and C-peptide are secreted in approximately equal proportions from the $\beta$-cell, but C-peptide is not cleared from the blood as rapidly as insulin. Therefore, it provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the rate of insulin secretion. Plasma C-peptide measurements are also potentially useful in helping to figure out the type of diabetes mellitus or degree of insulin secretion in patients who are receiving exogenous insulin because exogenous insulin lacks the C-peptide.

00
Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, such as Dianne A., have almost undetectable levels of insulin in their blood. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, such as Deborah S., conversely, have normal or even elevated levels of insulin in their blood; however, the level of insulin in their blood is inappropriately low relative to their elevated blood glucose concentration. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, skeletal muscle, liver, and other tissues exhibit a resistance to the actions of insulin. As a result, insulin has a smaller than normal effect on glucose and fat metabolism in such patients. Levels of insulin in the blood must be higher than normal to maintain normal blood glucose levels. In the early stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus, these compensatory adjustments in insulin release may keep the blood glucose levels near the normal range. Over time, as the $\beta$-cells' capacity to secrete high levels of insulin declines, blood glucose levels increase and exogenous insulin becomes necessary.

01
The physiologic importance of insulin's usual action of mediating the suppressive effect of glucose on glucagon secretion is apparent in patients with types I and 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite the presence of hyperglycemia, glucagon levels in such patients initially remain elevated (near fasting levels) either because of the absence of insulin's suppressive effect or because of the resistance of the $\alpha$-cells to insulin's suppressive effect even in the face of adequate insulin levels in type 2 patients. Thus, these patients have inappropriately high glucagon levels, leading to the suggestion that diabetes mellitus is actually a "bi-hormonal" disorder.

During the "stress" of hypoglycemia, the autonomic nervous system stimulates the pancreas to secrete glucagon, which tends to restore the serum glucose level to normal. The increased activity of the adrenergic nervous system (through epinephrine) also alerts a patient, such as Connie C. to the presence of increasingly severe hypoglycemia. Hopefully, this will induce the patient to ingest simple sugars or other carbohydrates, which, in turn, will also increase glucose levels in the blood. Connie C. gained 8 lb before resection of her pancreatic insulin-secreting adenoma through this mechanism.
and catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), the action of the hormone is mediated through binding to a specific receptor on the plasma membrane (see Chapter 11, Section III). The first message of the hormone is transmitted to intracellular enzymes by the activated receptor and an intracellular second messenger; the hormone does not need to enter the cell to exert its effects. (In contrast, steroid hormones such as cortisol and the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine $\left[\mathrm{T}_{3}\right]$ enter the cytosol and eventually move into the cell nucleus to exert their effects.)

The mechanism by which the message carried by the hormone ultimately affects the rate of the regulatory enzyme in the target cell is called signal transduction. The three basic types of signal transduction for hormones binding to receptors on the plasma membrane are (1) receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase, which produces cAMP; (2) receptor kinase activity; and (3) receptor coupling to hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{PIP}_{2}\right)$. The hormones of metabolic homeostasis each use one of these mechanisms to carry out their physiologic effect. In addition, some hormones and neurotransmitters act through receptor coupling to gated ion channels (described in Chapter 11).

## I. Signal Transduction by Insulin

Insulin initiates its action by binding to a receptor on the plasma membrane of insulin's many target cells (see Fig. 11.13). The insulin receptor has two types of subunits: the $\alpha$-subunits to which insulin binds, and the $\beta$-subunits, which span the membrane and protrude into the cytosol. The cytosolic portion of the $\beta$-subunit has tyrosine kinase activity. On binding of insulin, the tyrosine kinase phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the $\beta$-subunit (autophosphorylation) as well as on several other enzymes within the cytosol. A principal substrate for phosphorylation by the receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), then recognizes and binds to various signal transduction proteins in regions referred to as SH2 domains. IRS-1 is involved in many of the physiologic responses to insulin through complex mechanisms that are the subject of intensive investigation. The basic tissue-specific cellular responses to insulin, however, can be grouped into five major categories: (1) insulin reverses glucagonstimulated phosphorylation, (2) insulin works through a phosphorylation cascade that stimulates the phosphorylation of several enzymes, (3) insulin induces and represses the synthesis of specific enzymes, (4) insulin acts as a growth factor and has a general stimulatory effect on protein synthesis, and (5) insulin stimulates glucose and amino acid transport into cells (see Fig. IV. 10 in the introduction to Section IV of this text).

Several mechanisms have been proposed for the action of insulin in reversing glucagon-stimulated phosphorylation of the enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism. From the student's point of view, the ability of insulin to reverse glucagon-stimulated phosphorylation occurs as if it were lowering cAMP and stimulating phosphatases that could remove those phosphates added by PKA. In reality, the mechanism is more complex and still is not fully understood.

## 2. Signal Transduction by Glucagon

The pathway for signal transduction by glucagon is one that is common to several hormones; the glucagon receptor is coupled to adenylate cyclase and cAMP production (see Fig. 11.10). Glucagon, through G-proteins, activates the mem-brane-bound adenylate cyclase, increasing the synthesis of the intracellular second messenger $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-cyclic AMP (cAMP) (see Fig. 11.18). cAMP activates PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase), which changes the activity of enzymes by phosphorylating them at specific serine residues. Phosphorylation activates some enzymes and inhibits others.

The G-proteins, which couple the glucagon receptor to adenylate cyclase, are proteins in the plasma membrane that bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and have dissociable subunits that interact with both the receptor and adenylate cyclase. In the absence of glucagon, the stimulatory $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$-protein complex binds guanosine diphosphate (GDP) but cannot bind to the unoccupied receptor or adenylate cyclase

(see Fig. 11.17). Once glucagon binds to the receptor, the receptor also binds the $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$-complex, which then releases GDP and binds GTP. The $\alpha$-subunit then dissociates from the $\beta$ - and $\gamma$-subunits and binds to adenylate cyclase, thereby activating it. As the GTP on the $\alpha$-subunit is hydrolyzed to GDP, the subunit dissociates and recomplexes with the $\beta$ - and $\gamma$-subunits. Only continued occupancy of the glucagon receptor can keep adenylate cyclase active.

Although glucagon works by activating adenylate cyclase, a few hormones inhibit adenylate cyclase. In this case, the inhibitory G-protein complex is called a $G_{i}$ complex. cAMP is the intracellular second messenger for several hormones that regulate fuel metabolism. The specificity of the physiologic response to each hormone results from the presence of specific receptors for that hormone in target tissues. For example, glucagon activates glucose production from glycogen in liver but not in skeletal muscle because glucagon receptors are present in liver but are absent in skeletal muscle. However, skeletal muscle has adenylate cyclase, cAMP, and PKA, which can be activated by epinephrine binding to the $\beta_{2}$-receptors in the membranes of muscle cells. Liver cells also have epinephrine receptors.
cAMP is very rapidly degraded to AMP by a membrane-bound phosphodiesterase. The concentration of cAMP is thus very low in the cell, so changes in its concentration can occur rapidly in response to changes in the rate of synthesis. The amount of cAMP present at any time is a direct reflection of hormone binding and the activity of adenylate cyclase. It is not affected by ATP, ADP, or AMP levels in the cell.
cAMP transmits the hormone signal to the cell by activating PKA (cAMPdependent protein kinase). As cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits of PKA, these subunits dissociate from the catalytic subunits, which are thereby activated (see Chapter 9, Fig. 9.12). Activated PKA phosphorylates serine residues of key regulatory enzymes in the pathways of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Some enzymes are activated and others are inhibited by this change in phosphorylation state. The message of the hormone is terminated by the action of semispecific protein phosphatases that remove phosphate groups from the enzymes. The activity of the protein phosphatases is also controlled through hormonal regulation.

Changes in the phosphorylation state of proteins that bind to cAMP response elements (CREs) in the promoter region of genes contribute to the regulation of gene transcription by several cAMP-coupled hormones (see Chapter 16). For instance, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is directly phosphorylated by PKA, a step essential for the initiation of transcription. Phosphorylation at other sites on CREB, by a variety of kinases, also may play a role in regulating transcription.

The mechanism for signal transduction by glucagon illustrates some of the important principles of hormonal signaling mechanisms. The first principle is that specificity of action in tissues is conferred by the receptor on a target cell for glucagon. In general, the major actions of glucagon occur in liver, adipose tissue, and certain cells of the kidney that contain glucagon receptors. The second principle is that signal transduction involves amplification of the first message. Glucagon and other hormones are present in the blood in very low concentrations. However, these minute concentrations of hormone are adequate to initiate a cellular response because the binding of one molecule of glucagon to one receptor ultimately activates many PKA molecules, each of which phosphorylates hundreds of downstream enzymes. The third principle involves integration of metabolic responses. For instance, the glucagon-stimulated phosphorylation of enzymes simultaneously activates glycogen degradation, inhibits glycogen synthesis, and inhibits glycolysis in the liver (see Fig. IV. 10 in the introduction to Section IV of this text). The fourth principle involves augmentation and antagonism of signals. An example of augmentation involves the actions of glucagon and epinephrine (which is released during exercise). Although these hormones bind to different receptors, each can increase cAMP and stimulate glycogen degradation. A fifth principle is that of rapid signal termination. In the case of glucagon, both the termination of the $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$-protein activation and the rapid degradation of cAMP contribute to signal termination.

Phosphodiesterase is inhibited by methylxanthines, a class of compounds that includes caffeine. Would the effect of a methylxanthine on fuel metabolism be similar to fasting or to a high-carbohydrate meal?

$\sigma$Ann R. to stay thin, frequently fasts for prolonged periods, but she jogs every morning (see Chapter 2). The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine and the increase of glucagon and fall of insulin during her exercise provide coordinated and augmented signals that stimulate the release of fuels above the fasting levels. Fuel mobilization will occur, of course, only as long as she has fuel stored as triacylglycerols.

Inhibition of phosphodiesterase by methyikanthine would increase cAMP and have the same effects on fuel metabolism as would an increase of glucagon and epinephrine, as in the fasted state. Increased fuel mobilization would occur through glycogenolysis (the release of glucose from glycogen) and through lipolysis (the release of fatty acids from triacylglycerols).

FIGURE 19.13 Structure of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are synthesized from tyrosine and act as both hormones and neurotransmitters. They are catecholamines, the term catechol referring to a ring structure containing two hydroxyl groups.

Deborah S. a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus, is experiencing insulin resistance. Her levels of circulating insulin are normal to high, although inappropriately low for her elevated level of blood glucose. However, her insulin target cells, such as muscle and fat, do not respond as those of a nondiabetic subject would to this level of insulin. For most type 2 patients, the site of insulin resistance is subsequent to binding of insulin to its receptor; that is, the number of receptors and their affinity for insulin is near normal. However, the binding of insulin at these receptors does not elicit most of the normal intracellular effects of insulin discussed previously. Consequently, there is little stimulation of glucose metabolism and storage after a high-carbohydrate meal and little inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis.

## B. Signal Transduction by Cortisol and Other Hormones that Interact with Intracellular Receptors

Signal transduction by the glucocorticoid cortisol and other steroids that have glucocorticoid activity, and by thyroid hormone, involves hormone binding to intracellular (cytosolic) receptors or binding proteins; thereafter, this hormone-binding protein complex, if not already in the nucleus, moves into the nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin. This interaction changes the rate of gene transcription in the target cells (see Chapter 16). The cellular responses to these hormones continue as long as the target cell is exposed to the specific hormones. Thus, disorders that cause a chronic excess in their secretion result in an equally persistent influence on fuel metabolism. For example, chronic stress such as that seen in prolonged sepsis may lead to varying degrees of glucose intolerance (hyperglycemia) if high levels of epinephrine and cortisol persist.

The effects of cortisol on gene transcription are usually synergistic to those of certain other hormones. For instance, the rates of gene transcription for some of the enzymes in the pathway for glucose synthesis from amino acids (gluconeogenesis) are induced by glucagon as well as by cortisol.

## C. Signal Transduction by Epinephrine and Norepinephrine

Epinephrine and norepinephrine are catecholamines (Fig. 19.13). They can act as neurotransmitters or as hormones. A neurotransmitter allows a neural signal to be transmitted across the junction or synapse between the nerve terminal of a proximal nerve axon and the cell body of a distal neuron. A hormone, conversely, is released into the blood and travels in the circulation to interact with specific receptors on the plasma membrane or cytosol of cells of the target organ. The general effect of these catecholamines is to prepare us for fight or flight. Under these acutely stressful circumstances, these "stress" hormones increase fuel mobilization, cardiac output, blood flow, and so on, which enables us to meet these stresses. The catecholamines bind to adrenergic receptors (the term adrenergic refers to nerve cells or fibers that are part of the involuntary or autonomic nervous system, a system that uses norepinephrine as a neurotransmitter).

There are nine different types of adrenergic receptors: $\alpha_{1 \mathrm{~A}}, \alpha_{1 \mathrm{~B}}, \alpha_{1 \mathrm{D}}, \alpha_{2 \mathrm{~A}}, \alpha_{2 \mathrm{~B}}$, $\alpha_{2 C}, \beta_{1}, \beta_{2}$, and $\beta_{3}$. Only the three $\beta$ - and $\alpha_{1}$-receptors are discussed here. The three $\beta$-receptors work through the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system, activating a $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$-protein, which activates adenylate cyclase, and eventually PKA. The $\beta_{1}$-receptor is the major adrenergic receptor in the human heart and is primarily stimulated by norepinephrine. On activation, the $\beta_{1}$-receptor increases the rate of muscle contraction, in part because of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of phospholamban (see Chapter 45). The $\beta_{2}$-receptor is present in liver, skeletal muscle, and other tissues and is involved in the mobilization of fuels (such as the release of glucose through glycogenolysis). It also mediates vascular, bronchial, and uterine smooth muscle contraction. Epinephrine is a much more potent agonist for this receptor than norepinephrine, whose major action is neurotransmission. The $\beta_{3}$-receptor is found predominantly in adipose tissue and to a lesser extent in skeletal muscle. Activation of this receptor stimulates fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis, and agonists for this receptor may prove to be beneficial weight-loss agents. The $\alpha_{1}$-receptors, which are postsynaptic receptors, mediate vascular and smooth muscle contraction. They work through the $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ system (see Chapter 11, Section III.B.2) via activation of a $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$ protein, and phospholipase $\mathrm{C} \beta$. This receptor also mediates glycogenolysis in liver.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Deborah S. has type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas Dianne A. has type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although the pathogenesis differs for these major forms of diabetes mellitus, both cause varying degrees of hyperglycemia. In type 1 diabetes mellitus, antibodies directed at a variety of proteins within the $\beta$-cells gradually destroy the pancreatic $\beta$-cells. As insulin-secretory capacity by the $\beta$-cells gradually diminishes below a critical level, the symptoms of chronic hyperglycemia develop rapidly.

In type 2 diabetes mellitus, these symptoms develop more subtly and gradually over the course of months or years. Eighty-five percent or more of type 2 patients are obese and, like Ivan A., have a high waist-hip ratio with regard to adipose tissue disposition. This abnormal distribution of fat in the visceral (peri-intestinal) adipocytes is associated with reduced sensitivity of fat cells, muscle cells, and liver cells to the actions of insulin outlined previously. This insulin resistance can be diminished through weight loss, specifically in the visceral depots. The development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, coupled with obesity and high blood pressure, can lead to the metabolic syndrome, a common clinical entity that is discussed in more detail in Section IV of the text.

Connie C. underwent an ultrasonographic (ultrasound) study of her upper abdomen, which showed a $2.6-\mathrm{cm}$ mass in the midportion of her pancreas. With this finding, her physicians decided that further noninvasive studies would not be necessary before surgery and removal of the mass. At the time of surgery, a yellow-white $2.8-\mathrm{cm}$ mass consisting primarily of insulin-rich $\beta$-cells was resected from her pancreas. No cytologic changes of malignancy were seen on microscopic examination of the surgical specimen, and no evidence of malignant behavior by the tumor (such as local metastases) was found. Connie had an uneventful postoperative recovery and no longer experienced the signs and symptoms of insulin-induced hypoglycemia.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Actions of Insulin. One of the important cellular responses to insulin is the reversal of glucagon-stimulated phosphorylation of enzymes. Mechanisms proposed for this action include the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, a reduction of cAMP levels, the stimulation of phosphodiesterase, the production of a specific protein (insulin factor), the release of a second messenger from a bound glycosylated phosphatidylinositol, and the phosphorylation of enzymes at a site that antagonizes PKA phosphorylation. Not all of these physiologic actions of insulin occur in each of the insulin-sensitive organs of the body.

Insulin also is able to antagonize the actions of glucagon at the level of specific induction or repression of key regulatory enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism. For instance, the rate of synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA) for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, a key enzyme of the gluconeogenic pathway, is increased severalfold by glucagon (via cAMP) and decreased by insulin. Thus, all of the effects of glucagon, even the induction of certain enzymes, can be reversed by insulin. This antagonism is exerted through an insulin-sensitive hormone response element (IRE) in the promoter region of the genes. Insulin causes repression of the synthesis of enzymes that are induced by glucagon.

The general stimulation of protein synthesis by insulin (its mitogenic or growthpromoting effect) appears to occur through a general increase in rates of mRNA translation for a broad spectrum of structural proteins. These actions result from a phosphorylation cascade initiated by autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor and ending in the phosphorylation of subunits of proteins that bind to and inhibit eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factors (eIFs). When phosphorylated, the inhibitory proteins are released from the eIFs, allowing translation of mRNA to be stimulated. In this respect, the actions of insulin are similar to those of other hormones that act as growth factors and that also have receptors with tyrosine kinase activity.

In addition to signal transduction, activation of the insulin receptor mediates the internalization of receptor-bound insulin molecules, increasing their subsequent degradation. Although unoccupied receptors can be internalized and eventually recycled to the plasma membrane, the receptor can be irreversibly degraded after prolonged occupation by insulin. The result of this process, referred to as receptor downregulation, is an attenuation of the insulin signal. The physiologic importance of receptor internalization on insulin sensitivity is poorly understood but could lead eventually to chronic hyperglycemia.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Glucose homeostasis is directed toward the maintenance of constant blood glucose levels.
- Insulin and glucagon are the two major hormones that regulate the balance between fuel mobilization and storage. They maintain blood glucose levels near 80 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, despite varying carbohydrate intake during the day.
- If dietary intake of all fuels is in excess of immediate need, it is stored as either glycogen or fat. Conversely, appropriately stored fuels are mobilized when demand requires.
- Insulin is released in response to carbohydrate ingestion and promotes glucose use as a fuel and glucose storage as fat and glycogen. Insulin secretion is regulated principally by blood glucose levels.
- Glucagon promotes glucose production via glycogenolysis (glycogen degradation) and gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis from amino acids and other noncarbohydrate precursors).
- Glucagon release is regulated principally through suppression by rising levels of glucose and rising levels of insulin. Glucagon levels decrease in response to a carbohydrate meal and increase during fasting. Increased levels of glucagon relative to insulin stimulate the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue.
- Glucagon acts by binding to a receptor on the cell surface, which stimulates the synthesis of the intracellular second messenger, cAMP.
- cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates key regulatory enzymes, activating some and inhibiting others.
- Insulin acts via a receptor tyrosine kinase and leads to the dephosphorylation of the key enzymes phosphorylated in response to glucagon.
- Hormones that antagonize insulin action, known as insulin counterregulatory hormones, include glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 19.4.


## TABLE 19.4 Disease Discussed in Chapter 19

| DISEASE OR DISORDER | ENVIRONMENTAL OR GENETIC | COMMENTS |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Type 2 diabetes | Both | Emergence of insulin resistance, owing to a wide variety of causes; tissues do not respond to insulin as they normally would. |
| Insulinoma | Both | Periodic release of insulin from a tumor of the pancreatic $\beta$-cells, leading to hypoglycemic symptoms, which are accompanied by excessive appetite and weight gain. |
| Hyperglycemia | Both | Constantly elevated levels of glucose in the circulation owing to a wide variety of causes. Hyperglycemia leads to protein glycation and potential loss of protein function in a variety of tissues. |
| Type I diabetes | Both | No production of insulin by the pancreatic $\beta$-cells, owing to an autoimmune destruction of the $\beta$ cells. Hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis may result from the lack of insulin. |
| Maturity-onset diabetes of the young | Genetic | Forms of diabetes caused by specific mutations, such as a mutation in pancreatic glucokinase, which alters the set point for insulin release from the $\beta$-cells |
| Neonatal diabetes | Genetic | One cause of neonatal diabetes is a mutation in a subunit of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel in various tissues. Such a mutation in the pancreas leads to permanent opening of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel, keeping intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ levels low, and difficulty in releasing insulin from the $\beta$-cells. |

10. The patient in the previous question had very high blood glucose levels, and his urine also contained high blood glucose levels. The high blood glucose levels can lead to cerebral dysfunction owing to which one of the following?
A. Dehydration
B. Reduced lipid concentrations in the blood
C. Increased lipid concentrations in the blood
D. Hyperhydration
E. High ammonia levels
F. Low ammonia levels

1. The answer is D. Once insulin is injected, glucose transport into the peripheral tissues will be enhanced. If the patient does not eat, the normal fasting level of glucose will drop even further resulting from the injection of insulin, which increases the movement of glucose into muscle and fat cells. The patient becomes hypoglycemic, as a result of which epinephrine is released from the adrenal medulla. This, in turn, leads to the signs and symptoms associated with high levels of epinephrine in the blood. Answers A and B are incorrect because as glucose levels drop, glucagon will be released from the pancreas to raise blood glucose levels, which would alleviate the symptoms. Answer E is incorrect because ketone body production does not produce hypoglycemic symptoms, nor would ketone bodies be significantly elevated only a few hours after the insulin shock the patient is experiencing.
2. The answer is D. When the patient took the insulin, the hormone stimulated glucose transport into the muscle and fat cells. This had the effect of lowering blood glucose levels, and, by not eating, the patient became severely hypoglycemic to the point that the blood glucose levels were below the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for the glucose transporters for the nervous system. The administration of epinephrine will stimulate the liver to release glucose, via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and will raise blood glucose levels sufficiently to overcome the insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The addition of insulin would only exacerbate the problem. Addition of triglycerides will not aid the nervous system because the fatty acids cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Normal saline will not add nutrients for the nervous system. Short-chain fatty acids also cannot enter the nervous system.
3. The answer is B. When glucagon binds to its receptor, the enzyme adenylate cyclase is eventually activated (through the action of G-proteins), which raises cAMP levels in the cell. The cAMP phosphodiesterase opposes this rise in cAMP and hydrolyzes cAMP to 5'-AMP. If the phosphodiesterase is inhibited by caffeine, cAMP levels would stay elevated for an extended period of time, enhancing the glucagon response. The glucagon response in liver is to export glucose (thus, E is incorrect) and to inhibit glycolysis (thus, D is incorrect). cAMP activates PKA, making answer C incorrect as well. The effect of insulin is to reduce cAMP levels (thus, A is incorrect).
4. The answer is B. Insulin release is dependent on an increase in the ATP/ADP ratio within the pancreatic $\beta$-cell. In MODY, the mutation in glucokinase results in a less active glucokinase at glucose concentrations that normally stimulate insulin release. Thus, higher concentrations of glucose are required to stimulate glycolysis and the TCA cycle to effectively raise the ratio of ATP to ADP. Answer A is incorrect because cAMP levels are not related to the mechanism of insulin release. Answer C is incorrect because initially transcription is not involved because insulin release is caused by exocytosis of preformed insulin in secretory vesicles. Answer D is incorrect because the pancreas will not degrade glycogen under conditions of high blood glucose, and answer $E$ is incorrect because lactate does not play a role in stimulating insulin release.
5. The answer is A. The brain requires glucose because fatty acids cannot readily cross the blood-brain barrier to enter neuronal cells. Thus, glucose production is maintained at an adequate level to allow the brain to continue to burn glucose for its energy needs. The other organs listed as possible answers can switch to the use of alternative fuel sources (lactate, fatty acids, amino acids) and are not as dependent on glucose for their energy requirements as is the brain.
6. The answer is E. Muscle does not express glucagon receptors, so they are refractory to the actions of glucagon. Muscle does, however, contain GTP (made via the TCA cycle), G-proteins, PKA, and adenylate cyclase (epinephrine stimulation of muscle cells raises cAMP levels and activates PKA).
7. The answer is B. Insulin does lower blood glucose and cause hypoglycemia, but this would produce symptoms of fatigue, confusion, and blurred vision. When hypoglycemia is present, the body releases glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine to raise blood glucose levels. Epinephrine causes tremors, sweating, and elevated pulse rate (fight-or-flight response). Testosterone is not involved.
8. The answer is E. Carbohydrates are more rapidly absorbed and have the greatest and most rapid influence on elevating blood glucose levels, which stimulates insulin production and reduces glucagon secretion from the pancreas. In addition, both elevated blood glucose and elevated insulin levels suppress glucagon release. Many amino acids stimulate glucagon release, and a lowprotein diet would still lead to glucagon secretion from the pancreas to a greater extent than a high-carbohydrate diet. High- or low-fat diets will not stimulate insulin release, and because gluconeogenesis is required to synthesize glucose under such diets, glucagon secretion would still be occurring.
9. The answer is A. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is caused by a lack of insulin (therefore, neither proinsulin nor C-peptide is produced as well), whereas type 2 diabetes mellitus is cellular resistance to secreted insulin (therefore, endogenous insulin and C-peptide are still produced in patients with type 2 diabetes). Measurement of an absolute insulin level would not be helpful because the patient is injecting insulin each day. However, if the patient is still producing insulin, he would also produce the C-peptide and would be classified as having

type 2 diabetes. If C-peptide levels are not detected, the patient is classified as having type 1 diabetes. Individuals with type 1 diabetes can have islet cell antibodies in their blood, but not insulin antibodies. The presence of antibodies against insulin in the blood would lead to a reduced response to insulin, or a form of type 2 diabetes. The measurement of glucagon or proglucagon levels would not differentiate type 1 from type 2 diabetes because both glucagon and proglucagon would still be produced in individuals with diabetes. The levels of glucagon secreted in both types of diabetes is similar.
10. The answer is A. The elevated glucose in the blood leads to an osmotic diuresis because water will leave cells to enter the blood and urine in order to reduce the glucose concentration in those fluids. As the water
leaves the tissues and enters the urine, blood volume also decreases, leading to even higher blood glucose concentrations. The loss of water leads to severe dehydration and to reduced blood flow to the brain (because of reduced blood volume), which will lead to cerebral dysfunction. The brain cannot use lipids as an energy source, so altering lipid concentrations in the blood will not affect cerebral function. The cerebral dysfunction is actually occurring under higher than normal blood glucose concentrations; it is the reduced blood volume that leads to the dysfunction. Carbohydrates do not contain a nitrogen group, so they do not produce ammonia. High levels of ammonia can cause cerebral dysfunction, but it does not come about because of high blood glucose levels.

FIGURE 20.1 The ATP-ADP cycle. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; $A T P$, adenosine triphosphate; $P_{i}$ inorganic phosphate.

## Cellular Bioenergetics: Adenosine Triphosphate and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$

Bioenergetics refers to cellular energy transformations.
The ATP-ADP Cycle. In cells, the chemical bond energy of fuels is transformed into the physiologic responses that are necessary for life. The central role of the high-energy phosphate bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in these processes is summarized in the ATP-ADP (adenosine diphosphate) cycle (Fig. 20.1). To generate ATP through cellular respiration, fuels are degraded by oxidative reactions that transfer most of their chemical bond energy to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to generate the reduced form of these coenzymes, NADH and FAD(2H). When NADH and FAD(2H) are oxidized by oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ in the electron-transport chain (ETC), the energy is used to regenerate ATP in the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Energy available from cleavage of the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP can be used directly for mechanical work (e.g., muscle contraction) or for transport work (e.g., a $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient generated by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase). It can also be used for biochemical work (energy-requiring chemical reactions), such as anabolic pathways (biosynthesis of large molecules such as proteins) or detoxification reactions. Phosphoryl transfer reactions, protein conformational changes, and the formation of activated intermediates containing high-energy bonds (e.g., uridine diphosphate [UDP]-sugars) facilitate these energy transformations. Energy released from foods that is not used for work against the environment is transformed into heat.

ATP Homeostasis. Fuel oxidation is regulated to maintain ATP homeostasis ("homeo," same; "stasis," state). Regardless of whether the level of cellular fuel use is high (with increased ATP consumption) or low (with decreased ATP consumption), the available ATP within the cell is maintained at a constant level by appropriate increases or decreases in the rate of fuel oxidation. Problems in ATP homeostasis and energy balance occur in obesity, hyperthyroidism, and myocardial infarction (MI).

Energy from Fuel Oxidation. Fuel oxidation is exergonic; it releases energy. The maximum quantity of energy released that is available for useful work (e.g., ATP synthesis) is called $\Delta \mathbf{G}^{\#}$, the change in Gibbs free energy at pH 7.0 under standard conditions. Fuel oxidation has a negative $\Delta \mathbf{G}^{\#}$, that is, the products have a lower chemical bond energy than the reactants, and their formation is energetically favored. ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate $\left(P_{i}\right)$ is endergonic: It requires energy and has a positive $\Delta \mathbf{G}^{\#}$. To proceed in our cells, all pathways must have a negative $\Delta \mathbf{G}^{\#}$. How is this accomplished for anabolic pathways such as glycogen synthesis? These metabolic pathways incorporate reactions that expend high-energy bonds to compensate for the energy-requiring steps. Because the $\Delta \mathbf{G}^{\#}$ values for a sequence of reactions are additive, the overall pathway becomes energetically favorable.

Fuels are oxidized principally by donating electrons to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and FAD , which then donate electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the ETC. The caloric value of a fuel is related to its $\Delta \mathbf{G}^{\#}$ for transfer of electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, and its reduction potential $\mathbf{E}^{\#}$ (a measure of its willingness to donate, or accept, electrons). Because fatty acids are more reduced than carbohydrates, they have a higher caloric value. The high affinity of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ for electrons (a high positive reduction potential) drives fuel oxidation forward, with release

of energy that can be used for ATP synthesis in oxidative phosphorylation. However, smaller amounts of ATP can be generated without the use of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in anaerobic glycolysis.

Fuel oxidation can also generate NADPH, which usually donates electrons to biosynthetic pathways and detoxification reactions. For example, in some reactions catalyzed by oxygenases, NADPH is the electron donor and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is the electron acceptor.

## THE WAITING ROOM

0Otto S. is a 26-year-old medical student who has completed his first year of medical school. He is 5 ft 10 in tall and began medical school weighing 154 lb , within his ideal weight range (see Chapter 1). By the time he finished his last examination in his first year, he weighed 187 lb . He had calculated his basal metabolic rate (BMR) at approximately 1,680 kilocalorie [kcal] and his energy expenditure for physical exercise equal to $30 \%$ of his BMR. He planned on returning to his pre-medical school weight in 6 weeks over the summer by eating 576 kcal less each day and playing 7 hours of tennis every day. However, he did a summer internship instead of playing tennis. When Otto started his second year of medical school, he weighed 210 lb .

2Stanley T. is a 26-year-old man who noted heat intolerance, with heavy sweating, heart palpitations, and tremulousness. Over the past 4 months, he has lost weight in spite of a good appetite. He is sleeping poorly and describes himself as feeling "jittery inside."

On physical examination, his heart rate is rapid (116 beats/minute) and he appears restless and fidgety. His skin feels warm, and he is perspiring profusely. A fine hand tremor is observed as he extends his arms in front of his chest. His thyroid gland appears to be diffusely enlarged and, on palpation, is approximately three times normal size. Thyroid function tests confirm that Mr. T.'s thyroid gland is secreting excessive amounts of the thyroid hormones tetraiodothyronine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{4}\right)$ and triiodothyronine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{3}\right)$, the major thyroid hormones present in the blood.

0Cora N. is a 64-year-old female who had a myocardial infarction (MI; often referred to as a "heart attack") 8 months ago. Although she has managed to lose 6 lb since the MI, she remains overweight and has not reduced the fat content of her diet adequately. The graded aerobic exercise program she started 5 weeks after her infarction is now followed irregularly, falling far short of the cardiac conditioning intensity prescribed by her cardiologist. She is readmitted to the hospital cardiac care unit after experiencing a severe "viselike pressure" in the midchest area while cleaning ice from the windshield of her car. The electrocardiogram shows evidence of a new anterior wall MI. Signs and symptoms of left ventricular failure are present.

## I. Energy Available to Do Work

The basic principle of the ATP-ADP cycle is that fuel oxidation generates ATP, and hydrolysis of ATP to ADP provides the energy to perform most of the work required in the cell. ATP has, therefore, been called the energy currency of the cells. To keep up with the demand, we must constantly replenish our ATP supply through the use of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ for fuel oxidation.

The amount of energy from ATP cleavage available to do useful work is related to the difference in energy levels between the products and substrates of the reaction and is called the change in Gibbs free energy, $\Delta \mathrm{G}(\Delta$, difference; G, Gibbs free energy). In cells, the $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ for energy production from fuel oxidation must be greater than the $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ of energy-requiring processes, such as protein synthesis and muscle contraction, for life to continue.

0To assess for thyroid function, one must understand how the hormones $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$ are released from the thyroid (see Chapter 41). The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland both monitor the level of free $T_{3}$ in the blood bathing them. When the concentration of free $T_{3}$ in the blood drops, the pituitary releases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which stimulates the thyroid to release $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$. The pituitary is under the control of the hypothalamus, which releases TSH-releasing hormone (TSHRH) under the appropriate conditions. Thus, if one notices low serum $T_{3}$ or $T_{4}$ levels, it may represent a thyroid or pituitary problem. Understanding the physiology enables the appropriate tests to be run to determine where the defect lies.
$T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$ are measured using sensitive techniques that involve antibody recognition (radioimmunoassay; see Chapter 41). TSH levels can be determined in a similar fashion using a sandwich technique (which requires the use of two distinct antibodies that recognize TSH).

Through the appropriate interpretation of these tests, one can determine if thyroid or pituitary function is impaired and design treatment accordingly.

## 1

Cora N. suffered a heart attack 8 months ago and had a significant loss of functional heart muscle. She occasionally gets pain while waking. The pain she is experiencing is called angina pectoris and is a crushing or constricting pain located in the center of the chest, often radiating to the neck or arms (see Ann J.. Chapters 6 and 7). The most common cause of angina is partial blockage of coronary arteries from atherosclerosis. The heart muscle cells beyond the block receive an inadequate blood flow and oxygen, and they die when ATP production falls too low.

The heart is a specialist in the transformation of ATP chemical bond energy into mechanical work. Each single heartbeat uses approximately $2 \%$ of the ATP in the heart. If the heart were not able to regenerate ATP, all its ATP would be hydrolyzed in $<1$ minute. Because the amount of ATP required by the heart is so high, it must rely on the pathway of oxidative phosphorylation for generation of this ATP. In Cora N.'s heart, hypoxia (the lack of oxygen) is affecting her ability to generate ATP.

# A. The High-Energy Phosphate Bonds of ATP 

The amount of energy released or required by bond cleavage or formation is determined by the chemical properties of the substrates and products. The bonds between the phosphate groups in ATP are called phosphoanhydride bonds (Fig. 20.2). When these bonds are hydrolyzed, energy is released because the products of the reaction (ADP and phosphate) are more stable, with lower bond energies, than the reactants (ATP and water $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]$ ). The instability of the phosphoanhydride bonds arises from their negatively charged phosphate groups, which repel each other and strain the bonds between them. It takes energy to make the phosphate groups stay together. In contrast, there are fewer negative charges in ADP to repel each other. The phosphate group as a free anion is more stable than it is in ATP because of an increase in resonance structures (i.e., the electrons of the oxygen double bond are shared by all the oxygen atoms). As a consequence, ATP hydrolysis is energetically favorable and proceeds with release of energy as heat.

In the cell, ATP is not hydrolyzed directly. Energy released as heat from ATP hydrolysis cannot be transferred efficiently into energy-requiring processes such as biosynthetic reactions or maintenance of an ion gradient. Instead, cellular enzymes transfer the phosphate group to a metabolic intermediate or protein that is part of the energy-requiring process (a phosphoryl transfer reaction).

## B. Change in Free Energy ( $\Delta \mathbf{G}$ ) during a Reaction

How much energy can be obtained from ATP hydrolysis to do the work required in the cell? The maximum amount of useful energy that can be obtained from a reaction is called $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ - the change in Gibbs free energy. The value of $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ for a reaction can be influenced by the initial concentration of substrates and products, by temperature, pH , and by pressure. The $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0}$ for a reaction refers to the energy change for a reaction starting at 1 M substrate and product concentrations and proceeding to equilibrium (equilibrium, by definition, occurs when there is no change in substrate and product concentrations with time). $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0}$ is the value for $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0}$ under standard conditions ( $\mathrm{pH}=$ $7.0,\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]=55 \mathrm{M}$, and $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) as well as standard concentrations (Table 20.1).
$\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0}$ is equivalent to the chemical bond energy of the products minus that of the reactants, corrected for energy that has gone into entropy (an increase in amount of molecular disorder). This correction for change in entropy is very small for most

FIGURE 20.2 Hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ). Cleavage of the phosphoanhydride bonds between either the $\beta$ - and $\gamma$-phosphates or between the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-phosphates releases the same amount of energy, approximately $7.3 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$. However, hydrolysis of the phosphate-adenosine bond (a phosphoester bond) releases less energy ( $\approx 3.4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$ ), and consequently, this bond is not considered a high-energy phosphate bond. During ATP hydrolysis, the change in disorder during the reaction is small, and so $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ values at physiologic temperature $\left(37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ are similar to those at standard temperature $\left(25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) . \Delta \mathrm{G}$ is affected by pH , which alters the ionization state of the phosphate groups of ATP and by the intracellular concentration of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ions, which bind to the $\beta$ - and $\gamma$-phosphate groups of ATP.

reactions that occur in cells, and thus, the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ for hydrolysis of various chemical bonds reflects the amount of energy available from that bond.

The value $-7.3 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}(-30.5$ kilojoule $[\mathrm{kJ}] / \mathrm{mol})$ that is generally used for the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ of ATP hydrolysis is thus the amount of energy available from hydrolysis of ATP, under standard conditions, that can be spent on energy-requiring processes; it defines the "monetary value" of our "ATP currency." Although the difference between cellular conditions ( $\mathrm{pH} 7.3,37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) and standard conditions is very small, the difference between cellular concentrations of ATP, ADP, and $P_{i}$ and the standard 1 M concentrations is huge and greatly affects the availability of energy in the cell.

## C. Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions

The value of $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ tells you whether the reaction requires or releases energy, the amount of energy involved, and the ratio of products to substrates at equilibrium. The negative value for the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ of ATP hydrolysis indicates that, if you begin with equimolar ( 1 M ) concentrations of substrates and products, the reaction proceeds in the forward direction with the release of energy. From initial concentrations of 1 M , the ATP concentration will decrease, and ADP and $P_{i}$ will increase until equilibrium is reached.

For a reaction in which a substrate $S$ is converted to a product $P$, the ratio of the product concentration to the substrate concentration at equilibrium is given by

$$
\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}=-\mathrm{RT} \ln [\mathrm{P}] /[\mathrm{S}]
$$

Equation 20.1.

The reaction catalyzed by phosphoglucomutase is reversible and functions in the synthesis of glycogen from glucose as well as the degradation of glycogen back to glucose. If the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ for conversion of glucose 6 -P to glucose I-P is $+1.65 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$, what is the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ of the reverse reaction?

The $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ for the reverse reaction is -1.65 kcal . The change in free energy is the same for the forward and reverse directions but has opposite sign. Because negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ values indicate favorable reactions, this reaction under standard conditions favors the conversion of glucose 1-P to glucose 6-P.

The $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ for the conversion of glucose 6-P to glucose 1-P is +1.65 kcal/mol. What is the ratio of [glucose 1-P] to [glucose 6-P] at equilibrium?

## TABLE 20.2 A General Expression for $\Delta \mathrm{G}$

To generalize the expression for $\Delta \mathrm{G}$, consider a reaction in which $a \mathrm{~A}+b \mathrm{~B} \equiv c \mathrm{C}+d \mathrm{D}$
The lowercase letters denote that $a$ moles of A will combine with $b$ moles of B to produce $c$ moles of $C$ and $d$ moles of $D$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}=-R \mathrm{~T} \ln \mathrm{~K}_{\mathrm{eq}}=-\mathrm{RT} \ln \frac{[\mathrm{C}]_{n}[\mathrm{D}]_{m}^{\prime}}{\left[\mathrm{A}]_{n}[\mathrm{R}]_{m}^{\prime}\right.} \\
\Delta \mathrm{G}==\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}+\mathrm{RT} \ln \frac{[\mathrm{CF}] \mathrm{D}]^{2}}{[\mathrm{~A}]^{2}[\mathrm{R}]^{2}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Table 20.2 indicates a more general form of this equation; R is the gas constant $\left[1.98 \mathrm{cal} / \mathrm{mol}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{K}\right)$, and T is equal to the temperature in degrees Kelvin.

Thus, the difference in chemical bond energies of the substrate and product $\left(\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}\right)$ determines the concentration of each at equilibrium.

Reactions such as ATP hydrolysis are exergonic (releasing energy) or exothermic (releasing heat). Both exergonic and exothermic reactions have a negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ and release energy while proceeding in the forward direction to equilibrium. Endergonic, or endothermic, reactions have a positive $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ for the forward direction (the direction shown), and the backward direction is favored. For example, in the pathway of glycogen synthesis, phosphoglucomutase converts glucose 6-phosphate (glucose 6-P) to glucose 1-phosphate (glucose 1-P). Glucose 1-P has a higher phosphate bond energy than glucose 6-P because the phosphate is on the aldehyde carbon (Fig. 20.3). The $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ value for the forward direction (glucose $6-\mathrm{P} \rightarrow$ glucose $1-\mathrm{P}$ ) is therefore positive. Beginning at equimolar concentrations of both compounds, there is a net conversion of glucose 1-P back to glucose 6-P, and at equilibrium, the concentration of glucose 6-P is higher than glucose 1-P. The exact ratio is determined by the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ for the reaction.

It is often said that a reaction with a negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ proceeds spontaneously in the forward direction, meaning that products accumulate at the expense of reactants. However, $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ is not an indicator of the velocity of the reaction or of the rate at which equilibrium can be reached. In the cell, the velocity of the reaction depends on the efficiency and amount of enzyme available to catalyze the reaction (see Chapter 9), so "spontaneously" in this context can be misleading.

The equations for calculating $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ are based on the first law of thermodynamics (see Table 20.1). The change in chemical bond energy that occurs during a reaction is $\Delta \mathrm{H}$, the change in enthalpy of the reaction. At constant temperature and pressure, $\Delta \mathrm{H}$ is equivalent to the chemical bond energy of the products minus that of the reactants. $\Delta \mathrm{G}$, the maximum amount of useful work available from a reaction, is equal to $\Delta \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{T} \Delta \mathrm{S} . \mathrm{T} \Delta \mathrm{S}$ is a correction for the amount of energy that has gone into an increase in the entropy (disorder in arrangement of molecules) of the system. Thus, $\Delta \mathrm{G}=\Delta \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{T} \Delta \mathrm{S}$, where $\Delta \mathrm{H}$ is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature of the system in Kelvin, and $\Delta \mathrm{S}$ is the change in entropy, or increased disorder of the system. $\Delta \mathrm{S}$ is often negligible in reactions such as ATP hydrolysis, in which the numbers of substrates $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{ATP}\right)$ and products $\left(\mathrm{ADP}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ are equal and no gas is formed. Under these conditions, the values for $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ at physiologic temperature $\left(37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ are similar to those at standard temperature $\left(25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$.

## II. Energy Transformations to Do Mechanical and Transport Work

For work in the cell to be done, a mechanism must be available for converting the chemical bond energy of ATP into another form, such as a $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient across a membrane. These energy transformations usually involve intermediate steps in which ATP is bound to a protein, and cleavage of the bound ATP results in a conformational change of the protein.

## A. Mechanical Work

In mechanical work, the high-energy phosphate bond of ATP is converted into movement by changing the conformation of a protein (Fig. 20.4). For example, in contracting muscle fibers, the hydrolysis of ATP while it is bound to myosin ATPase changes the conformation of myosin so that it is in a "cocked" position, ready to associate with the sliding actin filament. Thus, exercising muscle fibers have almost a 100 -fold higher rate of ATP use and caloric requirements than resting muscle fibers. Motor proteins, such as kinesins that transport chemicals along fibers, provide another example of mechanical work in a cell.

## B. Transport Work

In transport work, called active transport, the high-energy phosphate bond of ATP is used to transport compounds against a concentration gradient (see Chapter 10, Fig. 10.10). In plasma membrane ATPases (P-ATPases) and vesicular ATPases (V-ATPases), the chemical bond energy of ATP is used to reversibly phosphorylate the transport protein and change its conformation. For example, as the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}-$ ATPase binds and cleaves ATP, it becomes phosphorylated and changes its conformation to release three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions to the outside of the cell, thereby building up a higher extracellular than intracellular concentration of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reenters the cell on cotransport proteins that drive the uptake of amino acids and many other compounds into the cell. Thus, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$must be continuously transported back out. The expenditure of ATP for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport occurs even while we sleep and is estimated to account for $10 \%$ to $30 \%$ of our BMR.

A large number of other active transporters also convert ATP chemical bond energy into an ion gradient (membrane potential). Vesicular ATPases pump protons into lysosomes. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-ATPases in the plasma membrane move $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ out of the cell against a concentration gradient. Similar $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-ATPases pump $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the

The constant R is $1.98 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}-\mathrm{K}$, and T is $(273+25) \mathrm{K}$, so $\mathrm{RT}=-0.593 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$. Substituting in the previous equation then gives $1.65=-0.593 \mathrm{~h} /$ glucose $1-\mathrm{P} /$ [glucose 6-P]. Thus, $\mathrm{In} /$ glucose $1-\mathrm{P} /[\mathrm{glucose} 6-\mathrm{P}]=$ -2.78 , and [glucose $1-\mathrm{P} /$ glucose $6-\mathrm{P}]=\mathrm{e}^{-2.79}$, or 0.062 . So, the ratio of [glucose $1-\mathrm{P}]$ to [glucose 6-P] at equilibrium is 0.062 .

FIGURE 20.4 A simplified diagram of myosin ATPase. Muscle fiber is made of thick filaments composed of bundles of the protein myosin, and thin filaments composed of the protein actin (which is activated by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding). At many positions along the actin filament, a terminal domain of a myosin molecule, referred to as the "head," binds to a specific site on the actin. The myosin head has an ATP-binding site and is an ATPase; it can hydrolyze ATP to ADP and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{o}}$ (I) As ATP binds to myosin, the conformation of myosin changes, and it dissociates from the actin. (2) Myosin hydrolyzes the ATP, again changing conformation. (3) When $P_{i}$ dissociates, the myosin head reassociates with activated actin at a new position (position 2 in the figure). (4) As ADP dissociates, the myosin again changes conformation, or tightens. This change of conformation at multiple association points between actin and myosin slides the actin filament forward.

Otto 5. has not followed his proposed diet and exercise regimen and has been gaining weight. He has a positive caloric balance because his daily energy expenditure is less than his daily energy intake (see Chapter 2). Although the energy expenditure for physical exercise is only approximately $30 \%$ of the BMR in a sedentary individual, it can be $100 \%$ or more of the BMR in a person who exercises strenuously for several hours or more. The large increase in ATP use for muscle contraction during exercise accounts for its contribution to the daily energy expenditure.

In the thermodynamic perspective of energy expenditure, when energy intake to the body exceeds energy expended, the difference is effectively stored as fat.

lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (in muscle). Thus, a considerable amount of energy is expended in maintaining a low cytoplasmic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ level.

## III. Biochemical Work

The high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP are also used for biochemical work. Biochemical work occurs in anabolic pathways, which are pathways that synthesize large molecules (e.g., DNA, glycogen, triacylglycerols, proteins) from smaller compounds. Biochemical work also occurs when toxic compounds are converted to nontoxic compounds that can be excreted (e.g., the liver converts $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$ions to urea in the urea cycle). In general, formation of chemical bonds between two organic molecules (e.g., $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bonds in fatty acid synthesis or $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{N}$ bonds in protein synthesis) requires energy and is therefore biochemical work. How do our cells get these necessary energy-requiring reactions to occur?

To answer this question, the next sections consider how energy is used to synthesize glycogen from glucose (Fig. 20.5). Glycogen is a storage polysaccharide consisting of glucosyl units linked together through glycosidic bonds. If an anabolic pathway, such as glycogen synthesis, were to have an overall positive $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}$, the cell would be full of glucose and intermediates of the pathway but very little glycogen would be formed. To avoid this, cells do biochemical work and spend enough of their ATP currency to give anabolic pathways an overall negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}$.

## A. Adding $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}$ Values

Reactions in which chemical bonds are formed between two organic molecules are usually catalyzed by enzymes that transfer energy from cleavage of ATP in a phosphoryl transfer reaction or by enzymes that cleave a high-energy bond in an activated intermediate of the pathway. Because the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}$ values in a reaction sequence are additive, the pathway acquires an overall negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}$, and the reactions in the pathway will occur to move toward an equilibrium state in which the concentration of final products is greater than that of the initial reactants.

## I. Phosphoryl Transfer Reactions

One of the characteristics of Gibbs free energy is that $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}$ values for consecutive steps or reactions in a sequence can be added together to obtain a single value for the overall process. Thus, the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP can be used to drive a reaction forward that would otherwise be highly unfavorable energetically. Consider, for example, synthesis of glucose 6-P from glucose, the first step in glycolysis and glycogen synthesis (see Fig. 20.5, circle 2). If the reaction were to proceed by addition of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ to glucose, glucose $6-\mathrm{P}$ synthesis would have a positive $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}$ value of $3.3 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$ (Table 20.3). However, when this reaction is coupled to cleavage of the high-energy ATP bond through a phosphoryl transfer reaction, the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}$ for glucose $6-\mathrm{P}$ synthesis acquires a net negative value of $-4.0 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$, which can be calculated from the sum of the two reactions. Glucose 6-P cannot be transported back out of the cell, and, therefore, the net negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}$ for glucose $6-\mathrm{P}$ synthesis helps the cell to trap glucose for its own metabolic needs.

TABLE 20.3 $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}$ for the Transfer of a Phosphate from ATP to Glucose

| Glucose $+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightarrow \mathrm{G} 6 \mathrm{P}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ | $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}=+3.3 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| ATP $+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ | $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}=-7.3 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$ |
| Sum: glucose + ATP $\rightarrow$ G6P + ADP | $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{II}}=-4.0 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$ |

ADP: adenosine diphosphate; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$, inorganic phosphate.

The net value for synthesis of glucose 6-P from glucose and ATP would be the same whether the two reactions are catalyzed by the same enzyme, are catalyzed by two separate enzymes, or are not catalyzed by an enzyme at all because the net value of glucose 6-P synthesis is dictated by the amount of energy in the chemical bonds being broken and formed.

## 2. Activated Intermediates in Glycogen Synthesis

To synthesize glycogen from glucose, energy is provided by the cleavage of three high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP, uridine triphosphate (UTP), and pyrophosphate $\left(\mathrm{PP}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ (see Fig. 20.5, steps 2, 5, and 6). Energy transfer is facilitated by phosphoryl group transfer and by formation of an activated intermediate (UDP-glucose). Step 4, the conversion of glucose 6-P to glucose 1-P, has a positive $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$. This step is pulled and pushed in the desired direction by the accumulation of substrate and removal of product in reactions that have a negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ from cleavage of highenergy bonds. In step 5, the UTP high-energy phosphate bond is cleaved to form the activated sugar, UDP-glucose (Fig. 20.6). This reaction is further facilitated by cleavage of the high-energy bond in the $\mathrm{PP}_{\mathrm{i}}$ (step 6) that is released in step 5 (approximately -7.7 kcal ). In step 7, cleavage of the bond between UDP and glucose in the activated intermediate provides the energy for attaching the glucose moiety to the end of the glycogen molecule (approximately -3.3 kcal ). In general, the amount of ATP phosphate bond energy used in an anabolic pathway, or detoxification pathway, must provide the pathway with an overall negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$, so that the concentration of products is favored over that of reactants.

## B. $\Delta$ G Depends on Substrate and Product Concentrations

$\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ reflects the energy difference between reactants and products at specific concentrations (each at 1 M ) and standard conditions ( $\mathrm{pH} 7.0,25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). However, these are not the conditions prevailing in cells, in which variations from "standard conditions" are relevant to determining actual free-energy changes and hence the direction in which reactions are likely to occur. One aspect of free-energy changes contributing to the forward direction of anabolic pathways is the dependence of $\Delta \mathrm{G}$, the free-energy change of a reaction, on the initial substrate and product concentrations. Reactions in the cell with a positive $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ can proceed in the forward direction if the concentration of substrate is raised to high enough levels, or if the concentration of product is decreased to very low levels. Product concentrations can be very low if, for example, the product is rapidly used in a subsequent energetically favorable reaction, or if the product diffuses or is transported away.

## I. The Difference between $\Delta G$ and $\Delta G^{\mathrm{tr}}$

The driving force toward equilibrium starting at any concentration of substrate and product is expressed by $\Delta \mathrm{G}$, and not by $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$, which is the free-energy change to

Uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose)
FIGURE 20.6 Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose contains a high-energy pyrophosphate bond, shown in the green box.

Given a $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ of +1.65 kcal/mol for the conversion of glucose 6-P to glucose $1-P$ and a $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ of -4.0 kcal/mol for the conversion of glucose + ATP to glucose 6-P + ADP, what is the value of $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ for the conversion of glucose to glucose $1-P$ ?

Stanley T. has increased blood levels of thyroid hormones, which accelerate basal metabolic processes that use ATP in our organs (e.g., $\mathrm{Na}^{+} \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase), thereby increasing the BMR. An increased BMR was used for a presumptive diagnosis of hyperthyroidism before development of the tests to measure $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$. Because Stanley T. did not fully compensate for his increased ATP requirements with an increased caloric intake, he was in negative caloric balance and lost weight.

$\Delta G^{\circ}$ for the overall reaction is the sum of the individual reactions, or $-2.35 \mathrm{kcal}$. The individual reactions are
Glucose + ATP $\rightarrow$ glucose $6-\mathrm{P}+\mathrm{ADP}$
$\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}=-4.0 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$
glucose $6-\mathrm{P} \rightarrow$ glucose $1-\mathrm{P}$
$\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}=+1.65 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$
Therefore,
Glucose + ATP $\rightarrow$ glucose $1-\mathrm{P}+\mathrm{ADP}$
$\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}=-2.35 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$
Thus, the cleavage of ATP has made the synthesis of glucose $1-P$ from glucose energetically favorable.

Approximately $70 \%$ of our resting daily energy requirement arises from work carried out by our largest organs: the heart, brain, kidneys, and liver. Using their rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption and an assumption that for each mole of oxygen atom consumed, 2.5 mol of ATP are synthesized (see Chapter 24), it can be estimated that each of these organs is using and producing several times its own weight in ATP each day.

| Estimated Daily Use of ATP <br> (g ATP/g Tissue) |  |
| :-- | :--: |
| Heart | 16 |
| Brain | 6 |
| Kidneys | 24 |
| Liver | 6 |
| Skeletal muscle (rest) | 0.3 |
| Skeletal muscle (running) | 23.6 |

The heart, which rhythmically contracts, is using this ATP for mechanical work. In contrast, skeletal muscles in a resting individual use far less ATP per gram of tissue. The kidney has an ATP consumption per gram of tissue similar to that of the heart and uses this ATP largely for transport work to recover usable nutrients and to maintain $\mathrm{p} / \mathrm{I}$ and electrolyte balance. The brain, likewise, uses most of its ATP for transport work, maintaining the ion gradients necessary for conduction of nerve impulses. The liver, in contrast, has a high rate of ATP consumption and use to carry out metabolic work (biosynthesis and detoxification). Otto S. realizes that his resting daily energy requirement will remain constant, and for him to lose weight, he will have to eat less, exercise more, or both.
reach equilibrium starting with 1 M concentrations of substrate and product. For a reaction in which the substrate S is converted to the product P ,

$$
\Delta \mathrm{G}=\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}+\mathrm{RT} \ln [\mathrm{P}] /[\mathrm{S}]
$$

Equation 20.2.
(See Table 20.2 for the general form of this equation.)
The expression for $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ has two terms: $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$, the energy change to reach equilibrium starting at equal and 1 M concentrations of substrates and products; and the second term, the energy change to reach equal concentrations of substrate and product starting from any initial concentration. (When $[\mathrm{P}]=[\mathrm{S}]$ and $[\mathrm{P}] /[\mathrm{S}]=1, \ln [\mathrm{P}] /[\mathrm{S}]=0$, and $\Delta \mathrm{G}=\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$. ) The second term will be negative for all concentrations of substrate greater than product, and the greater the substrate concentration, the more negative this term will be. Thus, if the substrate concentration is suddenly raised high enough or the product concentration is decreased low enough, $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ (the sum of the first and second terms) will also be negative, and conversion of substrate to product becomes thermodynamically favorable.

## 2. The Reversibility of the Phosphoglucomutase Reaction in the Cell

The effect of substrate and product concentration on $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ and the direction of a reaction in the cell can be illustrated with conversion of glucose $6-\mathrm{P}$ to glucose $1-\mathrm{P}$, the reaction catalyzed by phosphoglucomutase in the pathway of glycogen synthesis (see Fig. 20.3). The reaction has a small positive $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ for glucose $1-\mathrm{P}$ synthesis $(+1.65 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol})$ and, at equilibrium, the ratio of [glucose $1-\mathrm{P}] /[$ glucose $6-\mathrm{P}]$ is approximately 6/94 (which was determined using Equation 20.1). However, if another reaction uses glucose $1-\mathrm{P}$ such that this ratio suddenly becomes $3 / 94$, there is now a driving force for converting more glucose $6-\mathrm{P}$ to glucose $1-\mathrm{P}$ and restoring the equilibrium ratio. Substitution in Equation 20.2 gives $\Delta \mathrm{G}$, the driving force to equilibrium, as $+1.65+$ RT ln[glucose $1-\mathrm{P}] /[$ glucose $6-\mathrm{P}]=1.65+(-2.06)=$ $-0.41 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$, which is a negative value. Thus, a decrease in the ratio of product to substrate has converted the synthesis of glucose 1-P from a thermodynamically unfavorable to a thermodynamically favorable reaction that will proceed in the forward direction until equilibrium is reached.

## C. Activated Intermediates with High-Energy Bonds

Many biochemical pathways form activated intermediates containing high-energy bonds to facilitate biochemical work. The term "high-energy bond" is a biologic term defined by the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ for ATP hydrolysis; any bond that can be hydrolyzed with the release of approximately as much, or more, energy than ATP is called a highenergy bond. The high-energy bond in activated intermediates, such as UDP-glucose in glycogen synthesis, facilitate energy transfer.

Cells use guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and cytidine triphosphate (CTP), as well as UTP and ATP, to form activated intermediates. Different anabolic pathways generally use different nucleotides as their direct source of high-energy phosphate bonds: UTP is used for combining sugars, CTP in lipid synthesis, and GTP in protein synthesis.

The high-energy phosphate bonds of UTP, GTP, and CTP are energetically equivalent to ATP and are synthesized from ATP by nucleoside diphosphokinases and nucleoside monophosphokinases. For example, UTP is formed from UDP by a nucleoside diphosphokinase in the reaction

$$
\mathrm{ATP}+\mathrm{UDP} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{UTP}+\mathrm{ADP}
$$

ADP is converted back to ATP by the process of oxidative phosphorylation, using energy supplied by fuel oxidation.

Energy-requiring reactions often generate the nucleoside diphosphate ADP. Adenylate kinase, an important enzyme in cellular energy balance, is a nucleoside

monophosphate kinase that transfers a phosphate from one ADP to another ADP to form ATP and adenosine monophosphate (AMP):

$$
\mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{ADP} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{AMP}+\mathrm{ATP}
$$

This enzyme can thus regenerate ATP under conditions in which ATP use is required.
In addition to the nucleoside triphosphates, other compounds containing highenergy bonds are formed to facilitate energy transfer in anabolic and catabolic pathways (e.g., 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate in glycolysis and acetyl coenzyme A [acetyl-CoA] in the tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle) (Fig. 20.7). Creatine phosphate contains a high-energy phosphate bond that allows it to serve as an energy reservoir for ATP synthesis and transport in muscle cells, neurons, and spermatozoa. A common feature of these molecules is that all of these high-energy bonds are "unstable," and their hydrolysis yields substantial free energy because the products are much more stable as a result of electron resonance within their structures.

## IV. Thermogenesis

According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy cannot be destroyed. Thus, energy from oxidation of a fuel (its caloric content) must be equal to the amount of heat released, the work performed against the environment, and the increase in order of molecules in our bodies. Some of the energy from fuel oxidation is converted into heat as the fuel is oxidized, and some heat is generated as ATP is used to do work. If we become less efficient in converting energy from fuel oxidation into ATP, or if we use an additional amount of ATP for muscular contraction, we will oxidize an additional amount of fuel to maintain ATP homeostasis (constant cellular ATP levels). With the oxidation of additional fuel, we release additional heat. Thus, heat production is a natural consequence of "burning fuel."

The term thermogenesis refers to energy expended for the purpose of generating heat in addition to that expended for ATP production. To maintain the body at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ despite changes in environmental temperature, it is necessary to regulate fuel oxidation and its efficiency (as well as heat dissipation). In shivering thermogenesis, we respond to sudden cold with asynchronous muscle contractions (shivers) that increase ATP use and therefore fuel oxidation and the release of energy as heat. In nonshivering thermogenesis (adaptive thermogenesis), the efficiency of converting energy from fuel oxidation into ATP is decreased. More fuel needs to be oxidized to maintain constant ATP levels, and thus, more heat is generated.

## V. Energy from Fuel Oxidation

Fuel oxidation provides energy for bodily processes principally through generation of the reduced coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD[2H]). They are used principally to generate ATP in oxidative phosphorylation. However, fuel oxidation also generates NADPH, which is most often used directly in energy-requiring processes. Carbohydrates also may be used to generate ATP through a nonoxidative pathway called anaerobic glycolysis.

## A. Energy Transfer from Fuels through Oxidative Phosphorylation

Fuel oxidation is our major source of ATP and our major means of transferring energy from the chemical bonds of the fuels to cellular energy-requiring processes. The amount of energy available from a fuel is equivalent to the amount of heat that is generated when a fuel is burned. To conserve this energy for the generation of ATP, the process of cellular respiration transforms the energy from the chemical bonds of fuels into the reduction state of electron-accepting coenzymes, $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and FAD (Fig. 20.8, circle 1). As these compounds transfer electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the ETC, most of this energy is transformed into an electrochemical gradient across the inner

Creatine phosphate is a high-energy phosphate reservoir and shuttle in brain, muscle, and spermatozoa. Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) is a precursor of the TCA cycle. The high-energy bonds are shown in red.

Stanley T. has increased thyroid hormone levels that increase his rate of ATP use and fuel oxidation. An excess of thyroid hormones also may affect the efficiency of ATP production, resulting in fewer ATP produced for a given level of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption. The increased rate of ATP use and diminished efficiency stimulate oxidative metabolism, resulting in a much greater rate of heat production. The hyperthyroid patient, therefore, complains of constantly feeling hot (heat intolerance) and sweaty. (Perspiration allows dissipation of excess heat through evaporation from the skin surface.)

# I. Oxidation-Reduction Reactions 

Oxidation-reduction reactions always involve a pair of chemicals: an electron donor, which is oxidized in the reactions; and an electron acceptor, which is reduced in the reaction. In fuel metabolism, the fuel donates electrons and is oxidized, and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ and FAD accept electrons and are reduced.

To remember this, think of the acronym LEO GER: Loss of Electrons $=O$ xidation; Gain of Electrons $=$ Reduction. Compounds are oxidized in the body in essentially three ways: (1) the transfer of electrons from the compound as a hydrogen atom or a hydride ion, (2) the direct addition of oxygen from $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, and (3) the direct donation of electrons (e.g., $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+} \rightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ) (see Chapter 5). Fuel oxidation involves the transfer of electrons as a hydrogen atom or a hydride ion, and thus, reduced compounds have more hydrogen relative to oxygen than the oxidized compounds. Consequently, aldehydes are more reduced than acids, and alcohols are more reduced than aldehydes.

When is $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, rather than FAD, used in a particular oxidation-reduction reaction? It depends on the chemical properties of the electron donor and the enzyme catalyzing the reaction. In oxidation reactions, $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$accepts two electrons as a hydride ion to form NADH, and a proton $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$is released into the medium (Fig. 20.9). It is generally used for metabolic reactions involving oxidation of alcohols and aldehydes. In contrast, FAD accepts two electrons as hydrogen atoms, which are donated singly from separate atoms (e.g., formation of a double bond or a disulfide) (Fig. 20.10).

As the reduced coenzymes donate these electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ through the ETC, they are reoxidized. The energy derived from reoxidation of NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ is available for the generation of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. In our analogy of ATP as currency, the reduced coenzymes are our paychecks for oxidizing fuels. Because our cells spend ATP so fast, we must immediately convert our paychecks into ATP cash.

FIGURE 20.9 Reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$) and $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$. These structurally related coenzymes are reduced by accepting two electrons as $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, the hydride ion.

# 2. Reduction Potential 

Each oxidation-reduction reaction makes or takes a fixed amount of energy $\left(\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}\right)$, which is directly proportional to the $\Delta \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ (the difference in reduction potentials of the oxidation-reduction pair). The reduction potential of a compound, $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{tr}}$, is a measure in volts of the energy change when that compound accepts electrons (becomes reduced); $-\Delta \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ is the energy change when the compound donates electrons (becomes oxidized). $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ can be considered an expression of the willingness of the

FIGURE 20.10 Reduction of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FAD accepts two electrons as two hydrogen atoms and is reduced. The reduced coenzyme is denoted in this text as $F A D(2 H)$ because it often accepts a total of two electrons one at a time, never going to the fully reduced form, $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$. Flavin mononucleotide consists of riboflavin with one phosphate group attached.

compound to accept electrons. Some examples of reduction potentials are shown in Table 20.4. Oxygen, which is the best electron acceptor, has the largest positive reduction potential (i.e., is the most willing to accept electrons and be reduced). As a consequence, the transfer of electrons from all compounds to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is energetically favorable and occurs with energy release.

The more negative the reduction potential of a compound, the greater is the energy available for ATP generation when that compound passes its electrons to oxygen. The $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{ff}}$ for transfer of electrons from NADH to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is greater than the transfer from $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see the reduction potential values for NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}[2 \mathrm{H}]$ in Table 20.4). Thus, the energy available for ATP synthesis from NADH is approximately -53 kcal , and from the FAD-containing flavoproteins in the ETC is approximately -41 kcal .

To calculate the free-energy change of an oxidation-reduction reaction, the reduction potential of the electron donor $(\mathrm{NADH})$ is added to that of the acceptor $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$. The $\Delta \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{ff}}$ for the net reaction is calculated from the sum of the half-reactions. For NADH donation of electrons, it is +0.320 V , opposite of that shown in Table 20.4 (remember, Table 20.4 shows the $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{ff}}$ for accepting electrons), and for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ acceptance, it is +0.816 V . The number of electrons being transferred is 2 (so, $n=2$ ). The direct relationship between the energy changes in oxidation-reduction reactions and $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{ff}}$ is expressed by the Nernst equation

$$
\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{ff}}=-n \mathrm{~F} \Delta \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{ff}}
$$

Equation 20.3.
where $n$ is the number of electrons transferred and F is Faraday constant ( $23 \mathrm{kcal} /$ $\mathrm{mol}-\mathrm{V})$. Thus, a value of approximately $-53 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$ is obtained for the energy available for ATP synthesis by transferring two electrons from NADH to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. The $\Delta \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{ff}}$ for $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ to donate electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is 1.016 V , compared to a $\Delta \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{ff}}$ of 1.136 V for electron transfer from NADH to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

## 3. Caloric Values of Fuels

The caloric value of a food is related directly to its oxidation state, which is a measure of $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{ff}}$ for transfer of electrons from that fuel to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. The electrons donated by the fuel are from its $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ and $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bonds. Fatty acids such as palmitate, $\mathrm{CH}_{3}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2}\right)_{14} \mathrm{COOH}$, have a caloric value of roughly $9 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$. Glucose is already partially oxidized and has a caloric value of only about $4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$. The carbons, on average, contain fewer $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds from which to donate electrons.

The caloric value of a food is applicable in humans only if our cells have enzymes that can oxidize that fuel by transferring electrons from the fuel to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$, or FAD. When we burn wood in a fireplace, electrons are transferred from cellulose and other carbohydrates to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, releasing energy as heat. However, wood has no caloric content for humans; we cannot digest it and convert cellulose to a form that can be oxidized by our enzymes. Cholesterol, although it is a lipid, also has no caloric value for us because we cannot oxidize the carbons in its complex ring structure in reactions that generate NADH, FAD(2H), or NADPH.

## B. NADPH in Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

$\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$is similar to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and has the same reduction potential. However, $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$ has an extra phosphate group on the ribose, which affects its enzyme binding (see Fig. 20.9). Consequently, most enzymes use either $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$or $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$but seldom both. In certain reactions, fuels are oxidized by transfer of electrons to $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$to form NADPH. For example, glucose 6-P dehydrogenase, in the pentose phosphate pathway, transfers electrons from glucose 6-P to $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$instead of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. NADPH usually donates electrons to biosynthetic reactions such as fatty acid synthesis and to detoxification reactions that use oxygen directly. Consequently, the energy in its reduction potential is usually used in energy-requiring reactions without first being converted to ATP currency.

## C. Anaerobic Glycolysis

Not all ATP is generated by fuel oxidation. In anaerobic glycolysis, glucose is degraded in reactions that form high-energy phosphorylated intermediates of the pathway (Fig. 20.11). These activated high-energy intermediates provide the energy for the generation of ATP from ADP without involving electron transfer to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Therefore, this pathway is called anaerobic glycolysis, and ATP is generated from substrate-level phosphorylation rather than from oxidative phosphorylation (see Chapter 24). Anaerobic glycolysis is a critical source of ATP for cells that have a decreased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ supply either because they are physiologically designed that way (e.g., cells in the kidney medulla, rapidly working muscle, red blood cells) or because their supply of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ has been pathologically decreased (e.g., coronary artery disease).

## VI. Oxygenases and Oxidases Not Involved in ATP Generation

Approximately $90 \%$ to $95 \%$ of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ we consume is used by the terminal oxidase in the ETC for ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation. The remainder of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is used directly by oxygenases and other oxidases, enzymes that oxidize a compound in the body by transferring electrons directly to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (Fig. 20.12). The large positive reduction potential of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ makes all of these reactions extremely favorable thermodynamically, but the electronic structure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ slows the speed of electron transfer. These enzymes, therefore, contain a metal ion that facilitates reduction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

## A. Oxidases

Oxidases transfer electrons from the substrate to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which is reduced to water $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$ or to hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$. The terminal protein complex in the ETC, called cytochrome oxidase, is an oxidase because it accepts electrons donated to the chain by NADH and FAD(2H) and uses these to reduce $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Most of the other oxidases in the cell form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ instead of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and are called peroxidases. Peroxidases are generally confined to peroxisomes to protect DNA and other cellular components from toxic free radicals (compounds containing single electrons in an outer orbital) generated by $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$.

# B. Oxygenases 

Oxygenases, in contrast to oxidases, incorporate one or both of the atoms of oxygen into the organic substrate (see Fig. 20.12). Monooxygenases, enzymes that incorporate one atom of oxygen into the substrate and the other into $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, are often named hydroxylases (e.g., phenylalanine hydroxylase, which adds a hydroxyl group to phenylalanine to form tyrosine) or mixed-function oxidases. Monooxygenases require an electron-donor substrate, such as NADPH; a coenzyme such as FAD, which can transfer single electrons; and a metal or similar compound that can form a reactive oxygen complex. They are usually found in the endoplasmic reticulum and occasionally in mitochondria. Dioxygenases, enzymes that incorporate both atoms of oxygen into the substrate, are used in the pathways for converting arachidonate into prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes.

## VII. Energy Balance

Our total energy expenditure is equivalent to our $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption (Fig. 20.13). The resting metabolic rate (energy expenditure of a person at rest, at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, after an overnight fast) accounts for approximately $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ of our total energy expenditure and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption, and physical exercise accounts for the remainder. Of the resting metabolic rate, approximately $90 \%$ to $95 \%$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption is used by the mitochondrial ETC, and only $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ is required for nonmitochondrial oxidases and oxygenases and is not related to ATP synthesis. Approximately 20\% to 30\% of the energy from this mitochondrial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption is lost by proton leak back across the mitochondrial membrane, which dissipates the electrochemical gradient without ATP synthesis. The remainder of our $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption is used for ATPases that maintain ion gradients and for biosynthetic pathways.

ATP homeostasis refers to the ability of our cells to maintain constant levels of ATP despite fluctuations in the rate of use. Thus, increased use of ATP for exercise or biosynthetic reactions increases the rate of fuel oxidation. The major mechanism used is feedback regulation; all of the pathways of fuel oxidation that lead to generation of ATP are feedback-regulated by ATP levels or by compounds related to the concentration of ATP. In general, the less ATP is used, the less fuel will be oxidized to generate ATP.

According to the first law of thermodynamics, the energy (in calories) in our consumed fuel can never be lost. Consumed fuel is either oxidized to meet the energy

demands of the BMR plus exercise, or it is stored as fat. Thus, an intake of calories in excess of those expended results in weight gain. The simple statement, "If you eat too much and don't exercise, you will gain weight," is really a summary of the bioenergetics of the ATP-ADP cycle.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

Otto S. Otto S. visited his physician, who noted the increased weight. The physician recommended several diet modifications to Otto that would decrease the caloric content of his diet and pointed out the importance of exercise for weight reduction. He reminded Otto that the American Heart Association recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least 5 days per week or at least 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least 3 days per week. He also reminded Otto that he would want to be a role model for his patients. Otto decided to begin an exercise regimen that included at least 30 minutes of running and tennis at least 5 days a week.

Stanley T. Mr. T. exhibited the classical signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism (increased secretion of the thyroid hormones $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$; see Fig. 11.8 for the structure of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ ), including a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland). $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is the more active form of the hormone. $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ is synthesized and secreted in approximately 10 times greater amounts than $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. Liver and other cells contain an enzyme (a deiodinase) that removes one of the iodines from $\mathrm{T}_{4}$, converting it to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. Thyroid function tests confirmed this diagnosis.

Thyroid hormones (principally $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ ) modulate cellular energy production and use through their ability to increase gene transcription (see Fig. 16.13) of many proteins involved in intermediary metabolism, including enzymes in the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. They increase the rate of ATP use by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}-$ ATPase and other enzymes. They also affect the efficiency of energy transformations, so that either more fuel must be oxidized to maintain a given level of ATP or more ATP must be expended to achieve the desired physiologic response. The loss of weight experienced by Stanley T., in spite of a very good appetite, reflects his increased caloric requirements and less efficient use of fuels. The result is enhanced oxidation of adipose tissue stores as well as a catabolic effect on muscle and other protein-containing tissues. Through mechanisms that are not well understood, increased levels of thyroid hormone in the blood also increase the activity or "tone" of the sympathetic (adrenergic) nervous system. An activated sympathetic nervous system leads to a more rapid and forceful heartbeat (tachycardia and palpitations), increased nervousness (anxiety and insomnia), tremulousness (a sense of shakiness or jitteriness), and other symptoms.

Cora N. Cora N. was in left ventricular heart failure (LVF) when she presented to the hospital with her second heart attack in 8 months. The diagnosis of LVF was suspected, in part, by her rapid heart rate ( 104 beats/ minute) and respiratory rate. On examining her lungs, her physician heard respiratory rales (or crackles) caused by inspired air bubbling in fluid that had filled her lung air spaces secondary to LVF. This condition is referred to as congestive heart failure.

Cora's rapid heart rate (tachycardia) resulted from a reduced capacity of her ischemic, failing left ventricular muscle to eject a normal amount of blood into the arteries leading away from the heart with each contraction. The resultant drop in intra-arterial pressure signaled a reflex response in the central nervous system that, in turn, caused an increase in heart rate in an attempt to bring the total amount of blood leaving the left ventricle each minute (the cardiac output) back toward a more appropriate level to maintain systemic blood pressure.

Initial treatment of Cora's congestive heart failure will include efforts to reduce the workload of the heart by decreasing blood volume (preload) with diuretics and decreasing her blood pressure, and the administration of oxygen by nasal cannula to increase the oxygen levels in her blood.

Congestive heart failure occurs when the weakened pumping action of the left ventricular heart muscle, often from ischemia, leads to a reduced blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body. This leads to an increase in blood volume in the vessels that bring oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart. The pressure inside these pulmonary vessels eventually reaches a critical level, above which water from the blood moves down a "pressure gradient" from the capillary lumen into alveolar air spaces of the lung (transudation). The patient experiences shortness of breath as the fluid in the air spaces interferes with oxygen exchange from the inspired air into arterial blood, causing hypoxia. The hypoxia then stimulates the respiratory center in the central nervous system, leading to a more rapid respiratory rate in an effort to increase the oxygen content of the blood. As the patient inhales deeply, the physician hears gurgling/ cradling sounds (known as inspiratory roles) with a stethoscope placed over the posterior lung bases. These sounds represent the bubbling of inspired air as it enters the fluid-filled pulmonary alveolar air spaces.

FIGURE 20.14 Hypoxia, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and cell death.Without an adequate $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ supply, decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation results in an increase of cytoplasmic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions. Increased ion levels can trigger death cascades that involve increased permeability of the plasma membrane, loss of ion gradients, decreased cytosolic pH , mitochondrial $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ overload, and a change in mitochondrial permeability called the mitochondrial permeability transition. The solid lines show the first sequence of events; the dashed lines show how these events feed back to accelerate the mitochondrial deterioration, making recovery of oxidative phosphorylation impossible.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

Active Transport and Cell Death. Most of us cannot remember when we first learned that we would die if we stopped breathing. But exactly how cells die from a lack of oxygen is an intriguing question. Hypoxia leads to both physical and transcriptional changes. Pathologists generally describe two histologically distinct types of cell death: necrosis and apoptosis (programmed cell death). Cell death from a lack of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, such as occurs during an MI, can be very rapid and is considered necrosis. The lack of ATP for the active transport of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ triggers some of the death cascades that lead to necrosis (Fig. 20.14).

The influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and loss of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient across the plasma membrane is an early event accompanying ATP depletion during interruption of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ supply. One consequence of the increased intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration is that other transport processes driven by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient are impaired. For example, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$exchanger, which normally pumps out $\mathrm{H}^{+}$generated from metabolism in exchange for extracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, can no longer function, and intracellular pH may drop. The increased intracellular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$may impair ATP generation from anaerobic glycolysis. As a consequence of increased intracellular ion concentrations, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ enters the cells and hydropic swelling occurs. Swelling is accompanied by the release of creatine kinase MB subunits, troponin I, and troponin C into the blood. Some of these enzymes are measured in the blood to help diagnose an MI (see Chapters 6 and 7). Swelling is an early event and is considered a reversible stage of cell injury.

Normally, intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration is carefully regulated to fluctuate at low levels (intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration is $<10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$, compared to $\sim 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}$ in extracellular fluid). Fluctuations of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration at these low levels regulate myofibrillar contraction, energy metabolism, and other cellular processes. However, when $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration is increased above this normal range, it triggers cell death (necrosis). High $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentrations activate a phospholipase that increases membrane permeability, resulting in further loss of ion gradients across the cell membrane. They also trigger opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which results in loss of mitochondrial function and further impairs oxidative phosphorylation.

Intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ levels may increase as a result of cell swelling, the lack of ATP for ATP-dependent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ pumps, or the loss of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient. Normally, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-ATPases located in the plasma membrane pump $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ out of the cell. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-$ ATPases in the endoplasmic reticulum, and in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of heart and other muscles, sequester $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ within the membranes, where it is bound by a low-affinity binding protein. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to a nerve impulse, which signals contraction, and the increase of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stimulates both muscle contraction and the oxidation of fuels. Within the heart, another $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ transporter protein, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ exchange transporter, coordinates the efflux of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in exchange for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, so that $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is extruded with each contraction.

Hypoxia also induces the transcription of genes in an attempt to compensate for the hypoxic conditions. A family of transcription factors, known as hypoxiainducible factors (HIFs), are activated under hypoxic conditions. These factors bind to hypoxia-responsive elements (promoter-proximal elements) in the regulatory region of target genes. More than 70 target genes are regulated by HIFs, including the gene for erythropoietin, which stimulates increased red blood cell production. Induction of these genes allows cells to adapt to and survive for some time under these hypoxic conditions.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Bioenergetics refers to cellular energy transformations.
- The high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP are a cell's primary source of energy.
- ATP is generated through cellular respiration, the oxidation of fuels to carbon dioxide and water.
- ATP can also be generated, at reduced levels, via anaerobic glycolysis (in the absence of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ).
- The electrons captured from fuel oxidation generate NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$, which are used to regenerate ATP via the process of oxidative phosphorylation.
- The energy available from ATP hydrolysis can be used for the following:
- Mechanical work (muscle contraction)
- Transport work (establishment of ion gradients across membranes)
- Biochemical work (energy-requiring chemical reactions, including detoxification reactions)
- Energy released from fuel oxidation that is not used for work is transformed into and released as heat.
- The many pathways of fuel oxidation are coordinately regulated to maintain ATP homeostasis.
- $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ is the change in Gibbs free energy at pH 7.0 under standard conditions between the substrates and products of a reaction.
- Fuel oxidation has a negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$; the products formed have less chemical energy than the reactants (an exergonic reaction pathway).
- ATP synthesis has a positive $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ and is endergonic; the reaction requires energy.
- Metabolic pathways have an overall negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$, which is obtained by summing all of the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ values for each reaction in the pathway.
- Oxidation-reduction reactions can be related to changes in free energy, the use of $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{tr}}$, the chemical's affinity for electrons. Compounds with higher $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ values have greater affinity for electrons than those with lower $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ values.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 20.5.

TABLE 20.5 Diseases Discussed in Chapter 20

| DISEASE OR DISORDER | ENVIRONMENTAL OR GENETIC | COMMENTS |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Obesity | Both | Understanding daily caloric needs can enable one to gain or lose weight through alterations in exercise and eating habits. |
| Hyperthyroidism | Both | Thyroid hormone is important in regulating energy metabolism; excessive triiodothyronine $\left(T_{3}\right)$ and tetraiodothyronine $\left(T_{4}\right)$ release enhance metabolism, leading to weight loss and a greater rate of heat production. |
| Myocardial infarction (heart attack) | Both | The heart requires a constant level of energy, derived primarily from lactate, glucose, and fatty acids. This is necessary so that the rate of contraction can remain constant or increase during appropriate periods. Interference of oxygen flow to certain areas of the heart will reduce energy generation, leading to a myocardial infarction. |

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is E. Both of the high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP are located between phosphate groups (both the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-phosphates, and the $\beta$ - and $\gamma$-phosphates). The phosphate bond between the $\alpha$-phosphate and ribose (or adenosine) is not a highenergy bond (thus, A and B are incorrect); and there is no phosphate between the ribose and adenine, or two hydroxyl groups in the ribose ring; therefore, answers C and D are incorrect.
2. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. The change in enthalpy, $\Delta \mathrm{H}$, is the total amount of heat that can be released in a reaction. The first law of thermodynamics states that the total energy of a system remains constant, and the second law of thermodynamics states the universe tends toward a state of disorder (thus, A and B are incorrect). Answer D is incorrect because $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0^{\circ}}$ is the standard free-energy change measured at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and a pH of 7 . Answer E is incorrect because a high-energy bond releases more than about 7 $\mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$ of heat when it is hydrolyzed. The definition of a high-energy bond is based on the hydrolysis of one of the high-energy bonds of ATP.
3. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The concentration of the substrates and products influence the direction of a reaction. Answer B is incorrect because reactions with a positive free energy, at 1 M concentrations of substrate and product, will proceed in the reverse direction. Answer C is incorrect because substrate and product concentrations do influence the free energy of a reaction. Answer D is incorrect because the free energy must be considered (in addition to the substrate and product concentrations) to determine the direction of a reaction. Answer E is false; an enzyme's efficiency does not influence the direction of a reaction.
4. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. A heart attack results in decreased pumping of blood, and thus a decreased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ supply to
the heart (thus, A is incorrect). The lack of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ leads to a lack of ATP (thus, B is incorrect) owing to an inability to perform oxidative phosphorylation. The lack of ATP impairs the working of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase, which pumps sodium out of the cell in exchange for potassium. Therefore, intracellular levels of sodium will increase as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ enters the cell through other transport mechanisms (thus, E is incorrect). The high intracellular sodium concentration then blocks the functioning of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$antiporter (which sends protons out of the cell in exchange for sodium). Because intracellular sodium is high, the driving force for this reaction is lost, which leads to increased intracellular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, or a lower intracellular pH (thus, C is correct). The intracellular pH also decreases because of glycolysis in the absence of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which produces lactic acid. The loss of the sodium gradient, coupled with the lack of ATP, leads to increased calcium in the cell (thus, D is incorrect) owing to an inability to pump calcium out.
5. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$accepts two electrons as hydride ions to form NADH (thus, A and B are incorrect). Answers D and E are incorrect because FAD can accept two single electrons from separate atoms, together with protons, or FAD can accept a pair of electrons.
6. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. When a protein is phosphorylated, the most likely sites of phosphorylation are the hydroxyl groups of serine, threonine, or tyrosine. Prior to phosphorylation, those hydroxyl groups on the amino acid side chains can only participate in hydrogen bonds. When phosphorylated, the oxygen of the hydroxyl group is now covalently linked to the phosphate, which has two negative charges. This allows this group to form ionic bonds, which were not available prior to phosphorylation. The formation of ionic bonds then alters the tertiary and/or the quaternary structure of the protein. The addition of phosphate groups reduces the hydrophobicity

of this region of the protein, and the primary structure of the protein is the linear sequence of amino acids and does not involve hydrogen bond formation.
7. The answer is $\mathbf{D} . \Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}$ values are additive for a series of reactions. In order to generate the overall reaction required, creatine + ATP yields ADP + creatine phosphate, the second reaction listed in the question needs to be reversed. Upon reversing a reaction, the sign of the standard free energy is reversed, in this case becoming +10.3 for the reaction creatine + inorganic phosphate yields creatine phosphate $+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Upon summing the first reaction, and the reversed second reaction, the overall reaction is obtained and the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\circ}=10.3-7.3$, or $+3.0 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$.
8. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. More than $90 \%$ of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ we breathe is used for cellular respiration, the overall process of transferring the electrons obtained from oxidizing fuels to oxygen in order to generate ATP. When ATP energy is needed, a high-energy phosphate bond of ATP is cleaved, forming ADP. $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and FAD are electronaccepting coenzymes that accept electrons from fuels as they are oxidized, and the electron carriers are reduced to NADH and FAD(2H). NADH and FAD(2H) donate their electrons to the electron transfer chain in order to generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Generation of acetyl-CoA is only phase 1 of cellular
respiration and does not by itself generate ATP. In phase 2, oxidation of acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle collects energy as NADH and FAD(2H) in order to generate ATP.
9. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. The instability of the phosphoanhydride bonds arises from their negatively charged phosphate groups that repel each other and strain their bonds. ATP has more negatively charged phosphate groups (4) than ADP (3), reflective of ATP containing two highenergy bonds, and ADP containing one high-energy bond. In the cell, ATP is not hydrolyzed directly; rather, it is hydrolyzed in specific reactions that require energy to be pushed toward product formation. ATP is also used to form phosphate intermediates that are then substrates for other reactions in a metabolic pathway. The heat released from ATP hydrolysis is used for thermogenesis, but it cannot be used to drive other energy-requiring processes.
10. The answer is D. Biochemical work occurs in anabolic pathways (synthesizing large molecules) or when toxic compounds are converted to nontoxic compounds that can be excreted. Muscle fiber contraction is mechanical work and generating a sodium gradient, or transporting compounds against a concentration gradient, are considered transport work. Catabolic pathways lead to the generation of ATP.

# Digestion,Absorption, and Transport of Carbohydrates 

Carbohydrates are the largest source of dietary calories for most of the world's population. The major carbohydrates in the US diet are starch, lactose, and sucrose. The starches amylose and amylopectin are polysaccharides composed of hundreds to millions of glucosyl units linked together through $\alpha-1,4$ - and $\alpha-1,6$-glycosidic bonds (Fig. 21.1). Lactose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and galactose, linked together through a $\beta-1,4$-glycosidic bond. Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose, linked through an $\alpha-1,2$-glycosidic bond. The digestive processes convert all of these dietary carbohydrates to their constituent monosaccharides by hydrolyzing glycosidic bonds between the sugars.

The digestion of starch begins in the mouth (Fig. 21.2). The salivary gland releases $\alpha$-amylase, which converts starch to smaller polysaccharides called $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-dextrins. Salivary $\alpha$-amylase is inactivated by the acidity of the stomach (hydrochloric acid [HCl]). Pancreatic $\alpha$-amylase and bicarbonate are secreted by the exocrine pancreas into the lumen of the small intestine, where bicarbonate neutralizes the gastric secretions. Pancreatic $\alpha$-amylase continues the digestion of $\alpha$-dextrins, converting them to disaccharides (maltose), trisaccharides (maltotriose), and oligosaccharides called limit dextrins. Limit dextrins usually contain four to nine glucosyl residues and an isomaltose branch (two glucosyl residues attached through an $\alpha-1,6$-glycosidic bond).

The digestion of the disaccharides lactose and sucrose, as well as further digestion of maltose, maltotriose, and limit dextrins, occurs through disaccharidases attached to the membrane surface of the brush border (microvilli) of intestinal epithelial cells. Glucoamylase hydrolyzes the $\alpha-1,4$-bonds of dextrins. The sucrase-isomaltase complex hydrolyzes sucrose, most of maltose, and almost all of the isomaltose formed by glucoamylase from limit dextrins. Lactase-glycosylceramidase ( $\beta$-glycosidase) hydrolyzes the $\beta$-glycosidic bonds in lactose and glycolipids. A fourth disaccharidase complex, trehalase, hydrolyzes the bond (an $\alpha-1,1$-glycosidic bond) between two glucosyl units in the sugar trehalose. The monosaccharides produced by these hydrolases (glucose, fructose, and galactose) are then transported into the intestinal epithelial cells.

Dietary fiber, composed principally of polysaccharides, cannot be digested by enzymes in the human intestinal tract. In the colon, dietary fiber and other nondigested carbohydrates may be converted to gases $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}\right.$, and methane) and shortchain fatty acids (principally acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) by bacteria in the colon.

Glucose, galactose, and fructose formed by the digestive enzymes are transported into the absorptive epithelial cells of the small intestine by proteinmediated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent active transport and facilitative diffusion. Monosaccharides are transported from these cells into the blood and circulate to the liver and peripheral tissues, where they are taken up by facilitative transporters. Facilitative transport of glucose across epithelial cells and other cell membranes is mediated by a family of tissue-specific glucose transport proteins (GLUT I to GLUT 5). The type of transporter found in each cell reflects the role of glucose metabolism in that cell.

FIGURE 21.1 The structures of common dietary carbohydrates. For disaccharides and higher, the sugars are linked through glycosidic bonds between the anomeric carbon of one sugar and a hydroxyl group on another sugar. The glycosidic bond may be either $\alpha$ or $\beta$, depending on its position above or below the plane of the sugar containing the anomeric carbon. (See Chapter 5, Section II.A, to review terms used in the description of sugars.) The starch amylose is a polysaccharide of glucose residues linked with $\alpha-1,4$-glycosidic bonds. Amylopectin is amylose with the addition of $\alpha-1,6$-glycosidic branch points. Dietary sugars may be monosaccharides (single sugar residues), disaccharides (two sugar residues), oligosaccharides (several sugar residues), or polysaccharides (hundreds of sugar residues). For clarity, the hydrogen atoms are not shown in the figure.

FIGURE 21.2 Overview of carbohydrate digestion. Digestion of the carbohydrates occurs first, followed by absorption of monosaccharides. Subsequent metabolic reactions occur after the sugars are absorbed.

# THE WAITING ROOM 

$\square$Denise V. is a 20-year-old exchange student from Nigeria who has noted gastrointestinal bloating, abdominal cramps, and intermittent diarrhea ever since arriving in the United States 6 months ago. A careful history shows that these symptoms occur most commonly about 45 minutes to 1 hour after eating breakfast but may occur after other meals as well. Dairy products, which were not a part of Denise's diet in Nigeria, were identified as the probable offending agent because her gastrointestinal symptoms disappeared when milk and milk products were eliminated from her diet.

Deborah S.'s fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels are frequently above the normal range in spite of good compliance with insulin therapy. Her physician has referred her to a dietician skilled in training diabetic patients in the successful application of an appropriate American Diabetes Association diet. As part of the program, Ms. S. is asked to incorporate foods containing fiber into her diet, such as whole grains (e.g., wheat, oats, corn), legumes (e.g., peas, beans, lentils), tubers (e.g., potatoes, peanuts), and fruits.

(1) The dietary sugar in fruit juice and other sweets is sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose joined through their anomeric carbons. Nina M/s symptoms of pain and abdominal distension are caused by an inability to digest sucrose or absorb fructose, which are converted to gas by colonic bacteria. The possibility of carbohydrate malabsorption was considered, and a hydrogen breath test was recommended.

(2)Starch blockers were marketed many years ago as a means of losing weight without having to exercise or reduce your daily caloric intake. Starch blockers were based on a protein found in beans, which blocked the action of amylase. Thus, as the advertisements proclaimed, one could eat a large amount of starch during a meal, and as long as you took the starch blocker, the starch would pass through the digestive tract without being metabolized. Unfortunately, this was too good to be true, and starch blockers were never shown to be effective in aiding weight loss. This was probably because of a combination of factors, such as inactivation of the inhibitor by the low pH in the stomach, and an excess of amylase activity as compared with the amount of starch blocker ingested. Recently, this issue has been revisited because a starch blocker from wheat has been developed that may work as advertised, although much more research is required to determine whether this amylase inhibitor will be safe and effective in humans. In addition, newer (and improved) preparations of the bean extract are also being readvertised.

(3)Nina M. is a 13-month-old baby girl, the second child born to unrelated parents. Her mother had a healthy, full-term pregnancy, and Nina's birth weight was normal. She did not respond well to breastfeeding and was changed entirely to a formula based on cows' milk at 6 weeks. Between 9 and 18 weeks of age, she was admitted to the hospital twice with a history of screaming after feeding but was discharged after observation without a specific diagnosis. Elimination of cows' milk from her diet did not relieve her symptoms; Nina's mother reported that when Nina turned 1 year old and she introduced some fruit juice into her diet, the screaming bouts were worse, particularly after drinking juice. She also noticed that Nina frequently had gas and a distended abdomen. She was still thriving (weight $>97$ th percentile), with no abnormal findings on physical examination. A stool sample was taken.

## I. Dietary Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are the largest source of calories in the average American diet and usually constitute $40 \%$ to $45 \%$ of our caloric intake. The plant starches amylopectin and amylose, which are present in grains, tubers, and vegetables, constitute approximately $50 \%$ to $60 \%$ of the carbohydrate calories consumed. These starches are polysaccharides, containing 10,000 to 1 million glucosyl units. In amylose, the glucosyl residues form a straight chain linked via $\alpha-1,4$-glycosidic bonds; in amylopectin, the $\alpha-1,4$-chains contain branches connected via $\alpha-1,6$-glycosidic bonds (see Fig. 21.1). The other major sugar found in fruits and vegetables is sucrose, a disaccharide of glucose and fructose (see Fig. 21.1). Sucrose and small amounts of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose are the major natural sweeteners found in fruit, honey, and vegetables. Dietary fiber, the part of the diet that cannot be digested by human enzymes of the intestinal tract, is also composed principally of plant polysaccharides and a polymer called lignin.

Most foods derived from animals, such as meat or fish, contain very little carbohydrate except for small amounts of glycogen (which has a structure similar to amylopectin) and glycolipids. The major dietary carbohydrate of animal origin is lactose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and galactose that is found exclusively in milk and milk products (see Fig. 21.1). Sweeteners, in the form of sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup (starch, partially hydrolyzed and isomerized to fructose), also appear in the diet as additives to processed foods. On average, a person in the United States consumes 65 lb of added sucrose and 40 lb of high-fructose corn syrup solids per year.

Although all cells require glucose for metabolic functions, neither glucose nor other sugars are specifically required in the diet. Glucose can be synthesized from many amino acids found in dietary protein. Fructose, galactose, xylulose, and all the other sugars required for metabolic processes in the human can be synthesized from glucose.

## II. Digestion of Dietary Carbohydrates

In the digestive tract, dietary polysaccharides and disaccharides are converted to monosaccharides by glycosidases, enzymes that hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds between the sugars. All of these enzymes exhibit some specificity for the sugar, the glycosidic bond ( $\alpha$ or $\beta$ ), and the number of saccharide units in the chain. The monosaccharides formed by glycosidases are transported across the intestinal mucosal cells into the interstitial fluid and subsequently enter the bloodstream. Undigested carbohydrates enter the colon, where bacteria may ferment them.

## A. Salivary and Pancreatic $\alpha$-Amylase

The digestion of starch (amylopectin and amylose) begins in the mouth, where chewing mixes the food with saliva. The salivary glands secrete approximately 1 L of liquid per day into the mouth, containing salivary $\alpha$-amylase and other components.

![ma44181198a6](ma44181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 21.3 Action of salivary and pancreatic $\alpha$-amylases.
$\alpha$-Amylase is an endoglycosidase, which means that it hydrolyzes internal $\alpha-1,4-$ bonds between glucosyl residues at random intervals in the polysaccharide chains (Fig. 21.3). The shortened polysaccharide chains that are formed are called $\alpha$-dextrins. Salivary $\alpha$-amylase is largely inactivated by the acidity of the stomach contents, which contain HCl secreted by the parietal cells.

The acidic gastric juice enters the duodenum, the upper part of the small intestine, where digestion continues. Secretions from the exocrine pancreas ( $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day) flow down the pancreatic duct and also enter the duodenum. These secretions contain bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$, which neutralizes the acidic pH of stomach contents, and digestive enzymes, including pancreatic $\alpha$-amylase.

Pancreatic $\alpha$-amylase continues to hydrolyze the starches and glycogen, forming the disaccharide maltose, the trisaccharide maltotriose, and oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides, called limit dextrins, are usually four to nine glucosyl units long and contain one or more $\alpha-1,6$-branches. The two glucosyl residues that contain the $\alpha-1,6$-glycosidic bond eventually become the disaccharide isomaltose.
$\alpha$-Amylase has no activity toward sugar-containing polymers other than glucose linked by $\alpha-1,4$-bonds. $\alpha$-Amylase displays no activity toward the $\alpha-1,6$-bond at branch points and has little activity for the $\alpha-1,4$-bond at the nonreducing end of a chain.

## B. Disaccharidases of the Intestinal Brush-Border Membrane

The dietary disaccharides lactose and sucrose, as well as the products of starch digestion, are converted to monosaccharides by glycosidases attached to the membrane in the brush border of absorptive cells. The different glycosidase activities are found in four glycoproteins: glucoamylase, the sucrase-isomaltase complex, the smaller glycoprotein trehalase, and lactase-glucosylceramidase (Table 21.1). These glycosidases are collectively called the small intestinal disaccharidases, although glucoamylase is really an oligosaccharidase.

Amylase activity in the gut is abundant and is not normally rate-limiting for the process of digestion. Alcohol-induced pancreatitis or surgical removal of part of the pancreas can decrease pancreatic secretion. Pancreatic exocrine secretion into the intestine also can be decreased because of cystic fibrosis (as in Susan F, see Chapter 17), in which mucus blocks the pancreatic duct, which eventually degenerates. However, pancreatic exocrine secretion can be decreased to $10 \%$ of normal and still not affect the rate of starch digestion because amylases are secreted in the saliva and pancreatic fluid in excessive amounts. In contrast, protein and fat digestion are more strongly affected in cystic fibrosis.

Acarbose is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that blocks the activities of pancreatic $\alpha$ amylase and brush-border $\alpha$-glucosidases (with a specificity for glucose). The drug is produced from a microorganism and is a unique tetrasaccharide. Acarbose can be used in patients with type 2 diabetes. It reduces the rate at which ingested carbohydrate reaches the bloodstream after a meal, but flatulence and diarrhea (caused by colonic bacterial metabolism of the nondigested sugars) are side effects of taking this drug, and thus, it is not used very often.

![ma45181198a6](ma45181198a6.jpg)

Can the glycosidic bonds of the structure shown here be hydrolyzed by $\alpha$-amylose?
![ma46181198a6](ma46181198a6.jpg)

## I. Glucoamylase

Glucoamylase and the sucrase-isomaltase complex have similar structures and exhibit a great deal of sequence homogeneity. A membrane-spanning domain near the $N$ terminus attaches the protein to the luminal membrane. The long polypeptide chain forms two globular domains, each with a catalytic site. In glucoamylase, the two catalytic sites have similar activities, with only small differences in substrate specificity. The protein is heavily glycosylated, with oligosaccharides that protect it from digestive proteases.

Glucoamylase is an exoglycosidase that is specific for the $\alpha-1,4$-bonds between glucosyl residues (Fig. 21.4A). It begins at the nonreducing end of a polysaccharide or limit dextrin, and it sequentially hydrolyzes the bonds to release glucose monosaccharides. It will digest a limit dextrin down to isomaltose, the glucosyl disaccharide with an $\alpha-1,6$-branch, that is subsequently hydrolyzed principally by the isomaltase activity in the sucrase-isomaltase complex.

FIGURE 21.4 A. Glucoamylase activity. Glucoamylase is an $\alpha-1,4$-exoglycosidase that initiates cleavage at the nonreducing end of the sugar. Thus, for maltotriose, the bond labeled $I$ is hydrolyzed first, which then allows the bond at position 2 to be the next one hydrolyzed. B. Isomaltase activity. Arrows indicate the $\alpha-1,6$-bonds that are cleaved. C. Trehalose. This disaccharide contains two glucose moieties linked by an unusual bond that joins their anomeric carbons. It is cleaved by trehalase.

## 2. Sucrase-Isomaltase Complex

The structure of the sucrase-isomaltase complex is similar to that of glucoamylase, and these two proteins have a high degree of sequence homology. However, after the single polypeptide chain of sucrase-isomaltase is inserted through the membrane and the protein protrudes into the intestinal lumen, an intestinal protease clips it into two separate subunits that remain attached to each other through noncovalent interactions. Each subunit has a catalytic site that differs in substrate specificity from the other through noncovalent interactions. The sucrase-maltase site accounts for approximately $100 \%$ of the intestine's ability to hydrolyze sucrose in addition to maltase activity; the isomaltase-maltase site accounts for almost all of the intestine's ability to hydrolyze $\alpha-1,6$-bonds (see Fig. 21.4B), in addition to maltase activity. Together, these sites account for approximately $80 \%$ of the maltase activity of the small intestine. The remainder of the maltase activity is found in the glucoamylase complex.

## 3. Trehalase

Trehalase is only half as long as the other disaccharidases and has only one catalytic site. It hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond in trehalose, a disaccharide composed of two glucosyl units linked by an $\alpha$-bond between their anomeric carbons (see Fig. 21.4C). Trehalose, which is found in insects, algae, mushrooms, and other fungi, is not currently a major dietary component in the United States. However, unwitting consumption of trehalose can cause nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms of severe gastrointestinal distress if consumed by an individual deficient in the enzyme. Trehalase deficiency was discovered when a woman became very sick after eating mushrooms and was initially thought to have $\alpha$-amanitin poisoning.

## 4. $\beta$-Glycosidase Complex (Lactase-Glucosylceramidase)

The $\beta$-glycosidase complex is another large glycoprotein found in the brush border that has two catalytic sites extending in the lumen of the intestine. However, its primary structure is very different from that of the other enzymes, and it is attached to the membrane through its carboxyl end by a phosphatidylglycan anchor (see Fig. 10.6). The lactase catalytic site hydrolyzes the $\beta$-bond connecting glucose and galactose in lactose (a $\beta$-galactosidase activity; Fig. 21.5). The major activity of the other catalytic site in humans is the $\beta$-bond between glucose or galactose and ceramide in glycolipids (this catalytic site is sometimes called phlorizin hydrolase, named for its ability to hydrolyze an artificial substrate).

## 5. Location Within the Intestine

The production of maltose, maltotriose, and limit dextrins by pancreatic $\alpha$-amylase occurs in the duodenum, the most proximal portion of the small intestine. Sucraseisomaltase activity is highest in the jejunum, where the enzymes can hydrolyze sucrose and the products of starch digestion. $\beta$-Glycosidase activity is also highest in the jejunum. Glucoamylase activity increases progressively along the length of the small intestine, and its activity is highest in the ileum. Thus, it presents a final opportunity for digestion of starch oligomers that have escaped amylase and disaccharidase activities at the more proximal regions of the intestine.

## Lactose

(1)No. This polysaccharide is cellulose, which contains $\beta-1,4$-glycosidic bonds. Pancreatic and salivary $\alpha$-amylase cleave only $\alpha-1,4$-bonds between glucosyl units.

(2)Individuals with genetic deficiencies of the sucrase-isomaltase complex show symptoms of sucrose intolerance but are able to digest normal amounts of starch in a meal without problems. The maltase activity in the glucoamylase complex, and residual activity in the sucrase-isomaltase complex (which is normally present in excess of need), is apparently sufficient to digest normal amounts of dietary starch.

(3)Which of the bonds in the structure shown here are hydrolyzed by the sucrase-isomaltase complex? Which by glucoamylase?
![ma50181198a6](ma50181198a6.jpg)

Bonds (I) and (3) would first be hydrolyzed by glucoamylase. Bond (2) requires isomaltase. Bonds (4) and (5) can then be hydrolyzed by the sucrase-isomaltase complex or by the glucoamylase complex, all of which can convert maltotriose and maltose to glucose.

## C. Metabolism of Sugars by Colonic Bacteria

Not all of the starch ingested as part of foods is normally digested in the small intestine (Fig. 21.6). Starches that are high in amylose, or are less well-hydrated (e.g., starch in dried beans), are resistant to digestion and enter the colon. Dietary fiber and undigested sugars also enter the colon. Here, colonic bacteria rapidly metabolize the saccharides, forming gases, short-chain fatty acids, and lactate. The major short-chain fatty acids formed are acetic acid (two carbons), propionic acid (three carbons), and butyric acid (four carbons). The short-chain fatty acids are absorbed by the colonic mucosal cells and can provide a substantial source of energy for these cells. The major gases formed are hydrogen gas $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}\right)$, carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$, and methane $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{4}\right)$. These gases are released through the colon, resulting in flatulence, or through the breath. Incomplete products of digestion in the intestines increase the retention of water in the colon, resulting in diarrhea.

## D. Lactose Intolerance

Lactose intolerance refers to a condition of pain, nausea, and flatulence after the ingestion of foods containing lactose, most notably dairy products. Although lactose intolerance is often caused by low levels of lactase, it also can be caused by intestinal injury (defined in the following text).

## I. Nonpersistent and Persistent Lactase

Lactase activity increases in the human from about 6 to 8 weeks of gestation, and it rises during the late gestational period ( 21 to 32 weeks) through full term. It remains high for about 1 month after birth and then begins to decline. For most of the world's population, lactase activity decreases to adult levels at approximately 5 to 7 years of age. Adult levels are $<10 \%$ of those present in infants. These populations have adult hypolactasia (formerly called adult lactase deficiency) and exhibit the lactase nonpersistence phenotype. In people who are derived mainly from Western Northern Europeans, and milk-dependent Nomadic tribes of Saharan Africa, the levels of lactase remain at, or only slightly below, infant levels throughout adulthood (lactase persistence phenotype). Thus, adult hypolactasia is the normal condition for most of the world's population (Table 21.2).

In contrast, congenital lactase deficiency is a severe autosomal-recessive inherited disease in which lactase activity is significantly reduced or totally absent. The disorder presents as soon as the newborn is fed breast milk or lactose-containing formula, resulting in watery diarrhea, weight loss, and dehydration. Treatment consists of removal of lactose from the diet, which allows for normal growth and development to occur.

## 2. Intestinal Injury

Intestinal diseases that injure the absorptive cells of the intestinal villi diminish lactase activity along the intestine, producing a condition known as secondary lactase deficiency. Kwashiorkor (protein malnutrition), colitis, gastroenteritis, tropical and nontropical sprue, and excessive alcohol consumption fall into this category. These diseases also affect other disaccharidases, but sucrase, maltase, isomaltase, and glucoamylase activities are usually present at such excessive levels that there are no pathologic effects. Lactase is usually the first activity lost and the last to recover.

$\mathbf{M}$Nina M. was given a hydrogen breath test, a test measuring the amount of hydrogen gas released after consuming a test dose of sugar. In this test, the patient breathes into a portable meter or a collecting bag attached to a nonportable device. The larger, nonportable devices measure the hydrogen in the breath via gas chromatography. The portable devices measure the hydrogen gas produced using hydrogen-specific electrodes and measuring a current that is created when hydrogen comes into contact with the electrode. The association of Nina's symptoms with her ingestion of fruit juices suggests that she might have a problem resulting from low sucrase activity or an inability to absorb fructose. Her ability to thrive and her adequate weight gain suggest that any deficiencies of the sucrase-isomaltase complex must be partial and do not result in a functionally important reduction in maltase activity (maltase activity is also present in the glucoamylase complex). Her urine tested negative for sugar, suggesting that the problem is in digestion or absorption because only sugars that are absorbed and enter the blood can be found in urine. The basis of the hydrogen breath test is that if a sugar is not absorbed, it is metabolized in the intestinal lumen by bacteria that produce various gases including hydrogen. The test can be accompanied by measurements of the amount of sugar that appear in the blood or feces, and acidity of the feces.

Lactose intolerance can either be the result of a primary deficiency of lactase production in the small bowel (as is the case for Denise $\mathbf{V}_{1}$ ), or it can be secondary to an injury to the intestinal mucosa, where lactase is normally produced. The lactose that is not absorbed is converted by colonic bacteria to lactic acid, methane gas $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{4}\right)$, and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas (see the following figure). The osmotic effect of the lactose and lactic acid in the bowel lumen is responsible for the diarrhea that is often seen as part of this syndrome. Similar symptoms can result from sensitivity to milk proteins (milk intolerance) or from the malabsorption of other dietary sugars.

In adults suspected of having a lactase deficiency, the diagnosis is usually made inferentially when avoidance of all dairy products results in relief of symptoms and a rechallenge with these foods reproduces the characteristic syndrome. If the results of these measures are equivocal, however, the malabsorption of lactose can be determined more specifically by measuring the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ content of the patient's breath after a test dose of lactose has been consumed.

Denise V.'s symptoms did not appear if she took available over-the-counter tablets containing lactase when she ate dairy products.

## III. Dietary Fiber

Dietary fiber is the portion of the diet resistant to digestion by human digestive enzymes. It consists principally of plant materials that are polysaccharide derivatives and lignan (see Fig. 21.6). The components of fiber are often divided into the categories of soluble and insoluble fiber, according to their ability to dissolve in water. Insoluble fiber consists of three major categories: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignins. Soluble fiber categories include pectins, mucilages, and gums (Table 21.3). Although human enzymes cannot digest fiber, the bacterial flora in the normal human gut may metabolize the more soluble dietary fibers to gases and short-chain fatty acids, much as they do undigested starch and sugars. Some of these fatty acids may be absorbed and used by the colonic epithelial cells of the gut, and some may travel to the liver through the hepatic portal vein. We may obtain as much as $10 \%$ of our total calories from compounds produced by bacterial digestion of substances in our digestive tract.

The 2015 Dietary Guideline Advisory Committee issued guidelines for fiber ingestion-anywhere from 22 to $34 \mathrm{~g} /$ day in adults, depending on the age and sex of the individual. No distinction was made between soluble and insoluble fibers. Adult males between the ages of 19 and 30 years require 34 g of fiber per day. Males between 31 and 50 years of age require 30.8 g of fiber per day. Males older than 51 years of age are recommended to consume 28 g of fiber per day. Adult women between 19 and 30 years of age require $28 \mathrm{~g} /$ day. Women between the ages of 31 and 50 years of age are recommended to consume 25.2 g of fiber per day. Women older than 51 years of age are recommended to consume 22 g of fiber per day. These numbers are increased during pregnancy and lactation. One beneficial effect of fiber is seen in diverticular disease in which sacs or pouches may develop in the colon

| NOMENCLATURE | CLASSES OF COMPOUNDS | DIETARY SOURCES |
| Insoluble Fiber |  |  |

because of a weakening of the muscle and submucosal structures. Fiber is thought to "soften" the stool, thereby reducing pressure on the colonic wall and enhancing expulsion of feces.

Certain types of soluble fiber have been associated with disease prevention. For example, pectins may lower blood cholesterol levels by binding bile acids. $\beta$-Glucan (obtained from oats) has also been shown, in some studies, to reduce cholesterol levels through a reduction in bile acid resorption in the intestine (see Chapter 32). Pectins also may have a beneficial effect in the diet of individuals with diabetes mellitus by slowing the rate of absorption of simple sugars and preventing high blood glucose levels after meals. However, each of the beneficial effects that have been related to "fiber" is relatively specific for the type of fiber and the physical form of the food that contains the fiber. This factor, along with many others, has made it difficult to obtain conclusive results from studies of the effects of fiber on human health.

## IV. Absorption of Sugars

Once the carbohydrates have been split into monosaccharides, the sugars are transported across the intestinal epithelial cells and into the blood for distribution to all tissues. Not all complex carbohydrates are digested at the same rate within the intestine, and some carbohydrate sources lead to a near-immediate rise in blood glucose levels after ingestion, whereas others slowly raise blood glucose levels over an extended period after ingestion. The glycemic index of a food is an indication of how rapidly blood glucose levels rise after consumption. Glucose and maltose have the highest glycemic indices (defined as 100). Table 21.4 indicates the glycemic index for a variety of food types. Although there is no need to memorize this table, note that cornflakes and potatoes have high glycemic indices, whereas yogurt and skim milk have particularly low glycemic indices.

The glycemic response to ingested foods depends not only on the glycemic index of the foods but also on the fiber and fat content of the food as well as its method of preparation. Highly glycemic carbohydrates can be consumed before and

0Beans, peas, soybeans, and other leguminous plants contain oligosaccharides with linked galactose residues that cannot be hydrolyzed for absorption, including sucrose with one, two, or three galactose residues attached (see Fig. 21.6). What is the fate of these polysaccharides in the intestine?

These sugars are not digested well by the human intestine but form good sources of energy for the bacteria of the gut. These bacteria convert the sugars to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$, lactic acid, and short-chain fatty acids. The amount of gas released after a meal containing beans is especially notorious.

The dietitian explained to Deborah 5. the rationale for a person with diabetes to follow a carbohydrate-controlled diet using meal-planning tools such as carbohydrate counting (www.diabetes.org, click on Food and Fitness). It is important for Deborah to add a variety of fibers, particularly soluble fiber, to her diet. The gelforming, water-retaining pectins and gums found in foods such as oatmeal, nuts, beans, lentils, and apples delay gastric emptying and retard the rate of absorption of disaccharides and monosaccharides, thus reducing the rate at which blood glucose levels rise. Although research has shown that the total amount of carbohydrate is most influential on blood glucose levels, the quality of carbohydrate-the glycemic index of foods-may also need to be considered for optimal maintenance of blood glucose levels in people with diabetes. Consumption of a low-glycemic-index diet results in a lower rise in blood glucose levels after eating, which can be more easily controlled by exogenous insulin. For example, Ms. S. is advised to eat pasta and barley (glycemic indices of 49 and 28 , respectively) instead of potatoes (glycemic index of 63 to 87 , depending on the method of preparation) and to incorporate breakfast cereals composed of wheat, bran, barley, and oats into her morning routine. Because the total amount and the type of carbohydrate influence blood glucose levels, Deborah is advised to consume lower glycemic index foods in appropriate portions.
after exercise because their metabolism results in a rapid entry of glucose into the blood, where it is then immediately available for use by muscle cells. Low-glycemic carbohydrates enter the circulation slowly and can be used to best advantage if consumed before exercise, such that as exercise progresses, glucose is slowly being absorbed from the intestine into the circulation, where it can be used to maintain blood glucose levels during the exercise period.

## A. Absorption by the Intestinal Epithelium

Glucose is transported through the absorptive cells of the intestine by facilitated diffusion and by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent facilitated transport. (See Chapter 10 for a description of transport mechanisms.) The glucose molecule is extremely polar and cannot diffuse through the hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane. Each hydroxyl group of the glucose molecule forms at least two hydrogen bonds with water molecules, and random movement would require energy to dislodge the polar hydroxyl groups from their hydrogen bonds and to disrupt the van der Waals forces between the hydrocarbon tails of the fatty acids in the membrane phospholipid. Glucose, therefore, enters the absorptive cells by binding to transport proteins, membrane-spanning proteins that bind the glucose molecule on one side of the membrane and release it on the opposite side. Two types of glucose transport proteins are present in the intestinal absorptive cells: the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent glucose transporters and the facilitative glucose transporters (Fig. 21.7).

## I. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-Dependent Transporters

$\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent glucose transporters, which are located on the luminal side of the absorptive cells, enable these cells to concentrate glucose from the intestinal lumen. A low intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration is maintained by a $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase on the serosal (blood) side of the cell that uses the energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cleavage to pump $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$out of the cell into the blood. Thus, the transport of glucose from a low concentration in the lumen to a high concentration in the cell is promoted by the cotransport of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from a high concentration in the lumen to a low concentration in the cell (secondary active transport). Similar transporters are found in the epithelial cells of the kidney, which are thus able to transport glucose against its concentration gradient.

## 2. Facilitative Glucose Transporters

Facilitative glucose transporters, which do not bind $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, are located on the serosal side of the cells. Glucose moves via the facilitative transporters from the high concentration inside the cell to the lower concentration in the blood without the expenditure of energy. In addition to the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent glucose transporters, facilitative transporters for glucose also exist on the luminal side of the absorptive cells. The best characterized facilitative glucose transporters found in the plasma membranes of cells (referred to as GLUT 1 to GLUT 5) are described in Table 21.5. One common structural theme to these proteins is that they all contain 12 membrane-spanning domains. Note that the sodium-linked transporter on the luminal side of the intestinal epithelial cell is not a member of the GLUT family.

The epithelial cells of the kidney, which reabsorb glucose from the lumen of the renal tubule back into the blood, have $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent glucose transporters similar to those of intestinal epithelial cells. They are thus also able to transport glucose against its concentration gradient. Other types of cells use mainly facilitative glucose transporters that carry glucose down its concentration gradient.

## 3. Galactose and Fructose Absorption through Glucose Transporters

Galactose is absorbed through the same mechanisms as glucose. It enters the absorptive cells on the luminal side via the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent glucose transporters and facilitative glucose transporters and is transported through the serosal side on the facilitative glucose transporters.

![ma54181198a6](ma54181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 21.7 $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent and facilitative transporters in the intestinal epithelial cells. Both glucose and fructose are transported by the facilitated glucose transporters on the luminal and serosal sides of the absorptive cells. Glucose and galactose are transported by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-glucose cotransporters on the luminal (mucosal) side of the absorptive cells. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; $A T P$, adenosine triphosphate; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.

Fructose both enters and leaves absorptive epithelial cells by facilitated diffusion, apparently via transport proteins that are part of the GLUT family. The transporter on the luminal side has been identified as GLUT 5. Although this transporter can transport glucose, it has a much higher activity with fructose (see Fig. 21.7). Other fructose transport proteins also may be present. For reasons as yet unknown, fructose is absorbed at a much more rapid rate when it is ingested as sucrose than when it is ingested as a monosaccharide.

Genetic techniques have identified additional GLUT transporters (GLUT 6 to GLUT 12), but the roles of these transporters have not yet been fully described.

FIGURE 21.8 Stimulation by insulin of glucose transport into muscle and adipose cells. Binding of insulin to its cell membrane receptor causes vesicles containing glucose transport proteins to move from inside the cell to the cell membrane.

## B. Transport of Monosaccharides into Tissues

The properties of the GLUT transport proteins differ among tissues, reflecting the function of glucose metabolism in each tissue. In most cell types, the rate of glucose transport across the cell membrane is not rate-limiting for glucose metabolism. This is because the isoform of transporter present in these cell types has a relatively low $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for glucose (i.e., a low concentration of glucose will result in half the maximal rate of glucose transport) or is present in relatively high concentration in the cell membrane so that the intracellular glucose concentration reflects that in the blood. Because the enzyme that initially metabolizes glucose in these (named hexokinase; see Chapter 22) cells has an even lower $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for glucose ( 0.05 to 0.10 mM ), variations in blood glucose levels do not affect the intracellular rate of glucose metabolism. However, in several tissues, the rate of transport becomes rate limiting when the serum level of glucose is low or when low levels of insulin signal the absence of dietary glucose.

The erythrocyte (red blood cell) is an example of a tissue in which glucose transport is not rate-limiting. Although the glucose transporter (GLUT 1) has a $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of 1 to 7 mM , it is present in extremely high concentrations, constituting approximately $5 \%$ of all membrane proteins. Consequently, as the blood glucose levels fall from a postprandial level of $140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(7.5 \mathrm{mM})$ to the normal fasting level of $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(4.5 \mathrm{mM})$, or even the hypoglycemic level of $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(2.2 \mathrm{mM})$, the supply of glucose is still adequate for the rates at which glucose-dependent metabolic pathways operate.

In the liver, the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for the glucose transporter (GLUT 2) is relatively high compared with that of other tissues, probably $\geq 15 \mathrm{mM}$. This is in keeping with the liver's role as the organ that maintains blood glucose levels. Thus, the liver will convert glucose into other energy storage molecules only when blood glucose levels are high, such as the time immediately after ingesting a meal. In muscle and adipose tissue, the transport of glucose is greatly stimulated by insulin. The mechanism involves the recruitment of glucose transporters (specifically, GLUT 4) from intracellular vesicles into the plasma membrane (Fig. 21.8). In adipose tissue, the stimulation of glucose transport across the plasma membrane by insulin increases its availability for the synthesis of fatty acids and glycerol from the glycolytic pathway. In skeletal muscle, the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin increases its availability for energy generation (glycolysis) and glycogen synthesis.

## V. Glucose Transport through the Blood-Brain Barrier and into Neurons

A hypoglycemic response is elicited by a decrease of blood glucose concentration to some point between 18 and $54 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 1 and 3 mM ). The hypoglycemic response is a result of a decreased supply of glucose to the brain and starts with light-headedness and dizziness and may progress to coma. The slow rate of transport of glucose through the blood-brain barrier (from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid) at low levels of glucose is thought to be responsible for this neuroglycopenic response. Glucose transport from the cerebrospinal fluid across the plasma membranes of neurons is rapid and is not rate-limiting for ATP generation from glycolysis.

In the brain, the endothelial cells of the capillaries have extremely tight junctions, and glucose must pass from the blood into the extracellular cerebrospinal fluid by GLUT 1 transporters in the endothelial cell membranes (Fig. 21.9) and then through the basement membrane. Measurements of the overall process of glucose transport from the blood into the brain (mediated by GLUT 3 on neural cells) show a $K_{\mathrm{m}, \text { app }}$ of 7 to 11 mM and a maximal velocity not much greater than the rate of glucose use by the brain. Thus, decreases of blood glucose below the fasting level of 80 to $90 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(\sim 5 \mathrm{mM})$ are likely to significantly affect the rate of glucose metabolism in the brain because of reduced glucose transport into the brain.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

$\square$Denise V. One out of five Americans experiences some form of gastrointestinal discomfort from 30 minutes to 12 hours after ingesting lactoserich foods. Most become symptomatic when they consume more than 25 g of lactose at one time (e.g., 8 oz of milk or its equivalent). Denise V.'s symptoms were caused by her "new" diet in this country, which included a glass of milk in addition to the milk she used on her cereal with breakfast each morning.

Management of lactose intolerance includes a reduction or avoidance of lactosecontaining foods, depending on the severity of the deficiency of intestinal lactase. Hard cheeses (cheddar, Swiss, Jarlsberg) are low in lactose and may be tolerated by patients with only moderate lactase deficiency. Yogurt with "live and active cultures" printed on the package contains bacteria that release free lactases when the bacteria are lysed by gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes. The free lactases then digest the lactose. Commercially available milk products that have been hydrolyzed with a lactase enzyme provide a $70 \%$ reduction in total lactose content, which may be adequate to prevent digestive symptoms in mildly affected patients. Tablets and capsules containing lactase are also available and should be taken 30 minutes before meals.

Many adults who have a lactase deficiency develop the ability to ingest small amounts of lactose in dairy products without experiencing symptoms. This adaptation probably involves an increase in the population of colonic bacteria that can cleave lactose and not a recovery or induction of human lactase synthesis. For many individuals, dairy products are the major dietary source of calcium, and their complete elimination from the diet can lead to osteoporosis. Therefore, other dietary sources such as beans, almonds, tofu, turnip greens, kale, and calcium-fortified juices/beverages or calcium supplements should be recommended. Lactose, however, is used as a "filler" or carrying agent in $>1,000$ prescription and over-thecounter drugs in this country. People with lactose intolerance often unwittingly ingest lactose with their medications.

Deborah S. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes, such as Deborah S., frequently have elevations in serum glucose levels (hyperglycemia). This is often attributable to a lack of circulating, active insulin, which normally stimulates glucose uptake (through the recruitment of GLUT 4 transporters from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane) by the peripheral tissues (heart, muscle, and adipose tissue). Without uptake by these tissues, glucose tends to accumulate within the bloodstream, leading to hyperglycemia.

Nina M. The large amount of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ produced on fructose ingestion suggested that Nina M.'s problem was one of a deficiency in fructose transport into the absorptive cells of the intestinal villi. If fructose were being absorbed properly, the fructose would not have traveled to the colonic bacteria, which metabolized the fructose to generate the hydrogen gas. If there was a concern for deficiencies of the sucrase-isomaltase complex, a jejunal biopsy could be done; it would allow the measurement of lactase, sucrase, maltase, and trehalase activities. Genetic testing for the presence of a mutation in one of these proteins is also becoming available. Although Nina had no sugar in her urine, malabsorption of disaccharides can result in their appearance in the urine if damage to the intestinal mucosal cells allows their passage into the interstitial fluid. When Nina was placed on a diet free of fruit juices and other foods containing fructose, she did well and could tolerate small amounts of pure sucrose.

More than $50 \%$ of the adult population is estimated to be unable to absorb fructose in high doses ( 50 g ), and $>10 \%$ cannot completely absorb 25 g of fructose. These individuals, like those with other disorders of fructose metabolism, must avoid fruits and other foods that contain high concentrations of fructose.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Cholera. Cholera is an acute watery diarrheal disorder caused by the waterborne gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is a disease of antiquity; descriptions of epidemics of the disease date to before 500 вс. During epidemics, the infection is spread by large numbers of Vibrio that enter water sources from the voluminous liquid stools and contaminate the environment, particularly in areas of extreme poverty where plumbing and modern waste-disposal systems are primitive or nonexistent. Dennis V. experienced cholera after eating contaminated shellfish (see Chapter 10).

After being ingested, the V. cholerae organisms attach to the brush border of the intestinal epithelium and secrete an exotoxin that binds irreversibly to a specific chemical receptor ( $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{M} 1}$ ganglioside) on the cell surface. This exotoxin catalyzes an adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation reaction that increases adenylate cyclase activity and thus cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in the enterocyte. As a result, the normal absorption of sodium, anions, and water from the gut lumen into the intestinal cell is markedly diminished. The exotoxin also stimulates the crypt cells to secrete chloride, accompanied by cations and water, from the bloodstream into the lumen of the gut. The resulting loss of solute-rich diarrheal fluid may, in severe cases, exceed $1 \mathrm{~L} /$ hour, leading to rapid dehydration and even death.

The therapeutic approach to cholera takes advantage of the fact that the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ dependent transporters for glucose and amino acids are not affected by the cholera exotoxin. As a result, coadministration of glucose and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$by mouth results in the uptake of glucose and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, accompanied by chloride and water, thereby partially correcting the ion deficits and fluid loss. Amino acids and small peptides are also absorbed by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent cotransport involving transport proteins distinct from the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent glucose transporters. Therefore, addition of protein to the glucosesodium replacement solution enhances its effectiveness and markedly decreases the severity of the diarrhea. Adjunctive antibiotic therapy also shortens the diarrheal phase of cholera but does not decrease the need for the oral replacement therapy outlined earlier.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is E. The GLUT 5 transporter has a much higher affinity for fructose than glucose and is the facilitator of choice for fructose uptake by cells. The other GLUT transporters do not transport fructose to any significant extent.
2. The answer is A. The pancreas produces $\alpha$-amylase, which digests starch in the intestinal lumen. If pancreatic
$\alpha$-amylase cannot enter the lumen because of pancreatitis, the starch will not be digested to a significant extent. (The salivary $\alpha$-amylase begins the process, but only for the time during which the food is in the mouth, because the acidic conditions of the stomach destroy the salivary activity.) The discomfort arises from the bacteria in the intestine digesting the starch and producing acids

and gases. Lactose, sucrose, and maltose are all disaccharides that would be cleaved by the intestinal disaccharidases located on the brush border of the intestinal epithelial cells (thus, B, D, and E are incorrect). These activities might be slightly reduced because the pancreas would also have difficulty excreting bicarbonate to the intestine, and the low pH of the stomach contents might reduce the activity of these enzymes. However, these enzymes are present in excess and will eventually digest the disaccharides. Fiber cannot be digested by human enzymes, so answer C is incorrect.
3. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Insulin is required to stimulate glucose transport into muscle and fat cells but not into brain, liver, pancreas, or red blood cells. Thus, muscle would be feeling the effects of glucose deprivation and would be unable to replenish its own glycogen supplies as a result of its inability to extract blood glucose, even though blood glucose levels would be high.
4. The answer is E. Flour contains starch, which leads to glucose production in the intestine. Milk contains lactose, a disaccharide of glucose and galactose, which is split by lactase in the small intestine. Sucrose is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose, which is split by sucrase in the small intestine. Thus, glucose, galactose, and fructose are all available in the lumen of the small intestine for transport through the intestinal epithelial cells and into the circulation.
5. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. Salivary and pancreatic $\alpha$-amylase will partially digest starch to glucose, but maltose and disaccharides will pass through the intestine and exit with the stool as a result of the limited activity of the brush-border enzymes. Because the amylase enzymes are working, there will only be normal levels of starch in the stool (thus, B is incorrect). Not all available glucose is entering the blood, so less insulin will be released by the pancreas (thus, E is incorrect), which will lead to less glucose uptake by the muscles and less glycogen production (thus, D is incorrect). Because neither lactose nor sucrose can be digested to a large
extent in the intestinal lumen under these conditions, it would be difficult to have elevated levels of galactose or fructose in the blood (thus, C is incorrect).
6. The answer is B. The starch amylopectin is a branched polysaccharide of glucosyl units linked through $\alpha-1,4$ glycosidic bonds with $\alpha-1,6$ glycosidic bonds as branchpoints. The straight-chained starch amylose and the disaccharide maltose are both linked through $\alpha-1,4$ glycosidic bonds. The disaccharide sucrose contains a 1,2-glycosidic bond between glucose and fructose, whereas lactose contains a $\beta-1,4$-glycosidic bond between galactose and glucose.
7. The answer is D. Human enzymes cannot digest dietary fiber. However, bacteria in the colon can convert fiber to short-chain fatty acids, $\mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and methane. These gases give the symptoms of bloating, cramping, and excess gas (flatulence). Viruses do not metabolize fiber.
8. The answer is A. Sucrose and small amounts of glucose and fructose are the major natural sweeteners in fruit, honey, and vegetables. Lactose is the sugar found in milk and milk-derived products. Xylulose is a component of the pentose phosphate pathway, and its levels in fruits and vegetables are low.
9. The answer is C. With viral gastroenteritis, the cells lining the brush borders of the small intestine can be sloughed off into the lumen of the intestine, resulting in temporary lactose intolerance owing to the lack of lactase activity. Once these cells regenerate, the symptoms should disappear. She does not have congenital lactase deficiency, so her children will not inherit a defect in lactose metabolism. Antibiotics have no effect on viral illnesses and should not be given for viral gastroenteritis.
10. The answer is B. Maltose (glucose $\alpha-1,4$-glucose) has the highest glycemic index and would most rapidly raise blood sugar levels after ingestion. Malted grains and malted milk are high in maltose. All the other foods listed exhibit a glycemic index that is only about half the glycemic index of maltose, and the glucose derived from that food would require more time to reach the blood than the glucose derived from maltose.

## Generation of Adenosine Triphosphate from Glucose, Fructose, and Galactose: Glycolysis

Glucose is the universal fuel for human cells. Every cell type in humans is able to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from glycolysis, the pathway in which glucose is oxidized and cleaved to form pyruvate. The importance of glycolysis in our fuel economy is related to the availability of glucose in the blood as well as the ability of glycolysis to generate ATP in both the presence and absence of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Glucose is the major sugar in our diet and the sugar that circulates in the blood to ensure that all cells have a continuous fuel supply. The brain uses glucose almost exclusively as a fuel.

Glycolysis begins with the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate (glucose 6-P) by hexokinase (HK). In subsequent steps of the pathway, one glucose 6-P molecule is oxidized to two pyruvate molecules with generation of two molecules of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) (Fig. 22.1). A net generation of two molecules of ATP occurs through direct transfer of high-energy phosphate from intermediates of the pathway to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (substrate-level phosphorylation).

Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol and generates cytosolic NADH. Because NADH cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane, its reducing equivalents are transferred to the electron-transport chain (ETC) by either the malateaspartate shuttle or the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle (see Fig. 22.1). Pyruvate is then oxidized completely to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (see Chapter 23). Complete aerobic oxidation of glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can generate approximately 30 to 32 mol of ATP per mole of glucose.

When cells have a limited supply of oxygen (e.g., the kidney medulla), or few or no mitochondria (e.g., the red cell), or greatly increased demands for ATP (e.g., skeletal muscle during high-intensity exercise), they rely on anaerobic glycolysis for generation of ATP. In anaerobic glycolysis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) oxidizes the NADH generated from glycolysis by reducing pyruvate to lactate (Fig. 22.2). Because $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is not required to reoxidize the NADH, the pathway is referred to as anaerobic. The energy yield from anaerobic glycolysis ( 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose) is much lower than the yield from aerobic oxidation. The lactate (lactic acid) is released into the blood. Under pathologic conditions that cause hypoxia, tissues may generate enough lactic acid to cause lactic acidemia.

In each cell, glycolysis is regulated to ensure that ATP homeostasis is maintained, without using more glucose than necessary. In most cell types, hexokinase, the first enzyme of glycolysis, is inhibited by glucose 6-P (see Fig. 22.1). Thus, glucose is not taken up and phosphorylated by a cell unless glucose 6-P enters a metabolic pathway, such as glycolysis or glycogen synthesis. The control of glucose 6-P entry into glycolysis occurs at phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), the rate-limiting enzyme

of the pathway. PFK-I is allosterically inhibited by ATP and allosterically activated by adenosine monophosphate (AMP). AMP increases in the cytosol as ATP is hydrolyzed by energy-requiring reactions.

Glycolysis has functions in addition to ATP production. For example, in liver and adipose tissue, this pathway generates pyruvate as a precursor for fatty acid biosynthesis. Glycolysis also provides precursors for the synthesis of compounds such as amino acids and five-carbon sugar phosphates.

Although glucose is at the center of carbohydrate metabolism and is the major dietary sugar, other sugars in the diet are converted to intermediates of glucose metabolism, and their fates parallel that of glucose.

Fructose, the second most common sugar in the adult diet, is ingested principally as the monosaccharide or as part of sucrose (Fig. 22.3). It is metabolized principally in the liver (and to a lesser extent in the small intestine and kidney) by phosphorylation at the I-position to form fructose I-phosphate (fructose I-P), followed by conversion to intermediates of the glycolytic pathway. The major products of its metabolism in liver are, therefore, the same as for glucose (including lactate, blood glucose, and glycogen). Essential fructosuria (fructokinase deficiency) and hereditary fructose intolerance (a deficiency of the fructose I-P cleavage by aldolase B) are inherited disorders of fructose metabolism.

Fructose synthesis from glucose in the polyol pathway occurs in seminal vesicles and other tissues. Aldose reductase converts glucose to the sugar alcohol sorbitol (a polyol), which is then oxidized to fructose. In the lens of the eye, elevated levels of sorbitol in diabetes mellitus may contribute to formation of cataracts.

Galactose is ingested principally as lactose, which is converted to galactose and glucose in the intestine. Galactose is converted to glucose principally in the liver. It is phosphorylated to galactose I-phosphate (galactose I-P) by galactokinase and activated to a UDP-sugar by galactosyl uridylyltransferase. The metabolic pathway subsequently generates glucose I-P. Classical galactosemia, a deficiency of galactosyl uridylyltransferase, results in the accumulation of galactose I-P in the liver and the inhibition of hepatic glycogen metabolism and other pathways that require UDP sugars. Cataracts can occur from accumulation of galactose in the blood, which is converted to galactitol (the sugar alcohol of galactose) in the lens of the eye.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Linda F. is a 68-year-old woman who is admitted to the hospital emergency department with very low blood pressure ( $80 / 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) caused by an acute hemorrhage from a previously diagnosed ulcer of the stomach. Linda's bleeding stomach ulcer has reduced her effective blood volume severely enough to compromise her ability to perfuse (deliver blood to) her tissues. She is also known to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a result of 42 years of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day. Her respiratory rate is rapid and labored, her skin is cold and clammy, and her lips are slightly blue (cyanotic). She appears anxious and moderately confused.

As appropriate emergency measures are taken to stabilize her and elevate her blood pressure, blood is sent for immediate blood typing and cross-matching, so that blood transfusions can be started. A battery of laboratory tests is ordered, including venous hemoglobin, hematocrit, and an arterial blood gas, which includes an arterial pH , partial pressures of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}\right)$ and carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)$, bicarbonate, and oxygen saturation. Results show that the hemorrhaging and COPD have resulted in hypoxemia, with decreased oxygen delivery to her tissues and both a respiratory and a metabolic acidosis.

FIGURE 22.2 Anaerobic glycolysis (shown in red). The conversion of glucose to lactate generates 2 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from substrate-level phosphorylation.

FIGURE 22.3 Fructose. The sugar fructose is found in the diet as the free sugar in foods such as honey or as a component of the disaccharide sucrose in fruits and sweets. It also can be synthesized from glucose via the polyol pathway. In the lens of the eye, the polyol pathway contributes to the formation of cataracts. Fructose is metabolized by conversion to intermediates of glycolysis.

O
The hematocrit (the percentage of the volume of blood occupied by packed red blood cells) and hemoglobin content (grams of hemoglobin in 100 mL of blood) are measured to determine whether the oxygencarrying capacity of the blood is adequate. Both values can be decreased by conditions that interfere with erythropoiesis (the synthesis of red blood cells in bone marrow), such as iron deficiency. They also can be decreased during chronic bleeding as interstitial fluid replaces the lost blood volume and dilutes out the red blood cells but not during immediate acute hemorrhage. The $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ are the partial pressures of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the blood. The $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ and oxygen saturation determine whether adequate oxygen is available for tissues. Measurement of the $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and bicarbonate can distinguish between a metabolic and a respiratory acidosis (see Chapter 4).

Otto S., a 26-year-old medical student, had gained weight during his first sedentary year in medical school. During his second year, he began watching his diet, jogging for an hour four times each week, and playing tennis twice a week. He has decided to compete in a $5-\mathrm{km}$ race. To prepare for the race, he begins training with wind sprints-bouts of alternately running and walking.

$\square$Ivan A. is a 56-year-old morbidly obese accountant (see Chapters 1 through 3). He decided to see his dentist because he felt excruciating pain in his teeth when he ate ice cream. He really likes sweets and keeps hard candy in his pocket. The dentist noted from Mr. A.'s history that he had numerous cavities as a child in his baby teeth. At this visit, the dentist found cavities in two of Mr. A.'s teeth.

Candice S. is an 18-year-old girl who presented to her physician for a precollege physical examination. While taking her medical history, the doctor learned that she carefully avoided eating all fruits and any foods that contained table sugar. She related that from a very early age, she had learned that these foods caused severe weakness and symptoms suggestive of low blood sugar such as tremulousness and sweating. Her medical history also indicated that her mother had told her that once she started drinking and eating more than breast milk, she became an irritable baby who often cried incessantly, especially after meals, and vomited frequently. At these times, Candice's abdomen had become distended, and she became drowsy and apathetic. Her mother had intuitively eliminated certain foods from Candice's diet, after which the severity and frequency of these symptoms diminished.

Erin G. is the third child in her family, with a normal pregnancy and vaginal delivery at home like her older siblings. Her mother was unable to get to the initial pediatrician visit because she was busy with all her young children, but she noticed that Erin began vomiting 3 days after birth, usually within 30 minutes after breastfeeding. She finally brought Erin to the pediatrician at 3 weeks, when she noticed her child's eyes were yellow. She also reported that her abdomen became distended at these times and she became irritable and cried frequently. The doctor agreed that Erin was slightly jaundiced. He also noted an enlargement of her liver and questioned the possibility of early cataract formation in the lenses of Erin's eyes. He ordered liver and kidney function tests and did two separate dipstick urine tests in his office, one designed to measure only glucose in the urine and the other capable of detecting any of the reducing sugars.

## I. Glycolysis

Glycolysis is one of the principal pathways for generating ATP in cells and is present in all cell types. The central role of glycolysis in fuel metabolism is related to its ability to generate ATP with, and without, oxygen. The oxidation of glucose to pyruvate generates ATP from substrate-level phosphorylation (the transfer of phosphate from high-energy intermediates of the pathway to ADP) and NADH. Subsequently, the pyruvate may be oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the TCA cycle and ATP generated from electron transfer to oxygen in oxidative phosphorylation (see Chapter 23). However, if the pyruvate and NADH from glycolysis are converted to lactate (anaerobic glycolysis), ATP can be generated in the absence of oxygen, via substrate-level phosphorylation.

Glucose is readily available from our diet, internal glycogen stores, and the blood. Carbohydrate provides $50 \%$ or more of the calories in most diets, and glucose is the major carbohydrate. Other dietary sugars, such as fructose and galactose, are oxidized by conversion to intermediates of glycolysis. Glucose is

stored in cells as glycogen, which can provide an internal source of fuel for glycolysis in emergency situations (e.g., decreased supply of fuels and oxygen during ischemia, caused by a reduced blood flow). Insulin and other hormones maintain blood glucose at a constant level (glucose homeostasis), thereby ensuring that glucose is always available to cells that depend on glycolysis for generation of ATP.

After a high-carbohydrate meal, glucose is the major fuel for almost all tissues. Exceptions include intestinal mucosal cells, which transport glucose from the gut into the blood, and cells in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, which return glucose from the renal filtrate to the blood. During fasting, the brain continues to oxidize glucose because it has a limited capacity for the oxidation of fatty acids or other fuels. Cells also continue to use glucose for the portion of their ATP generation that must be met by anaerobic glycolysis because of either a limited oxygen supply or a limited capacity for oxidative phosphorylation (e.g., the red blood cell).

In addition to serving as an anaerobic and aerobic source of ATP, glycolysis is an anabolic pathway that provides biosynthetic precursors. For example, in liver and adipose tissue, this pathway generates pyruvate as a precursor for fatty acid biosynthesis. Glycolysis also provides precursors for the synthesis of compounds such as amino acids and of nucleotides. The integration of glycolysis with other anabolic pathways is discussed in Chapter 34.

## A. The Reactions of Glycolysis

The glycolytic pathway, which cleaves 1 mol of glucose to 2 mol of the threecarbon compound pyruvate, consists of a preparative phase and an ATP-generating phase. In the initial preparative phase of glycolysis, glucose is phosphorylated twice by ATP to form fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fructose 1,6-bisP) (Fig. 22.4). The ATP expenditure in the beginning of the preparative phase is sometimes called priming the pump because this initial use of 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose results in the production of 4 mol of ATP per mole of glucose in the ATP-generating phase.

In the ATP-generating phase, fructose 1,6-bisP is split into two triose phosphates. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (glyceraldehyde 3-P; a triose phosphate) is oxidized by $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and phosphorylated using inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$. The highenergy phosphate bond generated in this step is transferred to ADP to form ATP. The remaining phosphate is also rearranged to form another high-energy phosphate bond that is transferred to ADP. Because 2 mol of triose phosphate were formed, the yield from the ATP-generating phase is 4 ATP and 2 NADH. The result is a net yield of 2 mol of ATP, 2 mol of NADH, and 2 mol of pyruvate per mole of glucose.

## I. Conversion of Glucose to Glucose 6-Phosphate

Glucose metabolism begins with transfer of a phosphate from ATP to glucose to form glucose 6-P (Fig. 22.5). Phosphorylation of glucose commits it to metabolism within the cell because glucose 6-P cannot be transported back across the plasma membrane. The phosphorylation reaction is irreversible under physiologic conditions because the reaction has a high negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$. Phosphorylation does not, however, commit glucose to glycolysis.

Glucose 6-P is a branch point in carbohydrate metabolism. It is a precursor for almost every pathway that uses glucose, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (see Chapter 27), and glycogen synthesis (see Chapter 26). From the opposite point of view, it also can be generated from other pathways of carbohydrate metabolism, such as glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen), the pentose phosphate pathway, and gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of glucose from noncarbohydrate sources).

FIGURE 22.5 Glucose 6-phosphate (glucose 6-P) metabolism. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

Hexokinases, the enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of glucose, are a family of tissue-specific isoenzymes that differ in their kinetic properties. The isoenzyme found in liver and $\beta$-cells of the pancreas has a much higher $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ than other hexokinases and is called glucokinase. In many cells, some of the hexokinase is bound to porins in the outer mitochondrial membrane (voltage-dependent anion channels; see Chapter 24), which gives these enzymes first access to newly synthesized ATP as it exits the mitochondria.

# 2. Conversion of Glucose 6-Phosphate to the Triose Phosphates 

In the remainder of the preparative phase of glycolysis, glucose 6-P is isomerized to fructose 6-phosphate (fructose 6-P), again phosphorylated, and subsequently cleaved into two three-carbon fragments (Fig. 22.6). The isomerization, which positions a keto group next to carbon 3, is essential for the subsequent cleavage of the bond between carbons 3 and 4.

The next step of glycolysis, phosphorylation of fructose 6-P to fructose 1,6-bisP by PFK-1, is generally considered the first committed step of the pathway. This phosphorylation requires ATP and is thermodynamically and kinetically irreversible. Therefore, PFK-1 irrevocably commits glucose to the glycolytic pathway. PFK-1 is a regulated enzyme in cells, and its regulation controls the entry of glucose into glycolysis. Like hexokinase, it exists as tissue-specific isoenzymes whose regulatory properties match variations in the role of glycolysis in different tissues.

Fructose 1,6-bisP is cleaved into two phosphorylated three-carbon compounds (triose phosphates) by aldolase (see Fig. 22.6). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde 3-P are the products. DHAP is isomerized to glyceraldehyde 3-P by triose phosphate isomerase. Aldolase is named for the mechanism of the forward reaction, which is an aldol cleavage, and the mechanism of the reverse reaction, which is an aldol condensation. The enzyme exists as tissue-specific isoenzymes, which all catalyze the cleavage of fructose 1,6-bisP but differ in their specificities for fructose 1-P. The enzyme uses a lysine residue at the active site to form a covalent bond with the substrate during the course of the reaction. Inability to form this covalent linkage inactivates the enzyme.

Thus, at this point in glycolysis, for every mole of glucose that enters the pathway, 2 mol of glyceraldehyde 3-P are produced and continue through the pathway.

## 3. Oxidation and Substrate-Level Phosphorylation

In the next part of the glycolytic pathway, glyceraldehyde 3-P is oxidized and phosphorylated so that subsequent intermediates of glycolysis can donate phosphate to ADP to generate ATP. The first reaction in this sequence, catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, is really the key to the pathway (see Fig. 22.6). This enzyme oxidizes the aldehyde group of glyceraldehyde 3-P to an enzyme-bound carboxyl group and transfers the electrons to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to form NADH. The oxidation step is dependent on a cysteine residue at the active site of the enzyme, which forms a high-energy thioester bond during the course of the reaction. The high-energy intermediate immediately accepts a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ to form the high-energy acyl phosphate bond in 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG), releasing the product from the cysteine residue on the enzyme. This high-energy phosphate bond is the start of substrate-level phosphorylation (the formation of a high-energy phosphate bond where none previously existed, without the use of oxygen).

In the next reaction, the phosphate in this bond is transferred to ADP to form ATP by 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. The energy of the acyl phosphate bond is high enough ( $\sim 10 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$ ) so that transfer to ADP is an energetically favorable process. 3-Phosphoglycerate is also a product of this reaction.

FIGURE 22.6 Reactions of glycolysis. High-energy phosphates are indicated by the red squiggles. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $N A D^{+}$, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; $P_{4}$ inorganic phosphate.

To transfer the remaining low-energy phosphoester on 3-phosphoglycerate to ADP, it must be converted into a high-energy bond. This conversion is accomplished by moving the phosphate to the second carbon (forming 2-phosphoglycerate) and then removing water to form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The enolphosphate bond is a high-energy bond (its hydrolysis releases $\sim 14 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$ of energy), so

When individuals with defects of aldolase B ingest fructose, the extremely high levels of fructose 1-P that accumulate in the liver and kidney cause several adverse effects. Hypoglycemia results from inhibition of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glycogen phosphorylase (and possibly phosphoglucomutase and other enzymes of glycogen metabolism) are inhibited by the accumulated fructose 1-P. Aldolase B is required for glucose synthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-P and DHAP, and its low activity in aldolase B-deficient individuals is further decreased by the accumulated fructose 1-P. The inhibition of gluconeogenesis results in lactic acidosis.

The accumulation of fructose 1-P also substantially depletes the intracellular phosphate pools. The fructokinase reaction uses ATP at a rapid rate such that the mitochondria regenerate ATP rapidly, which leads to a drop in free phosphate levels. The low levels of phosphate release inhibition of AMP deaminase, which converts AMP to inosine monophosphate (IMP). The nitrogenous base of IMP (hypoxanthine) is degraded to uric acid. The lack of phosphate and depletion of adenine nucleotides lead to a loss of ATP, further contributing to the inhibition of biosynthetic pathways, including gluconeogenesis.
the transfer of phosphate to ADP by pyruvate kinase is energetically favorable (see Fig. 22.6) and not reversible. This final reaction converts PEP to pyruvate.

## 4. Summary of the Glycolytic Pathway

The overall net reaction in the glycolytic pathway is

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { Glucose }+2 \mathrm{NAD}^{+}+2 \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}+2 \mathrm{ADP} \rightarrow 2 \text { pyruvate }+2 \mathrm{NADH}+4 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 \\
\mathrm{ATP}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
\end{gathered}
$$

The pathway occurs with an overall negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ of approximately $-22 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$. Therefore, it cannot be reversed without the expenditure of energy.

## B. Fructose

Fructose is found in the diet as a component of sucrose in fruit, as a free sugar in honey, and in high-fructose corn syrup (see Fig. 22.3). Fructose enters epithelial cells and other types of cells by facilitated diffusion on the GLUT 5 transporter. It is metabolized to intermediates of glycolysis. Problems with fructose absorption and metabolism are relatively more common than with other sugars.

## 1. Fructose Metabolism

Fructose is metabolized by conversion to glyceraldehyde 3-P and DHAP, which are intermediates of glycolysis (Fig. 22.7). The steps parallel those of glycolysis. The first step in the metabolism of fructose, as with glucose, is phosphorylation. Fructokinase, the major kinase involved, phosphorylates fructose at the 1-position. Fructokinase has a high $V_{\max }$ and rapidly phosphorylates fructose as it enters the cell. The fructose 1-P formed is not an intermediate of glycolysis but rather is cleaved by aldolase B to DHAP (an intermediate of glycolysis)
![ma63181198a6](ma63181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 22.7 Fructose metabolism. The pathway for the conversion of fructose to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (dihydroxyacetone-P) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (glyceraldehyde-3-P) is shown in red. These two compounds are intermediates of glycolysis and are converted in the liver principally to glucose, glycogen, or fatty acids. In the liver, aldolase B cleaves both fructose 1-phosphate (fructose-1-P) in the pathway for fructose metabolism, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fructose-1,6-BP) in the pathway for glycolysis. $A D P$, adenosine diphosphate; $A T P$, adenosine triphosphate; Fructose-6-P, fructose 6-phosphate; Glucose-1-P, glucose 1-phosphate; Glucose-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.

and glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde is then phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde 3-P by triose kinase. DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-P are intermediates of the glycolytic pathway and can proceed through it to pyruvate, the TCA cycle, and fatty acid synthesis. Alternatively, these intermediates can also be converted to glucose by gluconeogenesis. In other words, the fate of fructose parallels that of glucose.

The metabolism of fructose occurs principally in the liver, and to a lesser extent in the small intestinal mucosa and proximal epithelium of the renal tubule, because these tissues have both fructokinase and aldolase B. Aldolase exists as several isoforms: aldolases A, B, and C and fetal aldolase. Although all of these aldolase isoforms can cleave fructose 1,6-bisP, the intermediate of glycolysis, only aldolase B can also cleave fructose 1-P. Aldolase A, present in muscle and most other tissues, and aldolase C, present in brain, have almost no ability to cleave fructose 1-P. Fetal aldolase, present in the liver before birth, is similar to aldolase C.

Aldolase B is the rate-limiting enzyme of fructose metabolism, although it is not a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. It has a much lower affinity for fructose 1-P than fructose 1,6-bisP and is very slow at physiologic levels of fructose 1-P. As a consequence, after ingesting a high dose of fructose, normal individuals accumulate fructose 1-P in the liver while it is slowly converted to glycolytic intermediates. Individuals with hereditary fructose intolerance (a deficiency of aldolase B) accumulate much higher amounts of fructose 1-P in their livers.

Other tissues also have the capacity to metabolize fructose but do so much more slowly. The hexokinase isoforms present in muscle, adipose tissue, and other tissues can convert fructose to fructose 6-P but react much more efficiently with glucose. As a result, fructose phosphorylation is very slow in the presence of physiologic levels of intracellular glucose and glucose 6-P.

## 2. Synthesis of Fructose in the Polyol Pathway

Fructose can be synthesized from glucose in the polyol pathway. The polyol pathway is named for the first step of the pathway, in which sugars are reduced to the sugar alcohol by the enzyme aldose reductase (Fig. 22.8). Glucose is reduced to the sugar alcohol sorbitol, and sorbitol is then oxidized to fructose. This pathway is present in seminal vesicles, which synthesize fructose for the seminal fluid. Spermatozoa use fructose as a major fuel source while in the seminal fluid and then switch to glucose once in the female reproductive tract. Use of fructose is thought to prevent acrosomal breakdown of the plasma membrane (and consequent activation) while the spermatozoa are still in the seminal fluid.

The polyol pathway is present in many tissues, but its function in all tissues is not understood. Aldose reductase is relatively nonspecific, and its major function may be the metabolism of an aldehyde sugar other than glucose. The activity of this enzyme can lead to major problems in the lens of the eye where it is responsible for the production of sorbitol from glucose and galactitol from galactose. When the concentration of glucose or galactose is elevated in the blood, their respective sugar alcohols are synthesized in the lens more rapidly than they are removed, resulting in increased osmotic pressure within the lens.

(1)The accumulation of sugars and sugar alcohols in the lens of patients with hyperglycemia (e.g. diabetes mellitus) results in the formation of cataracts. Glucose levels are elevated and increase the synthesis of sorbitol and fructose. As a consequence, a high osmotic pressure is created in the lens. The high glucose and fructose levels also result in nonenzymatic glycosylation of lens proteins. The result of the increased osmotic pressure and the glycosylation of the lens protein is an opaque cloudiness of the lens known as a cataract. Erin G. seemed to have an early cataract, probably caused by the accumulation of galactose and its sugar alcohol galactitol.

(1)Essential fructosuria is a rare and benign genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme fructokinase. Why is this disease benign, when a deficiency of aldolase B (hereditary fructose intolerance) can be fatal?

(1)The accumulation of sorbitol in muscle and nerve tissues may contribute to the peripheral neuropathy characteristic of patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. This is one of the many reasons it is so important for Dianne A. (who has type I diabetes mellitus) and Deborah S. (who has type 2 diabetes mellitus) to achieve good glycemic control.
![ma64181198a6](ma64181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 22.8 The polyol pathway converts glucose to fructose. $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

In essential fructosuria, fructose cannot be converted to fructose I-P. This condition is benign because no toxic metabolites of fructose accumulate in the liver, and the patient remains nearly asymptomatic. Some of the ingested fructose is slowly phosphorylated by hexokinase in nonhepatic tissues and metabolized by glycolysis, and some appears in the urine. There is no renal threshold for fructose; the appearance of fructose in the urine (fructosuria) does not require a high fructose concentration in the blood.

Hereditary fructose intolerance, conversely, results in the accumulation of fructose I-P and fructose. By inhibiting glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, the high levels of fructose I-P caused the hypoglycemia that Candice S. experienced as an infant when she became apathetic and drowsy, and as an adult when she experienced sweating and tremulousness.

One of the most serious problems of classical galactosemia is irreversible intellectual disability. Realizing this problem, Erin G.'s physician wanted to begin immediate dietary therapy. A test that measures galactose-I-P uridylyltransferase in erythrocytes was ordered. This test is an enzymatic assay that mixes the unknown sample (in this case, a lysate from red blood cells, which contain the enzyme) with galactose I-P, UDP-glucose, and NADP ${ }^{+}$in the presence of excess phosphoglucomutase and glucose-6-P dehydrogenase. As the uridylyltransferase converts galactose I-P to UDP-galactose and glucose 1-phosphate (glucose 1-P), the glucose 1-P is rapidly converted to glucose 6-P by phosphoglucomutase. The glucose 6-P is then converted to 6-phosphogluconate and NADPH by glucose-6-P dehydrogenase. The resulting increase in absorbance at 340 nm allows a determination of the initial uridylyltransferase activity. The enzyme activity in Erin G.'s red blood cells was virtually absent, confirming the diagnosis of classical galactosemia.

## C. Galactose Metabolism: Conversion to Glucose 1-Phosphate

Dietary galactose is metabolized principally by phosphorylation to galactose 1-P and then conversion to UDP-galactose and glucose 1-P (Fig. 22.9). The phosphorylation of galactose, again an important first step in the pathway, is carried out by a specific kinase, galactokinase. The formation of UDP-galactose is accomplished by attack of the phosphate oxygen on galactose 1-P on the $\alpha$ phosphate of UDP-glucose, releasing glucose 1-P while forming UDP-galactose. The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is galactose 1-P uridylyltransferase. The UDP-galactose is then converted to UDP-glucose by the reversible UDP-glucose epimerase (the configuration of the hydroxyl group on carbon 4 is reversed in this reaction). The net result of this sequence of reactions is that galactose is converted to glucose 1-P, at the expense of one high-energy bond of ATP. The sum of these reactions is indicated in the following equations:
(1) Galactose + ATP $\xrightarrow{\text { Galactokinase }}$ galactose 1-P + ADP
(2) Galactose 1-P + UDP-glucose $\xrightarrow[\text { uridylyltransferase }]{\text { Galactose1-P }}$ UDP-galactose + glucose 1-P
(3) UDP-galactose $\xrightarrow{\text { UDP-glucose epimerase }}$ UDP-glucose

Net equation: Galactose + ATP $\rightarrow$ Glucose 1-P + ADP

The enzymes for galactose conversion to glucose 1-P are present in many tissues, including the adult erythrocyte, fibroblasts, and fetal tissues. The liver has high activity of these enzymes and can convert dietary galactose to blood glucose and glycogen. The fate of dietary galactose, like that of fructose, therefore, parallels that of glucose. The ability to metabolize galactose is even greater in infants than in adults. Newborn infants ingest up to 1 g of galactose per kilogram per feeding (as lactose). Yet, the rate of metabolism is so high that the blood level in the systemic circulation is $<3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, and none of the galactose is lost in the urine.

(1)Erin G.'s urine was negative for glucose when measured with the glucose oxidase strip but was positive for the presence of a reducing sugar. The reducing sugar was identified as galactose. Her liver function tests showed an increase in serum bilirubin and in several liver enzymes. Albumin was present in her urine. These findings and the clinical history increased her physician's suspicion that Erin had classical galactosemia.

Classical galactosemia is caused by a deficiency of galactose-1-P uridylyltransferase. In this disease, galactose 1-P accumulates in tissues, and galactose is elevated in the blood and urine. This condition differs from the rarer deficiency of galactokinase (nonclassical galactosemia), in which galactosemia and galactosuria occur but galactose 1-P is not formed. Both enzyme defects result in cataracts from galactitol formation by aldose reductase in the polyol pathway. Aldose reductase has a relatively high $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for galactose, approximately 12 to 20 mM , so galactitol is formed only in galactosemic patients who have eaten galactose. Galactitol is not further metabolized and diffuses out of the lens very slowly. Thus, hypergalactosemia is even more likely to cause cataracts than hyperglycemia. Erin G., although she is only 3 weeks old, appeared to have early cataracts forming in the lenses of her eyes.

One of the most serious problems of classical galactosemia is an irreversible intellectual disability. Realizing the problem, Erin G.'s physician wanted to begin immediate dietary therapy. A test that measures galactose 1-P uridylyltransferase activity in erythrocytes was ordered. The enzyme activity was virtually absent, confirming the diagnosis of classical galactosemia.

![ma65181198a6](ma65181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 22.9 Metabolism of galactose. Galactose is phosphorylated to galactose I-phosphate (galactose I-P) by galactokinase. Galactose I-P reacts with uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose to release glucose 1-phosphate (glucose I-P). Galactose thus can be converted to blood glucose, enter glycolysis, or enter any of the metabolic routes of glucose. In classical galactosemia, a deficiency of galactose-I-P uridylyltransferase (shown in green) results in the accumulation of galactose I-P in tissues and the appearance of galactose in the blood and urine. In nonclassical galactosemia, a deficiency of galactokinase (shown in red) results in the accumulation of galactose. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

# D. Oxidative Fates of Pyruvate and NADH 

The NADH produced from glycolysis must be continuously reoxidized back to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to provide an electron acceptor for the glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase reaction and prevent product inhibition. Without oxidation of this NADH, glycolysis cannot continue. There are two alternate routes for oxidation of cytosolic NADH (Fig. 22.10). One route is aerobic, involving shuttles that transfer reducing equivalents across the mitochondrial membrane (see Chapter 23 for details of the shuttle systems) and ultimately to the ETC and oxygen (see Fig. 22.10A). The other route is anaerobic (without the use of oxygen). In anaerobic glycolysis, NADH is reoxidized in the cytosol by LDH, which reduces pyruvate to lactate (see Fig. 22.10B).

## A. Aerobic glycolysis

![ma66181198a6](ma66181198a6.jpg)
B. Anaerobic glycolysis
![ma67181198a6](ma67181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 22.10 Alternate fates of pyruvate. A. The pyruvate produced by glycolysis enters mitochondria and is oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The reducing equivalents in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) enter mitochondria via a shuttle system. B. Pyruvate is reduced to lactate in the cytosol, thereby using the reducing equivalents in NADH. Acetyl CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $F A D(2 H)$, reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide; Glycerol 3-P, glycerol 3-phosphate; $P_{\mathrm{o}}$ inorganic phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.

The confusion experienced by Linda F. in the emergency department is caused by an inadequate delivery of oxygen to the brain. Neurons have very high ATP requirements, and most of this ATP is provided by aerobic oxidation of glucose to pyruvate in glycolysis and by pyruvate oxidation to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the TCA cycle. The brain has little or no capacity to oxidize fatty acids, so its glucose consumption is high ( $\sim 125$ to 150 g/day in the adult). Its oxygen demands are also high. If cerebral oxygen supply were completely interrupted, the brain would last only 10 seconds. The only reason that consciousness lasts longer during anoxia or asphyxia is that there is still some oxygen in the lungs and in circulating blood. A decrease of blood flow to approximately one-half of the normal rate results in a loss of consciousness.
![ma68181198a6](ma68181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 22.II Lactate dehydrogenase reaction. Pyruvate, which may be produced by glycolysis, is reduced to lactate. The reaction, which occurs in the cytosol, requires reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase. This reaction is readily reversible.

The dental caries in Ivan A.'s mouth were caused principally by the low pH generated from lactic acid production by oral bacteria. Below a pH of 5.5 , decalcification of tooth enamel and dentine occurs. Lactobacilli and Streptococcus mutans are major contributors to this process because almost all of their energy is derived from the conversion of glucose or fructose to lactic acid, and they are able to grow well at the low pH generated by this process. Mr.A's dentist explained that bacteria in his dental plaque could convert all the sugar in his candy into acid in $<20$ minutes. The acid is buffered by bicarbonate and other buffers in saliva, but saliva production decreases in the evening. Thus, the acid could dissolve the hydroxyapatite in his tooth enamel during the night.

The fate of pyruvate depends on the route used for NADH oxidation. If NADH is reoxidized in a shuttle system, pyruvate can be used for other pathways, one of which is oxidation to acetyl coenzyme A and entry into the TCA cycle for complete oxidation. Alternatively, in anaerobic glycolysis, pyruvate is reduced to lactate and diverted away from other potential pathways. Thus, the use of the shuttle systems allows for more ATP to be generated than by anaerobic glycolysis, by both oxidizing the cytoplasmically derived NADH in the ETC and by allowing pyruvate to be oxidized completely to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

The reason that shuttles are required for the oxidation of cytosolic NADH by the ETC is that the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH, and no transport protein exists that can translocate NADH across this membrane directly.

## E. Anaerobic Glycolysis

When the oxidative capacity of a cell is limited (e.g., such as in the red blood cell, which has no mitochondria), the pyruvate and NADH produced from glycolysis cannot be oxidized aerobically. The NADH is, therefore, oxidized to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$in the cytosol by reduction of pyruvate to lactate. This reaction is catalyzed by LDH (Fig. 22.11). The net reaction for anaerobic glycolysis is

$$
\text { Glucose }+2 \mathrm{ADP}+2 \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightarrow 2 \text { lactate }+2 \mathrm{ATP}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

## I. Acid Production in Anaerobic Glycolysis

Anaerobic glycolysis results in acid production in the form of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Glycolysis forms pyruvic acid, which is reduced to lactic acid. At an intracellular pH of 7.35 , lactic acid dissociates to form the carboxylate anion lactate and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ for lactic acid is 3.85). Lactate and the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$are both transported out of the cell into interstitial fluid by a transporter on the plasma membrane and eventually diffuse into the blood. If the amount of lactate generated exceeds the buffering capacity of the blood, the pH drops below the normal range, resulting in lactic acidosis (see Chapter 4).

## 2. Tissues Dependent on Anaerobic Glycolysis

Many tissues, including red and white blood cells, the kidney medulla, the tissues of the eye, and skeletal muscles, rely on anaerobic glycolysis for at least a portion of their ATP requirements (Table 22.1). Tissues (or cells) that are heavily dependent on anaerobic glycolysis usually have a low ATP demand, high levels of glycolytic enzymes, and few capillaries, such that oxygen must diffuse over a greater distance to reach target cells. The lack of mitochondria, or the increased rate of glycolysis, is often related to some aspect of cell function. For example, the mature red blood cell has no mitochondria because oxidative metabolism might interfere with its function

TABLE 22.1 Major Tissue Sites of Lactate Production in a Resting Man (an Average 70-kg Man Consumes about 300 g of Carbohydrate per Day)

## DAILY LACTATE PRODUCTION (g/day)

| Total lactate production | 115 |
| :-- | --: |
| Red blood cells | 29 |
| Skin | 20 |
| Brain | 17 |
| Skeletal muscle | 16 |
| Renal medulla | 15 |
| Intestinal mucosa | 8 |
| Other tissues | 10 |

in transporting oxygen bound to hemoglobin. Some of the lactic acid generated by anaerobic glycolysis in skin is secreted in sweat, where it acts as an antibacterial agent. Many large tumors use anaerobic glycolysis for ATP production and lack capillaries in their core.

In tissues with some mitochondria, both aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis occur simultaneously. The relative proportion of the two pathways depends on the mitochondrial oxidative capacity of the tissue and its oxygen supply and may vary among cell types within the same tissue because of cell distance from the capillaries. When a cell's energy demand exceeds the capacity of the rate of the ETC and oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP, glycolysis is activated, and the increased $\mathrm{NADH} / \mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio will direct excess pyruvate into lactate. Because under these conditions PDH, the TCA cycle, and the ETC are operating as fast as they can, anaerobic glycolysis is meeting the need for additional ATP.

## 3. Fate of Lactate

Lactate released from cells undergoing anaerobic glycolysis is taken up by other tissues (primarily the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle) and oxidized back to pyruvate. In the liver, the pyruvate is used to synthesize glucose (gluconeogenesis), which is returned to the blood. The cycling of lactate and glucose between peripheral tissues and liver is called the Cori cycle (Fig. 22.12).

In many other tissues, lactate is oxidized to pyruvate, which is then oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the TCA cycle. Although the equilibrium of the LDH reaction favors lactate production, flux occurs in the opposite direction if NADH is being rapidly oxidized in the ETC (or is being used for gluconeogenesis):

$$
\text { Lactate }+\mathrm{NAD}^{+} \rightarrow \text { pyruvate }+\mathrm{NADH}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

The heart, with its huge mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity, is able to use lactate released from other tissues as a fuel. During exercise such as bicycle riding, lactate released into the blood from skeletal muscles in the leg might be used by resting skeletal muscles in the arm. In the brain, glial cells and astrocytes produce lactate, which is used by neurons or released into the blood.

LDH is a tetramer composed of A subunits (also called $M$ subunits, for skeletal muscle form) and B subunits (also called $H$ subunits, for heart). Different tissues produce different amounts of the two subunits, which then combine randomly to form five different tetramers (M4, M3H1, M2H2, M1H3, and H4). These isoenzymes differ only slightly in their properties, but the kinetic properties of the M4 form facilitate conversion of pyruvate to lactate in skeletal muscle, whereas the H 4 form facilitates conversion of lactate to pyruvate in the heart for energy generation.

(2)In response to the hypoxemia caused by Linda F.s COPD, she has increased levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in her tissues. HIF-1 is a gene transcription factor found in tissues throughout the body (including brain, heart, kidney, lung, liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and white blood cells) which plays a homeostatic role in coordinating tissue responses to hypoxia. Each tissue will respond with a subset of the following changes. HIF-1 increases transcription of the genes for many of the glycolytic enzymes, including PFK-1, enolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and LDH. HIF-1 also increases synthesis of several proteins that enhance oxygen delivery to tissues, including erythropoietin, which increases the generation of red blood cells in bone marrow, vascular endothelial growth factor, which regulates angiogenesis (formation of blood vessels) and inducible nitric oxide synthase, which synthesizes nitric oxide, a vasodilator. As a consequence, Ms. F. was able to maintain hematocrit and hemoglobin levels that were on the high side of the normal range, and her tissues had an increased capacity for anaerobic glycolysis.
![ma70181198a6](ma70181198a6.jpg)

The eye contains cells that transmit or focus light, and these cells, therefore, cannot be filled with opaque structures such as mitochondria or densely packed capillary beds. The corneal epithelium generates most of its ATP aerobically from its few mitochondria but still metabolizes some glucose anaerobically. Oxygen is supplied by diffusion from the air. The lens of the eye is composed of fibers that must remain birefringent to transmit and focus light, so mitochondria are nearly absent. The small amount of ATP required (principally for ion balance) can readily be generated from anaerobic glycolysis even though the energy yield is low. The lens is able to pick up glucose and release lactate into the vitreous body and aqueous humor. It does not need oxygen and has no use for capillaries.

FIGURE 22.13 Biosynthetic functions of glycolysis. Compounds formed from intermediates of glycolysis are shown in the boxes. These pathways are discussed in later chapters. Dotted lines indicate that more than one step is required for the conversion shown in the figure. Acetyl CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; Glucose 6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; Glycerol-P, glycerol phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.

# II. Other Functions of Glycolysis 

Glycolysis, in addition to providingATP, generates precursors for biosynthetic pathways (Fig. 22.13). Intermediates of the pathway can be converted to ribose 5-phosphate, the sugar incorporated into nucleotides such as ATP. Other sugars, such as UDP-glucose, mannose, and sialic acid, are also formed from intermediates of glycolysis. Serine is synthesized from 3-phosphoglycerate, and alanine from pyruvate. The backbone of triacylglycerols, glycerol 3-P, is derived from DHAP in the glycolytic pathway.

The liver is the major site of biosynthetic reactions in the body. In addition to those pathways mentioned previously, the liver synthesizes fatty acids from the pyruvate generated by glycolysis. It also synthesizes glucose from lactate, glycerol 3-P, and amino acids in the gluconeogenic pathway, which is basically a reversal of glycolysis. Consequently, in liver, many of the glycolytic enzymes exist as isoenzymes with properties suited for these functions.

The bisphosphoglycerate shunt is a "side reaction" of the glycolytic pathway in which 1,3-BPG is converted to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). Red blood cells form 2,3-BPG to serve as an allosteric inhibitor of oxygen binding to heme (see Chapter 42). 2,3-BPG reenters the glycolytic pathway via dephosphorylation to 3-phosphoglycerate. 2,3-BPG also functions as a coenzyme in the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate by the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglyceromutase. Because 2,3-BPG is not depleted by its role in this catalytic process, most cells need only very small amounts.

## III. Regulation of Glycolysis by the Need for Adenosine Triphosphate

The principles of pathway regulation are summarized in Table 22.2. In pathways that are subject to feedback regulation, the first step of the pathway must be

# TABLE 22.2 Generalizations on the Regulation of Metabolic Pathways 

I. Regulation matches function. The type of regulation use depends on the function of the pathway. Tissue-specific isozymes may allow the features of regulatory enzymes to match somewhat different functions of the pathway in different tissues.
2. Regulation of metabolic pathways occurs at rate-limiting steps-the slowest steps-in the pathway. These are reactions in which a small change of rate will affect the flux through the whole pathway.
3. Regulation usually occurs at the first committed step of a pathway or at metabolic branch points. In human cells, most pathways are interconnected with other pathways and have regulatory enzymes for every branch point.
4. Regulatory enzymes often catalyze physiologically irreversible reactions. These are also the steps that differ in biosynthetic and degradative pathways.
5. Many pathways have feedback regulation; that is, the end product of the pathway controls the rate of its own synthesis. Feedback regulation may involve inhibition of an early step in the pathway (feedback inhibition) or regulation of gene transcription.
6. Human cells use compartmentation to control access of substrate and activators or inhibitors to different enzymes.
7. Hormonal regulation integrates responses in pathways requiring more than one tissue. Hormones generally regulate fuel metabolism by
a. Changing the phosphorylation state of enzymes
b. Changing the amount of enzyme present by changing its rate of synthesis (often induction or repression of mRNA synthesis) or degradation
c. Changing the concentration of an activator or inhibitor
regulated so that precursors flow into alternative pathways if product is not needed. Another generalization concerning regulation of metabolic pathways is that it occurs at the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting (slowest) step in a pathway (see Table 22.2).

One of the major functions of glycolysis is the generation of ATP, so the pathway is regulated to maintain ATP homeostasis in all cells. PFK-1 and PDH (see Chapter 23), which links glycolysis and the TCA cycle, are both major regulatory sites that respond to feedback indicators of the rate of ATP use (Fig. 22.14). The supply of glucose 6-P for glycolysis is tissue-dependent and can be regulated at the steps of glucose transport into cells, glycogenolysis (the degradation of glycogen to form glucose), or the rate of glucose phosphorylation by hexokinase isoenzymes. Other regulatory mechanisms integrate the ATP-generating role of glycolysis with its anabolic roles.

All of the regulatory enzymes of glycolysis exist as tissue-specific isoenzymes, which alter the regulation of the pathway to match variations in conditions and needs in different tissues. For example, in the liver, an isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase introduces an additional regulatory site in glycolysis that contributes to the inhibition of glycolysis when the reverse pathway, gluconeogenesis, is activated.

## A. Relationships among ATP, ADP, and AMP Concentrations

The AMP levels within the cytosol provide a better indicator of the rate of ATP use than the ATP concentration itself (Fig. 22.15). The concentration of AMP in the cytosol is determined by the equilibrium position of the adenylate kinase reaction, which catalyzes the following reaction:

$$
2 \mathrm{ADP} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{AMP}+\mathrm{ATP}
$$

The equilibrium is such that hydrolysis of ATP to ADP in energy-requiring reactions increases both the ADP and AMP contents of the cytosol. However, ATP is present in much higher quantities than AMP or ADP, so a small decrease of ATP concentration in the cytosol causes a much larger percentage increase in the small AMP pool. In skeletal muscles, for instance, ATP levels are approximately 5 mM and decrease by no more than $20 \%$ during strenuous exercise (see Fig. 22.15). At the same time, ADP levels may increase by $50 \%$, and AMP levels, which are in the micromolar range, may increase by $300 \%$. AMP activates several metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, glycogenolysis, and fatty acid oxidation (particularly in muscle tissues) to ensure that ATP homeostasis is maintained.

FIGURE 22.15 Changes in adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) concentrations in skeletal muscle during exercise. The concentration of ATP decreases by only $\sim 20 \%$ during exercise, and the concentration of ADP rises. The concentration of AMP, produced by the adenylate kinase reaction, increases manyfold and serves as a sensitive indicator of decreasing ATP levels.

FIGURE 22.14 Major sites of regulation in the glycolytic pathway. Hexokinase and phosphofructokinase-1 are the major regulatory enzymes in skeletal muscle. The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the mitochondrion determines whether pyruvate is converted to lactate or to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA).

## B. Regulation of Hexokinases

Hexokinases exist as tissue-specific isoenzymes whose regulatory properties reflect the role of glycolysis in different tissues. In most tissues, hexokinase is a low- $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ enzyme with a high affinity for glucose (see Chapter 9). It is inhibited by physiologic concentrations of its product, glucose 6-P (see Fig. 22.14). If glucose 6-P does not enter glycolysis or another pathway, it accumulates and decreases the activity of hexokinase. In the liver, the isoenzyme glucokinase is a high- $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ enzyme that is not readily inhibited by glucose 6-P. Thus, glycolysis can continue in the liver even when energy levels are high, so that anabolic pathways, such as the synthesis of the major energy-storage compounds, glycogen and fatty acids,

can occur. Hepatic glucokinase, however, does bind to the glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) when glucose levels in the hepatocyte are low. When GKRP binds to glucokinase, the complex translocates to the nucleus, removing glucokinase (and its enzymatic activity) from the cytoplasm. As glucose levels eventually rise in the hepatocyte, the complex reenters the cytoplasm, and the glucokinase is released from the GKRP such that glucokinase can phosphorylate glucose and initiate the glycolytic pathway.

## C. Regulation of Phosphofructokinase-I

PFK-1 is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis and controls the rate of glucose 6-P entry into glycolysis in most tissues. PFK-1 is an allosteric enzyme that has a total of six binding sites: Two are for substrates (Mg-ATP and fructose 6-P) and four are allosteric regulatory sites (see Fig. 22.14). The allosteric regulatory sites occupy a physically different domain on the enzyme than the catalytic site. When an allosteric effector binds, it changes the conformation at the active site and may activate or inhibit the enzyme (see also Chapter 9). The allosteric sites for PFK-1 include an inhibitory site for MgATP, an inhibitory site for citrate and other anions, an allosteric activation site for AMP, and an allosteric activation site for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (fructose 2,6-bisP) and other bisphosphates. Several different tissue-specific isoforms of PFK-1 are affected in different ways by the concentration of these substrates and allosteric effectors, but all contain these four allosteric sites.

Three different types of PFK-1 isoenzyme subunits exist: M (muscle), L (liver), and C (common). The three subunits show variable expression in different tissues, with some tissues having more than one type. For example, mature human muscle expresses only the M subunit, the liver expresses principally the L subunit, and erythrocytes express both the M and the L subunits. The C subunit is present in highest levels in platelets, placenta, kidney, and fibroblasts but is relatively common to most tissues. Both the M and L subunits are sensitive to AMP and ATP regulation, but the C subunits are much less so. Active PFK-1 is a tetramer, composed of four subunits. Within muscle, the M4 form predominates; but within tissues that express multiple isoenzymes of PFK-1, heterotetramers can form that have full activity.

## I. Allosteric Regulation of PFK-I by AMP and ATP

ATP binds to two different sites on the enzyme, the substrate-binding site and an allosteric-inhibitory site. Under physiologic conditions in the cell, the ATP concentration is usually high enough to saturate the substrate-binding site and inhibit the enzyme by binding to the ATP allosteric site. This effect of ATP is opposed by AMP, which binds to a separate allosteric-activator site (Fig. 22.16). For most of the PFK-1 isoenzymes, the binding of AMP increases the affinity of the enzyme for fructose 6-P (e.g., it shifts the kinetic curve to the left). Thus, increases in AMP concentration can greatly increase the rate of the enzyme (see Fig. 22.16), particularly when fructose 6-P concentrations are low.

## 2. Regulation of PFK-I by Fructose 2,6-Bisphosphate

Fructose 2,6-bisP is also an allosteric activator of PFK-1 that opposes ATP inhibition. Its effect on the rate of activity of PFK-1 is qualitatively similar to that of AMP, but it has a separate binding site. Fructose 2,6-bisP is not an intermediate of glycolysis but is synthesized by an enzyme that phosphorylates fructose 6-P at the 2-position. The enzyme is, therefore, named phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK-2); it is a bifunctional enzyme with two separate domains, a kinase domain and a phosphatase domain. At the kinase domain, fructose 6-P is phosphorylated to fructose 2,6-bisP; and at the phosphatase domain, fructose 2,6-bisP is hydrolyzed back to fructose 6-P. PFK-2 is regulated through changes in the ratio of activity of the two domains. For example, in skeletal muscles, high concentrations of fructose 6-P activate the kinase and inhibit the phosphatase, thereby increasing the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisP and activating glycolysis.

Otto S. has started high-intensity exercise that will increase the production of lactate in his exercising skeletal muscles. In skeletal muscles, the amount of aerobic versus anaerobic glycolysis that occurs varies with intensity of the exercise, with duration of the exercise, with the type of skeletal muscle fiber involved, and with the level of training. Human skeletal muscles are usually combinations of type I fibers (called fast glycolytic fibers, or white muscle fibers) and type IIb fibers (called slow oxidative fibers, or red muscle fibers). The designation fast or slow refers to their rate of shortening, which is determined by the isoenzyme of myosin ATPase present. Compared with glycolytic fibers, oxidative fibers have a higher content of mitochondria and myoglobin, which gives them a red color. The gastrocnemius, a muscle in the leg used for running, has a high content of type Ib fibers. However, these fibers will still produce lactate during sprints when the ATP demand exceeds their oxidative capacity.

Under ischemic conditions, AMP levels within the heart increase rapidly because of the lack of ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation. The increase in AMP levels activates the AMP-activated protein kinase, which phosphorylates the heart isoenzyme of PFK-2 to activate its kinase activity. This results in increased levels of fructose 2,6 -bisP, which activates PFK-1 along with AMP so that the rate of glycolysis can increase to compensate for the lack of ATP production via aerobic means.

Several methods can be used to determine lactate levels in blood. Two of the most common use enzymatic methods are given. The first is the conversion of lactate to pyruvate (which also converts $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to NADH) in the presence of LDH. Because NADH has considerable light absorption at 340 nm (and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ does not), one can follow the increase in absorbance at this wavelength as the reaction proceeds and determine the levels of lactate that were initially present in the sample. To ensure that all of the lactate is measured, hydrazine is added to the reaction; the hydrazine reacts with the pyruvate to remove the product of the LDH reaction, which forces the reaction to go to completion. The second enzymatic procedure that is commonly used employs lactate oxidase, which converts lactate, in the presence of oxygen, to pyruvate and hydrogen peroxide. In this case, a second enzymatic reaction measures the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced (which removes the product of the lactate oxidase reaction, ensuring completion of the reaction). This second reaction uses peroxidase and a chromogen, which is converted to a colored product as the hydrogen peroxide is removed. The amount of colored product produced allows lactate levels to be determined accurately. Both procedures have been automated for use in the clinical laboratory.

During Cora N.'s myocardial infarction (see Chapter 20), the ischemic area in her heart had a limited supply of oxygen and bloodborne fuels. The absence of oxygen for oxidative phosphorylation would decrease the levels of ATP and increase those of AMP, an activator of PFK-1 and the AMP-dependent protein kinase, resulting in a compensatory increase of anaerobic glycolysis and lactate production. However, obstruction of a vessel leading to her heart would decrease lactate removal, resulting in a decrease of intracellular pH . Under these conditions, at very low pH levels, glycolysis is inhibited and unable to compensate for the lack of oxidative phosphorylation.

PFK-2 also can be regulated through phosphorylation by serine-threonine protein kinases. The liver isoenzyme contains a phosphorylation site near the amino terminus that decreases the activity of the kinase and increases the phosphatase activity. This site is phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) and is responsible for decreased levels of liver fructose 2,6-bisP during fasting conditions (as modulated by circulating glucagon levels, which is discussed in detail in Chapters 19 and 28). The cardiac isoenzyme contains a phosphorylation site near the carboxyl terminus that can be phosphorylated in response to adrenergic activators of contraction (such as norepinephrine) and by increased AMP levels. Phosphorylation at this site increases the kinase activity and increases fructose 2,6-bisP levels, thereby contributing to the activation of glycolysis.

## 3. Allosteric Inhibition of PFK-1 at the Citrate Site

The function of the citrate-anion allosteric site is to integrate glycolysis with other pathways. For example, the inhibition of PFK-1 by citrate (an intermediate of the Krebs TCA cycle; see Chapter 23) may play a role in decreasing glycolytic flux in the heart during the oxidation of fatty acids.

## D. Regulation of Pyruvate Kinase

Pyruvate kinase exists as tissue-specific isoenzymes, designated as R (red blood cells), L (liver), and M1/M2 (muscle and other tissues). The M1 form present in brain, heart, and muscle contains no allosteric sites, and pyruvate kinase does not contribute to the regulation of glycolysis in these tissues (these tissues also do not undergo significant gluconeogenesis). However, the liver isoenzyme can be inhibited through phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and by several allosteric effectors that contribute to the inhibition of glycolysis during fasting conditions. These allosteric effectors include activation by fructose 1,6-bisP, which ties the rate of pyruvate kinase to that of PFK-1, and inhibition by ATP, which signifies high energy levels.

## IV. Lactic Acidemia

Lactate production is a normal part of metabolism. In the absence of disease, elevated lactate levels in the blood are associated with anaerobic glycolysis during exercise. In lactic acidosis, lactic acid accumulates in blood to levels that significantly affect the pH (lactate levels $>5 \mathrm{mM}$ and a decrease of blood $\mathrm{pH}<7.2$ ). A further discussion of lactic acidemia occurs in Chapter 24, after learning about oxidative phosphorylation.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Linda F. was admitted to the hospital with severe hypotension caused by an acute hemorrhage. Her plasma lactic acid level was elevated and her arterial pH was low. The underlying mechanism for Ms. F.'s derangement in acid-base balance is a severe reduction in the amount of oxygen delivered to her tissues for cellular respiration (hypoxemia). Several concurrent processes contributed to this lack of oxygen. The first was her severely reduced blood pressure caused by a brisk hemorrhage from a bleeding gastric ulcer. The blood loss led to hypoperfusion and, therefore, reduced delivery of oxygen to her tissues. This led to increased lactate production from anaerobic glycolysis and an elevation of serum lactate to almost 10 times the normal levels. The marked reduction in the number of red blood cells in her circulation caused by blood loss further compromised oxygen delivery. Her preexisting COPD added to her hypoxemia by decreasing her ventilation and, therefore, the transfer of oxygen to her blood (low $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ ). In addition, her COPD led to retention of carbon dioxide (high $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ ), which caused a respiratory acidosis because the retained $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ interacted with water to form carbonic acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)$, which dissociates to $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and bicarbonate. The reduction in her arterial pH to 7.18

(reference range $=7.35$ to 7.45 ), therefore, resulted from both a mild respiratory acidosis (elevated $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ ) and a more profound metabolic acidosis (elevated serum lactate levels).

In infants and small children, the major symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, intestinal discomfort, and failure to thrive. The greater the ingestion of dietary fructose, the more severe is the clinical reaction. The result of prolonged ingestion of fructose is ultrastructural changes in the liver and kidney that result in hepatic and renal failure. Hereditary fructose intolerance is usually a disease of infancy because adults with fructose intolerance who have survived avoid the ingestion of fruits, table sugar, and other sweets.

Before the metabolic toxicity of fructose was appreciated, substitution of fructose for glucose in intravenous solutions, and of fructose for sucrose in enteral tube feeding or diabetic diets, was frequently recommended. (Enteral tube feeding refers to tubes placed into the gut; parenteral tube feeding refers to tubes placed into a vein, feeding intravenously.) Administration of intravenous fructose to patients with diabetes mellitus or other forms of insulin resistance avoided the hyperglycemia found with intravenous glucose, possibly because fructose metabolism in the liver bypasses the insulin-regulated step at phosphofructokinase-1. However, because of the unregulated flow of fructose through glycolysis, intravenous fructose feeding frequently resulted in lactic acidosis (see Fig. 22.7). In addition, the fructokinase reaction is very rapid, and tissues became depleted of ATP and phosphate when large quantities of fructose were metabolized over a short period. This led to cell death. Fructose is less toxic in the diet or in enteral feeding because of the relatively slow rate of fructose absorption.

Erin G. has galactosemia, which is caused by a deficiency of galactose-1-P uridylyltransferase; it is one of the most common genetic diseases. Galactosemia is an autosomal-recessive disorder of galactose metabolism that occurs in about 1 in 60,000 newborns. All of the states in the United States screen newborns for this disease because failure to begin immediate treatment results in intellectual disability. Failure to thrive is the most common initial clinical symptom. Vomiting or diarrhea occurs in most patients, usually starting within a few days of beginning milk ingestion. Signs of deranged liver function, jaundice or hepatomegaly, are present almost as frequently after the first week of life. The jaundice of intrinsic liver disease may be accentuated by the severe hemolysis in some patients. Cataracts have been observed within a few days of birth.

Management of patients requires eliminating galactose from the diet. Failure to eliminate this sugar results in progressive liver failure and death. In infants, artificial milk made from casein or soybean hydrolysate is used.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

The Mechanism of Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase. How is the first high-energy bond created in the glycolytic pathway? This is the work of the glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase reaction, which converts glyceraldehyde 3-P to 1,3-BPG. This reaction can be considered to be two separate half-reactions: the first being the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-P to 3-phosphoglycerate, and the second being the addition of inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ to 3-phosphoglycerate to produce 1,3-BPG. The $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ for the first reaction is approximately $-12 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$; for the second reaction, it is approximately $+12 \mathrm{kcal} /$ mol. Thus, although the first half-reaction is extremely favorable, the second halfreaction is unfavorable and does not proceed under cellular conditions. So how does the enzyme help this reaction to proceed? This is accomplished through the enzyme forming a covalent bond with the substrate, using an essential cysteine residue at the active site to form a high-energy thioester linkage during the course of the reaction (Fig. 22.17). Thus, the energy that would be released as heat in the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-P to 3-phosphoglycerate is conserved in the thioester linkage that is formed (such that the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ of the formation of the thioester intermediate from glyceraldehyde 3-P is close to zero). Then, replacement of the sulfur

FIGURE 22.17 Mechanism of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (glyceraldehyde-3-P) dehydrogenase reaction.(I) The enzyme forms a covalent linkage with the substrate, using a cysteine (Cys) group at the active site. The enzyme also contains bound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$close to the active site. (2) The substrate is oxidized, forming a high-energy thioester linkage (in red) and NADH. (3) NADH has a low affinity for the enzyme and is replaced by a new molecule of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. (4) Inorganic phosphate ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ) attacks the thioester linkage, releasing the product 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and regenerating the active enzyme in a form ready to initiate another reaction.
with $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ to form the final product, 1,3-BPG, is relatively straightforward, as the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0^{\prime}}$ for that conversion is also close to zero, and the acylphosphate bond retains the energy from the oxidation of the aldehyde. This is one example of how covalent catalysis by an enzyme can result in the conservation of energy between different bond types.

- The enzymes of glycolysis are in the cytosol.
- Glucose is the major sugar in our diet; all cells can use glucose for energy.
- Glycolysis generates two molecules of ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation, and two molecules of NADH.
- The cytosolic NADH generated via glycolysis transfers its reducing equivalents to mitochondrial $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$via shuttle systems across the inner mitochondrial membrane.
- The pyruvate generated during glycolysis can enter the mitochondria and be oxidized completely to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by pyruvate dehydrogenase and the TCA cycle.
- Anaerobic glycolysis generates energy in cells with a limited supply of oxygen or few mitochondria.
- Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is reduced to lactate by NADH, thereby regenerating the $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$required for glycolysis to continue.
- Glycolysis is regulated to ensure that ATP homeostasis is maintained.
- Thekeyregulatedenzymes of glycolysisarehexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1, and pyruvate kinase.
- Fructose is ingested principally as the monosaccharide or as part of sucrose. Fructose metabolism generates fructose 1-phosphate, which is then converted to intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.

- Galactose is ingested principally as lactose, which is converted to glucose and galactose in the intestine. Galactose metabolism generates, first, galactose 1-phosphate, which is converted to UDP-galactose. The end product is glucose 1-phosphate, which is isomerized to glucose 6-phosphate, which then enters glycolysis.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is B. The major roles of glycolysis are to generate energy and to produce precursors for other biosynthetic pathways. Gluconeogenesis is the pathway that generates glucose (thus, A is incorrect); $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ is produced in the mitochondria by a variety of reactions but not glycolysis (thus, C is incorrect); glycogen synthesis occurs under conditions in which glycolysis is inhibited (thus, D is incorrect); and glycolysis does not hydrolyze ATP to generate heat (that is caused by nonshivering thermogenesis; thus, E is incorrect).
2. The answer is D. By starting with glyceraldehyde 3-P, the energy-requiring steps of glycolysis are bypassed. Thus, as glyceraldehyde 3-P is converted to pyruvate, two
molecules of ATP will be produced (at the phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase steps) and one molecule of NADH will be produced (at the glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase step).
3. The answer is H. Glucose 1-P is isomerized to glucose 6-P, which then enters glycolysis. This skips the hexokinase step, which uses 1 ATP. Thus, starting from glucose 1-P, one would get the normal 2 ATP and 2 NADH; but with one less ATP used in the priming steps, the total yield would be 3 ATP and 2 NADH.
4. The answer is B. The pathway consumes 2 ATP at the beginning of the pathway and produces 4 ATP at the end of the pathway for each molecule of glucose. Therefore,

the net energy production is 2 ATP for each molecule of glucose. Glycolysis synthesizes ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation, not oxidative phosphorylation (thus, A is incorrect) and synthesizes two molecules of pyruvate in the process (thus, D is incorrect). The pathway is cytosolic (thus, D is incorrect), and the rate-limiting step is the one catalyzed by phosphofructokinase-1 (thus, C is incorrect).
5. The answer is E. Fructose 1-P is found only in fructose metabolism. Glucose 1-P is derived from glycogen degradation. Fructose 6-P and fructose 1,6-bisP are found in glycolysis but not in fructose metabolism. Both fructose and glucose are converted to glyceraldehyde 3-P, and this is where the two pathways intersect. Their continued metabolism is identical from this point on.
6. The answer is E. The child has a form of galactosemia in which galactose cannot be metabolized, such that free galactose enters the blood and is excreted via the urine. The below-normal blood glucose levels indicate that glucose is not being excreted in the urine. The high levels of galactose lead to galactose entering the lens of the eye, where it is converted to galactitol via aldose reductase, trapping the galactitol in the lens. This leads to an osmotic imbalance across the lens, resulting in swelling and cataract formation. High levels of fructose do not lead to cataract formation. Lactose is a disaccharide that is cleaved to glucose and galactose in the small intestine, such that lactose does not enter the blood. Maltose is another disaccharide (glucose-glucose) that does not enter the blood.
7. The answer is C. The child either has classical galactosemia (caused by a deficiency of galactose 1-P uridylyltransferase) or nonclassical galactosemia (caused by a deficiency of galactokinase). Measurement of galactose 1-P levels would enable one to determine if galactokinase were deficient (if it were, galactose 1-P levels
would be low) or if galactose 1-P uridylyltransferase were defective (in which case galactose 1-P levels would be elevated). Measurement of the other compounds listed would not allow for a determination as to whether galactokinase or galactose 1-P uridylyltransferase were defective.
8. The answer is D. Metformin interrupts the Cori cycle (gluconeogenesis in the liver using lactate, derived from the muscle, as a source of carbons). The heart, with its huge mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity, uses lactate as fuel and easily metabolizes the excess lactate (which is why heart failure is a contraindication to the use of metformin; otherwise, lactic acidosis would occur). The red blood cells, renal medullary cells, and tissues of the eye all use anaerobic glycolysis to generate energy, producing lactate, but cannot use lactate as a fuel.
9. The answer is C. The committed step for glycolysis is the one catalyzed by phosphofructokinase-1, which converts fructose 6-P to fructose 1,6-bisP. Glucose is not directly converted to glucose 1-P (glucose 1-P); glucose must first be phosphorylated to glucose 6-P and then isomerized to glucose 1-P. Glucose 6-P has other potential fates (glycogen synthesis, hexose monophosphate shunt), so the generation of glucose 6-P from glucose does not commit the sugar to the glycolytic pathway. Aldolase cleaves fructose 1,6-bisP into 2 triose phosphates, but this is not considered the committed step of glycolysis.
10. The answer is A. Red blood cells do not contain mitochondria and can only generate energy via anaerobic mechanisms. Without mitochondria, aerobic glycolysis cannot occur through the TCA cycle or oxidative phosphorylation of glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Only anaerobic glycolysis can occur with production of lactate and production of ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. The ETC occurs within the mitochondria.

# Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle 

The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) accounts for more than two-thirds of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generated from fuel oxidation. The pathways for oxidation of fatty acids, glucose, amino acids, acetate, and ketone bodies all generate acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which is the substrate for the TCA cycle. As the activated two-carbon acetyl group is oxidized to two molecules of $\mathbf{C O}_{2}$, energy is conserved as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD[2H]), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (Fig. 23.1). NADH and FAD(2H) subsequently donate electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ via the electron-transport chain (ETC), with the generation of ATP from oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, the TCA cycle is central to energy generation from cellular respiration.

Within the TCA cycle, the oxidative decarboxylation of $\alpha$-ketoglutarate is catalyzed by the multisubunit $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, which contains the coenzymes thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP), lipoate, and FAD. A similar complex, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), catalyzes the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, thereby providing a link between the pathways of glycolysis and the TCA cycle (see Fig. 23.1)
![ma77181198a6](ma77181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 23.1 Summary of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The major pathways of fuel oxidation generate acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which is the substrate for the TCA cycle. The number of carbons in each intermediate of the cycle is indicated in parentheses by the name of the compound. CoASH, coenzyme A;GDP, guanosine diphosphate;GTP, guanosine triphosphate; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.

The two-carbon acetyl group is the ultimate source of the electrons that are transferred to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and FAD and also the carbon in the two $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules that are produced. Oxaloacetate is used and regenerated in each turn of the cycle (see Fig. 23.1). However, when cells use intermediates of the TCA cycle for biosynthetic reactions, the carbons of oxaloacetate must be replaced by anaplerotic (filling up) reactions, such as the pyruvate carboxylase reaction.

The TCA cycle occurs in the mitochondrion, where its flux is tightly coordinated with the rate of the ETC and oxidative phosphorylation through feedback regulation that reflects the demand for ATP. The rate of the TCA cycle is increased when ATP use in the cell is increased through the response of several enzymes to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) levels, the NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio, the rate of FAD(2H) oxidation, or the $\mathbf{C a 2}^{+}$concentration. For example, isocitrate dehydrogenase is allosterically activated by ADP.

There are two general consequences to impaired functioning of the TCA cycle: (1) an inability to generate ATP from fuel oxidation and (2) an accumulation of TCA cycle precursors. For example, inhibition of pyruvate oxidation in the TCA cycle results in its reduction to lactate, which can cause lactic acidosis. The most common situation leading to an impaired function of the TCA cycle is a relative lack of oxygen to accept electrons in the ETC.

first step of the TCA cycle, the acetyl portion of acetyl-CoA combines with the fourcarbon intermediate oxaloacetate to form citrate (six carbons), which is rearranged to form isocitrate. In the next two oxidative decarboxylation reactions, electrons are transferred to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to form NADH, and two molecules of electron-depleted $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are released. Subsequently, a high-energy phosphate bond in GTP is generated from substrate-level phosphorylation. In the remaining portion of the TCA cycle, succinate is oxidized to oxaloacetate with the generation of one $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ and one NADH. The net reaction of the TCA cycle, which is the sum of the equations for individual steps, shows that the two carbons of the acetyl group have been oxidized to two molecules of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, with conservation of energy as three molecules of NADH, one of $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$, and one of GTP.

The TCA cycle requires a large number of vitamins and minerals to function. These include niacin $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$, riboflavin (FAD and flavin mononucleotide [FMN]), pantothenic acid (coenzyme A), thiamin, $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$, and phosphate.

## II. Reactions of the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle

In the TCA cycle, the two-carbon acetyl group of acetyl-CoA is oxidized to two $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules (see Fig. 23.1). The function of the cycle is to conserve the energy from this oxidation, which it accomplishes principally by transferring electrons from intermediates of the cycle to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and FAD. The eight electrons donated by the acetyl group (four from each carbon) eventually end up in three molecules of NADH and one of $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ (Fig. 23.2). As a consequence, ATP can be generated from oxidative phosphorylation when NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ donate these electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ via the ETC.

Initially, the acetyl group is incorporated into citrate, an intermediate of the TCA cycle (Fig. 23.3). As citrate progresses through the cycle to oxaloacetate, it is oxidized by four dehydrogenases (isocitrate dehydrogenase, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase), which remove electron-containing hydrogen or hydride atoms from a substrate and transfer them to electron-accepting coenzymes such as $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$or FAD. The isomerase aconitase rearranges electrons in citrate, thereby forming isocitrate, to facilitate an electron transfer to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. An iron cofactor in aconitase facilitates the isomerization.

Although no oxygen is introduced into the TCA cycle, the two molecules of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced have more oxygen than the acetyl group. These oxygen atoms are ultimately derived from the carbonyl group of acetyl-CoA, two molecules of water added by fumarase and citrate synthase, and the $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$ added to GDP.

The overall yield of energy-containing compounds from the TCA cycle is three NADH, one $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$, and one GTP. The high-energy phosphate bond of GTP is generated from substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinate thiokinase (succinyl coenzyme A [succinyl-CoA] synthetase). As the NADH and FAD(2H) are reoxidized in the ETC, approximately 2.5 ATP are generated for each NADH, and 1.5 ATP for the $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ (see Chapter 24). Consequently, the net energy yield from the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation is about 10 high-energy phosphate bonds for each acetyl group oxidized.

## A. Formation and Oxidation of Isocitrate

The TCA cycle begins with condensation of the activated acetyl group and oxaloacetate to form the six-carbon intermediate citrate, a reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme citrate synthase (see Fig. 23.3). Synthases, in general, catalyze the condensation of two organic molecules to form a carbon-carbon bond in the absence of high-energy phosphate bond energy. A synthetase catalyzes the same type of reaction but requires high-energy phosphate bonds to complete the reaction. Because oxaloacetate is regenerated with each turn of the cycle, it is not really considered a substrate of the cycle or a source of electrons or carbon.

0Otto S.'s exercise program increases his rate of ATP use and his rate of fuel oxidation in the TCA cycle. The TCA cycle generates NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$, and the electrontransport chain transfers electrons from NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, thereby creating the electrochemical potential that drives ATP synthesis from ADP. As ATP is used in the cell, the rate of the electrontransport chain increases. The TCA cycle and other fuel oxidative pathways respond by increasing their rates of NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ production.

FIGURE 23.3 Reactions of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The oxidation-reduction enzymes and coenzymes are shown in red. Entry of the two carbons of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) into the TCA cycle are indicated with the green box. The carbons released as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are shown with yellow boxes. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CoASH, coenzyme A; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate; $S C o A$, coenzyme $A$.

In the next step of the TCA cycle, the hydroxyl (alcohol) group of citrate is moved to an adjacent carbon so that it can be oxidized to form a keto group. The isomerization of citrate to isocitrate is catalyzed by the enzyme aconitase, which is named for an intermediate of the reaction. The enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of the alcohol group and the subsequent cleavage of the carboxyl group to release $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (an oxidation followed by a decarboxylation), forming $\alpha$-ketoglutarate.

# B. $\alpha$-Ketoglutarate to Succinyl Coenzyme A 

The next step of the TCA cycle is the oxidative decarboxylation of $\alpha$-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, catalyzed by the $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (see Fig. 23.3). The dehydrogenase complex contains the coenzymes TPP, lipoic acid, and FAD.

In this reaction, one of the carboxyl groups of $\alpha$-ketoglutarate is released as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and the adjacent keto group is oxidized to the level of an acid, which then combines with the sulfhydryl group of coenzyme A (CoASH) to form succinyl-CoA (see Fig. 23.3). Energy from the reaction is conserved principally in the reduction state of NADH, with a smaller amount present in the high-energy thioester bond of succinyl-CoA.

## C. Generation of Guanosine Triphosphate

Energy from the succinyl-CoA thioester bond is used to generate GTP from guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ in the reaction catalyzed by succinate thiokinase (also known as succinyl-CoA synthetase, for the reverse reaction) (see Fig. 23.3). This reaction is an example of substrate-level phosphorylation. By definition, substrate-level phosphorylation is the formation of a high-energy phosphate bond where none previously existed without the use of molecular $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (in other words, not oxidative phosphorylation). The high-energy phosphate bond of GTP is energetically equivalent to that of ATP and can be used directly for energyrequiring reactions like protein synthesis.

## D. Oxidation of Succinate to Oxaloacetate

Up to this stage of the TCA cycle, two carbons have been stripped of their available electrons and released as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Two pairs of these electrons have been transferred to two $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, and one GTP has been generated. However, two additional pairs of electrons arising from acetyl-CoA still remain in the TCA cycle as part of succinate. The remaining steps of the TCA cycle transfer these two pairs of electrons to FAD and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and add $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, thereby regenerating oxaloacetate.

The sequence of reactions converting succinate to oxaloacetate begins with the oxidation of succinate to fumarate (see Fig. 23.3). Single electrons are transferred from the two adjacent $-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-$ methylene groups of succinate to an FAD bound to succinate dehydrogenase, thereby forming the double bond of fumarate. From the reduced enzyme-bound FAD, the electrons are passed into the ETC. A hydroxyl group and a proton from water add to the double bond of fumarate, converting it to malate. In the last reaction of the TCA cycle, the alcohol group of malate is oxidized to a keto group through the donation of electrons to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$.

With regeneration of oxaloacetate, the TCA cycle is complete; the chemical bond energy, carbon, and electrons donated by the acetyl group have been converted to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, \mathrm{NADH}, \mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H}), \mathrm{GTP}$, and heat.

The succinate-to-oxaloacetate sequence of reactions-oxidation through formation of a double bond, addition of water to the double bond, and oxidation of the resultant alcohol to a ketone-is found in many oxidative pathways in the cell, such as the pathways for the oxidation of fatty acids and oxidation of the branched-chain amino acids.

## III. Coenzymes of the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle

The enzymes of the TCA cycle rely heavily on coenzymes for their catalytic function. Isocitrate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase use $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$as a coenzyme, and succinate dehydrogenase uses FAD. Citrate synthase catalyzes a reaction that uses a CoA derivative, acetyl-CoA. The $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex uses TPP, lipoate, and FAD as bound coenzymes, and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and CoASH are used as substrates. Each of these coenzymes has unique structural features that enable it to fulfill its role in the TCA cycle.

## A. Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide

Both FAD and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$are electron-accepting coenzymes. Why is FAD used in some reactions and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$in others? Their unique structural features enable FAD and

0Ann R. has been malnourished for some time and has developed subclinical deficiencies of many vitamins, including riboflavin. The coenzymes FAD and FMN are synthesized from the vitamin riboflavin. Riboflavin is actively transported into cells, where the enzyme flavokinase adds a phosphate to form FMN. FAD synthetase then adds AMP to form FAD. FAD is the major coenzyme in tissues and is generally found tightly bound to proteins, with about $10 \%$ being covalently bound. Its turnover in the body is very slow, and people can live for long periods on low intakes without displaying any signs of a riboflavin deficiency.

![ma80181198a6](ma80181198a6.jpg)

One of Otto S.'s tennis partners told him that he had heard about a health food designed for athletes that contained succinate. The advertisement made the claim that succinate would provide an excellent source of energy during exercise because it could be metabolized directly without oxygen. Do you see anything wrong with this statement?
$\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to act as electron acceptors in different types of reactions and to play different physiologic roles in the cell. FAD is able to accept single electrons ( $\mathrm{H} \cdot$ ) and forms a half-reduced single-electron intermediate (Fig. 23.4). It thus participates in reactions in which single electrons are transferred independently from two different atoms, which occurs in double-bond formation (e.g., succinate to fumarate) and disulfide bond formation (e.g., lipoate to lipoate disulfide in the $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction). In contrast, $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$accepts a pair of electrons as the hydride ion $\left(\mathrm{H}^{-}\right)$, which is attracted to the carbon opposite the positively charged pyridine ring (Fig. 23.5). This occurs, for example, in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones by malate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase. The nicotinamide ring accepts a hydride ion from the $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bond, and the alcoholic hydrogen is released into the medium as a positively charged proton, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

The free-radical, single-electron forms of FAD are very reactive, and FADH can lose its electron through exposure to water or the initiation of chain reactions. As a consequence, FAD must remain very tightly, sometimes covalently, attached to its enzyme while it accepts and transfers electrons to another group bound on the enzyme. Because FAD interacts with many functional groups on amino acid side chains in the active site, the $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{ff}}$ for enzyme-bound FAD varies greatly and can be greater or much less than that of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. In contrast, $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and NADH are more like substrate and product than coenzymes.

NADH plays a regulatory role in balancing energy metabolism that $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ cannot because $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ remains attached to its enzyme. Free $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$binds to a dehydrogenase and is reduced to NADH, which is then released into the medium, where it can bind and inhibit a different dehydrogenase. Consequently, oxidative enzymes are controlled by the NADH/ $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio and do not generate NADH faster than it can be reoxidized in the ETC. The regulation of the TCA cycle and other

FIGURE 23.4 One-electron steps in the reduction of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). When FAD and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) accept single electrons (e), they are converted to the half-reduced semiquinone, a semistable free-radical form. They can also accept two electrons to form the fully reduced form, $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$. However, in most dehydrogenases, $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ is never formed. Instead, the first electron is shared with a group on the protein as the next electron is transferred. Therefore, in this text, overall acceptance of two electrons by FAD has been denoted by the more general abbreviation $F A D(2 H)$.

Subsequent electron shifts in the pyridine ring remove the positive charge. The H of the -OH group dissociates into water as a proton, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. NAD ${ }^{+}$, the electron acceptor, is reduced.
pathways of fuel oxidation by the NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio is part of the mechanism for coordinating the rate of fuel oxidation to the rate of ATP use.

## B. Role of Coenzyme A in the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle

CoASH, the acylation coenzyme, participates in reactions through the formation of a thioester bond between the sulfur (S) of CoASH and an acyl group (e.g., acetylCoA, succinyl-CoA) (Fig. 23.6). The complete structure of CoASH and its vitamin precursor, pantothenate, is shown in Figure 8.9A. A thioester bond differs from a typical oxygen ester bond because sulfur, unlike oxygen, does not share its electrons and participate in resonance formations. One of the consequences of this feature of sulfur chemistry is that the carbonyl carbon, the $\alpha$-carbon, and the $\beta$-carbon of the acyl group in a CoA thioester can be activated for participation in different types of reactions (e.g., in the citrate synthase reaction, the $\alpha$-carbon methyl group is activated for condensation with oxaloacetate; see Figs. 23.3 and 23.6A). Another consequence is that the thioester bond is a high-energy bond that has a large negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{ff}}$ of hydrolysis (approximately $-13 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$ ).
![ma83181198a6](ma83181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 23.6 Use of the high-energy thioester bond of acyl coenzyme As. Energy transformations are shown in red. A. The energy released by hydrolysis of the thioester bond of acetyl coenzyme A in the citrate synthase reaction contributes a large negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{ff}}$ to the forward direction of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. B. The energy of the succinyl coenzyme A thioester bond is used for the synthesis of the high-energy phosphate bond of guanosine triphosphate (GTP). CoASH, coenzyme A; GDP, guanosine diphosphate; OAA, oxaloacetate; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate; $S C o A$, coenzyme $A$.

(1)The claim that succinate oxidation can produce energy without oxygen is wrong. It is probably based on the fact that succinate is oxidized to fumarate by the donation of electrons to FAD. However, ATP can be generated from this process only when these electrons are donated to oxygen in the ETC. The energy generated by the electron-transport chain is used for ATP synthesis in the process of oxidative phosphorylation. After the covalently bound $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ is oxidized back to FAD by the electron-transport chain, succinate dehydrogenase can oxidize another succinate molecule. If oxygen was not present, the $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ would remain reduced, and the enzyme could no longer convert succinate to fumarate.
![ma84181198a6](ma84181198a6.jpg)

2Coenzyme A (CoASH) is synthesized from the vitamin pantothenate in a sequence of reactions that phosphorylate pantothenate, add the sulfhydryl portion of coenzyme A from cysteine, and then add AMP and an additional phosphate group from ATP (see Fig. 8.9A). Pantothenate is widely distributed in foods (pontos means "everywhere"), so it is unlikely that Ann R. has developed a pantothenate deficiency. Although coenzyme A is required in approximately 100 different reactions in mammalian cells, no Recommended Daily Allowance has been established for pantothenate, in part because indicators have not yet been found that specifically and sensitively reflect a deficiency of this vitamin in humans. The reported symptoms of pantothenate deficiency (fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite) are characteristic of vitamin deficiencies in general.

Succinyl CoA
FIGURE 23.7 Oxidative decarboxylation of $\alpha$-ketoglutarate. The $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex oxidizes $\alpha$-ketoglutarate to succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl CoA). The carboxyl group is released as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The keto group on the $\alpha$-carbon is oxidized and then forms the acyl coenzyme A thioester; succinylCoA. The $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$, and $\delta$ on succinyl-CoA refer to the sequence of atoms in $\alpha$-ketoglutarate. CoASH, coenzyme A; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; SCoA, coenzyme A.

0The $E^{0^{\circ}}$ for FAD-accepting electrons is -0.219 (see Table 19.4). The $E^{0^{\circ}}$ for NAD ${ }^{+}$accepting electrons is -0.32 . Thus, transfer of electrons from FAD(2H) to NAD ${ }^{+}$ is energeticaly unfavorable. How do the $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes allow this electron transfer to occur?

The energy from cleavage of the high-energy thioester bonds of succinylCoA and acetyl-CoA is used in two different ways in the TCA cycle. When the succinyl-CoA thioester bond is cleaved by succinate thiokinase, the energy is used directly for activating an enzyme-bound phosphate that is transferred to GDP (see Fig. 23.6B). In contrast, when the thioester bond of acetyl-CoA is cleaved in the citrate synthase reaction, the energy is released, giving the reaction a large negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0^{\circ}}$ of $-7.7 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$. The large negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0^{\circ}}$ for citrate formation helps to keep the TCA cycle going in the forward direction.

## C. The $\alpha$-Ketoacid Dehydrogenase Complexes

The $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is one of a three-member family of similar $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes. The other members of this family are the $P D C$ and the branched-chain amino acid $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. Each of these complexes is specific for a different $\alpha$-keto acid structure. In the sequence of reactions catalyzed by the complexes, the $\alpha$-keto acid is decarboxylated (i.e., releases the carboxyl group as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) (Fig. 23.7). The keto group is oxidized to the level of a carboxylic acid and then combined with CoASH to form an acyl-CoA thioester (e.g., succinyl-CoA).

All of the $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes are huge enzyme complexes composed of multiple subunits of three different enzymes, designated as $\mathrm{E}_{1}, \mathrm{E}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{E}_{3}$ (Fig. 23.8). $E_{1}$ is an $\alpha$-keto acid decarboxylase that contains TPP; it cleaves off the carboxyl group of the $\alpha$-keto acid. $E_{2}$ is a transacylase-containing lipoate; it transfers the acyl portion of the $\alpha$-keto acid from thiamin to CoASH. $E_{3}$ is dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, which contains FAD; it transfers electrons from reduced lipoate to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. The collection of three enzyme activities into one huge complex enables the product of one enzyme to be transferred to the next enzyme without loss of energy. Complex formation also increases the rate of catalysis because the substrates for $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{E}_{3}$ remain bound to the enzyme complex.
![ma86181198a6](ma86181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 23.8 Mechanism of $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (including $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and the branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complex). $R$ represents the portion of the $\alpha$-keto acid that begins with the $\beta$-carbon. In $\alpha$ ketoglutarate, R is $\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{COOH}$. In pyruvate, R is $-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$. The individual steps in the oxidative decarboxylation of $\alpha$-keto acids are catalyzed by three different subunits: $E_{1}, \alpha$-keto acid decarboxylase ( $\alpha$-ketoglutarate decarboxylase); $E_{2}$, transacylase (trans-succinylase); and $E_{3}$, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. (1) Thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) on $E_{1}$ decarboxylates the $\alpha$-keto acid and forms a covalent intermediate with the remaining portion. (2) The acyl portion of the $\alpha$-keto acid is transferred by TPP on $E_{1}$ to lipoate on $E_{2}$, which is a transacylase. (3) $E_{3}$ transfers the acyl group from lipoate to CoASH. Note how lipoate is reduced during this conversion. The lipoyl disulfide bond has been reduced to sulfhydryl groups (dihydrolipoate).(4) $\mathrm{E}_{3}$, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase transfers the electrons from reduced lipoate to its tightly bound FAD molecule, thereby oxidizing lipoate back to its original disulfide form. (5) The electrons are then transferred from FAD(2H) to NAD ${ }^{+}$to form NADH. DH, dehydrogenase; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide;Lip, lipoate; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; Trans Ac, transacylase.

## I. Thiamin Pyrophosphate in the $\alpha$-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase Complex

TPP is synthesized from the vitamin thiamin by the addition of pyrophosphate (see Fig. 8.8). The pyrophosphate group binds magnesium, which binds to amino acid side chains on the enzyme. This binding is relatively weak for a coenzyme, so thiamin turns over rapidly in the body, and a deficiency can develop rapidly in individuals who are on thiamin-free or low-thiamin diets.

The general function of TPP is the cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond next to a keto group. In the $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, pyruvate, and branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes, the functional carbon on the thiazole ring forms a covalent bond with the $\alpha$-keto carbon, thereby cleaving the bond between the $\alpha$-keto carbon and the adjacent carboxylic acid group (see Fig. 8.8 for the mechanism of this reaction). TPP is also a coenzyme for transketolase in the pentose phosphate pathway, where it similarly cleaves the carbon-carbon bond next to a keto group. In thiamin deficiency, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, pyruvate, and other $\alpha$-keto acids accumulate in the blood.

## 2. Lipoate

Lipoate is a coenzyme found only in $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes. It is synthesized in humans from carbohydrate and amino acids, and it does not require a vitamin precursor. Lipoate is attached to the transacylase enzyme through its carboxyl group, which is covalently bound to the terminal $-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ of a lysine in the protein (Fig. 23.9). At its functional end, lipoate contains a disulfide group that accepts electrons when it binds the acyl fragment of $\alpha$-ketoglutarate. It can thus act like a long, flexible $-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-$ arm of the enzyme that reaches over to the decarboxylase to pick up the acyl fragment from thiamin and transfer it to the active site containing bound CoASH. It then swings over to dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase to transfer electrons from the lipoyl sulfhydryl groups to FAD.

## 3. Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide and Dihydrolipoyl Dehydrogenase

FAD on dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase accepts electrons from the lipoyl sulfhydryl groups and transfers them to bound $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. FAD thus accepts and transfers electrons

When FAD is bound to an enzyme, as it is in the $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes, amino acid side chains can alter its $\mathrm{E}^{0}$ value. Thus, the transfer of electrons from the bound $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$in dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase is actually energetically favorable.

In Al M.'s heart failure, which is caused by a dietary deficiency of the vitamin thiamin, pyruvate dehydrogenase, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and the branchedchain $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes are less functional than normal. Because heart muscle, skeletal muscle, and nervous tissue have high rates of ATP production from the NADH produced by the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and of acetylCoA to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the TCA cycle, these tissues present with the most obvious signs of thiamin deficiency.

In Western societies, gross thiamin deficiency is most often associated with alcoholism. The mechanism for active absorption of thiamin is strongly and directly inhibited by alcohol. Subclinical deficiency of thiamin from malnutrition or anorexia may be common in the general population and is usually associated with multiple vitamin deficiencies.

Arsenic poisoning is caused by the presence of a large number of different arsenious compounds that are effective metabolic inhibitors. Acute accidental or intentional arsenic poisoning requires high doses and involves arsenate $\left(\mathrm{AsO}_{4}{ }^{2-}\right)$ and arsenite $\left(\mathrm{AsO}_{3}{ }^{2-}\right)$. Arsenite, which is 10 times more toxic than arsenate, binds to neighboring sulfhydryl groups, such as those in dihydrolipoate and in nearby cysteine pairs (vicinal) found in $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes and in succinic dehydrogenase. Arsenate weakly inhibits enzymatic reactions involving phosphate, including the enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in glycolysis (see Chapter 22). Thus, both aerobic and anaerobic ATP production can be inhibited. The low doses of arsenic compounds found in water supplies are a major public health concern but are associated with increased risk of cancer rather than direct toxicity.

without leaving its binding site on the enzyme. The direction of the reaction is favored by interactions of FAD with groups on the enzyme, which change its reduction potential, and by the overall release of energy from cleavage and oxidation of $\alpha$-ketoglutarate.

# IV. Energetics of the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle 

Like all metabolic pathways, the TCA cycle operates with an overall net negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ (Fig. 23.10). The conversion of substrates to products is, therefore, energetically favorable. However, some of the reactions, such as the malate dehydrogenase reaction, have a positive value.

The net standard free-energy change for the TCA cycle, $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$, can be calculated from the sum of the $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}}$ values for the individual reactions. The $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{tr}},-13 \mathrm{kcal}$, is the amount of energy lost as heat. It can be considered the amount of energy spent to ensure that oxidation of the acetyl group to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ goes to completion. This value is surprisingly small. However, oxidation of NADH and FAD(2H) in the ETC helps to make acetyl oxidation more energetically favorable and pulls the TCA cycle forward.

## A. Overall Efficiency of the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle

The reactions of the TCA cycle are extremely efficient in converting energy in the chemical bonds of the acetyl group to other forms. The total amount of energy available from the acetyl group is about $228 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$ (the amount of energy that could be released from complete combustion of 1 mol of acetyl groups to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in an experimental chamber). The products of the TCA cycle (NADH, FAD[2H], and GTP) contain about 207 kcal (Table 23.1). Thus, the TCA cycle reactions are able to conserve about $90 \%$ of the energy available from the oxidation of acetyl-CoA.

## B. Thermodynamically and Kinetically Reversible and Irreversible Reactions

Three reactions in the TCA cycle have large negative values for $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0^{\circ}}$ that strongly favor the forward direction: the reactions catalyzed by citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (see Fig. 23.10). Within the TCA cycle, these reactions are physiologically irreversible for two reasons: The products do not rise to high enough concentrations under physiologic conditions to overcome the large negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0^{\circ}}$ values, and the enzymes involved catalyze the reverse reaction very slowly. These reactions make the major contribution to the overall negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0^{\circ}}$ for the TCA cycle and keep it going in the forward direction.

In contrast to these irreversible reactions, the reactions catalyzed by aconitase and malate dehydrogenase have a positive $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0^{\circ}}$ for the forward direction and are thermodynamically and kinetically reversible. Because aconitase is rapid in both directions, equilibrium values for the concentration ratio of products to substrates is maintained, and the concentration of citrate is about 23 times that of isocitrate. The accumulation of citrate instead of isocitrate facilitates transport of excess citrate to the cytosol, where it can provide a source of acetyl-CoA for pathways like fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. It also allows citrate to serve as an inhibitor of citrate synthase when flux through isocitrate dehydrogenase is decreased. Likewise, the equilibrium constant of the malate dehydrogenase reaction favors the accumulation of malate over oxaloacetate, resulting in a low oxaloacetate concentration that is influenced by the NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio. Thus, there is a net flux of oxaloacetate toward malate in the liver during fasting (as a result of fatty acid oxidation, which raises the $\mathrm{NADH} / \mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio), and malate can then be transported out of the mitochondria to provide a substrate for gluconeogenesis.

## V. Regulation of the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle

The oxidation of acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle and the conservation of this energy as NADH and FAD(2H) is essential for generation of ATP in almost all tissues in the body. Despite changes in the supply of fuels, type of fuels in the blood, or rate of ATP use, cells maintain ATP homeostasis (a constant level of ATP). The rate of the TCA cycle, like that of all fuel oxidation pathways, is principally regulated to correspond to the rate of the ETC, which is regulated by the ATP/ADP ratio and the rate of ATP use (see Chapter 24). The major sites of regulation are shown in Figure 23.11.

Two major messengers feed information on the rate of ATP use back to the TCA cycle: (1) the phosphorylation state of ATP, as reflected in ATP and ADP levels; and (2) the reduction state of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, as reflected in the ratio of $\mathrm{NADH} / \mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. Within the cell, even within the mitochondrion, the total adenine nucleotide pool (adenosine monophosphate [AMP], ADP, plus ATP) and the total NAD pool ( $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$plus NADH) are relatively constant. Thus, an increased rate of ATP use results in a small decrease of ATP concentration and an increase of ADP. Likewise, increased NADH oxidation to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$by the ETC increases the rate of pathways that produce NADH. Under normal physiologic conditions, the TCA cycle and other oxidative pathways respond so rapidly to increased ATP demand that the ATP concentration does not significantly change.

![ma90181198a6](ma90181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 23.11 Major regulatory interactions in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The rate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis controls the rate of ATP synthesis, which controls the rate of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidation in the electrontransport chain (ETC). All NADH and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD[2H]) produced by the cycle donate electrons to this chain (shown on the right). Thus, oxidation of acetyl coenzyme A in the TCA cycle can go only as fast as electrons from NADH enter the electrontransport chain, which is controlled by the ATP and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) content of the cells. The ADP and NADH concentrations feed information on the rate of oxidative phosphorylation back to the TCA cycle. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (DH), $\alpha$-ketoglutarate DH, and malate DH are inhibited by increased NADH concentration. The NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio changes the concentration of oxaloacetate. Citrate is a product inhibitor of citrate synthase. ADP is an allosteric activator of isocitrate DH. During muscular contraction, increased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentrations activate isocitrate DH and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate DH (as well as pyruvate DH). Acetyl CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; $P_{\mathrm{s}}$ inorganic phosphate; Succinyl CoA, succinyl coenzyme A.

# A. Regulation of Citrate Synthase 

Citrate synthase, which is the first enzyme of the TCA cycle, is a simple enzyme that has no allosteric regulators. Its rate is controlled principally by the concentration of oxaloacetate, its substrate, and the concentration of citrate, a product inhibitor, that is competitive with oxaloacetate (see Fig. 23.11). The malate-oxaloacetate equilibrium favors malate, so the oxaloacetate concentration is very low inside the mitochondrion, and is below the apparent $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ (see Chapter 9, Section II.A.1) of citrate synthase. When the $\mathrm{NADH} / \mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio decreases, the ratio of oxaloacetate to malate increases. When isocitrate dehydrogenase is activated, the concentration of citrate decreases, thus relieving the product inhibition of citrate synthase. Hence, both increased oxaloacetate and decreased citrate levels regulate the response of citrate synthase to conditions established by the ETC and oxidative phosphorylation. In the liver, the $\mathrm{NADH} / \mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio helps determine whether acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle or goes into the alternative pathway for ketone body synthesis.

## B. Allosteric Regulation of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase

Isocitrate dehydrogenase, which consists of eight subunits, is considered one of the rate-limiting steps of the TCA cycle, and it is allosterically activated by ADP and inhibited by NADH (Fig. 23.12). In the absence of ADP, the enzyme exhibits positive

cooperativity; as isocitrate binds to one subunit, other subunits are converted to an active conformation (see Chapter 9, Section III.A, on allosteric enzymes). In the presence of ADP, all of the subunits are in their active conformation, and isocitrate binds more readily. Consequently, the apparent $K_{\mathrm{m,app}}$ (the $S_{0,5}$ ) shifts to a much lower value. Thus, at the concentration of isocitrate found in the mitochondrial matrix, a small change in the concentration of ADP can produce a large change in the rate of the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction. Small changes in the concentration of the product, NADH, and of the cosubstrate, $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, also affect the rate of the enzyme more than they would a nonallosteric enzyme.

## C. Regulation of $\alpha$-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase

The $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, although not an allosteric enzyme, is product-inhibited by NADH and succinyl-CoA and may also be inhibited by GTP (see Fig. 23.11). Thus, both $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase respond directly to changes in the relative levels of ADP and hence the rate at which NADH is oxidized by electron transport. Both of these enzymes are also activated by $\mathrm{Ca}^{+2}$. In contracting heart muscle, and possibly other muscle tissues, the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{+2}$ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during muscle contraction may provide an additional activation of these enzymes when ATP is being rapidly hydrolyzed.

## D. Regulation of Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Intermediates

Regulation of the TCA cycle serves two functions: It ensures that NADH is generated fast enough to maintain ATP homeostasis, and it regulates the concentration of TCA cycle intermediates. For example, in the liver, a decreased rate of isocitrate dehydrogenase increases citrate concentration, which stimulates citrate efflux to the cytosol. In the cytosol, citrate can act as an inhibitor of PFK-1 as well as activating fatty acid synthesis and providing a substrate for fatty acid synthesis (see Chapter 31). Citrate efflux from the mitochondria sends the message that energy levels are high within the mitochondria. Several regulatory interactions occur in the TCA cycle, in addition to those mentioned previously, that control the levels of TCA intermediates and their flux into pathways that adjoin the TCA cycle.

## VI. Precursors of Acetyl Coenzyme A

Compounds enter the TCA cycle as acetyl-CoA or as an intermediate that can be converted to malate or oxaloacetate. Compounds that enter as acetyl-CoA are oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Compounds that enter as TCA cycle intermediates replenish intermediates that have been used in biosynthetic pathways, such as gluconeogenesis or heme synthesis, but cannot be fully oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

## A. Sources of Acetyl Coenzyme A

Acetyl-CoA serves as a common point of convergence for the major pathways of fuel oxidation. It is generated directly from the $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids and degradation of the ketone bodies $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate (Fig. 23.13). It is also formed from acetate, which can arise from the diet or from ethanol oxidation. Glucose and other carbohydrates enter glycolysis, a pathway common to all cells, and are oxidized to pyruvate. The amino acids alanine and serine are also converted to pyruvate. Pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA by the PDC complex. Several amino acids, such as leucine and isoleucine, are also oxidized to acetyl-CoA. Thus, the final oxidation of acetyl-CoA to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the TCA cycle is the last step in all the major pathways of fuel oxidation.

## B. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex

The PDC oxidizes pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, thus linking glycolysis and the TCA cycle. In the brain, which is dependent on the oxidation of glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to fulfill its ATP needs, regulation of the PDC is a life-and-death matter.

FIGURE 23.12 Allosteric regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase. Isocitrate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$, and NADH bind in the active site; adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ are activators and bind to separate allosteric sites. A. A graph of velocity versus isocitrate concentration shows positive cooperativity (sigmoid curve) in the absence of ADP. The allosteric activator ADP changes the curve into one closer to a rectangular hyperbola, and decreases the $K_{\mathrm{m}}\left(S_{0,5}\right)$ for isocitrate. B. The allosteric activation by ADP is not an all-or-nothing response. The extent of activation by ADP depends on its concentration. C. Increases in the concentration of product, NADH, decrease the velocity of the enzyme through effects on the allosteric activation.

Deficiencies of the PDC, although rare, are among the most common inherited diseases leading to lactic acidemia and, similar to pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, are grouped into the category of Leigh disease (subacute necrotizing encephalopathy). When PDC is defective, pyruvate will accumulate and ATP production will drop. The low ATP will stimulate glycolysis (see Chapter 22) to proceed anaerobically, and to do so, pyruvate is reduced to lactate. In its severe form, PDC deficiency presents with overwhelming lactic acidosis at birth, with death in the neonatal period. In a second form of presentation, the lactic acidemia is moderate, but there is profound psychomotor disability with increasing age. In many cases, concomitant damage to the brainstem and basal ganglia lead to death in infancy. The neurologic symptoms arise because the brain has a very limited ability to use fatty acids as a fuel and is, therefore, dependent on glucose metabolism for its energy supply.

The most common PDC genetic defects are in the gene for the $\alpha$-subunit of $\mathrm{E}_{1}$. The $\mathrm{E}_{1} \alpha$-gene is $X$-linked. Because of its importance in central nervous system metabolism, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is a problem in both males and females, even if the female is a carrier. For this reason, it is classified as an X-linked dominant disorder.

## I. Structure of the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex

The PDC belongs to the $\alpha$-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex family and thus shares structural and catalytic features with the $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and the branched-chain $\alpha$-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (Fig. 23.14). It contains the same three basic types of catalytic subunits: (1) pyruvate decarboxylase subunits that bind TPP $\left(\mathrm{E}_{1}\right)$, (2) transacetylase subunits that bind lipoate $\left(\mathrm{E}_{2}\right)$, and (3) dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase subunits that bind FAD $\left(\mathrm{E}_{3}\right)$ (see Fig. 23.8). Although the $\mathrm{E}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ enzymes in PDC are relatively specific for pyruvate, the same dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase participates in all of the $\alpha$-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes. In addition to these three types of subunits, the PDC complex contains one additional subunit, an $\mathrm{E}_{3}$-binding protein ( $\mathrm{E}_{3} \mathrm{BP}$ ). Each functional component of the PDC complex is present in multiple copies (e.g., bovine heart PDC has 30 subunits of $\mathrm{E}_{1}, 60$ subunits of $\mathrm{E}_{2}$, and 6 subunits each of $\mathrm{E}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{E}_{3} \mathrm{BP}$ ). The $\mathrm{E}_{1}$ enzyme is itself a tetramer of two different types of subunits, $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

## 2. Regulation of the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex

PDC activity is controlled principally through phosphorylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, which inhibits the enzyme, and dephosphorylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, which activates it (Fig. 23.15). Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase are regulatory subunits within the PDC complex and act only on the complex. PDC kinase transfers a phosphate from ATP to specific serine hydroxyl (Ser-OH) groups on pyruvate decarboxylase $\left(\mathrm{E}_{1}\right)$. PDC phosphatase removes these phosphate groups by hydrolysis. Phosphorylation of just one serine on the $\mathrm{PDC}_{1} \alpha$-subunit can decrease its activity by $>99 \%$. PDC kinase is present in complexes as tissue-specific isozymes that vary in their regulatory properties.

PDC kinase is itself inhibited by ADP and pyruvate. Thus, when rapid ATP use results in an increase of ADP, or when activation of glycolysis increases pyruvate levels, PDC kinase is inhibited and PDC remains in an active, nonphosphorylated form. PDC phosphatase requires $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ for full activity. In the heart, increased intramitochondrial $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ during rapid contraction activates the phosphatase, thereby increasing the amount of active, nonphosphorylated PDC.

PDC is also regulated through inhibition by its products, acetyl-CoA and NADH. This inhibition is stronger than regular product inhibition because their

binding to PDC stimulates its phosphorylation to the inactive form. The substrates of the enzyme, CoASH and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, antagonize this product inhibition. Thus, when an ample supply of acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle is already available from fatty acid oxidation, acetyl-CoA and NADH build up and dramatically decrease their own further synthesis by PDC.

PDC can also be activated rapidly through a mechanism involving insulin, which plays a prominent role in adipocytes. In many tissues, insulin may, over time, slowly increase the amount of PDC present.

The rate of other fuel oxidation pathways that feed into the TCA cycle is also increased when ATP use increases. Insulin, other hormones, and diet control the availability of fuels for these oxidative pathways.

## 3. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Regulation and Glycolysis

PDC is also regulated principally by the rate of ATP use through rapid phosphorylation to an inactive form (see Fig. 23.15). Thus, in a normally respiring cell, with an adequate supply of oxygen, glycolysis and the TCA cycle are activated together, and glucose can be completely oxidized to carbon dioxide. However, when tissues do not have an adequate supply of oxygen to meet their ATP demands, the increased NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase, but AMP activates glycolysis. A proportion of the pyruvate is then reduced to lactate to allow glycolysis to continue.

## VII. Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Intermediates and Anaplerotic Reactions

## A. Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Intermediates are Precursors for Biosynthetic Pathways

The intermediates of the TCA cycle serve as precursors for a variety of different pathways present in different cell types (Fig. 23.16). This is particularly important in the central metabolic role of the liver. The TCA cycle in the liver is often called an open cycle because there is such a high efflux of intermediates. After a highcarbohydrate meal, citrate efflux and cleavage to acetyl-CoA provides acetyl units for cytosolic fatty acid synthesis. During fasting, gluconeogenic precursors are converted to malate, which leaves the mitochondria for cytosolic gluconeogenesis. The liver also uses TCA cycle intermediates to synthesize carbon skeletons of amino

FIGURE 23.16 Efflux of intermediates from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In the liver, TCA cycle intermediates are continuously withdrawn into the pathways of fatty acid synthesis, amino acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and heme synthesis. In the brain, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate is converted to glutamate and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA), both of which are neurotransmitters.

FIGURE 23.15 Regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC kinase, a subunit of the enzyme, phosphorylates PDC at a specific serine residue, thereby converting PDC to an inactive form. The kinase is inhibited by adenine diphosphate (ADP) and pyruvate. PDC phosphatase, another subunit of the enzyme, removes the phosphate, thereby activating PDC. The phosphatase is activated by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. When the substrates pyruvate and coenzyme A (CoASH) are bound to PDC, the kinase activity is inhibited and PDC is active. When the products acetyl coenzyme A and NADH bind to PDC, the kinase activity is stimulated, and the enzyme is phosphorylated to the inactive form. $E_{i}$ and the kinase exist as tissue-specific isozymes with overlapping tissue specificity and somewhat different regulatory properties.

Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is one of the genetic diseases grouped together under the clinical manifestations of Leigh's disease. In the mild form, the patient presents early in life with delayed development and a mild-tomoderate lactic acidemia (similar to PDC defects, pyruvate will accumulate when pyruvate decarboxylase is defective). Patients who survive have severe intellectual disabilities, and there is a loss of cerebral neurons. In the brain, pyruvate carboxylase is present in the astrocytes, which use TCA cycle intermediates to synthesize glutamine. This pathway is essential for neuronal survival. The major cause of the lactic acidemia is that cells dependent on pyruvate carboxylase for an anaplerotic supply of oxaloacetate cannot oxidize pyruvate in the TCA cycle (because of low oxaloacetate levels), and the liver cannot convert pyruvate to glucose (because the pyruvate carboxylase reaction is required for this pathway to occur), so the excess pyruvate is converted to lactate.
![ma96181198a6](ma96181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 23.17 Pyruvate carboxylase reaction. Pyruvate carboxylase adds a carboxyl group from bicarbonate (which is in equilibrium with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) to pyruvate to form oxaloacetate. Biotin is used to activate and transfer the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The energy to form the covalent biotin- $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ complex is provided by the high-energy phosphate bond of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is cleaved in the reaction. The enzyme is activated by acetyl coenzyme A. Acetyl CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.
acids. Succinyl-CoA may be removed from the TCA cycle to form heme in cells of the liver and bone marrow. In the brain, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate is converted to glutamate and then to $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter. In skeletal muscle, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate is converted to glutamine, which is transported through the blood to other tissues.

Pyruvate, citrate, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and malate, ADP, ATP, and phosphate (as well as many other compounds) have specific transporters in the inner mitochondrial membrane that transport compounds between the mitochondrial matrix and cytosol in exchange for a compound of similar charge. In contrast, CoASH, acetyl-CoA, other CoA derivatives, $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and NADH , and oxaloacetate are not transported at a metabolically significant rate. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, many cells transport citrate to the cytosol, where it is cleaved to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate by citrate lyase.

## B. Anaplerotic Reactions

Removal of any of the intermediates from the TCA cycle removes the four carbons that are used to regenerate oxaloacetate during each turn of the cycle. With depletion of oxaloacetate, it is impossible to continue oxidizing acetyl-CoA. To enable the TCA cycle to keep running, cells have to supply enough four-carbon intermediates from degradation of carbohydrate or certain amino acids to compensate for the rate of removal. Pathways or reactions that replenish the intermediates of the TCA cycle are referred to as anaplerotic ("filling up").

## 1. Pyruvate Carboxylase

Pyruvate carboxylase is one of the major anaplerotic enzymes in the cell. It catalyzes the addition of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to pyruvate to form oxaloacetate (Fig. 23.17). Like most carboxylases, pyruvate carboxylase contains biotin (a vitamin), which forms a covalent intermediate with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in a reaction that requires ATP and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ (see Fig. 8.9). The activated $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is then transferred to pyruvate to form the carboxyl group of oxaloacetate.

Pyruvate carboxylase is found in many tissues, such as liver, brain, adipocytes, and fibroblasts, where its function is anaplerotic. Its concentration is high in liver and kidney cortex, where there is a continuous removal of oxaloacetate and malate from the TCA cycle to enter the gluconeogenic pathway.

Pyruvate carboxylase is activated by acetyl-CoA and inhibited by high concentrations of many acyl-CoA derivatives. As the concentration of oxaloacetate is depleted through the efflux of TCA cycle intermediates, the rate of the citrate synthase reaction decreases and acetyl-CoA concentration rises. The acetyl-CoA then activates pyruvate carboxylase to synthesize more oxaloacetate.

## 2. Amino Acid Degradation

The pathways for oxidation of many amino acids convert their carbon skeletons into five- and four-carbon intermediates of the TCA cycle that can regenerate oxaloacetate (Fig. 23.18). Alanine and serine carbons can enter through pyruvate carboxylase (see Fig. 23.18, circle 1). In all tissues with mitochondria (except for, surprisingly, the liver), oxidation of the two branched-chain amino acids isoleucine and valine to succinyl-CoA forms a major anaplerotic route (see Fig. 23.18, circle 3). In the liver, other compounds forming propionyl-CoA (e.g., methionine, threonine, and odd-chain-length or branched fatty acids) also enter the TCA cycle as succinylCoA. In most tissues, glutamine is taken up from the blood, converted to glutamate, and then oxidized to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, forming another major anaplerotic route (see Fig. 23.18, circle 2). However, the TCA cycle cannot be resupplied with intermediates of fatty acid oxidation of even-chain-length, or ketone body oxidation, both of which only produce acetyl-CoA. In the TCA cycle, two carbons are lost from citrate before succinyl-CoA is formed, so there is no net conversion of acetyl carbon to oxaloacetate.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

Otto S. is experiencing the benefits of physical conditioning. A variety of functional adaptations in the heart, lungs, vascular system, and skeletal muscle occur in response to regular graded exercise. The pumping efficiency of the heart increases, allowing greater cardiac output with fewer beats per minute and at a lower rate of oxygen use. The lungs extract a greater percentage of oxygen from the inspired air, allowing fewer respirations per unit of activity. The vasodilatory capacity of the arterial beds in skeletal muscle increases, promoting greater delivery of oxygen and fuels to exercising muscle. Concurrently, the venous drainage capacity in muscle is enhanced, ensuring that lactic acid will not accumulate in contracting tissues. These adaptive changes in physiologic responses are accompanied by increases in the number, size, and activity of skeletal muscle mitochondria, along with the content of TCA cycle enzymes and components of the electron-transport chain. These changes markedly enhance the oxidative capacity of exercising muscle.

In skeletal muscle and other tissues, ATP is generated by anaerobic glycolysis when the rate of aerobic respiration is inadequate to meet the rate of ATP use. Under these circumstances, the rate of pyruvate production exceeds the cell's capacity to oxidize NADH in the electron-transport chain and hence to oxidize pyruvate in the TCA cycle. The excess pyruvate is reduced to lactate. Because lactate is an acid, its accumulation affects the muscle and causes pain and swelling.

Beniberi, now known to be caused by thiamin deficiency, was attributed to lack of a nitrogenous component in food by Takaki, a Japanese surgeon, in 1884. In 1890, Eijkman, a Dutch physician working in Java, noted that the polyneuritis associated with beriberi could be prevented by rice bran that had been removed during polishing. Thiamin is present in the bran portion of grains, and it is abundant in pork and legumes. In contrast to most vitamins, milk and milk products, seafood, fruits, and vegetables are not good sources of thiamin.

Ann R. is experiencing fatigue for several reasons. She has iron-deficiency anemia, which affects iron-containing hemoglobin in her red blood cells, iron in aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, as well as iron in the heme proteins of the electron-transport chain. She may also be experiencing the consequences of multiple vitamin deficiencies, including thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin (the vitamin precursor of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$). It is less likely, but possible, that she also has subclinical deficiencies of pantothenate (the precursor of coenzyme A) or biotin. As a result, Ann's muscles must use glycolysis as their primary source of energy, which results in sore muscles.

Riboflavin deficiency generally occurs in conjunction with other deficiencies of water-soluble vitamins. The classic deficiency symptoms are cheilosis (inflammation of the corners of the mouth), glossitis (magenta tongue), and seborrheic ("greasy") dermatitis. It is also characterized by sore throat, edema of the pharyngeal and oral mucous membranes, and normochromic, normocytic anemia. However, it is not known whether the glossitis and dermatitis are actually caused by multiple vitamin deficiencies.

Riboflavin has a wide distribution in foods, and small amounts are present as coenzymes in most plant and animal tissues. Eggs, lean meats, milk, broccoli, and enriched breads and cereals are especially good sources. A portion of our niacin requirement can be met by synthesis from tryptophan. Meat (especially red meat), liver, legumes, milk, eggs, alfalfa, cereal grains, yeast, and fish are good sources of niacin and tryptophan.

Al M. presents a second time with an alcohol-related high-output form of heart failure from thiamin deficiency that is sometimes referred to as wet beriberi or as the beriberi heart (see Chapter 9). The word wet refers to the fluid retention, which may eventually occur when left ventricular contractility is so compromised that cardiac output, although initially relatively "high," cannot meet the "demands" of the peripheral vascular beds, which have dilated in response to the thiamin deficiency.

The cardiomyopathy is the result of the persistent high output required because of the dilated peripheral vasculature and is also likely related to a reduction in the normal biochemical function of the vitamin thiamin in heart muscle. Inhibition of the $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes causes accumulation of $\alpha$-keto acids in heart muscle (and in blood), which may result in a chemically induced cardiomyopathy. Impairment of two other functions of thiamin may also contribute to the cardiomyopathy. TTP serves as the coenzyme for transketolase in the pentose phosphate pathway, and pentose phosphates accumulate in thiamin deficiency. In addition, thiamin triphosphate (a different coenzyme form) may function in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance channels.

Immediate treatment with large doses ( 50 to 100 mg ) of intravenous thiamin may produce a measurable decrease in cardiac output and increase in peripheral vascular resistance as early as 30 minutes after the initial injection. Dietary supplementation of thiamin is not as effective because ethanol consumption interferes with thiamin absorption. Because ethanol also affects the absorption of most watersoluble vitamins, or their conversion to the coenzyme form, Al M. was also given a bolus containing a multivitamin supplement.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Compartmentation of Mitochondrial Enzymes. The mitochondrion forms a structural, functional, and regulatory compartment within the cell. The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to anions and cations, and compounds can cross the membrane only on specific transport proteins. The enzymes of the TCA cycle, therefore, have more direct access to products of the previous reaction in the pathway than they would if these products were able to diffuse throughout the cell. Complex formation between enzymes also restricts access to pathway intermediates. Malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase may form a loosely associated complex. The multienzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase and

$\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes are examples of substrate channeling by tightly bound enzymes; only the transacylase enzyme has access to the thiaminbound intermediate of the reaction, and only lipoamide dehydrogenase has access to reduced lipoic acid.

Compartmentation plays an important role in regulation. The close association between the rate of the electron-transport chain and the rate of the TCA cycle is maintained by their mutual access to the same pool of NADH and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$in the mitochondrial matrix. $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}, \mathrm{NADH}, \mathrm{CoASH}$, and acyl-CoA derivatives have no transport proteins and cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane. Thus, all of the dehydrogenases compete for the same $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$molecules and are inhibited when NADH rises. Likewise, accumulation of acyl-CoA derivatives (e.g., acetyl-CoA) within the mitochondrial matrix affects other CoA-using reactions, either by competing at the active site or by limiting CoASH availability.

Import of Nuclear-Encoded Proteins. All mitochondrial matrix proteins, such as the TCA cycle enzymes, are encoded by the nuclear genome. They are imported into the mitochondrial matrix as unfolded proteins that are pushed and pulled through channels in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 23.19). Proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix have either a targeting N -terminal presequence of about 23 amino acids that includes several positively charged amino acid residues, or an internal mitochondrial localizing signal. The mitochondrial matrix proteins are synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytosol and maintain an unfolded conformation by binding to heat-shock protein 70 (hsp 70) chaperonins. This basic presequence binds to a receptor in a translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex (see Fig. 23.19, Circle 1). The TOM complexes consist of channel proteins, assembly proteins, and receptor proteins with different specificities (e.g., TOM23 binds the matrix protein presequence). Negatively charged acidic residues on the receptors and in the channel pore assist in translocation of the matrix protein through the channel, presequence first.

The matrix preprotein is translocated across the inner membrane through a translocases of the inner membrane (TIM) complex (see Fig. 23.19, Circle 2). Insertion of the preprotein into the TIM channel is driven by the potential difference across the membrane, $\Delta \Psi$. Mitochondrial hsp 70 (mthsp 70), which is bound to the matrix side of the TIM complex, binds the incoming preprotein and may "ratchet" it through the membrane. ATP is required for binding of mthsp 70 to the TIM complex and again for the subsequent dissociation of the mthsp 70 and the matrix preprotein. In the matrix, the preprotein may require another heat-shock protein, hsp 60, for proper folding. The final step in the import process is cleavage of the signal sequence by a matrix-processing protease (see Fig. 23.19, Circle 3).

Proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane are imported through a similar process, using TOM and TIM complexes containing different protein components.

## KEY CONCEPTS

- The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle accounts for more than two-thirds of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generated from fuel oxidation.
- All of the enzymes required for the TCA cycle are in the mitochondria.
- Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), generated from fuel oxidation, is the substrate for the TCA cycle.
- Acetyl-CoA, when oxidized via the cycle, generates $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, reduced electron carriers, and guanosine triphosphate.
- The reduced electron carriers (NADH, FAD[2H]) donate electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ via the electron-transport chain, which leads to ATP generation from oxidative phosphorylation.

- The cycle requires several cofactors to function properly, some of which are derived from vitamins. These include thiamin pyrophosphate (derived from vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ ), flavin adenine dinucleotide (derived from vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{2}$, riboflavin), and coenzyme A (derived from pantothenic acid).
- Intermediates of the TCA cycle are used for many biosynthetic reactions and are replaced by anaplerotic (refilling) reactions within the cell.
- The cycle is carefully regulated within the mitochondria by energy and the levels of reduced electron carriers. As energy levels decrease, the rate of the cycle increases.
- Impaired functioning of the TCA cycle leads to an inability to generate ATP from fuel oxidation and an accumulation of TCA cycle precursors.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 23.2.


# TABLE 23.2 Diseases Discussed in Chapter 23 

| DISEASE OR DISORDER | ENVIRONMENTAL OR GENETIC | COMMENTS |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Obesity | Both | Increased physical activity, without increasing caloric intake, will lead to weight loss and increased exercise capacity. One effect of increased aerobic exercise is increasing the number and size of mitochondria in the muscle cells. |
| Anorexia nervosa | Both | Patients who have been malnourished for some time may exhibit subclinical deficiencies in many vitamins, including riboflavin and niacin, factors required for energy generation. |
| Congestive heart failure linked to alcoholism | Both | Thiamin deficiency, brought about by chronic alcohol ingestion, leads to dilation of the blood vessels, inefficient energy production by the heart, and failure to adequately pump blood throughout the body. The vitamin B1 deficiency reduces the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, severely restricting adenosine triphosphate generation. |
| Arsenic poisoning | Environmental | Arsenite inhibits enzymes and cofactors with free adjacent sulfhydryl groups (lipoic acid is a target of arsenite), whereas arsenate acts as a phosphate analog and inhibits substrate-level phosphorylation reactions. |
| Leigh disease (subacute necrotizing encephalopathy) | Genetic | Deficiencies of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), as well as of pyruvate carboxylase, are inherited disorders leading to lactic acidemia. In its most severe form, PDC deficiency presents with overwhelming lactic acidosis at birth, with death in the neonatal period. Even in less severe forms, neurologic symptoms arise because of the brain's dependence on glucose metabolism for energy. The most common PDC deficiency is X-linked, in the $\alpha$-subunit of the pyruvate decarboxylase ( $\mathrm{E}_{1}$ ) subunit. Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency also leads to intellectual disability. |

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The $\mathrm{E}_{3}$ subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase, the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase activity (with bound FAD), is shared among all the $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenases. Thus, with this mutation, both pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity would be defective. This defect would then lead to an accumulation of pyruvate (because pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is reduced), and the accumulated pyruvate is converted to lactate (to regenerate $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to allow glycolysis to continue), leading to an elevation of lactate in the bloodstream and a lowering of blood pH (lactic acidemia). A defect in pyruvate carboxylase will also result in an elevation of pyruvate levels, and lactic acidemia, but there would be no defect in $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity with a pyruvate carboxylase deficiency. The $\mathrm{E}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase are unique to pyruvate dehydrogenase, and are not shared with any other enzymes, so defects in these subunits will lead to lactic acidemia but would not affect $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. A defect in lactate dehydrogenase would result in an inability to produce lactate, and lactic acidemia would not result from a defect in that enzyme.
2. The answer is B. TTP is a required coenzyme for the $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes. With these complexes inactive, pyruvic acid and $\alpha$-ketoglutaric acid accumulate and dissociate to generate the anion and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Because $\alpha$-ketoglutarate is not listed as an answer, the only possible answer is pyruvate.
3. The answer is A. Succinate dehydrogenase is the only TCA cycle enzyme located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The other enzymes are in the mitochondrial matrix. Answer B is incorrect because succinate dehydrogenase is not regulated by NADH. Answer C is incorrect because $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase also contains a bound FAD (the difference is that the $\mathrm{FAD}[2 \mathrm{H}]$ in $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase donates its electrons to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, whereas the $\mathrm{FAD}[2 \mathrm{H}]$ in succinate dehydrogenase donates its electrons directly to the electron-transfer chain). Answer D is incorrect because both succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase have $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers. Answer E is incorrect because succinate dehydrogenase is not regulated by a kinase. Kinases regulate enzymes by phosphorylation (e.g., the regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase occurs through reversible phosphorylation).
4. The answer is $\mathbf{E}$. NADH decreases during exercise in order to generate energy for the exercise (if it were increased, it would inhibit the cycle and slow it down); thus, the NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio is decreased, and the lack of NADH activates flux through isocitrate dehydrogenase, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase. Isocitrate dehydrogenase is inhibited by NADH, so answer A is not correct. Fumarase is not regulated; thus,
answer B is incorrect. The four-carbon intermediates of the cycle are regenerated during each turn of the cycle, so their concentrations do not decrease (thus, C is incorrect). Product inhibition of citrate synthase would slow the cycle and not generate more energy (hence, D is incorrect).
5. The answer is D. Pantothenate is the vitamin precursor of coenzyme A. Niacin is the vitamin precursor of NAD, and riboflavin is the vitamin precursor of FAD and FMN. Vitamins A and C are used with only minor modifications, if any, and are not involved in any TCA cycle reactions.
6. The answer is B. The net equation of the TCA cycle, in terms of carbon atoms, is that acetyl-CoA is converted to two molecules of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The eight electrons associated with the two carbon atoms of acetyl-CoA are removed and placed in three molecules of NADH and one molecule of $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$. The TCA cycle does not generate reduced cofactors from pyruvate, lactate, oxaloacetate, or phosphoenolpyruvate. Those compounds would need to be converted to acetyl-CoA in order for the cycle to generate the reduced cofactors.
7. The answer is C. With hypoxia, the TCA cycle would slow down because of the accumulation of NADH (which cannot donate electrons to oxygen) caused by the lack of oxygen. The high NADH inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase, so pyruvate will accumulate, and the high levels of pyruvate will block lactate from being converted to pyruvate (the lactate dehydrogenase reaction), leading to lactate accumulation. Because the operation of the TCA cycle is greatly reduced, citrate and succinyl-CoA will not be produced, so they will not accumulate. The enzymes of the TCA cycle are located in the mitochondria, not in the cytoplasm.
8. The answer is D. GTP is generated from substratelevel phosphorylation during the TCA cycle (not ATP). Mitochondrial ATP is generated by oxidative phosphorylation, using the electrons from the electron carriers NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$. The TCA cycle requires some B vitamins but not vitamins C or D. One molecule of acetyl-CoA (two carbons) produces $2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}, 3 \mathrm{NADH}$, $1 \mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$, and 1 GTP (not ATP).
9. The answer is A. A deficiency of the $\mathrm{E}_{1}$ subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase would decrease conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, leading to an accumulation of pyruvate. Pyruvate is converted to lactate to allow glycolysis to continue to generate ATP from substrate-level phosphorylation. The pyruvate to lactate conversion regenerates the $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, which is required for glycolysis to proceed. Cells of the brain have a high ATP requirement and are highly dependent on glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation in the TCA cycle to meet this demand for ATP. Without pyruvate oxidation in the TCA cycle, glycolysis will try to produce ATP as fast as possible (because

of an increase of AMP levels, which activates PFK-1); however, the amount of ATP produced by glycolysis alone is not sufficient to meet the brain's needs. Thus, the ATP/ADP ratio actually decreases. Even though the brain cells are low in ATP levels, the decreased production of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate will not provide sufficient substrate to substantially increase the activity of the electron-transfer chain in brain cells. Fatty acids do not cross the blood-brain barrier, so ketone body oxidation would be required to increase acetyl-CoA levels within the mitochondria to allow rapid functioning of the TCA cycle. Acetyl-CoA is not produced from glucose when pyruvate dehydrogenase is defective, and acetylCoA cannot be exported to the circulation.
10. The answer is A. When pyruvate carboxylase is deficient, pyruvate cannot be converted to oxaloacetate,
thereby reducing the ability to replenish TCA cycle intermediates as they are being used for other pathways. As oxaloacetate levels decrease, acetyl-CoA cannot be converted to citrate, and acetyl-CoA will accumulate within the mitochondria. The elevated acetyl-CoA inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase, which, coupled with the reduced activity of pyruvate carboxylase, leads to pyruvate accumulation in the cytoplasm. The increased pyruvate is then converted to lactic acid, leading to lactic acidemia. Pyruvate is not an allosteric activator of lactate dehydrogenase. Because the TCA cycle is slowed owing to lack of oxaloacetate, NADH is not accumulating in the mitochondrial matrix, nor is ATP. Pyruvate is not an activator of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and free coenzyme A are the primary activators, along with ADP).

# Oxidative Phosphorylation and Mitochondrial Function 

Energy from fuel oxidation is converted to the high-energy phosphate bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Most of the energy from oxidation of fuels in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and other pathways is conserved in the form of the reduced electron-accepting coenzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD[2H]). The electron-transport chain (ETC) oxidizes NADH and FAD(2H) and donates the electrons to $\mathbf{O}_{2}$, which is reduced to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (Fig. 24.1). Energy from reduction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is used for phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to ATP by ATP synthase ( $\mathbf{F}_{0} \mathbf{F}_{1}$-ATPase). The net yield of oxidative phosphorylation is approximately 2.5 mol of ATP per mole of NADH oxidized, or 1.5 mol of ATP per mole of FAD(2H) oxidized.

Chemiosmotic Model of Adenosine Triphosphate Synthesis. The chemiosmotic model explains how energy from transport of electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is transformed into the high-energy phosphate bond of ATP (see Fig. 24.1). Basically, the ETC contains three large protein complexes (I, III, and IV) that span the inner mitochondrial membrane. As electrons pass through these complexes in a series of oxidation-reduction reactions, protons are transferred from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosolic side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The pumping of protons generates an electrochemical gradient $(\Delta p)$ across the membrane composed of the membrane potential and the proton gradient. ATP synthase contains a proton pore that spans the inner mitochondrial membrane and a catalytic headpiece that protrudes into the matrix. As protons are driven into the matrix through the pore, they change the conformation of the headpiece, which releases ATP from one site and catalyzes formation of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate $\left(P_{i}\right)$ at another site.
![ma100181198a6](ma100181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.1 Oxidative phosphorylation. Red arrows show the path of electron transport from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.As electrons pass through the chain, protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, thereby establishing an electrochemical potential gradient, $\Delta p$, across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The positive and negative charges on the membrane denote the membrane potential $(\Delta \psi) . \Delta p$ drives protons into the matrix through a pore in ATP synthase, which uses the energy to form adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right) . \mathrm{CaQ}$, coenzyme Q .

Deficiencies of Electron Transport. In cells, complete transfer of electrons from NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ through the chain to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is necessary for ATP generation. Impaired transfer through any complex can have pathologic consequences. Fatigue can result from iron-deficiency anemia, which decreases Fe for Fe-S centers and cytochromes Cytochrome $\mathbf{c}_{1}$ oxidase, which contains the $\mathbf{O}_{2}$-binding site, is inhibited by cyanide. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is maternally inherited, encodes some of the subunits of the ETC complexes and ATP synthase. OXPHOS diseases are caused by mutations in nuclear DNA or mtDNA that decrease mitochondrial capacity for oxidative phosphorylation.

Regulation of Oxidative Phosphorylation. The rate of the ETC is coupled to the rate of ATP synthesis by the transmembrane electrochemical gradient. As ATP is used for energy-requiring processes and ADP levels increase, proton influx through the ATP synthase pore generates more ATP, and the ETC responds to restore $\Delta \mathrm{p}$. In uncoupling, protons return to the matrix by a mechanism that bypasses the ATP synthase pore, and the energy is released as heat. Proton leakage, chemical uncouplers, and regulated uncoupling proteins increase our metabolic rate and heat generation.

Mitochondria and Cell Death. Although oxidative phosphorylation is a mitochondrial process, most ATP use occurs outside of the mitochondrion. ATP synthesized from oxidative phosphorylation is actively transported from the matrix to the intermembrane space by adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT). Porins form voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) through the outer mitochondrial membrane for the diffusion of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. ATP metabolites, and other ions. Under certain types of stress, ANT, VDACs, and other proteins form a nonspecific open channel known as the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This pore is associated with events that lead rapidly to necrotic cell death.

# THE WAITING ROOM 

$\square$Cora N. was recovering uneventfully from her heart attack 1 month earlier (see Chapter 20), when she won the Georgia state lottery. When she heard her number announced over the television, she experienced crushing chest pain and grew short of breath. Her family called 911 and she was rushed to the hospital emergency department.

On initial examination, her blood pressure was extremely high and her heart rhythm irregular. Cora is experiencing yet another myocardial infarction. An electrocardiogram showed unequivocal evidence of severe lack of oxygen (ischemia) in the muscles of the anterior and lateral walls of her heart. Life-support measures including nasal oxygen were initiated. An intravenous drip of nitroglycerin, a vasodilating agent, was started in an effort to reduce her hypertension (it will also help to decrease her "preload" by vasodilating the vessels going to the heart). She was also given a $\beta$-blocker, which will also help decrease her blood pressure as well as decrease the work of her heart by slowing her heart rate. She also required a small amount of intravenous nitroprusside to help lower her blood pressure. After her blood pressure was well controlled, and because the hospital did not have a cardiac catheterization laboratory and a transfer to a hospital with a cath lab was not possible, a decision was made to administer intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in an attempt to break up any intracoronary artery blood clots in vessels supplying the ischemic myocardium (thrombolytic therapy).

Stanley T. A ${ }^{121}$ I thyroid uptake and scan performed on Stanley T. confirmed that his hyperthyroidism was the result of Graves disease (see Chapter 20). Graves disease, also known as diffuse toxic goiter, is an autoimmune genetic disorder caused by the generation of human thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins. These immunoglobulins stimulate growth of the thyroid gland (goiter) and excess secretion of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{3}\right)$ and tetraiodothyronine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{4}\right)$. Because heat production is increased under these circumstances, Mr. T.'s heat intolerance and sweating were growing worse with time.

$\square$Cora N. is experiencing a second myocardial infarction. Ischemia (low blood flow) has caused hypoxia (low levels of oxygen) in the threatened area of her heart muscle, resulting in inadequate generation of ATP for the maintenance of low intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ levels (see Chapter 20). As a consequence, the myocardial cells in that specific location have become swollen and the cytosolic proteins creatine kinase (MB isoform) and troponin (heart isoform) have leaked into the blood. (See Ann J., Chapters 6 and 7).

An electromyogram measures the electrical potential of muscle cells both at rest and while contracting. Electrodes are inserted through the skin and into the muscle, and baseline recordings (no contraction) are obtained, followed by measurements of electrical activity when the muscle contracts. The electrode is retracted a small amount, and the measurements are repeated. This occurs for up to 10 to 20 measurements, thereby sampling, many distinct areas of the muscle. Under normal conditions, muscles at rest will have minimal electrical activity, which increases significantly as the muscle contracts. Electromyograms that deviate from the norm suggest an underlying pathology interfering with membrane polarizationdepolarization as the nerve cells instruct the muscle cells to contract.

Charles F. who has a follicular-type non-Hodgkin lymphoma, was being treated with the anthracycline drug doxorubicin (see Chapter 16). During the course of his treatment, he developed biventricular heart failure. Although doxorubicin is a highly effective anticancer agent against a wide variety of human tumors, its clinical use is limited by a specific, cumulative, dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Impairment of mitochondrial function may play a major role in this toxicity. Doxorubicin binds to cardiolipin, a lipid component of the inner membrane of mitochondria, where it might directly affect components of oxidative phosphorylation. Doxorubicin inhibits succinate oxidation, inactivates cytochrome oxidase, interacts with CoQ, adversely affects ion pumps, and inhibits ATP synthase, resulting in decreased ATP levels and mildly swollen mitochondria. It decreases the ability of the mitochondria to sequester $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and increases free radicals (highly reactive single-electron forms), leading to damage of the mitochondrial membrane (see Chapter 25). It also might affect heart function indirectly through other mechanisms.

Isabel S., an intravenous drug user, appeared to be responding well to her multidrug regimens to treat pulmonary tuberculosis and HIV (see Chapters 12, 13, 14, and 17). In the past 6 weeks, however, she has developed increasing weakness in her extremities to the point that she has difficulty carrying light objects or walking. Physical examination indicates a diffuse proximal and distal muscle weakness associated with muscle atrophy. The muscles are not painful on motion but are mildly tender to palpation. The blood level of the muscle enzymes creatine phosphokinase and aldolase are elevated. An electromyogram revealed a generalized reduction in the muscle action potentials, suggestive of a primary myopathic process. Proton spectroscopy of her brain and upper spinal cord showed no anatomic or biochemical abnormalities. The diffuse and progressive skeletal muscle weakness was out of proportion to that expected from her HIV or tuberculosis. This information led her physicians to consider other etiologies.

## I. Oxidative Phosphorylation

Generation of ATP from oxidative phosphorylation requires an electron donor (NADH or FAD[2H]), an electron acceptor $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, and an intact inner mitochondrial membrane that is impermeable to protons, all the components of the ETC and ATP synthase. It is regulated by the rate of ATP use.

Most cells are dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP homeostasis. During oxygen deprivation from ischemia (low blood flow), an inability to generate energy from the ETC results in increased permeability of this membrane and mitochondrial swelling. Mitochondrial swelling is a key element in the pathogenesis of irreversible cell injury, leading to cell lysis and death (necrosis).

## A. Overview of Oxidative Phosphorylation

Our understanding of oxidative phosphorylation is based on the chemiosmotic hypothesis, which proposes that the energy for ATP synthesis is provided by an electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This electrochemical gradient is generated by the components of the ETC, which pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane as they sequentially accept and donate electrons (see Fig. 24.1). The final acceptor is $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which is reduced to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

## I. Electron Transfer from NADH to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$

In the ETC, electrons donated by NADH or FAD(2H) are passed sequentially through a series of electron carriers embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Each of the components of the ETC is reduced as it accepts an electron and then oxidized as it passes the electrons to the next member of the chain. From NADH, electrons are transferred sequentially through NADH:CoQ oxidoreductase (complex I, also known as NADH dehydrogenase), coenzyme Q (CoQ), the cytochrome $b-c_{1}$ complex (complex III), cytochrome $c$, and finally, cytochrome $c$ oxidase (complex IV). NADH:CoQ oxidoreductase, the cytochrome b-c1 complex, and cytochrome c oxidase are multisubunit protein complexes that span the inner mitochondrial membrane. CoQ is a lipid-soluble quinone that is not protein-bound and is free to diffuse in the lipid membrane. It transports electrons from complex I to complex III and is an intrinsic part of the proton pump for each of these complexes. Cytochrome c is a small protein in the intermembrane space that transfers electrons from the $\mathrm{b}-\mathrm{c}_{1}$ complex to cytochrome oxidase. The terminal complex, cytochrome c oxidase, contains the binding site for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. As $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ accepts electrons from the chain, it is reduced to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

## 2. The Electrochemical Potential Gradient

At each of the three large membrane-spanning complexes in the chain, electron transfer is accompanied by proton pumping across the membrane. There is an energy drop of approximately 16 kilocalories ( kcal ) in reduction potential as electrons pass through each of these complexes, which provides the energy required to move protons against a concentration gradient. The membrane is impermeable to protons, so they cannot diffuse through the lipid bilayer back into the matrix. Thus, in actively respiring mitochondria, the intermembrane space and cytosol may be approximately 0.75 pH unit lower than the matrix.

The transmembrane movement of protons generates an electrochemical gradient with two components: the membrane potential (the external face of the membrane is charged positive relative to the matrix side) and the proton gradient (the intermembrane space has a higher proton concentration and is, therefore, more acidic than the matrix) (Fig. 24.2). The electrochemical gradient is sometimes called the proton motive force because it is the energy that pushes the protons to reenter the matrix to equilibrate on both sides of the membrane. The protons are attracted to the more negatively charged matrix side of the membrane, where the pH is more alkaline.

## 3. Adenosine Triphosphate Synthase

ATP synthase ( $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$-ATPase), the enzyme that generates ATP, is a multisubunit enzyme that contains an inner membrane portion $\left(\mathrm{F}_{0}\right)$ and a stalk and headpiece $\left(\mathrm{F}_{1}\right)$ that project into the matrix (Fig. 24.3). The 12 c -subunits in the membrane form a rotor that is attached to a central asymmetric shaft composed of the $\varepsilon$ - and $\gamma$-subunits. The headpiece is composed of three $\alpha \beta$-subunit pairs. Each $\beta$-subunit contains a catalytic site for ATP synthesis. The headpiece is held stationary by a $\delta$-subunit attached to a long b-subunit connected to subunit a in the membrane.

The influx of protons through the proton channel turns the rotor. The proton channel is formed by the c -subunits on one side and the a-subunit on the other side. Although the channel is continuous, it has two offset portions, one portion open directly to the intermembrane space and one portion open directly to the matrix. In the current model, each c-subunit contains a glutamyl carboxyl group that extends into the proton channel. Because this carboxyl group accepts a proton from the

![ma102181198a6](ma102181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.2 Proton motive force (electrochemical gradient) across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The proton motive force consists of a membrane potential, $\Delta \psi$, and a proton gradient, denoted by $\Delta p H$ for the difference in pH across the membrane. The electrochemical potential is called the proton motive force because it represents the potential energy driving protons to return to the more negatively charged alkaline matrix.

![ma103181198a6](ma103181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.4 Binding-change mechanism for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. The three $\alpha \beta$-subunit pairs of the ATP synthase headpiece have binding sites that can exist in three different conformations, depending on the position of the $\gamma$-stalk subunit. (I) When adenosine diphosphate (ADP) + inorganic phosphate (P.) bind to an open site and the proton influx rotates the $\gamma$-spindle (white arrow), the conformation of the subunits change and ATP is released from one site. (ATP dissociation is thus the energy-requiring step.) Bound ADP and $P_{i}$ combine to form ATP at another site. (2) As the ADP $+P_{i}$ bind to the new open site, and the $\gamma$-shaft rotates, the conformations of the sites change again and ATP is released. ADP and $P_{i}$ combine to form another ATP.

Although iron-deficiency anemia is characterized by decreased levels of hemoglobin and other iron-containing proteins in the blood, the iron-containing cytochromes and $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers of the ETC in tissues such as skeletal muscle are affected as rapidly. Fatigue in iron-deficiency anemia, in patients such as Ann R. (see Chapter 16), results in part from the lack of electron transport for ATP production.
intermembrane space, the c-subunit rotates into the hydrophobic lipid membrane. The rotation exposes a different proton-containing c-subunit to the portion of the channel that is open directly to the matrix side. Because the matrix has a lower proton concentration, the glutamyl carboxylic acid group releases a proton into the matrix portion of the channel. Rotation is completed by an attraction between the negatively charged glutamyl residue and a positively charged arginyl group on the a-subunit.

According to the binding-change mechanism, as the asymmetric shaft rotates to a new position, it forms different binding associations with the $\alpha \beta$-subunits (Fig. 24.4). The new position of the shaft alters the conformation of one $\beta$-subunit so that it releases a molecule of ATP and another subunit spontaneously catalyzes synthesis of ATP from $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$, one proton, and ADP. Thus, energy from the electrochemical gradient is used to change the conformation of the ATP synthase subunits so that the newly synthesized ATP is released.

## B. Oxidation-Reduction Components of the Electron-Transport Chain

Electron transport to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ occurs via a series of oxidation-reduction steps in which each successive component of the chain is reduced as it accepts electrons and oxidized as it passes electrons to the next component of the chain. The oxidation-reduction components of the chain include flavin mononucleotide (FMN), $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers, CoQ , and Fe in cytochromes $\mathrm{b}, \mathrm{c}_{1}, \mathrm{c}, \mathrm{a}$, and $\mathrm{a}_{2}$. Copper $(\mathrm{Cu})$ is also a component of cytochromes a and $\mathrm{a}_{3}$ (Fig. 24.5). With the exception of CoQ , all of these electron acceptors are tightly bound to the protein subunits of the carriers. FMN, like FAD, is synthesized from the vitamin riboflavin (see Fig. 20.10).

The reduction potential of each complex of the chain is at a lower energy level than the previous complex, so energy is released as electrons pass through each complex. This energy is used to move protons against their concentration gradient, so they become concentrated on the cytosolic side of the inner membrane.

## 1. NADH:CoQ Oxidoreductase

NADH:CoQ oxidoreductase (also named NADH dehydrogenase) is an enormous 42 -subunit complex that contains a binding site for NADH, several FMN and ironsulfur ( $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ ) center binding proteins, and binding sites for CoQ (see Fig. 24.5). An FMN accepts two electrons from NADH and is able to pass single electrons to the $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers. $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers, which are able to delocalize single electrons into large orbitals, transfer electrons to and from $\mathrm{CoQ} . \mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers are also present in other enzyme systems-such as proteins within the cytochrome b-c 1 complex, which transfer electrons to CoQ-and in aconitase in the TCA cycle.

## 2. Succinate Dehydrogenase and Other Flavoproteins

In addition to NADH:CoQ oxidoreductase, succinate dehydrogenase and other flavoproteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane also pass electrons to CoQ (see Fig. 24.5). Succinate dehydrogenase is part of the TCA cycle and also a component of complex II of the ETC. Electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF):CoQ oxidoreductase accepts electrons from ETF, which acquires them from fatty acid oxidation and other pathways. Both of these flavoproteins have $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers. Glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a flavoprotein that is part of a shuttle for reoxidizing cytosolic NADH (see Section I.E).

The free-energy drop in electron transfer between NADH and CoQ of approximately -13 to -14 kcal is able to support movement of four protons. However, the FAD in succinate dehydrogenase (as well as ETF:CoQ oxidoreductase and glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is at roughly the same redox potential as CoQ , and no energy is released as they transfer electrons to CoQ . These proteins do not span the membrane and consequently do not have a proton pumping mechanism.

![ma104181198a6](ma104181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.5 Components of the electron-transport chain. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide:coenzyme Q (NADH:CoQ) oxidoreductase (complex I) spans the membrane and has a proton-pumping mechanism involving CoQ. The electrons go from CoQ to the cytochrome b-c ${ }_{1}$ complex (complex III); electron transfer does not involve complex II. Succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF):CoQ oxidoreductase all transfer electrons to CoQ , but they do not span the membrane and do not have proton pumping mechanisms. As CoQ accepts electrons and protons from the matrix side, it is converted to $\mathrm{CoQH}_{3}$. Electrons are transferred from complex III to complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) by cytochrome c, a small cytochrome in the intermembrane space that has reversible binding sites on the $\mathrm{b}-\mathrm{c}_{1}$ complex and cytochrome c oxidase. FMN, flavin mononucleotide.

# 3. Coenzyme $Q$ 

CoQ is the only component of the ETC that is not protein-bound. The large hydrophobic side chain of 10 isoprenoid units ( 50 carbons) confers lipid solubility, and CoQ is able to diffuse freely through the lipids of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 24.6). When the oxidized quinone form accepts a single electron (to form the semiquinone), it forms a free radical (a compound with a single electron in an orbital). The transfer of single electrons makes it the major site for generation of toxic oxygen free radicals in the body (see Chapter 25).

The semiquinone can accept a second electron and two protons from the matrix side of the membrane to form the fully reduced quinone. The mobility of CoQ in the membrane, its ability to accept one or two electrons, and its ability to accept and donate protons enable it to participate in the proton pumps for both complexes I and III as it shuttles electrons between them (see Section I.C). CoQ is also called ubiquinone (the ubiquitous quinone), because quinones with similar structures are found in all plants and animals.

## 4. Cytochromes

The remaining components in the ETC are cytochromes (see Fig. 24.5). Each cytochrome is a protein that contains a bound heme (i.e., an Fe atom bound to a porphyrin nucleus similar in structure to the heme in hemoglobin) (Fig. 24.7).

Because of differences in the protein component of the cytochromes and small differences in the heme structure, each heme has a different reduction potential. The cytochromes of the $\mathrm{b}-\mathrm{c}_{1}$ complex have a higher energy level than those of cytochrome oxidase (a and $\mathrm{a}_{3}$ ). Thus, energy is released by electron transfer between
![ma105181198a6](ma105181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.6 Structure of coenzyme Q (CoQ). CoQ contains a quinone with a long lipophilic side chain comprising 10 isoprenoid units (thus, it is sometimes called $\mathrm{CoQ}_{10}$ ). CoQ can accept one electron ( $\mathrm{e}^{-}$) to become the half-reduced form, or two $\mathrm{e}^{-}$to become fully reduced.

![ma106181198a6](ma106181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.7 Heme A. Heme A is found in cytochromes a and $a_{3}$. Cytochromes are proteins that contain a heme chelated with an iron atom. Hemes are derivatives of protoporphyrin IX. Each cytochrome has a heme with different modifications of the side chains (indicated with dashed lines), resulting in a slightly different reduction potential and, consequently, a different position in the sequence of electron transfer.

$\sigma$
The iron in the heme in hemoglobin, unlike the iron in the heme of cytochromes, never changes its oxidation state (it is $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ in hemoglobin). If the iron in hemoglobin were to become oxidized ( $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ), the oxygen-binding capacity of the molecule would be lost. What accounts for this difference in iron oxidation states between hemoglobin and cytochromes?
complexes III and IV. The iron atoms in the cytochromes are in the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ state. As they accept an electron, they are reduced to $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$. As they are reoxidized to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, the electrons pass to the next component of the ETC.

## 5. Copper and the Reduction of Oxygen

The last cytochrome complex is cytochrome oxidase, which passes electrons from cytochrome c to $\mathrm{O}^{2}$ (see Fig. 24.5). It contains cytochromes a and $\mathrm{a}_{3}$ and the oxygen-binding site. A whole oxygen molecule, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, must accept four electrons to be reduced to two $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules. Bound copper $\left(\mathrm{Cu}^{+}\right)$ions in the cytochrome oxidase complex facilitate the collection of the four electrons and the reduction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

Cytochrome oxidase has a much lower $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ than myoglobin (the hemecontaining intracellular oxygen carrier) or hemoglobin (the heme-containing oxygen transporter in the blood). Thus, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is "pulled" from the erythrocyte to myoglobin, and from myoglobin to cytochrome oxidase, where it is reduced to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

## C. Pumping of Protons

One of the tenets of the chemiosmotic theory is that energy from the oxidationreduction reactions of the ETC is used to transport protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. This proton pumping is generally facilitated by the vectorial arrangement of the membrane-spanning complexes. Their structure allows them to pick up electrons and protons on one side of the membrane and release protons on the other side of the membrane as they transfer an electron to the next component of the chain. The direct physical link between proton movement and electron transfer can be illustrated by an examination of the Q cycle for the $\mathrm{b}-\mathrm{c}_{1}$ complex (Fig. 24.8). The Q cycle involves a double cycle of CoQ reduction and oxidation. CoQ accepts two protons at the matrix side together with two electrons; it then releases protons into the intermembrane space while donating one electron back to another component of the cytochrome $\mathrm{b}-\mathrm{c}_{1}$ complex and one to cytochrome c .

The mechanism for pumping protons at the NADH:CoQ oxidoreductase complex is not well understood, but it involves a Q cycle in which the $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers and

![ma107181198a6](ma107181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.8 The proton motive $Q$ cycle for the b-c, complex. (I) From $2 \mathrm{QH}_{2}$, electrons go down two different paths: One path is through an Fe-S center protein (ISP) toward cytochrome c (red arrows). Another path is "backward" to one of the b cytochromes (dashed arrows). (2) Electrons are transferred from ISP through cytochrome c,. Cytochrome c, which is in the intermembrane space, binds to the b-c, complex to accept an electron. (3) Returning electrons go through another b cytochrome and are directed toward the matrix. (4) At the matrix side, electrons and $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$are accepted by Q. Q, coenzyme Q; $Q^{--}$, coenzyme $Q$ semiquinone; $Q H_{2}$, coenzyme $Q$ hydroquinone.

FMN might participate. However, transmembrane proton movement at cytochrome c oxidase probably involves direct transport of the proton through a series of bound water molecules or amino acid side chains in the protein complex, a mechanism that has been described as a proton wire.

The significance of the direct link between the electron transfer and proton movement is that one cannot occur without the other (the processes are said to be "coupled"). Thus, when protons are not being used for ATP synthesis, the proton gradient and the membrane potential build up. This "proton backpressure" controls the rate of proton pumping, which controls electron transport and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption.

## D. Energy Yield from the Electron-Transport Chain

The overall free-energy release from oxidation of NADH by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is approximately -53 kcal , and from $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$, it is approximately -41 kcal . This $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0}$ is so negative that the chain is never reversible; we never synthesize oxygen from $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The negative $\Delta \mathrm{G}^{0}$ also drives NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ formation from the pathways of fuel oxidation, such as the TCA cycle and glycolysis, to completion.

Overall, each NADH donates two electrons, equivalent to the reduction of onehalf of an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule. A generally (but not universally) accepted estimate of the stoichiometry of ATP synthesis is that four protons are pumped at complex I, four protons at complex III, and two at complex IV. With three protons translocated for each ATP synthesized, and one proton for each phosphate transported into the matrix (see Section IV.A of this chapter), an estimated 2.5 ATPs are formed for each NADH oxidized, and 1.5 ATPs are formed for each of the other $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$-containing flavoproteins that donate electrons to CoQ. (This calculation neglects the basal proton leak.) Thus, only approximately $30 \%$ of the energy available from NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ oxidation by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is used for ATP synthesis. Some of the remaining energy in the electrochemical potential is used for the transport of anions and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the mitochondrion. The remainder of the energy is released as heat. Consequently, the ETC is also our major source of heat.

$\Delta$
Normally, the protein structures binding the heme either protect the iron from oxidation (such as the globin proteins) or allow oxidation to occur (such as happens in the cytochromes). However, in hemoglobin $M$, a rare hemoglobin variant found in the human population, a tyrosine is substituted for the histidine at position F8 in the normal hemoglobin A. This tyrosine stabilizes the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ form of heme, and these subunits cannot bind oxygen. This is a lethal condition if it is homozygous.

$\Delta$
Cora N. has a lack of oxygen in the anterior and lateral walls of her heart caused by severe ischemia (lack of blood flow) resulting from blockage of the coronary arteries supplying blood to this area of her heart. The arteries are blocked by a clot at the site of ruptured atherosclerotic plaques. The limited availability of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to act as an electron acceptor will decrease proton pumping and generation of an electrochemical potential gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane of ischemic cells. As a consequence, the rate of ATP generation in these specific areas of her heart will decrease, thereby triggering events that lead to irreversible cell injury.

![ma108181198a6](ma108181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.9 Glycerol 3-phosphate (glycerol 3-P) shuttle. Because nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$and NADH cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane, shuttles transfer the reducing equivalents into mitochondria. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is reduced to glycerol 3-P by cytosolic glycerol 3-P dehydrogenase, using cytosolic NADH produced in glycolysis. Glycerol 3-P then reacts in the inner mitochondrial membrane with mitochondrial glycerol 3-P dehydrogenase, which transfers the electrons to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and regenerates DHAP, which returns to the cytosol. The electron-transport chain transfers the electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which generates approximately 1.5 adenosine triphosphates (ATPs) for each $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ that is oxidized.

## E. Cytoplasmic NADH

There is no transport system for cytoplasmic NADH to cross the inner mitochondrial membrane, or for mitochondrial NADH to enter the cytoplasm. However, there are two shuttle systems to transport the electrons from NADH (cytoplasmic) to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ (mitochondrial). NADH can be reoxidized to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$in the cytosol by a reaction that transfers the electrons to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) in the glycerol 3-phosphate (glycerol 3-P) shuttle or to oxaloacetate in the malate-aspartate shuttle. The $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$that is formed in the cytosol returns to glycolysis, whereas glycerol 3-P or malate carry the reducing equivalents that are ultimately transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Thus, these shuttles transfer electrons and not NADH per se.

## I. Glycerol 3-Phosphate Shuttle

The glycerol 3-P shuttle is the major shuttle in most tissues. In this shuttle, cytosolic $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$is regenerated by cytoplasmic glycerol 3-P dehydrogenase, which transfers electrons from NADH to DHAP to form glycerol 3-P (Fig. 24.9). Glycerol 3-P then diffuses through the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the electrons are donated to a membrane-bound FAD-containing glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. This enzyme, like succinate dehydrogenase, ultimately donates electrons to CoQ , resulting in an energy yield of approximately 1.5 ATPs from oxidative phosphorylation. DHAP returns to the cytosol to continue the shuttle. The sum of the reactions in this shuttle system is simply

$$
\mathrm{NADH}_{\text {cytosol }}+\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{FAD}_{\text {mitochondria }} \rightarrow \mathrm{NAD}_{+}^{\text {cytosol }}+\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})_{\text {mitochondria }}
$$

## 2. Malate-Aspartate Shuttle

Many tissues contain both the glycerol 3-P shuttle and the malate-aspartate shuttle. In the malate-aspartate shuttle (Fig. 24.10), cytosolic $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$is regenerated by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, which transfers electrons from NADH to cytosolic oxaloacetate to form malate. Malate is transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by a specific translocase, which exchanges malate for $\alpha$-ketoglutarate. In the matrix, malate is oxidized back to oxaloacetate by mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, and NADH is generated. This NADH can donate electrons to the ETC
![ma109181198a6](ma109181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.10 Malate-aspartate shuttle. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) produced by glycolysis reduces oxaloacetate (OAA) to malate, which crosses the mitochondrial membrane and is reoxidized to OAA. The mitochondrial NADH donates electrons to the electron-transport chain, with 2.5 adenosine triphosphates (ATPs) generated for each NADH.To complete the shuttle, OAA must return to the cytosol, although it cannot be transported directly on a translocase. Instead, it is transaminated to aspartate, which is then transported out to the cytosol, where it is transaminated back to OAA. The translocators exchange compounds in such a way that the shuttle is completely balanced. $T A$, transamination reaction. $\alpha-K G, \alpha$-ketoglutarate; $E T C$, electron-transport chain.

with generation of approximately 2.5 mol of ATP per mole of NADH. The newly formed oxaloacetate cannot pass back through the inner mitochondrial membrane under physiologic conditions, so aspartate is used to return the oxaloacetate carbon skeleton to the cytosol. In the matrix, transamination reactions transfer an amino group to oxaloacetate to form aspartate, which is transported out to the cytosol (using an aspartate-glutamate exchange translocase) and converted back to oxaloacetate through another transamination reaction. The sum of all the reactions of this shuttle system is simply

$$
\mathrm{NADH}_{\text {cytosol }}+\mathrm{NAD}^{+}{ }_{\text {matrix }} \rightarrow \mathrm{NAD}^{+}{ }_{\text {cytosol }}+\mathrm{NADH}_{\text {matrix }}
$$

## 3. Energy Yield of Aerobic versus Anaerobic Glycolysis

In both aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis, each mole of glucose generates 2 mol of ATP, 2 mol of NADH, and 2 mol of pyruvate. The energy yield from anaerobic glycolysis ( 1 mol of glucose to 2 mol of lactate) is only 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose, as the NADH is recycled to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$by reducing pyruvate to lactate. Neither the NADH nor the pyruvate produced is thus used for further energy generation. However, when oxygen is available and cytosolic NADH can be oxidized via a shuttle system, pyruvate can also enter the mitochondria and be completely oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ via pyruvate dehydrogenase ( PDH ) and the TCA cycle. The oxidation of pyruvate via this route generates roughly 12.5 mol of ATP per mole of pyruvate. If the cytosolic NADH is oxidized by the glycerol 3-P shuttle, approximately 1.5 mol of ATP are produced per NADH. If, instead, the NADH is oxidized by the malate-aspartate shuttle, approximately 2.5 mol are produced. Thus, the two moles of NADH produced during glycolysis can lead to 3 to 5 mol of ATP being produced, depending on which shuttle system is used to transfer the reducing equivalents. Because each mole of pyruvate produced can give rise to 12.5 mol of ATP, altogether 30 to 32 mol of ATP can be produced from 1 mol of glucose oxidized to carbon dioxide.

To produce the same amount of ATP per unit time from anaerobic glycolysis as from the complete aerobic oxidation of glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, anaerobic glycolysis must occur approximately 15 times faster and use approximately 15 times more glucose. Cells achieve this high rate of glycolysis by expressing high levels of glycolytic enzymes. In certain skeletal muscles and in most cells during hypoxic crises, high rates of glycolysis are associated with rapid degradation of internal glycogen stores to supply the required glucose 6 -phosphate.

## F. Respiratory Chain Inhibition and Sequential Transfer

In the cell, electron flow in the ETC must be sequential from NADH or a flavoprotein all the way to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to generate ATP (see Fig. 24.5). In the absence of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (anoxia), there is no ATP generated from oxidative phosphorylation because electrons back up in the chain. Even complex I cannot pump protons to generate the electrochemical gradient because every molecule of CoQ already has electrons that it cannot pass down the chain without an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to accept them at the end. The action of the respiratory chain inhibitor cyanide, which binds to cytochrome oxidase, is similar to that of anoxia: It prevents proton pumping by all three complexes. Complete inhibition of the $\mathrm{b}-\mathrm{c}_{1}$ complex prevents pumping at cytochrome oxidase because there is no donor of electrons; it prevents pumping at complex I because there is no electron acceptor. Although complete inhibition of any one complex inhibits proton pumping at all of the complexes, partial inhibition of proton pumping can occur when only a fraction of the molecules of a complex contains bound inhibitor. The partial inhibition results in a partial decrease of the maximal rate of ATP synthesis. Table 24.1 lists chemical inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation and indicates the steps within either electron transport or ATP synthesis at which they act.

0What are the energy-generating steps as pyruvate is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide to generate 12.5 molecules of ATP per pyruvate?

1Intravenous nitroprusside rapidly lowers elevated blood pressure through its direct vasodilating action. Fortunately, it was required in Cora N.'s case only for a short time. During prolonged infusions of 24 to 48 hours or more, nitroprusside slowly breaks down to produce cyanide, an inhibitor of the cytochrome $c$ oxidase complex. Because small amounts of cyanide are detoxified in the liver by conversion to thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine, the conversion of nitroprusside to cyanide can be monitored by following blood thiocyanate levels.

In the complete oxidation of pyruvate to carbon dioxide, four steps generate NADH (PDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase). One step generates $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ (succinate dehydrogenase) and one substrate-level phosphorylation (succinate thiokinase). Thus, because each NADH generates 2.5 ATPs, the overall contribution by NADH is 10 ATP molecules. The $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ generates an additional 1.5 ATPs, and the substrate-level phosphorylation provides one more. Therefore, $10+1.5+1=12.5$ molecules of ATP.

# II. OXPHOS Diseases 

Clinical diseases involving components of oxidative phosphorylation (referred to as OXPHOS diseases) are among the most commonly encountered degenerative diseases. The clinical pathology may be caused by gene mutations in either mtDNA or nuclear DNA (nDNA) that encode proteins required for normal oxidative phosphorylation.

## A. Mitochondrial DNA and OXPHOS Diseases

The mtDNA is a small double-stranded circular DNA consisting of 16,569 nucleotide pairs. It encodes 13 subunits of the complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation: 7 of the 42 subunits of complex I (NADH:CoQ oxidoreductase complex), 1 of the 11 subunits of complex III (cytochrome b- $\mathrm{c}_{1}$ complex), 3 of 13 of the subunits of complex IV (cytochrome oxidase), and 2 subunits of the $\mathrm{F}_{0}$ portion ATP-synthase complex. In addition, mtDNA encodes the necessary components for translation of its messenger RNA (mRNA): a large and small ribosomal (rRNA) and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Mutations in mtDNA have been identified as deletions, duplications, or point mutations. Disorders associated with these mutations are outlined in Table 24.2.

Cyanide binds to the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ in the heme of the cytochrome $\mathrm{a}_{5}$ component of cytochrome c oxidase and prevents electron transport to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Mitochondrial respiration and energy production cease, and cell death occurs rapidly. The central nervous system is the primary target for cyanide toxicity. Acute inhalation of high concentrations of cyanide (e.g., smoke inhalation during a fire) provokes a brief central nervous system stimulation followed rapidly by convulsion, coma, and death. Acute exposure to lower amounts can cause light-headedness, breathlessness, dizziness, numbness, and headaches.

Cyanide is present in the air as hydrogen cyanide (HCN), in soil and water as cyanide salts (e.g., NaCN ), and in foods as cyanoglycosides. Most of the cyanide in the air usually comes from automobile exhaust. Examples of populations with potentially high exposures include active and passive smokers, people who are exposed to house or other building fires, residents who live near cyanide- or thiocyanate-containing hazardous waste sites, and workers involved in several manufacturing processes (e.g., photography, pesticide application).

Cyanoglycosides such as amygdalin are present in edible plants such as almonds, pits from stone fruits (e.g., apricots, peaches, plums, cherries), sorghum, cassava, soybeans, spinach, lima beans, sweet potatoes, maize, millet, sugar cane, and bamboo shoots.

HCN is released from cyanoglycosides by $\beta$-glucosidases present in the plant or in intestinal bacteria. Small amounts are inactivated in the liver principally by rhodanase, which converts it to thiocyanate.

In the United States, toxic amounts of cyanoglycosides have been ingested as ground apricot pits, either as a result of their promotion as a health food or as a treatment for cancer. The drug Laetrile (amygdalin) was used as a cancer therapeutic agent, although it was banned in the United States because it was ineffective and potentially toxic. Commercial fruit juices made from unpitted fruit could provide toxic amounts of cyanide, particularly in infants or children. In countries in which cassava is a dietary staple, improper processing results in retention of its high cyanide content at potentially toxic levels.

The genetics of mutations in mtDNA are defined by maternal inheritance, replicative segregation, threshold expression, a high mtDNA mutation rate, and the accumulation of somatic mutations with age. The maternal inheritance pattern reflects the exclusive transmission of mtDNA from the mother to her children. The egg contains approximately 300,000 molecules of mtDNA packaged into mitochondria. These are retained during fertilization, whereas those of the sperm do not enter the egg or are lost. Usually, some mitochondria are present that have the mutant mtDNA and some have normal (wild-type) DNA. As cells divide during mitosis and meiosis, mitochondria replicate by fission, but various amounts of mitochondria with mutant and wild-type DNA are distributed to each daughter cell (replicative segregation). Thus, any cell can have a mixture of mitochondria, each with mutant or wild-type mtDNAs (termed heteroplasmy). The mitotic and meiotic segregation of the heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation results in variable oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies between patients with the same mutation, and even among a patient's own tissues.

Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is responsible for producing most of the ATP that our cells require. The genes responsible for the polypeptides that comprise the OXPHOS complexes within the mitochondria are located within either the nDNA or the mtDNA. A broad spectrum of human disorders (the OXPHOS diseases) may result from genetic mutations or nongenetic alterations (spontaneous mutations) in either the nDNA or the mtDNA. Increasingly, such changes appear to be responsible for at least some aspects of common disorders, such as Parkinson disease, dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer disease, depressive disorders, and a host of less well-known clinical entities.

Decreased activity of the electrontransport chain can result from inhibitors as well as from mutations in mtDNA and nuclear DNA. Why does an impairment of the ETC result in lactic acidosis?

A patient experienced spontaneous muscle jerking (myoclonus) in her mid-teens, and her condition progressed over 10 years to include debilitating myoclonus, neurosensory hearing loss, dementia, hypoventilation, and mild cardiomyopathy. Energy metabolism was affected in the central nervous system, heart, and skeletal muscle, resulting in lactic acidosis. A history indicated that the patient's mother, her grandmother, and two maternal aunts had symptoms involving either nervous or muscular tissue (clearly a case of maternal inheritance). However, no other relative had identical symptoms. The symptoms and history of the patient are those of myoclonic epileptic ragged red fiber disease (MERRF). The affected tissues (central nervous system and muscle) are two of the tissues with the highest ATP requirements. Most cases of MERRF are caused by a point mutation in mitochondrial tRNA^{Lys} (mtRNA ${ }^{\text {Lys}}$ ). The mitochondria, obtained by muscle biopsy, are enlarged and show abnormal patterns of cristae. The muscle tissue also shows ragged red fibers.

The disease pathology usually becomes worse with age because a small amount of normal mitochondria might confer normal function and exercise capacity while the patient is young. As the patient ages, somatic (spontaneous) mutations in mtDNA accumulate from the generation of free radicals within the mitochondria (see Chapter 25). These mutations frequently become permanent partly because mtDNA does not have access to the same repair mechanisms available for nDNA (high mutation rate). Even in normal individuals, somatic mutations result in a decline of oxidative phosphorylation capacity with age (accumulation of somatic mutations with age). At some stage, the ATP-generating capacity of a tissue falls below the tissue-specific threshold for normal function (threshold expression). In general, symptoms of these defects appear in one or more of the tissues with the highest ATP demands: nervous tissue, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney.

## B. Other Genetic Disorders of Oxidative Phosphorylation

Genetic mutations also have been reported for mitochondrial proteins that are encoded by nuclear DNA. Most of the estimated 1,000 proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation are encoded by nuclear DNA, whereas mtDNA encodes only 13 subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes (including ATP synthase). Nuclear DNA encodes the additional 70 or more subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes as well as the ANT and other anion translocators. Coordinate regulation of expression of nuclear and mtDNA, import of proteins into the mitochondria, assembly of the complexes, and regulation of mitochondrial fission are nuclear-encoded. The nuclear respiratory factors (NRF-1 and NRF-2) are nuclear transcription factors that bind to and activate promotor regions of the nuclear genes that encode subunits of the respiratory chain complexes, including cytochrome c. They also activate the transcription of the nuclear gene for the mitochondrial transcription factor (mTF)-A. The protein product of this gene translocates into the mitochondrial matrix, where it stimulates transcription and replication of the mitochondrial genome.

Nuclear DNA mutations differ from mtDNA mutations in several important respects. These mutations do not show a pattern of maternal inheritance but are usually autosomal recessive. The mutations are uniformly distributed to daughter cells and, therefore, are expressed in all tissues containing the allele for a particular tissue-specific isoform. However, phenotypic expression will still be most apparent in tissues with high ATP requirements.

## C. Lactic Acidosis

Lactic acidosis generally results from a greatly increased NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio in tissues (Fig. 24.11). The increased NADH concentration prevents pyruvate oxidation in the TCA cycle and directs pyruvate to lactate. To compensate for the decreased ATP production from oxidative metabolism, phosphofructokinase-1, and, therefore, the entire glycolytic pathway, is activated. For example, consumption of large amounts of alcohol, which is rapidly oxidized in the liver and increases NADH levels, can result in lactic acidosis. Hypoxia in any tissue increases lactate production as cells attempt to compensate for a lack of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ for oxidative phosphorylation.

Several other problems that interfere with either the ETC or pyruvate oxidation in the TCA cycle result in lactic acidemia (see Fig. 24.11). For example, OXPHOS diseases (inherited deficiencies in subunits of complexes in the ETC, such as myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers [MERRF]) increase the NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio and inhibit PDH (see Chapter 23). Pyruvate accumulates and is converted to lactate to allow glycolytic ATP production to proceed. Similarly, impaired PDH activity from an inherited deficiency of $\mathrm{E}_{1}$ (the decarboxylase subunit of the complex), or

from severe thiamin deficiency, increases blood lactate levels (see Chapter 23). Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency also can result in lactic acidosis (see Chapter 23) also because of an accumulation of pyruvate.

Lactic acidosis can also result from inhibition of lactate use in gluconeogenesis (e.g., hereditary fructose intolerance, which is caused by a defective aldolase gene). If other pathways that use glucose 6-phosphate are blocked, glucose 6-phosphate can be shunted into glycolysis and lactate production (e.g., glucose 6-phosphate deficiency).

## III. Coupling of Electron Transport and Adenosine Triphosphate Synthesis

The electrochemical gradient couples the rate of the ETC to the rate of ATP synthesis. Because electron flow requires proton pumping, electron flow cannot occur faster than protons are used for ATP synthesis (coupled oxidative phosphorylation) or returned to the matrix by a mechanism that short-circuits the ATP synthase pore (uncoupling).

$\Delta$The effect of inhibition of electron transport is an impaired oxidation of pyruvate, fatty acids, and other fuels. In many cases, the inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport results in higher-than-normal levels of lactate and pyruvate in the blood and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio. NADH oxidation requires the complete transfer of electrons from NADH to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, and a defect anywhere along the chain will result in the accumulation of NADH and a decrease in $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. The increase in NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$inhibits PDH and causes the accumulation of pyruvate. It also increases the conversion of pyruvate to lactate (anaerobic glycolysis), and elevated levels of lactate appear in the blood.A large number of genetic defects of the proteins in respiratory chain complexes have, therefore, been classified together as congenital lactic acidosis.

How does shivering generate heat?
![ma112181198a6](ma112181198a6.jpg)

Historically, a skeletal muscle biopsy performed on patients treated with zidovudine and myopathy would show proliferation of subsarcolemmal mitochondria with degeneration of muscle fibers (ragged red fibers). An analysis of mtDNA would show a quantitative depletion of mtDNA.

Isabel S. was being treated for HIV with a multidrug regimen including a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor. One of the first drugs of this class was zidovudine (azidothymidine, AZT), which also can act as an inhibitor of the mtDNA polymerase (polymerase $\gamma$ ). A review of the drug's potential adverse effects showed that rarely it may cause varying degrees of mtDNA depletion in different tissues, including skeletal muscle. The depletion may cause a severe mitochondrial myopathy, including ragged red fiber accumulation within the skeletal muscle cells associated with ultrastructural abnormalities in their mitochondria. This can occur with all drugs in this class, but it is much less common with the newer ones.

## A. Regulation through Coupling

As ATP chemical bond energy is used by energy-requiring reactions, ADP and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ concentrations increase. The more ADP present to bind to the ATP synthase, the greater will be proton flow through the ATP synthase pore from the intermembrane space to the matrix. Thus, as ADP levels rise, proton influx increases, and the electrochemical gradient decreases (Fig. 24.12). The proton pumps of the ETC respond with increased proton pumping and electron flow to maintain the electrochemical gradient. The result is increased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption. The increased oxidation of NADH in the ETC and the increased concentration of ADP stimulate the pathways of fuel oxidation, such as the TCA cycle, to supply more NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ to the ETC. For example, during exercise, we use more ATP for muscle contraction, consume more oxygen, oxidize more fuel (which means burn more calories), and generate more heat from the ETC. If we rest, the rate of ATP use decreases, proton influx decreases, the electrochemical gradient increases, and proton backpressure decreases the rate of the ETC. NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ cannot be oxidized as rapidly in the ETC, and consequently, their buildup inhibits the enzymes that generate them.

The system is poised to maintain very high levels of ATP at all times. In most tissues, the rate of ATP use is nearly constant over time. However, in skeletal muscles, the rates of ATP hydrolysis change dramatically as the muscle goes from rest to rapid contraction. Even under these circumstances, ATP concentration decreases by only approximately $20 \%$ because it is so rapidly regenerated. In the heart, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activation of TCA cycle enzymes provides an extra push to NADH generation so that neither ATP nor NADH levels fall as ATP demand is increased. The ETC has a very high capacity and can respond very rapidly to any increase in ATP use.

## B. Uncoupling Adenosine Triphosphate Synthesis from Electron Transport

When protons leak back into the matrix without going through the ATP synthase pore, they dissipate the electrochemical gradient across the membrane without generating ATP. This phenomenon is called uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. It occurs with chemical compounds, known as uncouplers, and it occurs physiologically with uncoupling proteins (UCPs) that form proton conductance channels through the membrane. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation results in increased oxygen consumption and heat production as electron flow and proton pumping attempt to maintain the electrochemical gradient.

## I. Chemical Uncouplers of Oxidative Phosphorylation

Chemical uncouplers, also known as proton ionophores, are lipid-soluble compounds that rapidly transport protons from the cytosolic to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 24.13). Because the proton concentration is higher in the intermembrane space than in the matrix, uncouplers pick up protons from the intermembrane space. Their lipid solubility enables them to diffuse through the inner mitochondrial membrane while carrying protons and release these protons on the matrix side. The rapid influx of protons dissipates the electrochemical potential gradient; therefore, the mitochondria are unable to synthesize ATP. Eventually, mitochondrial integrity and function are lost.

## 2. Uncoupling Proteins and Thermogenesis

UCPs form channels through the inner mitochondrial membrane that are able to conduct protons from the intermembrane space to the matrix, thereby short-circuiting ATP synthase.

UCP1 (thermogenin) is associated with heat production in brown adipose tissue. The major function of brown adipose tissue is nonshivering thermogenesis, whereas the major function of white adipose tissue is the storage of triacylglycerols

![ma113181198a6](ma113181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.13 Action of uncouplers. Dinitrophenol (DNP) is lipid-soluble and can therefore diffuse across the membrane. It has a dissociable proton with a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ near 7.2. Thus, in the intermembrane space where $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is high ( pH low), DNP picks up a proton, which it carries across the membrane. At the lower proton concentration of the matrix, the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ dissociates. As a consequence, cells cannot maintain their electrochemical gradient or synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP). DNP was once recommended in the United States as a weight-loss drug, based on the principle that decreased [ATP] and increased electron transport stimulate fuel oxidation. However, several deaths resulted from its use.
in lipid droplets. The brown color arises from the large number of mitochondria that participate. Human infants, who have little voluntary control over their environment and may kick their blankets off at night, have brown fat deposits along the neck, the breastplate, between the scapulae, and around the kidneys to protect them from cold. However, there is very little brown fat in most adults.

In response to cold, sympathetic nerve endings release norepinephrine, which activates a lipase in brown adipose tissue that releases fatty acids from triacylglycerols (Fig. 24.14). Fatty acids serve as a fuel for the tissue (i.e., are oxidized to generate the electrochemical potential gradient and ATP) and participate directly in the proton conductance channel by activating UCP1 along with reduced CoQ . When UCP1 is activated by fatty acids, it transports protons from the cytosolic side of the inner mitochondrial membrane back into the mitochondrial matrix without
![ma114181198a6](ma114181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.14 Brown fat is a tissue specialized for nonshivering thermogenesis. Cold or excessive food intake stimulates the release of norepinephrine from the sympathetic nerve endings. As a result, a lipase is activated that releases fatty acids for oxidation. The proton conductance protein thermogenin is activated, and protons are brought into the matrix. This stimulates the electron-transport chain, which increases its rate of NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ oxidation and produces more heat.

Shivering results from muscle contraction, which increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. As a consequence of proton entry for ATP synthesis, the ETC is stimulated. Oxygen consumption increases, as does the amount of energy lost as heat by the electron-transport chain.

Salicylate, which is a degradation product of aspirin in humans, is lipid-soluble and has a dissociable proton. In high concentrations, as in salicylate poisoning, salicylate is able to partially uncouple mitochondria. The decline of ATP concentration in the cell and consequent increase of AMP in the cytosol stimulates glycolysis. The overstimulation of the glycolytic pathway (see Chapter 22) results in increased levels of lactic acid in the blood and a metabolic acidosis. Fortunately, Dennis V. did not develop this consequence of aspirin poisoning (see Chapter 4).

ATP generation. Thus, it partially uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and generates additional heat.

The UCPs exist as a family of proteins: UCP1 (thermogenin) is expressed in brown adipose tissue; $U C P 2$ is found in most cells; $U C P 3$ is found principally in skeletal muscle; and $U C P 4$ and $U C P 5$ are found in the nervous system. These are highly regulated proteins that, when activated, increase the amount of energy from fuel oxidation that is being released as heat. However, recent data indicate that this may not be the primary role of UCP2 and UCP3. It has been hypothesized that UCP3 acts as a transport protein to remove fatty acid anions and lipid peroxides from the mitochondria, thereby reducing the risk of forming oxygen free radicals (see Chapter 25) and thus decreasing the occurrence of mitochondrial and cell injury.

## 3. Proton Leak and Resting Metabolic Rate

A low level of proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane occurs in our mitochondria all the time, and our mitochondria thus are normally partially uncoupled. It has been estimated that $>20 \%$ of our resting metabolic rate is the energy expended to maintain the electrochemical gradient dissipated by our basal proton leak (also referred to as global proton leak). Some of the proton leak results from permeability of the membrane associated with proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer. An unknown amount may result from UCPs.

## IV. Transport through Inner and Outer Mitochondrial Membranes

Most of the newly synthesized ATP that is released into the mitochondrial matrix must be transported out of the mitochondria, where it is used for energy-requiring processes such as active ion transport, muscle contraction, or biosynthetic reactions. Likewise, ADP, phosphate, pyruvate, and other metabolites must be transported into the matrix. This requires transport of compounds through both the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes.

## A. Transport through the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane

The inner mitochondrial membrane forms a tight permeability barrier to all polar molecules, including ATP, ADP, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$, anions such as pyruvate, and cations such as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{H}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Yet the process of oxidative phosphorylation depends on rapid and continuous transport of many of these molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 24.15). Ions and other polar molecules are transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by specific protein translocases that nearly balance charge during the transport process. Most of the exchange transport is a form of active transport that generally uses energy from the electrochemical potential gradient, either the membrane potential or the proton gradient.

ATP-ADP translocase (also called $A N T$, for adenine nucleotide translocase) transports ATP formed in the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space in a specific 1:1 exchange for ADP produced from energy-requiring reactions outside of the mitochondria (see Fig. 24.15). Because ATP contains four negative charges and ADP contains only three, the exchange is promoted by the electrochemical potential gradient because the net effect is the transport of one negative charge from the matrix to the cytosol. Similar antiports exist for most metabolic anions. In contrast, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ and pyruvate are transported into the mitochondrial matrix on specific transporters called symports together with a proton. A specific transport protein for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ uptake, called the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ uniporter, is driven by the electrochemical potential gradient, which is negatively charged on the matrix side of the membrane relative to the cytosolic side. Other transporters include the dicarboxylate transporter (phos-phate-malate exchange), the tricarboxylate transporter (citrate-malate exchange),

![ma115181198a6](ma115181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.15 Transport of compounds across the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. The electrochemical potential gradient drives the transport of ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane on specific translocases. Each translocase is composed of specific membranespanning helices that bind only specific compounds (adenine nucleotide translocase [ANT]). In contrast, the outer membrane contains relatively large unspecific pores called voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) through which a wide range of ions diffuse. These bind cytosolic proteins such as hexokinase (HK), which enables HK to have access to newly exported adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ADP, adenosine diphosphate; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.
the aspartate-glutamate transporter, and the malate- $\alpha$-ketoglutarate transporter (the last two as seen previously in the malate-aspartate shuttle for transferring reducing equivalents across the inner mitochondrial membrane).

# B. Transport through the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 

Whereas the inner mitochondrial membrane is highly impermeable, the outer mitochondrial membrane is permeable to compounds with a molecular weight up to approximately 6,000 Da because it contains large nonspecific pores called $V D A C s$ that are formed by mitochondrial porins (see Fig. 24.15). Unlike most transport proteins, which are membrane-spanning helices with specific binding sites, VDACs are composed of porin homodimers that form a $\beta$-barrel with a relatively large nonspecific water-filled pore through the center. These channels are "open" at low transmembrane potential, with a preference for anions such as phosphate, chloride, pyruvate, citrate, and adenine nucleotides. VDACs thus facilitate translocation of these anions between the intermembrane space and the cytosol. Several cytosolic kinases, such as the hexokinase that initiates glycolysis, bind to the cytosolic side of the channel, where they have ready access to newly synthesized ATP.

## C. The Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore

The mitochondrial permeability transition involves the opening of a large nonspecific pore (called the mitochondrial permeability transition pore [MPTP]) through the inner mitochondrial membrane and outer membranes at sites where they form a

![ma116181198a6](ma116181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 24.16 The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). In the MPTP, adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is thought to complex with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). The conformation of ANT is regulated by cyclophilin D (CD), and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The change to an open pore is activated by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, depletion of adenine nucleotides, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that alter SH groups. It is inhibited by the electrochemical potential gradient ( $\Delta p$ ), by cytosolic ATP, and by a low cytosolic pH . VDACs bind several proteins, including $\mathrm{BCl}-2$ and Bax, which regulate apoptosis. Binding of proapoptotic members of the $\mathrm{BCl}-2$ family to VDAC may change the permeability of the outer membrane so as to either favor, or block, events leading to apoptosis (such as cytochrome c release; see "Biochemical Comments" and Chapter 18).
junction (Fig. 24.16). In one model of the MPTP the basic components of the pore are ANT, the VDAC, and cyclophilin D (CD; which is a cis-trans isomerase for the proline peptide bond). Normally, ANT is a closed pore that functions specifically in a 1:1 exchange of matrix ATP for ADP in the intermembrane space. However, increased mitochondrial matrix $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, excess phosphate, or reactive oxygen species (ROS), which form oxygen or oxygen-nitrogen radicals, can activate opening of the pore. Conversely, ATP on the cytosolic side of the pore (and possibly a $\mathrm{pH}<7.0$ ) and a membrane potential across the inner membrane protect against pore opening. Opening of the MPTP can be triggered by ischemia (hypoxia), which results in a temporary lack of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ for maintaining the proton gradient and ATP synthesis. When the proton gradient is not being generated by the ETC, ATP synthase runs backward and hydrolyzes ATP in an attempt to restore the gradient, thus rapidly depleting cellular levels of ATP. As ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP, the ADP is converted to adenine, and the nucleotide pool is no longer able to protect against pore opening. This can lead to a downward spiral of cellular events. A lack of ATP for maintaining the low mitochondrial $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can contribute to pore opening. When the MPTP opens, protons flood in, and maintaining a proton gradient becomes impossible. Anions and cations enter the matrix, mitochondrial swelling ensues, and the mitochondria become irreversibly damaged. The result is cell lysis and death (necrosis).

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

4Cora N. Thrombolysis stimulated by intravenous recombinant TPA restored $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to Cora N.'s heart muscle and successfully decreased the extent of ischemic damage. The rationale for the use of TPA within 4 to 6 hours after the onset of a myocardial infarction relates to the function of the normal intrinsic fibrinolytic system (see Chapter 43). This system is designed to dissolve unwanted intravascular clots through the action of the enzyme plasmin, a protease that digests the fibrin matrix within the clot. TPA stimulates the conversion of plasminogen to its active form, plasmin. The result is a lysis of the thrombus and improved blood flow through the previously obstructed vessel, allowing fuels and oxygen to

reach the heart cells. The human TPA protein administered to Mrs. N. is produced by recombinant DNA technology (see Chapter 17). This treatment rapidly restored oxygen supply to her heart.

Stanley T. Mr. T. could be treated with antithyroid drugs, by subtotal resection of the thyroid gland, or with radioactive iodine. Successful treatment normalizes thyroid hormone secretion, and all of the signs, symptoms, and metabolic alterations of hyperthyroidism quickly subside.

Isabel S. In the case of Isabel S., there was a concern for a myopathic process superimposed on her HIV and her pulmonary tuberculosis, either of which could have caused progressive weakness. In addition, she could have been suffering from a congenital mtDNA myopathy, symptomatic only as she ages. If she was being treated with zidovudine (AZT), an older drug not used very commonly anymore, her myopathy could have been caused by a disorder of oxidative phosphorylation induced by AZT. The lamivudine she was taking has rarely caused this myopathy. A systematic diagnostic process finally led her physician to conclude that she had HIV-associated myopathy.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

Mitochondria and Apoptosis. The loss of mitochondrial integrity is a major route initiating apoptosis (see Chapter 18, Section V). The intermembrane space contains procaspases 2,3 , and 9 , which are proteolytic enzymes that are in the zymogen form (i.e., they must be proteolytically cleaved to be active). It also contains apoptosis-initiating factor (AIF) and caspase-activated DNase (CAD). AIF has a nuclear targeting sequence and is transported into the nucleus under appropriate conditions. Once AIF is inside the nucleus, it initiates chromatin condensation and degradation. Cytochrome c, which is loosely bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane, may also enter the intermembrane space when the electrochemical potential gradient is lost. The release of cytochrome c and the other proteins into the cytosol initiates apoptosis (see Chapter 18).

What is the trigger for the release of cytochrome c and the other proteins from the mitochondria? The VDAC pore is not large enough to allow the passage of proteins. Several theories have been proposed, each supported and contradicted by experimental evidence. One is that Bax (a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that forms an ion channel in the outer mitochondrial membrane) allows the entry of ions into the intermembrane space, causing swelling of this space and rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Another theory is that Bax and VDAC (which is known to bind Bax and other Bcl-2 family members) combine to form an extremely large pore, much larger than is formed by either alone. Finally, it is possible that the MPTP or ANT participate in rupture of the outer membrane but that they close in a way that still provides the energy for apoptosis.

## KEY CONCEPTS

- The reduced cofactors generated during fuel oxidation donate their electrons to the mitochondrial electron-transport chain.
- The electron-transport chain transfers the electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which is reduced to water.
- As electrons travel through the electron-transport chain, protons are transferred from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosolic side of the inner mitochondrial membrane.
- The asymmetric distribution of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane generates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane.
- The electrochemical gradient consists of a change in $\mathrm{pH}(\Delta \mathrm{pH})$ across the membrane and a difference in charge $(\Delta \Psi)$ across the membrane.

As infusion of TPA lysed the clot blocking blood flow to Cora N.'s heart, oxygenated blood was reintroduced into the ischemic heart. Although oxygen may rapidly restore the capacity to generate ATP, it often increases cell death, a phenomenon called ischemia-reperfusion injury.

During ischemia, several factors may protect heart cells against irreversible injury and cell death until oxygen is reintroduced. The stimulation of anaerobic glycolysis in the cytosol generates ATP without oxygen as glucose is converted to lactic acid. Lactic acid decreases cytosolic pH . Both cytosolic ATP and a lowering of the pH protect against opening of the MPTP. In addition, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ uptake by mitochondria requires a membrane potential, and it is matrix $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that activates opening of the MPTP. Thus, depending on the severity of the ischemic insult, the MPTP may not open, or may open and reseal, until oxygen is reintroduced. Then, depending on the sequence of events, reestablishment of the proton gradient, mitochondrial uptake of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, or an increase of $\mathrm{pH}>7.0$ may activate the MPTP before the cell has recovered. In addition, the reintroduction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ generates oxygen free radicals, particularly through free-radical forms of CoQ in the ETC. These also may open the MPTP. The role of free radicals in ischemia-reperfusion injury is discussed in more detail in Chapter 25.

In addition to increased transcription of genes that encode TCA cycle enzymes and certain other enzymes of fuel oxidation, thyroid hormones increase the level of the uncoupling proteins UCP2 and UCP3. In hyperthyroidism, the efficiency with which energy is derived from the oxidation of these fuels is significantly less than normal. As a consequence of the increased rate of the ETC, hyperthyroidism results in increased heat production. Patients with hyperthyroidism, such as Stanley T. complain of constantly feeling hot and sweaty.

- Proton entry into the mitochondrial matrix is energetically favorable and drives the synthesis of ATP via the ATP synthase.
- Respiration (oxygen consumption) is normally coupled to ATP synthesis; if one process is inhibited, the other is also inhibited.
- Uncouplers allow respiration to continue in the absence of ATP synthesis, as the energy inherent in the proton gradient is released as heat.
- OXPHOS diseases are caused by mutations in either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA that lead to a decrease in mitochondrial capacity for synthesizing ATP via oxidative phosphorylation.
- As the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to virtually all biochemical compounds, transport systems exist to allow entry and exit of appropriate metabolites.
- The transfer of cytoplasmic reducing equivalents into the mitochondria occurs via shuttle systems; either the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle or the malateaspartate shuttle.
- Under appropriate stress, mitochondria will generate a nonspecific channel across both the inner and outer membranes that is known as the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. The opening of the pore is associated with events that lead to necrotic cell death.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 24.3.


# TABLE 24.3 Diseases Discussed in Chapter 24 

| DISEASE OR DISORDER | ENVIRONMENTAL OR GENETIC | COMMENTS |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Myocardial infarction | Both | The lack of oxygen in the anterior and lateral walls of the heart is caused by severe ischemia owing to clots formed within certain coronary arteries at the site of ruptured atherosclerotic plaques. The limited availability of oxygen to act as an electron acceptor decreases the proton motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane of ischemic cells. This leads to reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation, triggering events that lead to irreversible cell injury. |
| Hyperthyroidism | Both | Graves disease is an autoimmune genetic disorder caused by the generation of human thyroidstimulating immunoglobulins. These immunoglobulins stimulate growth of the thyroid gland and excess secretion of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{3}\right)$ and tetraiodothyronine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{4}\right)$. |
| HIV treatment complication | Environmental | One of the first drugs used to treat HIV was zidovudine (ZDV), formerly called azidothymidine (AZT) a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor. This class of drugs can act as an inhibitor of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. Under rare conditions, it can lead to a depletion of mitochondrial DNA in cells, leading to a severe mitochondrial myopathy. |
| Iron-deficiency anemia | Environmental | Lack of iron for heme synthesis, leading to reduced oxygen delivery to cells, and reduced iron in the electron-transfer chain, leading to muscle weakness. |
| Cyanide poisoning | Environmental | Cyanide binds to the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ in the heme of cytochrome $\mathrm{a}_{5}$, a component of cytochrome oxidase. Mitochondrial respiration and energy production cease, and cell death occurs rapidly. |
| Mitochondrial disorders | Genetic | Many types of mutations, leading to altered mitochondrial function and reduced energy production, caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. See Table 24.2 for a full listing of these disorders. |

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is B. For a component to be in the oxidized state, it must have donated, or never received, electrons. Complex II will metabolize succinate to produce fumarate (generating FAD[2H]), but no succinate is available in this experiment. Thus, complex II never sees any electrons and is always in an oxidized state. The substrate malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate, generating NADH, which donates electrons to complex I of the ETC. These electrons are transferred to CoQ, which donates electrons to complex III, to cytochrome c, and then to complex IV. Cyanide will block the transfer of electrons from complex IV to oxygen, so all previous complexes containing electrons will be backed up and the electrons will be "stuck" in the complexes, making these components reduced. Thus, answers A and C through E must be incorrect.
2. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. The proton motive force consists of two components, a $\Delta \mathrm{pH}$, and a $\Delta \psi$ (electrical component). The addition of valinomycin and potassium will destroy the electrical component but not the pH component. Thus, the proton motive force will decrease but will still be greater than zero. Thus, the other answers are all incorrect.
3. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. Dinitrophenol equilibrates the proton concentration across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby destroying the proton motive force. Thus, none of the other answers is correct.
4. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. A deficiency of $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers in the ETC would impair the transfer of electrons down the chain and reduce ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation. Answer B is incorrect because the decreased production of water from the ETC is not of sufficient magnitude to cause her to become dehydrated. Answer C is incorrect because iron does not form a chelate with NADH and FAD(2H). Answer D is incorrect because iron is not a cofactor for $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Answer E is incorrect because iron does not accompany the protons that make up the proton gradient.
5. The answer is B. NADH would not be reoxidized as efficiently by the ETC, and the NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio would increase. Answer A is incorrect because ATP would not be produced at a high rate. Therefore, ADP would build up and the ATP:ADP ratio would be low. Answer C is incorrect because OXPHOS diseases can be caused by mutations in nuclear or mtDNA, and not all OXPHOS proteins are encoded by the X chromosome. Answer D is incorrect because, depending on the nature of the mutation, the activity of complex II of the ETC might be normal or decreased, but there is no reason to expect increased activity. Answer E is incorrect because the integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane would not necessarily be affected. It could be, but it would not be expected for all patients with OXPHOS disorders.
6. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Heme is required for the synthesis of cytochromes. Complex I, although containing iron, does so in iron-sulfur centers and contains no cytochromes. Complexes III and IV contain cytochromes, whereas myoglobin and hemoglobin contain heme as the oxygen binding component of those proteins. Defects in heme synthesis, then, would have a negative impact on the function of complexes III and IV, as well as hemoglobin and myoglobin, without greatly affecting the functioning of complex I.
7. The answer is B. Because rotenone inhibits the oxidation of NADH, it would completely block the generation of the electrochemical potential gradient in vivo and, therefore, it would block ATP generation. In the presence of rotenone, NADH would accumulate and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ concentrations would decrease. Although the mitochondria might still be able to oxidize compounds like succinate, which transfer electrons to FAD, no succinate would be produced in vivo if the $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$-dependent dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle were inhibited. Thus, very shortly after rotenone administration, there would not be any substrates available for the electron transfer chain, and NADH dehydrogenase would be blocked, so

oxidative phosphorylation would be completely inhibited. If glucose supplies were high, anaerobic glycolysis could provide some ATP, but not nearly enough to keep the heart pumping. Anaerobic glycolysis produces 2 ATP per glucose molecule, compared with 32 ATP molecules generated by oxidative phosphorylation, which is a reduction of approximately $95 \%$.
8. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and FAD are electron acceptors and NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ are electron donors. Oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor and is not an electron donor. The inner mitochondrial membrane must be impermeable to most compounds, including protons; otherwise, the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis could not be created or maintained. The enzyme ATP synthase contains a proton pore that spans the inner mitochondrial membrane and a catalytic headpiece that protrudes into the matrix. Protons are driven through the pore and change the conformation of the subunits in the headpiece, thereby producing ATP. If protons enter the mitochondria other ways then through the pore, no ATP is generated by the ATP synthase (partial uncoupling). A synthetase is an enzyme that uses high-energy phosphate bonds (usually from ATP) to catalyze its reaction, and the ATP synthase creates high-energy phosphate bonds and does not use them.
9. The answer is D. Complexes I, III, and IV are protein complexes that span the inner mitochondrial membrane, and their location within the membrane would not be disrupted by a high-salt solution. Cytochrome c is a small protein in the intermembrane space that binds to the inner mitochondrial membrane through noncovalent
interactions. High salt can dislodge cytochrome c from the inner membrane, and the mitochondria would become cytochrome c-deficient. Electron flow would stop in the absence of cytochrome c owing to an inability to transfer electrons from complexes III to complex IV. CoQ is a lipid-soluble quinone that diffuses in the lipid membrane, and it would not be removed from the membrane by a high-salt solution.
10. The answer is C. Uncouplers uncouple oxidation from phosphorylation such that oxygen consumption is increased, there is an increased flow of electrons through the electron-transfer chain, but ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation is diminished. ATP production is reduced owing to the reduction in the size of the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane because the UCPs allow protons to enter the matrix of the mitochondria without going through the ATP synthase. Because the energy of electron transfer is no longer being used to generate a proton gradient, it is released as heat, and an individual taking such a drug would be expected to exhibit an increased body temperature. Owing to the uncoupling, the oxidation of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) would increase, as would the glycolytic rate, in attempts to generate ATP for the cell. The ATP synthase would be producing less ATP, and glycolysis would be producing more ATP. The weight loss would come about because of the inefficiency in ATP generation via acetyl-CoA oxidation, as more fatty acids would have to be metabolized in order to generate a certain amount of ATP from the acetyl-CoA derived from the fatty acids.

FIGURE 25.1 $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is a biradical. It has two antibonding electrons with parallel spins, (parallel arrows). It has a tendency to form toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\right)$, the nonradical hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, and the hydroxyl radical $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{\bullet}\right)$.

## Oxygen Toxicity and Free-Radical Injury

$\mathbf{O}_{2}$ is both essential to human life and toxic. We are dependent on $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ for oxidation reactions in the pathways of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation, detoxification, and biosynthesis. However, when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ accepts single electrons, it is transformed into highly reactive oxygen radicals that damage cellular lipids, proteins, and DNA. Damage by reactive oxygen radicals contributes to cellular death and degeneration in a wide range of diseases (Table 25.1).

Radicals are compounds that contain a single electron, usually in an outside orbital. Oxygen is a biradical, a molecule that has two unpaired electrons in separate orbitals (Fig. 25.1). Through several enzymatic and nonenzymatic processes that routinely occur in cells, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ accepts single electrons to form reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are highly reactive oxygen radicals or compounds that are readily converted in cells to these reactive radicals. The ROS formed by reduction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ are the radical superoxide $\left(\mathbf{O}_{2}^{-}\right)$, the nonradical hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathbf{H}_{2} \mathbf{O}_{2}\right)$, and the hydroxyl radical $\left(\mathbf{O H}^{\bullet}\right)$.

ROS may be generated nonenzymatically or enzymatically as accidental byproducts or major products of reactions. Superoxide may be generated nonenzymatically from coenzyme $Q$ (CoQ) or from metal-containing enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450, xanthine oxidase, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH] oxidase). The highly toxic hydroxyl radical is formed nonenzymatically from superoxide in the presence of $\mathbf{F e}^{2+}$ or $\mathbf{C u}^{+}$by the Fenton reaction and from hydrogen peroxide in the Haber-Weiss reaction.

Oxygen radicals and their derivatives can be deadly to cells. The hydroxyl radical causes oxidative damage to proteins and DNA. It also forms lipid peroxides and malondialdehyde from membrane lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. In some cases, free-radical damage is the direct cause of a disease state (e.g., tissue damage initiated by exposure to ionizing radiation). In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson disease, or in ischemia-reperfusion injury, ROS may perpetuate the cellular damage caused by another process.

| Hemodialysis | Ischemia-reperfusion injury following stroke |
| Diabetes | OXPHOS diseases (mitochondrial DNA disorders) |
| Acute renal failure | Multiple sclerosis |
| Aging | Parkinson disease |

OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation.

Oxygen radicals are joined in their destructive damage by the free-radical nitric oxide (NO) and the ROS hypochlorous acid ( HOCl ). NO combines with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or superoxide to form reactive nitrogen-oxygen species (RNOS), such as the nonradical peroxynitrite or the radical nitrogen dioxide. RNOS are present in the environment (e.g., cigarette smoke) and are generated in cells. During phagocytosis of invading microorganisms, cells of the immune system produce $\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{-}, \mathrm{HOCl}$, and NO through the actions of NADPH oxidase, myeloperoxidase, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, respectively. In addition to killing phagocytosed invading microorganisms, these toxic metabolites may damage surrounding tissue components.

Cells protect themselves against damage by ROS and other radicals through repair processes, compartmentalization of free-radical production, defense enzymes, and endogenous and exogenous antioxidants (free-radical scavengers). The defense enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) removes the superoxide free radical. Catalase and glutathione peroxidase remove hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides. Vitamin E, vitamin C, and plant flavonoids act as antioxidants. Oxidative stress occurs when the rate of ROS generation exceeds the capacity of the cell for their removal (Fig. 25.2).

## THE WAITING ROOM

Two years ago, Les G., a 62-year-old man, noted an increasing tremor of his right hand when sitting quietly (resting tremor). The tremor disappeared if he actively used this hand to do purposeful movement. As this symptom progressed, he also complained of stiffness in his muscles that slowed his movements (bradykinesia). His wife noticed a change in his gait; he had begun taking short, shuffling steps and leaned forward as he walked (postural imbalance). He often appeared to be staring ahead with a rather immobile facial expression. She noted a tremor of his eyelids when he was asleep and, recently, a tremor of his legs when he was at rest. Because of these progressive symptoms and some subtle personality changes (anxiety and emotional lability), she convinced Les to see their family doctor.

The doctor suspected that her patient probably had primary or idiopathic parkinsonism (Parkinson disease) and referred Mr. G. to a neurologist. In Parkinson disease, neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, containing the pigment melanin and the neurotransmitter dopamine, degenerate.

Cora N. had done well since the successful lysis of blood clots in her coronary arteries with the use of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) (see Chapters 20 and 24). This therapy quickly relieved the crushing chest pain (angina) she had experienced when she won the lottery. At her first office visit after her discharge from the hospital, Cora's cardiologist told her she had developed multiple premature contractions of the ventricular muscle of her heart as the clots were being lysed. This process could have led to a life-threatening arrhythmia known as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. However, Cora's arrhythmia responded quickly to pharmacologic suppression and did not recur during the remainder of her hospitalization.

## I. $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and the Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species

The generation of $R O S$ from $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in our cells is a natural, everyday occurrence. The electrons that contribute to their formation are usually derived from reduced electron carriers of the electron-transport chain (ETC). ROS are formed as accidental products of nonenzymatic and enzymatic reactions. Occasionally, they are deliberately synthesized in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Ultraviolet radiation and pollutants in the air can increase formation of toxic oxygen-containing compounds.
![ma118181198a6](ma118181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 25.2 Oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when the rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen-oxygen species (RNOS) production overbalances the rate of their removal by cellular defense mechanisms. These defense mechanisms include several enzymes and antioxidants. Antioxidants usually react nonenzymatically with ROS.

The basal ganglia are part of a neuronal feedback loop that modulates and integrates the flow of information from the cerebral cortex to the motor neurons of the spinal cord. The neostriatum is the major input structure from the cerebral cortex. The substantia nigra pars compacta consists of neurons that provide integrative input to the neostriatum through pigmented neurons that use dopamine as a neurotransmitter (the nigrostriatal pathway). Integrated information feeds back to the basal ganglia and to the cerebral cortex to control voluntary movement. In Parkinson disease, a decrease in the amount of dopamine reaching the basal ganglia results in the movement disorder.

In ventricular tachycardia, rapid premature beats from an irritative focus in ventricular muscle occur in runs of varying duration. Persistent ventricular tachycardia compromises cardiac output, leading to death. This arrhythmia can result from severe ischemia (lack of blood flow) in the ventricular muscle of the heart caused by clots forming at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. However, Cora N.'s rapid beats began during the infusion of tissue TPA as the clot was lysed. Thus, they probably resulted from reperfusing a previously ischemic area of her heart with oxygenated blood. This phenomenon is known as ischemic-reperfusion injury, and it is caused by cytotoxic ROS derived from oxygen in the blood that reperfuses previously hypoxic cells. Ischemiareperfusion injury also may occur when tissue oxygenation is interrupted during surgery or transplantation.

Catecholamine (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine) measurements, which were ordered for Mr. G., use either serum or a 25 -hour urine collection as samples for assay. After appropriate removal of cells and/or particulate matter, the sample is placed over an ion-exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) column and the eluate from the column is analyzed by sensitive electrochemical detection. Through comparison with retention times of standard catecholamines on the column, the various catecholamine species can be clearly resolved from each other. The electrochemical detection uses electrodes that are oxidized by the samples, and the amplitude current that is generated via the redox reaction allows one to determine the concentration of catecholamines in the specimen.

FIGURE 25.3 Reduction of oxygen by four one-electron steps. The four one-electron reduction steps for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ progressively generate superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical plus water. Superoxide is sometimes written $\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$to better illustrate its single unpaired electron. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, the half-reduced form of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, has accepted two electrons and is, therefore, not an oxygen radical. $\mathrm{e}^{-}$, electron.

## A. The Radical Nature of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$

A radical, by definition, is a molecule that has a single unpaired electron in an orbital. A free radical is a radical that is capable of independent existence. (Radicals formed in an enzyme active site during a reaction, for example, are not considered free radicals unless they can dissociate from the protein to interact with other molecules.) Radicals are highly reactive and initiate chain reactions by extracting an electron from a neighboring molecule to complete their own orbitals. Although the transition metals (e.g., $\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{Cu}, \mathrm{Mo}$ ) have single electrons in orbitals, they are not usually considered free radicals because they are relatively stable, do not initiate chain reactions, and are bound to proteins in the cell.

The oxygen molecule is a biradical, which means it has two single electrons in different orbitals. These electrons cannot both travel in the same orbital because they have parallel spins (they spin in the same direction). Although oxygen is very reactive from a thermodynamic standpoint, its single electrons cannot react rapidly with the paired electrons found in the covalent bonds of organic molecules. As a consequence, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ reacts slowly through the acceptance of single electrons in reactions that require a catalyst (such as a metal-containing enzyme).

Because the two unpaired electrons in oxygen have the same (parallel) spin, they are called antibonding electrons. In contrast, carbon-carbon and carbonhydrogen bonds each contain two electrons, which have antiparallel spins and form a thermodynamically stable pair. As a consequence, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ cannot readily oxidize a covalent bond because one of its electrons would have to flip its spin around to make new pairs. The difficulty in changing spins is called spin restriction. Without spin restriction, organic life forms could not have developed in the oxygen atmosphere on earth because they would be spontaneously oxidized by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.
$\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is capable of accepting a total of four electrons, which reduces it to water (Fig. 25.3). When $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ accepts one electron, superoxide is formed. Superoxide is still a radical because it has one unpaired electron remaining. This reaction is not thermodynamically favorable and requires a moderately strong reducing agent that can donate single electrons (e.g., the radical form of coenzyme Q [CoQH $\bullet]$ in the ETC). When superoxide accepts an electron, it is reduced to hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, which is not a radical. The hydroxyl radical is formed in the next one-electron reduction step in the reduction sequence. Finally, acceptance of the last electron reduces the hydroxyl radical to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

## B. Characteristics of Reactive Oxygen Species

ROS are oxygen-containing compounds that are highly reactive free radicals or compounds that are readily converted to these oxygen free radicals in the cell. The major oxygen metabolites produced by one-electron reduction of oxygen (superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical) are classified as ROS (Table 25.2).

Reactive free radicals extract electrons (usually as hydrogen atoms) from other compounds to complete their own orbitals, thereby initiating free-radical chain reactions. The hydroxyl radical is probably the most potent of the ROS. It initiates chain reactions that form lipid peroxides and organic radicals and adds directly to compounds. The superoxide anion is also highly reactive, but it has limited lipid solubility and cannot diffuse far. However, it can generate the more reactive hydroxyl and hydroperoxy radicals by reacting nonenzymatically with hydrogen peroxide in the Haber-Weiss reaction (Fig. 25.4).

Hydrogen peroxide, although not actually a radical, is a weak oxidizing agent that is classified as an ROS because it can generate the hydroxyl radical $(\mathrm{OH} \bullet)$. Transition metals, such as $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ or $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}$, catalyze formation of the hydroxyl radical from hydrogen peroxide in the nonenzymatic Fenton reaction (see Fig. 25.4). Because hydrogen peroxide is lipid-soluble, it can diffuse through membranes and generate $\mathrm{OH} \bullet$ at localized $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ - or $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}$-containing sites, such as the ETC within the mitochondria. Hydrogen peroxide is also the precursor of hypochlorous acid ( HOCl$)$, a powerful oxidizing agent that is produced endogenously and enzymatically by phagocytic cells. To decrease occurrence of the Fenton reaction, accessibility to transition metals, such as $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}$, are highly restricted in cells or in

TABLE 25.3 Reactive Oxygen Species and Reactive Nitrogen-Oxygen Species

| REACTIVE SPECIES | PROPERTIES |
| :--: | :--: |
| Superoxide anion $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\right)$ | Produced by the electron-transport chain and at other sites. Cannot diffuse far from the site of origin. Generates other reactive oxygen species. |
| Hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ | Not a free radical but can generate free radicals by reaction with a transition metal (e.g., $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ). Can diffuse into and through cell membranes. |
| Hydroxyl radical $(\mathrm{OH} \cdot)$ | The most reactive species in attacking biologic molecules. Produced from $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the Fenton reaction in the presence of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ or $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}$. |
| Organic radicals ( $\mathrm{RO} \cdot, \mathrm{R} \cdot, \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{S}$ ) | Organic free radicals ( $R$ denotes the remainder of the compound). Produced from ROH, RH (e.g., at the carbon of a double bond in a fatty acid), or RSH $\mathrm{OH} \cdot$ attack. |
| Peroxy radical $(\mathrm{RCOO} \cdot)$ | An organic peroxy radical, such as occurs during lipid degradation (also denoted $\mathrm{LOO} \cdot$ ). |
| Hypochlorous acid ( HOCl$)$ | Produced in neutrophils during the respiratory burst to destroy invading organisms. Toxicity is through halogenation and oxidation reactions. Attacking species is $\mathrm{OCl}^{-}$. |
| Singlet oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}\right)$ | Oxygen with antiparallel spins. Produced at high oxygen tensions from absorption of ultraviolet light. Decays so fast that it is probably not a significant in vivo source of toxicity. |
| Nitric oxide (NO) | Reactive nitrogen-oxygen species (RNOS). A free radical produced endogenously by nitric oxide synthase. Binds to metal ions. Combines with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or other oxygen-containing radicals to produce additional RNOS. |
| Peroxynitrite $\left(\mathrm{ONOO}^{-}\right)$ | RNOS.A strong oxidizing agent that is not a free radical. It can generate nitrogen dioxide $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right)$, which is a radical. |

the body as a whole. Events that release iron from cellular storage sites, such as a crushing injury, are associated with increased free-radical injury.

Organic radicals are generated when superoxide or the hydroxyl radical indiscriminately extract electrons from other molecules. Organic peroxy radicals are intermediates of chain reactions, such as lipid peroxidation. Other organic radicals, such as the ethoxy radical, are intermediates of enzymatic reactions that escape into solution (see Table 25.2).

An additional group of oxygen-containing radicals, termed RNOS, contains nitrogen as well as oxygen. These radicals are derived principally from the free radical nitric oxide (NO), which is produced endogenously by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. NO combines with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or superoxide to produce additional RNOS.

## C. Major Sources of Primary Reactive Oxygen Species in the Cell

ROS are constantly being formed in the cell; approximately $3 \%$ to $5 \%$ of the oxygen we consume is converted to oxygen free radicals. Some are produced as accidental by-products of normal enzymatic reactions that escape from the active site of metalcontaining enzymes during oxidation reactions. Others, such as hydrogen peroxide, are physiologic products of oxidases in peroxisomes. Deliberate production of toxic free radicals occurs during the inflammatory response. Drugs, natural radiation, air pollutants, and other chemicals also can increase formation of free radicals in cells.

## I. Generation of Superoxide

One of the major sites of superoxide generation is CoQ in the mitochondrial ETC (Fig. 25.5). The one-electron reduced form of $\mathrm{CoQ}(\mathrm{CoQH} \bullet)$ is free within the membrane and can accidentally transfer an electron to dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, thereby forming superoxide. In contrast, when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds to cytochrome oxidase and accepts electrons, none of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ radical intermediates is released from the enzyme, and no ROS are generated.

FIGURE 25.4 Generation of the hydroxyl radical by the nonenzymatic Haber-Weiss and Fenton reactions. In the simplified versions of these reactions shown here, the transfer of single electrons generates the hydroxyl radical. Reactive oxygen species are shown in the boxes. In addition to $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}, \mathrm{Cu}^{+}$and many other metals can also serve as single-electron donors in the Fenton reaction.

With insufficient oxygen, Cora N.'s ischemic heart muscle mitochondria were unable to maintain cellular ATP levels, resulting in high intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ levels. The reduced state of the electron carriers in the absence of oxygen, and loss of mitochondrial ion gradients or membrane integrity, leads to increased superoxide production once oxygen becomes available during reperfusion. The damage can be self-perpetuating, especially if iron bound to components of the ETC becomes available for the Fenton reaction, or the mitochondrial permeability transition is activated.

FIGURE 25.5 Generation of superoxide by coenzyme $Q(\mathrm{CoQ})$ in the electron-transport chain. In the process of transporting electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, some of the electrons escape when $\mathrm{CoQH} \bullet$ accidentally interacts with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to form superoxide. $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{H}$ represents the Fe -heme center of the cytochromes. FMN, flavin mononucleotide; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

# 2. Oxidases, Oxygenases, and Peroxidases 

Most of the oxidases, peroxidases, and oxygenases in the cell bind $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and transfer single electrons to it via a metal. Free-radical intermediates of these reactions may be accidentally released before the reduction is complete.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes are a major source of free radicals "leaked" from reactions. Because these enzymes catalyze reactions in which single electrons are transferred to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and an organic substrate, the possibility of accidentally generating and releasing free-radical intermediates is high (see Chapters 20 and 24). Induction of P450 enzymes by alcohol, drugs, or chemical toxicants leads to increased cellular injury. As an example, carbon tetrachloride $\left(\mathrm{CCl}_{4}\right)$, which is used as a solvent in the dry-cleaning industry, is converted by cytochrome P450 to a highly reactive free radical that has caused hepatocellular necrosis in workers in that industry. When the enzyme-bound $\mathrm{CCl}_{4}$ accepts an electron, it dissociates into $\mathrm{CCl}_{3} \bullet$ and Cl . The $\mathrm{CCl}_{3} \bullet$ radical, which cannot continue through the P 450 reaction sequence, "leaks" from the enzyme active site and initiates chain reactions in the surrounding polyunsaturated lipids of the endoplasmic reticulum. These reactions spread into the plasma membrane and to proteins, eventually resulting in cell swelling, accumulation of lipids, and cell death. When substrates for cytochrome P450 enzymes are not present, its potential for destructive damage is diminished by repression of gene transcription.

Hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides are generated enzymatically as major reaction products by several oxidases present in peroxisomes, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum. For example, monoamine oxidase, which oxidatively degrades the neurotransmitter dopamine, generates $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ at the mitochondrial membrane of certain neurons. Peroxisomal fatty acid oxidase generates $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ rather than $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ during the oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids (see Chapter 30). Xanthine oxidase, an enzyme of purine degradation that can reduce $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{-}$or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the cytosol, is thought to be a major contributor to ischemia-reperfusion injury, especially in intestinal mucosal and endothelial cells. Lipid peroxides are also formed enzymatically as intermediates in the pathways for synthesis of many eicosanoids, including leukotrienes and prostaglandins.

## 3. Ionizing Radiation

Cosmic rays that continuously bombard the earth, radioactive chemicals, and X-rays are forms of ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation has a high enough energy level that it can split water into hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals, thus leading to radiation damage to the skin, mutations, cancer, and cell death. It also may generate organic radicals through direct collision with organic cellular components.

## II. Oxygen Radical Reactions with Cellular Components

Oxygen radicals produce cellular dysfunction by reacting with lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and DNA to extract electrons (summarized in Fig. 25.6). Evidence of free-radical damage has been described in $>100$ disease states. In some of these diseases, free-radical damage is the primary cause of the disease; in others, it enhances complications of the disease.

## A. Membrane Attack: Formation of Lipid and Lipid Peroxy Radicals

Chain reactions that form lipid free radicals and lipid peroxides in membranes make a major contribution to ROS-induced injury (Fig. 25.7). An initiator (such as a hydroxyl radical produced locally in the Fenton reaction) begins the chain reaction. It extracts a hydrogen atom, preferably from the double bond of a polyunsaturated fatty acid in a membrane lipid. The chain reaction is propagated when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ adds to form lipid peroxy radicals and lipid peroxides. Eventually, lipid degradation occurs, forming such products as malondialdehyde (from fatty acids with three or more double bonds) and ethane and pentane (from the $\omega$-terminal carbons of three- and six-carbon fatty acids, respectively). Malondialdehyde appears in the blood and urine and is used as an indicator of free-radical damage.
![ma123181198a6](ma123181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 25.6 Free radical-mediated cellular injury. Superoxide and the hydroxyl radical initiate lipid peroxidation in the cellular, mitochondrial, nuclear, and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The increase in cellular permeability results in an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, which causes further mitochondrial damage. The cysteine sulfhydryl groups and other amino acid residues on proteins are oxidized and degraded. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA can be oxidized, resulting in strand breaks and other types of damage. Reactive nitrogen-oxygen species (nitric oxide [NO], $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$, and peroxynitrites) have similar effects. $R E R$, rough endoplasmic reticulum; SER, smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

0Production of ROS by xanthine oxidase in endothelial cells may be enhanced during ischemia-reperfusion in Cora N. $\mathbf{N}$ heart. In undamaged tissues, xanthine oxidase exists as a dehydrogenase that uses $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$rather than $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as an electron acceptor in the pathway for degradation of purines (hypoxanthine $\rightarrow$ xanthine $\rightarrow$ uric acid; see Chapter 39). When $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ levels decrease, phosphorylation of ADP to ATP decreases, and degradation of ADP and adenine through xanthine oxidase increases. In the process, xanthine dehydrogenase is converted to an oxidase. As long as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ levels are below the high $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the enzyme for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, little damage is done. However, during reperfusion, when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ levels return to normal, xanthine oxidase generates $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{-}$at the site of injury.

The appearance of lipofuscin granules in many tissues increases during aging. The pigment lipofuscin (from the Greek lipos, for lipids, and the Latin fuscus, for dark) consists of a heterogeneous mixture of cross-linked polymerized lipids and protein formed by reactions between amino acid residues and lipid peroxidation products, such as malondialdehyde. These cross-linked products are probably derived from peroxidatively damaged cell organelles that were autophagocytized by lysosomes but could not be digested. When these dark pigments appear on the skin of the hands in aged individuals, they are referred to as "liver spots," a traditional hallmark of aging. In Les G, and other patients with Parkinson disease, lipofuscin appears as Lewy bodes in degenerating neurons.

![ma124181198a6](ma124181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 25.7 Lipid peroxidation: a free-radical chain reaction. A. Lipid peroxidation is initiated by a hydroxyl or other radical that extracts a hydrogen atom from a polyunsaturated lipid (LH), thereby forming a lipid radical ( $\mathrm{L} \cdot$ ). B. The free-radical chain reaction is propagated by reaction with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, forming the lipid peroxy radical $\left(\mathrm{LOO} \cdot\right)$ and lipid peroxide (LOOH). C. Rearrangements of the single electron result in degradation of the lipid. Malondialdehyde, one of the compounds formed, is soluble and appears in blood. D. The chain reaction can be terminated by reduced vitamin E (Vit $\mathrm{E}_{\text {red }}$ ) and other lipid-soluble antioxidants that donate single electrons. Two subsequent reduction steps form a stable, oxidized antioxidant.

Peroxidation of lipid molecules invariably changes or damages lipid molecular structure. In addition to the self-destructive nature of membrane lipid peroxidation, the aldehydes that are formed can cross-link proteins. When the damaged lipids are the constituents of biologic membranes, the cohesive lipid bilayer arrangement and stable structural organization is disrupted (see Fig. 25.6). Disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity may result in further free-radical production.

## B. Proteins and Peptides

In proteins, the amino acids proline, histidine, arginine, cysteine, and methionine are particularity susceptible to hydroxyl radical attack and oxidative damage. As a consequence of oxidative damage, the protein may fragment or residues cross-link with other residues. Free-radical attack on protein cysteine residues can result in cross-linking and formation of aggregates that prevents their degradation. However, oxidative damage increases the susceptibility of other proteins to proteolytic digestion.

Free-radical attack and oxidation of the cysteine sulfhydryl residues of the tripeptide glutathione ( $\gamma$-glutamylcysteinylglycine; see Section V.A.3) increases oxidative damage throughout the cell. Glutathione is a major component of cellular defense against free-radical injury, and its oxidation reduces its protective effects.

## C. DNA

Oxygen-derived free radicals are also a major source of DNA damage. Approximately 20 types of oxidatively altered DNA molecules have been identified. The nonspecific binding of $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ to DNA facilitates localized production of the hydroxyl radical, which can cause base alterations in the DNA (one example is generating 8-hydroxyguanine from guanine, in the presence of the hydroxyl radical). It also can attack the deoxyribose backbone and cause strand breaks. This DNA damage can be repaired to some extent by the cell (see Chapter 12) or minimized by apoptosis of the cell.

## III. Nitric Oxide and Reactive Nitrogen-Oxygen Species

NO is an oxygen-containing free radical that, like $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, is both essential to life and toxic. NO has a single electron and therefore binds to other compounds that contain single electrons, such as $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$. As a gas, NO diffuses through the cytosol and lipid membranes and into cells. At low concentrations, it functions physiologically as a neurotransmitter and as a hormone that causes vasodilation. At high concentrations, however, it combines with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or with superoxide to form additional reactive and toxic species that contain both nitrogen and oxygen (RNOS). RNOS are involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease and in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

## A. Nitric Oxide Synthase

At low concentrations, NO serves as a neurotransmitter or as a hormone. It is synthesized from arginine by NO synthases (Fig. 25.8). As a gas, it is able to diffuse through water and lipid membranes and into target cells. In the target cell, it exerts its physiologic effects by high-affinity binding to Fe -heme in the enzyme guanylyl cyclase, thereby activating a signal transduction cascade. However, NO is rapidly inactivated by nonspecific binding to many molecules, and therefore, cells that produce NO need to be close to the target cells.

The body has three different tissue-specific isoforms of NO synthase, each encoded by a different gene: neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS , isoform I), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, isoform II), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, isoform III). nNOS and eNOS are tightly regulated by the concentration of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to produce the small amounts of NO required for its role as a neurotransmitter and hormone. In contrast, iNOS is present in many cells of the immune system and cell types with a similar lineage, such as macrophages and brain astroglia. This isoenzyme of NO synthase is regulated principally by induction of gene transcription and not by changes in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration. It produces high and toxic levels of NO to assist in killing invading microorganisms. It is these very high levels of NO that are associated with generation of RNOS and NO toxicity.

$\sigma$Evidence of protein damage shows up in many diseases, particularly those associated with aging. In patients with cataracts, proteins in the lens of the eye exhibit free-radical damage and contain methionine sulfoxide residues and tryptophan degradation products.

$\sigma$Nitroglycerin, in tablet form, is often given to patients with coronary artery disease who experience ischemia-induced chest pain (angina). The nitroglycerin decomposes in the blood, forming nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. This decreases the preload (blood return to the heart) by dilating the veins and therefore eases the work of the heart and also increases blood flow to the heart by dilating arteries, which relieves the angina.
![ma125181198a6](ma125181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 25.8 Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) synthesizes the free radical nitric oxide (NO). Like cytochrome P450 enzymes, NOS uses Fe-heme, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to transfer single electrons from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. NOS also requires the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin $\left(\mathrm{BH}_{4}\right)$.

# B. Nitric Oxide Toxicity 

The toxic actions of NO can be divided into two categories: direct toxic effects resulting from binding to Fe -containing proteins, and indirect effects mediated by compounds formed when NO combines with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or with superoxide to form RNOS.

## I. Direct Toxic Effects of Nitric Oxide

NO, as a radical, exerts direct toxic effects by combining with Fe-containing compounds that also have single electrons. Major destructive sites of attack include $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers (e.g., ETC complexes I through III, aconitase) and Fe-heme proteins (e.g., hemoglobin and ETC cytochromes). However, there is usually little damage because NO is present in low concentrations and Fe -heme compounds are present in excess capacity. NO can cause serious damage, however, through direct inhibition of respiration in cells that are already compromised through oxidative phosphorylation diseases or ischemia.

## 2. Reactive Nitrogen-Oxygen Species Toxicity

When NO is present in very high concentrations (e.g., during inflammation), it combines nonenzymatically with superoxide to form peroxynitrite $\left(\mathrm{ONOO}^{-}\right)$, or with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to form dinitrogen trioxide $\left(\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ (Fig. 25.9). Peroxynitrite, although it is not a free radical, is a strong oxidizing agent that is stable and directly toxic. It can diffuse through the cell and lipid membranes to interact with a wide range of targets, including the methionine side chain in proteins and -SH groups (e.g., $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers in the ETC). It also breaks down to form additional RNOS, including the freeradical nitrogen dioxide $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right)$, which is an effective initiator of lipid peroxidation. Peroxynitrite products also react (nitration) with aromatic rings, forming compounds
![ma126181198a6](ma126181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 25.9 Formation of reactive nitrogen-oxygen species (RNOS) from nitric oxide (NO). RNOS are shown in red. The type of damage caused by each RNOS is shown in parentheses. Of all the nitrogen-oxygen-containing compounds shown, only nitrate is relatively nontoxic. Nitrogen dioxide $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)$ is one of the toxic agents present in smog, automobile exhaust, gas ranges, pilot lights, cigarette smoke, and smoke from forest fires or burning buildings.

such as nitrotyrosine or nitroguanosine. $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, which can be derived from either $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ or nitrite, is the agent of nitrosative stress, and it nitrosylates sulfhydryl and similarly reactive groups in the cell. Nitrosylation usually interferes with the proper functioning of the protein or lipid that has been modified. Thus, RNOS can do as much oxidative and free-radical damage as non-nitrogen-containing ROS, as well as nitrating and nitrosylating compounds. The result is widespread and includes inhibition of a large number of enzymes, mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, inhibition of the ETC and energy depletion, single-stranded or double-stranded breaks in DNA, and modification of bases in DNA.

## IV. Formation of Free Radicals during Phagocytosis and Inflammation

In response to infectious agents and other stimuli, phagocytic cells of the immune system (neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes/macrophages) exhibit a rapid consumption of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ called the respiratory burst. The respiratory burst is a major source of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, the hydroxyl radical, HOCl , and RNOS. The generation of free radicals is part of the human antimicrobial defense system and is intended to destroy invading microorganisms, tumor cells, and other cells targeted for removal.

## A. Reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate Oxidase

The respiratory burst results from the activity of NADPH oxidase, which catalyzes the transfer of an electron from NADPH to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to form superoxide (Fig. 25.10). NADPH oxidase is assembled from cytosolic as well as membranous proteins recruited into the phagolysosome membrane as it surrounds an invading microorganism.
![ma127181198a6](ma127181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 25.10 Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the phagocytic respiratory burst by activated neutrophils. (I) Activation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase on the outer side of the plasma membrane initiates the respiratory burst with the generation of superoxide. During phagocytosis, the plasma membrane invaginates, and superoxide is released into the vacuole space. (2) Superoxide (either spontaneously or enzymatically via superoxide dismutase [SOD]) generates $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$. (3) Granules containing myeloperoxidase are secreted into the phagosome, where myeloperoxidase generates hypochlorous acid ( HOCl ) and other halides. (4) $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ can also generate the hydroxyl radical from the Fenton reaction. (5) Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) may be activated and generate nitric oxide (NO). (6) NO combines with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, which may generate additional reactive nitrogen-oxygen species. The result is an attack on the membranes and other components of phagocytosed cells, and eventual lysis. The whole process is referred to as the respiratory burst because it lasts only 30 to 60 minutes and consumes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

(1)In patients with chronic granulomatous disease, phagocytes have genetic defects in NADPH oxidase. NADPH oxidase, of which there are several isozymes, generally has six different subunits (two in the cell membrane, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which together form flavoprotein $b_{5 / 6}$ and four recruited from the cytosol, which include the small GTPase Rac, as well as a complex of p47phox, p67phox, and $\mathrm{p} 40^{\text {phox }}$ ); the genetic defect may be in any of four of the genes that encode these subunits. The membrane catalytic $\beta$-subunit of NADPH oxidase is a 91-kDa flavocytochrome glycoprotein. It transfers electrons from bound NADPH to FAD, which transfers them to the Fe -heme components. The membranous $\alpha$-subunit (p22) is required for stabilization. The cytosolic proteins are required for assembly of the complex. The $91-\mathrm{kDa} \beta$-subunit is affected most often in X-linked chronic granulomatous disease, whereas the $\alpha$-subunit is affected in a rare autosomal-recessive form. The cytosolic subunits p47 and p67 are affected most often in patients with the autosomal-recessive form of granulomatous disease. In addition to their enhanced susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections, these patients suffer from an apparent dysregulation of normal inflammatory responses.

During Cora N.'s myocardial ischemia (decreased blood flow), the ability of her heart to generate ATP from oxidative phosphorylation was compromised. The damage appeared to accelerate when oxygen was first reintroduced (reperfused) into the tissue. During ischemia, Co Q and the other single-electron components of the ETC become saturated with electrons. When oxygen is reintroduced (reperfusion), electron donation to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to form superoxide is increased. The increase of superoxide results in enhanced formation of hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical. Macrophages in the area clean up cell debris from ischemic injury and produce nitric oxide, which may further damage mitochondria by generating RNOS that attack $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers and cytochromes in the ETC. These radicals, which increase in concentration when oxygen is introduced into the system, may actually amplify the damage done by the original ischemic event and increase the infarct size.

Superoxide is released into the intramembranous space of the phagolysosome, where it is generally converted to hydrogen peroxide and other ROS that are effective against bacteria and fungal pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is formed by SOD, which may come from the phagocytic cell or from the invading microorganism.

## B. Myeloperoxidase and Hypochlorous Acid

The formation of HOCl from $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ is catalyzed by myeloperoxidase, a hemecontaining enzyme that is present only in phagocytic cells of the immune system (predominantly neutrophils). The HOCl rapidly dissociates and loses a proton.

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \xrightarrow{\text { Myeloperoxidase }} \mathrm{HOCl}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \xrightarrow{\text { Dissociation }} \mathrm{OCl}+\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

Myeloperoxidase contains two Fe -hemelike centers, which give it the green color seen in pus. HOCl is a powerful toxin that destroys bacteria within seconds through halogenation and oxidation reactions. It oxidizes many Fe - and S -containing groups (e.g., sulfhydryl groups, $\mathrm{Fe}-\mathrm{S}$ centers, ferredoxin, heme-proteins, methionine), oxidatively decarboxylates and deaminates proteins, and cleaves peptide bonds. Aerobic bacteria under attack rapidly lose membrane transport, possibly because of damage to ATP synthase or electron transport chain components (which reside in the plasma membrane of bacteria).

## C. Reactive Nitrogen-Oxygen Species and Inflammation

When human neutrophils of the immune system are activated to produce NO, NADPH oxidase is also activated. NO reacts rapidly with superoxide to generate peroxynitrite, which forms additional RNOS. NO also may be released into the surrounding medium to combine with superoxide in target cells.

In several disease states, free-radical release by neutrophils or macrophages during inflammation contributes to injury in the surrounding tissues. During stroke or myocardial infarction, phagocytic cells that move into the ischemic area to remove dead cells may increase the area and extent of damage. The self-perpetuating mechanism of radical release by neutrophils during inflammation and immune-complex formation may explain some of the features of chronic inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. As a result of free-radical release, the immunoglobulin G (IgG) proteins present in the synovial fluid are partially oxidized, which improves their binding with the rheumatoid antibody. This binding, in turn, stimulates the neutrophils to release more free radicals.

## V. Cellular Defenses against Oxygen Toxicity

Our defenses against oxygen toxicity fall into the categories of antioxidant defense enzymes, dietary and endogenous antioxidants (free-radical scavengers), cellular compartmentalization, metal sequestration, and repair of damaged cellular components. The antioxidant defense enzymes react with ROS and cellular products of free-radical chain reactions to convert them to nontoxic products.

Dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin E and flavonoids, and endogenous antioxidants, such as urate, can terminate free-radical chain reactions. Defense through compartmentalization refers to separation of species and sites involved in ROS generation from the rest of the cell (Fig. 25.11). For example, many of the enzymes that produce hydrogen peroxide are sequestered in peroxisomes with a high content of antioxidant enzymes. Metals are bound to a wide range of proteins within the blood and in cells, preventing their participation in the Fenton reaction. Iron, for example, is tightly bound to its storage protein, ferritin, and cannot react with hydrogen peroxide. Repair mechanisms for DNA and for removal of oxidized fatty acids from membrane lipids are available to the cell. Oxidized amino acids on proteins are continuously repaired through protein degradation and resynthesis of new proteins.

![ma128181198a6](ma128181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 25.II Compartmentalization of free-radical defenses. Various defenses against reactive oxygen species (ROS) are found in the various subcellular compartments of the cell. The location of free-radical defense enzymes (shown in red) matches the type and amount of ROS generated in each subcellular compartment. The highest activities of these enzymes are found in the liver, adrenal gland, and kidney, where mitochondrial and peroxisomal contents are high, and cytochrome P450 enzymes are found in abundance in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) peroxidase are present as isozymes in the various compartments. Another form of compartmentalization involves the sequestration of Fe , which is stored as mobilizable Fe in ferritin. Excess Fe is stored in nonmobilizable hemosiderin deposits. GSH is a nonenzymatic antioxidant.

## A. Antioxidant Scavenging Enzymes

The enzymatic defense against ROS includes SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase.

## I. Superoxide Dismutase

Conversion of superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (dismutation) by SOD is often called the primary defense against oxidative stress because superoxide is such a strong initiator of chain reactions (Fig. 25.12A). SOD exists as three isoenzyme forms, a $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}-\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ form present in the cytosol, a $\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ form present in mitochondria, and a $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}-\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ form found extracellularly. The activity of $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}-\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ SOD is increased by chemicals or conditions (such as hyperbaric oxygen) that increase the production of superoxide.

## 2. Catalase

Hydrogen peroxide, once formed, must be reduced to water to prevent it from forming the hydroxyl radical in the Fenton reaction or the Haber-Weiss reaction (see Fig. 25.4) One of the enzymes that is capable of reducing hydrogen peroxide is catalase (see Fig. 25.12B). Catalase is found principally in peroxisomes and to a lesser extent in the cytosol and microsomal fraction of the cell. The highest activities are found in tissues with a high peroxisomal content (kidney and liver). In cells of the immune system, catalase serves to protect the cell against its own respiratory burst.

## 3. Glutathione Peroxidase and Glutathione Reductase

Glutathione ( $\gamma$-glutamylcysteinylglycine) is one of the body's principal means of protecting against oxidative damage (see also Chapter 27). Glutathione is a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine, with the amino group of cysteine joined in peptide linkage to the $\gamma$-carboxyl group of glutamate (Fig. 25.13). In reactions that are catalyzed by glutathione peroxidases, the reactive sulfhydryl groups reduce hydrogen peroxide to water and lipid peroxides to nontoxic alcohols. In these reactions, two glutathione molecules are oxidized to form a single
![ma129181198a6](ma129181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 25.12 A. Superoxide dismutase converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, which is nontoxic unless it is converted to other reactive oxygen species (ROS). B. Catalase converts two molecules of hydrogen peroxide to two molecules of water and one molecule of oxygen. (ROS is shown in a yellow box.)

The intracellular form of the $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}-\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ SOD is encoded by the SOD I gene. To date, 58 mutations in this gene have been discovered in individuals affected by familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig disease). How a mutation in this gene leads to the symptoms of this disease has yet to be understood. It is important to note that only $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the total cases of diagnosed ALS are caused by the familial form. Recent work has indicated that mutations in enzymes involved in RNA processing also lead to familial and sporadic ALS.

Why does the cell need a high content of SOD in mitochondria?

![ma130181198a6](ma130181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 25.13 Glutathione peroxidase reduces hydrogen peroxide to water. A. The structure of glutathione (GSH). The sulfhydryl group of GSH, which is oxidized to a disulfide, is shown in red. B. Glutathione peroxidase transfers electrons from GSH to hydrogen peroxide. C. GSH redox cycle. Glutathione reductase regenerates reduced GSH. (Reactive oxygen species is shown in the yellow box.)

$\sigma$
Mitochondria are major sites for generation of superoxide from the interaction of $\mathrm{Co} Q$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. The $\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ SOD present in mitochondria is not regulated through induction/repression of gene transcription, presumably because the rate of superoxide generation is always high. Mitochondria also have a high content of glutathione and glutathione peroxidase and can thus convert $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and prevent lipid peroxidation.

Premature infants with low levels of lung surfactant (see Chapter 31) require oxygen therapy. The level of oxygen must be closely monitored to prevent ROS-induced retinopathy and subsequent blindness (the retinopathy of prematurity) and to prevent bronchial pulmonary dysplasia. The tendency for these complications to develop is enhanced by the possibility of low levels of SOD and vitamin E in the premature infant.
molecule, glutathione disulfide. The sulfhydryl groups are also oxidized in nonenzymatic chain-terminating reactions with organic radicals.

Glutathione peroxidases exist as a family of selenium enzymes with somewhat different properties and tissue locations. Within cells, they are found principally in the cytosol and mitochondria and are the major means for removing $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ produced outside of peroxisomes. They contribute to our dietary requirement for selenium and account for the protective effect of selenium in the prevention of free-radical injury.

Once oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is formed, it must be reduced back to the sulfhydryl form by glutathione reductase in a redox cycle (see Fig. 25.13C). Glutathione reductase contains a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and catalyzes transfer of electrons from NADPH to the disulfide bond of GSSG. NADPH is thus essential for protection against free-radical injury. The major source of NADPH for this reaction is the pentose phosphate pathway (see Chapter 27).

## B. Nonenzymatic Antioxidants (Free-Radical Scavengers)

Free-radical scavengers convert free radicals to a nonradical, nontoxic form in nonenzymatic reactions. Most free-radical scavengers are antioxidants, compounds that neutralize free radicals by donating a hydrogen atom (with its one electron) to the radical. Antioxidants, therefore, reduce free radicals and are themselves oxidized in the reaction. Dietary free-radical scavengers (e.g., vitamin E, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, flavonoids), as well as endogenously produced free-radical scavengers (e.g., urate, melatonin), have a common structural feature, which is a conjugated doublebond system that may be an aromatic ring.

$\sigma$
Selenium (Se) is present in human proteins principally as selenocysteine (cysteine with the sulfur group replaced by Se , abbreviated sec). This amino acid functions in catalysis and has been found in II or more human enzymes, including the 4 enzymes of the glutathione peroxidase family. Se is supplied in the diet as selenomethionine from plants (methionine with the Se replacing the sulfur), selenocysteine from animal foods, and inorganic Se. Se from all of these sources can be converted to selenophosphate. Selenophosphate reacts with a unique tRNA-containing bound serine to form a selenocysteine-tRNA, which incorporates selenocysteine into the appropriate protein as it is being synthesized. Se homeostasis in the body is controlled principally through regulation of its secretion as methylated Se. The current dietary requirement is approximately $70 \mu \mathrm{~g} /$ day for adult males and $55 \mu \mathrm{~g} /$ day for females. Deficiency symptoms reflect diminished antioxidant defenses and include symptoms of vitamin E deficiency.

## I. Vitamin E

Vitamin E ( $\alpha$-tocopherol), the most widely distributed antioxidant in nature, is a lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin that functions principally to protect against lipid peroxidation in membranes (see Fig. 25.11). Vitamin E comprises several tocopherols that differ in their methylation pattern. Among these, $\alpha$-tocopherol is the most potent antioxidant and is present in the largest amounts in our diet (Fig. 25.14).

Vitamin E is an efficient antioxidant and nonenzymatic terminator of free-radical chain reactions, and it has little pro-oxidant activity. When vitamin E donates an electron to a lipid peroxy radical, it is converted to a free-radical form that is stabilized by resonance. If this free-radical form were to act as a pro-oxidant and abstract an electron from a polyunsaturated lipid, it would be oxidizing that lipid and actually propagate the free-radical chain reaction. The chemistry of vitamin E is such that it has a much greater tendency to donate a second electron and go to the fully oxidized form.

Tocopheryl quinone
FIGURE 25.14 Vitamin E ( $\alpha$-tocopherol) terminates free-radical lipid peroxidation by donating single electrons to lipid peroxy radicals ( $\mathrm{LOO} \cdot$ ) to form the more stable lipid peroxide, LOOH. In so doing, the $\alpha$-tocopherol is converted to the fully oxidized tocopheryl quinone.

Vitamin E is found in the diet in the lipid fractions of some vegetable oils and in liver, egg yolks, and cereals. It is absorbed together with lipids, and fat malabsorption results in symptomatic deficiencies.Vitamin E circulates in the blood in lipoprotein particles. Its deficiency causes neurologic symptoms, probably because the polyunsaturated lipids in myelin and other membranes of the nervous system are particularly sensitive to free-radical injury. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that individuals with a higher intake of foods containing vitamin E, $\beta$-carotene, and vitamin $C$ have a somewhat lower risk of cancer and certain other ROS-related diseases than do individuals on diets that are deficient in these vitamins. However, studies in which well-nourished populations were given supplements of these antioxidant vitamins found either no effects or harmful effects compared with the beneficial effects from eating foods containing a wide variety of antioxidant compounds. Of the pure chemical supplements tested, there is evidence only for the efficacy of vitamin E. In two clinical trials, $\beta$-carotene (or $\beta$-carotene + vitamin A) was associated with a higher incidence of lung cancer among smokers and higher mortality rates. In one study, vitamin E intake was associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (possibly because of vitamin K mimicry).

FIGURE 25.15 L-Ascorbate (the reduced form) donates single electrons ( $e^{-}$) to free radicals or disulfides in two steps as it is oxidized to dehydro-L-ascorbic acid. Its principal role in free-radical defense is probably regeneration of vitamin E. However, it also may react with superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorite, the hydroxyl and peroxy radicals, and nitrogen dioxide.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the United States among people older than 50 years of age, and it affects as many as 15 million people in the United States. In AMD, visual loss is related to oxidative damage to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choriocapillaris epithelium. The photoreceptor/retinal pigment complex is exposed to sunlight, it is bathed in near-arterial levels of oxygen, and the membranes contain high concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids, all of which are conducive to oxidative damage. Lipofuscin granules, which accumulate in the RPE throughout life, may serve as photosensitizers, initiating damage by absorbing blue light and generating singlet oxygen (an energetically excited form of oxygen) that forms other radicals. Dark sunglasses are protective. Epidemiologic studies showed that the intake of lutein and zeaxanthin in dark-green leafy vegetables (e.g., spinach, collard greens) also may be protective. Lutein and zeaxanthin accumulate in the macula and protect against free-radical damage by absorbing blue light and quenching singlet oxygen.

## 2. Ascorbic Acid

Although ascorbate (vitamin C) is an oxidation-reduction coenzyme that functions in collagen synthesis and other reactions, it also plays a role in free-radical defense. Reduced ascorbate can regenerate the reduced form of vitamin E by donating electrons in a redox cycle (Fig. 25.15). It is water-soluble and circulates unbound in blood and extracellular fluid, where it has access to the lipid-soluble vitamin E present in membranes and lipoprotein particles.

## 3. Carotenoids

Carotenoids is a term applied to $\beta$-carotene (the precursor of vitamin A) and similar compounds with functional oxygen-containing substituents on the rings, such as zeaxanthin and lutein. These compounds can exert antioxidant effects as well as quench singlet $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (singlet oxygen is a highly ROS in which there are no unpaired electrons in the outer orbitals, but there is one orbital that is completely empty). Epidemiologic studies have shown a correlation between diets that are high in fruits and vegetables and health benefits, leading to the hypothesis that carotenoids might slow the progression of cancer, atherosclerosis, and other degenerative diseases by acting as chain-breaking antioxidants. However, in clinical trials, $\beta$-carotene supplements had either no effect or an undesirable effect. Its ineffectiveness may be the result of the pro-oxidant activity of the free-radical form.

In contrast, epidemiologic studies relating the intake of lutein and zeaxanthin with decreased incidence of AMD have received progressive support. These two carotenoids are concentrated in the macula (the central portion of the retina) and are called the macular carotenoids.

## 4. Other Dietary Antioxidants

Flavonoids are a group of structurally similar compounds that contain two spatially separate aromatic rings and are found in red wine, green tea, chocolate, and other plantderived foods. Flavonoids have been hypothesized to contribute to our free-radical defenses in several ways. Some flavonoids inhibit enzymes responsible for superoxide anion production, such as xanthine oxidase. Others efficiently chelate Fe and Cu , making it impossible for these metals to participate in the Fenton reaction. They also may act as free-radical scavengers by donating electrons to superoxide or lipid peroxy radicals, or they may stabilize free radicals by complexing with them.

It is difficult to tell how much dietary flavonoids contribute to our free-radical defense system; they have a high pro-oxidant activity and are poorly absorbed. Nonetheless, we generally consume large amounts of flavonoids ( $\sim 800 \mathrm{mg} /$ day), and there is evidence that they can contribute to the maintenance of vitamin E as an antioxidant.

## 5. Endogenous Antioxidants

Several compounds that are synthesized endogenously for other functions, or as urinary excretion products, also function nonenzymatically as free-radical antioxidants. Uric acid is formed from the degradation of purines and is released into extracellular fluids, including blood, saliva, and lung lining fluid. Together with protein thiols, it

accounts for the major free-radical trapping capacity of plasma. It is particularly important in the upper airways, where there are few other antioxidants. It can directly scavenge hydroxyl radicals, oxyheme oxidants formed between the reaction of hemoglobin and peroxy radicals, and peroxy radicals themselves. Having acted as a scavenger, uric acid produces a range of oxidation products that are subsequently excreted.

Melatonin, which is a secretory product of the pineal gland, is a neurohormone that functions in regulation of our circadian rhythm, light-dark signal transduction, and sleep induction. In addition to these receptor-mediated functions, it functions as a nonenzymatic free-radical scavenger that donates an electron (as hydrogen) to "neutralize" free radicals. It also can react with ROS and RNOS to form addition products, thereby undergoing suicidal transformations. Its effectiveness is related to both its lack of pro-oxidant activity and its joint hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature, which allows it to pass through membranes and the blood-brain barrier.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

$\mathscr{P}$es
Les G. has "primary" parkinsonism. The pathogenesis of this disease is not well established and may be multifactorial (Fig. 25.16). Recent work has identified several genes, which, when mutated and inactive, lead to rare familial Parkinson disease and others that affect the risk for Parkinson disease. The major clinical disturbances in Parkinson disease are a result of dopamine depletion in the neostriatum, resulting from degeneration of dopaminergic neurons whose cell bodies reside in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The decrease in dopamine production is the result of severe degeneration of these nigrostriatal neurons. Although the agent that initiates the disease is unknown, a variety of studies support a role for free radicals in Parkinson disease (mitochondrial dysfunction), along with alterations in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of protein degradation. Within these neurons, dopamine turnover is increased, dopamine levels are lower, glutathione is decreased, and lipofuscin (Lewy bodies) is increased. Iron levels are higher, and ferritin, the storage form of iron, is lower. Furthermore, the disease is mimicked by the compound 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP ${ }^{+}$), an inhibitor of NADH:CoQ oxidoreductase that increases superoxide production in these neurons and decreases ATP production. Analysis of mitochondria from patients with Parkinson disease indicate a $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ reduction in complex I activity. The reduced ATP levels may affect the ubiquitinproteasome pathway negatively, reducing protein degradation and linking these two pathways, which can lead to Parkinson disease. Even so, it is not known whether oxidative stress makes a primary or secondary contribution to the disease process.

Drug therapy is based on the severity of the disease. Several options are available. In the early phases of the disease if symptoms are mild, a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor can be used that inhibits dopamine degradation and decreases hydrogen peroxide formation. In later stages of the disease or more symptomatic stages, patients are treated with levodopa (L-DOPA), a precursor of dopamine, sometimes in combination with the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor.

(1)Cora N. experienced angina caused by severe ischemia in the ventricular muscle of her heart. The ischemia was caused by clots that formed at the site of atherosclerotic plaques within the lumen of the coronary arteries. When TPA was infused to dissolve the clots, the ischemic area of her heart was reperfused with oxygenated blood, resulting in ischemia-reperfusion injury. In her case, the reperfusion injury resulted in some short runs of ventricular tachycardia.

During ischemia, several events occur simultaneously in cardiomyocytes. A decreased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ supply results in decreased ATP generation from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and inhibition of cardiac muscle contraction. As a consequence, cytosolic AMP levels increase, activating anaerobic glycolysis and lactic acid production. If ATP levels are inadequate to maintain $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase activity, intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$increases, resulting in cellular swelling, a further increase in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ concentration, and increases of cytosolic and subsequently mitochondrial $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ levels.

FIGURE 25.16 A model for the role of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogenoxygen species (RNOS) in neuronal degradation in Parkinson disease. (I) Dopamine levels are reduced by monoamine oxidase (MAO), which generates $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$. (2) Superoxide also can be produced by mitochondria, which superoxide dismutase (SOD) will convert to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$. Iron levels increase, which allows the Fenton reaction to proceed, generating hydroxyl radicals. (3) Nitric oxide (NO), produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase, reacts with superoxide to form RNOS. (4) The RNOS and hydroxyl radical lead to radical chain reactions that result in lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, the formation of lipofuscin, and neuronal degeneration. The end result is a reduced production and release of dopamine, which leads to the clinical symptoms observed.

The decrease in ATP and increase in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ may open the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, resulting in permanent inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. Damage to lipid membranes is further enhanced by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activation of phospholipases.

Reperfusion with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ allows recovery of oxidative phosphorylation, provided that the mitochondrial membrane has maintained some integrity and the mitochondrial transition pore can close. However, it also increases generation of free radicals. The transfer of electrons from $\mathrm{CoQ} \bullet$ to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to generate superoxide is increased. Endothelial production of superoxide by xanthine oxidase also may increase. These radicals may go on to form the hydroxyl radical, which can enhance the damage to components of the ETC and mitochondrial lipids as well as activate the mitochondrial permeability transition. As macrophages move into the area to clean up cellular debris, they may generate nitric oxide and superoxide, thus introducing peroxynitrite and other free radicals into the area. Depending on the route and timing involved, the acute results may be cell death through necrosis, with slower cell death through apoptosis in the surrounding tissue.

Currently, an intense study of ischemic insults to a variety of animal organs is underway, in an effort to discover ways of preventing reperfusion injury. These include methods designed to increase endogenous antioxidant activity, to reduce the generation of free radicals, and, finally, to develop exogenous antioxidants that, when administered before reperfusion, would prevent its injurious effects. Preconditioning tissues to hypoxia is also a viable option to reducing reperfusion injury. Each of these approaches has met with some success, but their clinical application awaits further refinement. With the growing number of invasive procedures aimed at restoring arterial blood flow through partially obstructed coronary vessels, such as clot lysis, balloon or laser angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass grafting, development of methods to prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury will become increasingly urgent.

In Cora N.'s case, oxygen was restored before permanent impairment of oxidative phosphorylation had occurred and the stage of irreversible injury was reached.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Oxidases, the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle, and Cancer. The advent of whole genome sequencing (see Chapter 17) has allowed a large number of tumor cells to be analyzed for mutations in the genome. Surprisingly, certain types of tumors contained mutations in enzymes related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (see Chapter 23). Enzymes identified include succinate dehydrogenase, which was found in familial paraganglioma cells (this mutation is a loss of activity, in which succinate will accumulate); fumarase deficiency was found in multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and exhibited autosomal dominant behavior (in this mutation, fumarate will accumulate); and certain isozymes of isocitrate dehydrogenase, in which a gain of function mutation enables the enzyme to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate instead of $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, is found in gliomas and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The accumulation of succinate, fumarate, or 2-hydroxyglutarate, in a manner described in the following paragraphs, leads to an alteration in gene expression and oxygen sensing, which, in part, leads to tumor formation.
$\alpha$-Ketoglutarate, in addition to being a key intermediate in the TCA cycle, is also required for vitamin C-dependent hydroxylation reactions (see Chapter 5). Enzymes catalyzing such reactions include $N$-methyllysine hydroxylase (the first step in demethylating histones) and methylcytosine demethylase (the first step in demethylating 5-methylcytosine, found in the promoter of genes which are usually inactivated). The reaction catalyzed by these enzymes is oxygen $+\alpha$-ketoglutarate + substrate to be hydroxylated yields succinate $+\mathrm{CO}_{2}+$ hydroxylated product.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase exists as three different isozymes: IDH1, IDH2, and IDH3. IDH3 is the mitochondrial version, requires $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, and is part of the TCA cycle. Mutations in IDH3 do not lead to tumor formation. IDH1 and IDH2 are NADP ${ }^{+}$-dependent isozymes, with IDH1 being located in the cytoplasm, and IDH2 in the mitochondria. If IDH1 or IDH2 contains a mutation that alters a key arginine

residue at the active site, the enzyme will use $\alpha$-ketoglutarate as a substrate (instead of isocitrate) and generate 2-hydroxyglutarate as the product.

As described in Chapter 16, histone methylation occurs on the $N$-terminal tails of histones and is a component of the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. These methylation events can either activate or inhibit expression of a gene, depending on the gene. The enzyme $N$-methyllysine hydroxylase is the first step in the demethylation of the tails. The methyl group becomes hydroxylated, and the carbon is then lost in the form of formaldehyde, which is picked up by the one carbon carrier tetrahydrofolate. If 2-hydroxyglutarate has accumulated, it will bind to the active site of $N$-methyllysine hydroxylase, inhibiting the enzyme, and not allowing histone demethylation to occur. Similarly, if succinate has accumulated owing to a mutation in succinate dehydrogenase or fumarase, succinate will inhibit the hydroxylation reaction because of product inhibition (recall that succinate is a product of the hydroxylase).

In a similar fashion, the removal of methyl groups from cytosine in promoter regions of genes requires an initial hydroxylation reaction (the enzyme is methylcytosine dioxygenase) which is similarly inhibited by 2-hydroxyglutarate, succinate, or fumarate. This leads to a constant state of hypermethylation of the genome, and altered gene expression. In cases of AML the methylation pattern of the genome resembles that of stem cells and not that of differentiated blood cells.

The mutations in the TCA cycle enzymes and isozymes also affect the degradation of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Under conditions of low oxygen concentration, HIF binds to DNA regulatory elements to induce genes in response to low-oxygen conditions, such as an increase in expression of glycolytic enzymes. HIF activity is regulated, in part, by proline hydroxylation (which requires $\alpha$-ketoglutarate). An inability to hydroxylate the proline residue (because of 2-hydroxyglutarate, succinate, or fumarate accumulation) leads to HIF being active for extended period of times, altering gene transcription and leading to cell proliferation.

Laboratory experiments using inhibitors of the altered IDH molecules are in progress, and drugs have been developed that are candidates for clinical trials. Some of the drugs developed led to reversal of both DNA and histone hypermethylation, and induced cellular differentiation, in cultured cells containing tumor-inducing IDH-2 mutations.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Oxygen radical generation contributes to cellular death and degeneration in a variety of diseases.
- Radical damage occurs via electron extraction from a biologic molecule, creating a chain reaction of radical propagation.
- Reactive oxygen species (ROS) include superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical.
- ROS can be produced either enzymatically or nonenzymatically.
- ROS cause damage by oxidatively damaging DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to mutations and cell death.
- Other radical species include nitric oxide (NO) and hypochlorous acid ( HOCl$)$.
- NO reacts with oxygen or superoxide to form a family of reactive nitrogen species (RNOS).
- The immune response normally produces radical species (superoxide, HOCl , NO) to destroy invading microorganisms. Escape of radicals from the immune cells during this protective event can damage surrounding tissues.
- Cellular defense mechanisms against radical damage include defense enzymes, antioxidants, and compartmentalization of free radicals.
- Cellular defense enzymes include superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase.
- Antioxidants include vitamins E and C and plant flavonoids.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 25.3.

| TABLE 35.1 | Disease Discussed in Chapter 25 |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| DISEASE OR DISORDER | ENVIRONMENTAL OR GENETIC | COMMENTS |
| Free-radical disease | Both | Damage caused to proteins and lipids owing to freeradical generation may lead to cellular dysfunction. |
| Parkinson disease | Both | Inability to convert tyrosine to DOPA; DOPA treatment can temporarily reverse tremors and other symptoms. |
| Myocardial infarction | Both | The lack of oxygen in the walls of the heart is caused by severe ischemia owing to clots forming within certain coronary arteries at the site of ruptured atherosclerotic plaques. The limited availability of oxygen to act as an electron acceptor decreases the proton motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane of ischemic cells. This leads to reduced adenosine triphosphate generation, triggering events that lead to irreversible cell injury. Further damage to the heart muscle can occur because of freeradical generation after oxygen is reintroduced to the cells that were temporarily ischemic, a process known as ischemia-reperfusion injury. |
| Chronic granulomatous disease | Genetic | This disorder occurs owing to a reduced activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, leading to a reduction in the oxidative burst by neutrophils, coupled with a dysregulated immune response to bacteria and fungi. |
| Respiratory distress syndrome of a newborn | Both | Either mutations in surfactant or lack of surfactant production in newborns; lungs have difficulty inflating and compressing. |
| Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) | Both | The familial form of ALS is caused by mutations in superoxide dismutase, leading to difficulty in disposing of superoxide radicals, which leads to cell damage owing to excessive reactive oxygen species. |
| Age-related macular degeneration | Both | Oxidative damage occurs in the retinal pigment epithelium, leading first to reduced vision and then to blindness. |

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is D. Pyridoxal phosphate is a watersoluble vitamin that is important for amino acid and glycogen metabolism but has no role in protecting against free-radical damage. Ascorbate (vitamin C), vitamin E , and $\beta$-carotene can all react with free radicals to terminate chain propagation, whereas SOD uses the superoxide radical as a substrate and converts it to hydrogen peroxide, and glutathione peroxidase removes hydrogen peroxide from the cell, converting it to water.
2. The answer is B. SOD combines two superoxide radicals to produce hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. None of the other reactions is correct.
3. The answer is C. Vitamin E donates an electron and proton to the radical, thereby converting the radical to a stable form $(\mathrm{LOO} \bullet \rightarrow \mathrm{LOOH})$. The vitamin thus prevents the free radical from oxidizing another compound by extracting an H from that compound and propagating a free-radical chain reaction. The radical form of vita$\min \mathrm{E}$ generated is relatively stable and actually donates another electron and proton to a second free radical, forming oxidized vitamin E.
4. The answer is B. The Fenton reaction is the nonenzymatic donation of an electron from $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ to produce $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, the hydroxyl radical, and hydroxide ion. Only $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ or $\mathrm{Cu}^{1+}$ can be used in this reaction; thus, the other answers are incorrect.
5. The answer is E. Histones coat nuclear DNA and protect it from damage by radicals. Mitochondrial DNA lacks histones, so when radicals are formed, the DNA can be easily oxidized. Answers A and B are nonsensical; SOD reduces radical concentrations, so the fact that it is present in the mitochondria should help to protect the DNA from damage, not enhance it. Glutathione also protects against radical damage, and if the nucleus lacks it, then one would expect higher levels of nuclear DNA damage, not reduced levels. ROS can diffuse across membranes, so answers C and D are incorrect. Other factors that increase mitochondrial DNA damage relative to nuclear DNA are the proximity of mitochondrial DNA to the membrane, and the fact that most radical species are formed from CoQ , which is found within the mitochondria.
6. The answer is A. The familial form of chronic granulomatous disease is caused by reduced activity of NADPH

oxidase, which generates superoxide from oxygen during the respiratory burst in neutrophils, designed to destroy engulfed bacteria. Once superoxide is generated, other oxygen radicals can be generated (such as hydrogen peroxide), but the generation of superoxide is the primary event. Hypochlorous acid is also generated during the respiratory burst, but the enzyme required is myeloperoxidase, which is not defective in chronic granulomatous disease. Nitric oxide is generated by nitric oxide synthase and is not mutated in chronic granulomatous disease. Reduced glutathione is the protective form of glutathione and can be generated using glutathione peroxidase or glutathione reductase, neither of which is defective in chronic granulomatous disease.
7. The answer is E. The familial form of ALS (Lou Gehrig disease) is caused by an inherited mutation in SOD. In the absence of SOD, increased oxidative damage is possible to the neurons because of the accumulation of superoxide, the substrate for SOD. Catalase will reduce hydrogen peroxide levels, whereas glutathione peroxidase will convert reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione, using hydrogen peroxide as an electron donor. Nitric oxide does not accumulate in Lou Gehrig disease. The hydroxyl radical may accumulate because of the accumulation of superoxide, but the hydroxyl radical is not the direct cause of the disease.
8. The answer is E. RNOS are involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson and in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Although RNOS has a minor role in neutrophils (bacterial infections), ROS are strongly involved in fungal and viral infections as well as ischemic heart disease and infertility.
9. The answer is C. Most xenobiotics (e.g., alcohol, medications, other chemicals) induce the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes to metabolize the xenobiotic. During the reactions catalyzed by this family of enzymes, free radicals are sometimes generated and released from the enzyme complex, which can lead to intracellular protein and lipid damage. The ingestion of alcohol, medications, and other chemicals do not increase the frequency of oxygen reacting with CoQ , nor do they induce oxidases in peroxisomes or produce ionizing radiation. Hydrogen peroxide is not produced in the manufacturing of alcohol, most medications, or most chemicals.
10. The answer is A. Vitamins C and E and perhaps A act as antioxidants. Citrus fruits are high in vitamin C. Enriched bread is high in niacin and folate. Fortified dairy products are high in vitamin D (although raw milk is not), and green leafy vegetables are high in vitamin K and folate. Energy drinks usually have sugar, caffeine, and B vitamins.

# Formation and Degradation of Glycogen 

Glycogen is the storage form of glucose found in most types of cells. It is composed of glucosyl units linked by $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-1,4-glycosidic bonds, with $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-1,6-branches occurring roughly every 8 to 10 glucosyl units (Fig. 26.1). The liver and skeletal muscle contain the largest glycogen stores.

The formation of glycogen from glucose is an energy-requiring pathway that begins, like most of glucose metabolism, with the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate. Glycogen synthesis from glucose 6-phosphate involves the formation of uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) and the transfer of glucosyl units from UDP-glucose to the ends of the glycogen chains by the enzyme glycogen synthase. Once the chains reach approximately II glucosyl units, a branching enzyme moves 6 to 8 units to form an $\alpha-(1,6)$-branch.

Glycogenolysis, the pathway for glycogen degradation, is not the reverse of the biosynthetic pathway. The degradative enzyme glycogen phosphorylase removes glucosyl units one at a time from the ends of the glycogen chains, converting them to glucose 1-phosphate without resynthesizing UDP-glucose or uridine triphosphate (UTP). A debranching enzyme removes the glucosyl residues near each branch point.

Liver glycogen serves as a source of blood glucose. To generate glucose, the glucose 1-phosphate produced from glycogen degradation is converted to glucose 6-phosphate. Glucose 6-phosphatase, an enzyme found only in liver and kidney, converts glucose 6-phosphate to free glucose, which then enters the blood.
![ma136181198a6](ma136181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 26.1 Glycogen structure. Glycogen is composed of glucosyl units linked by $\alpha-1,4$-glycosidic bonds and $\alpha-1,6$-glycosidic bonds. The branches occur more frequently in the center of the molecule and less frequently in the periphery. The anomeric carbon that is not attached to another glucosyl residue (the reducing end) is attached to the protein glycogenin by a glycosidic bond. The hydrogen atoms have been omitted from this figure for clarity.

Glycogen synthesis and degradation are regulated in liver by hormonal changes that signal the need for blood glucose (see Chapter 19). The body maintains fasting blood glucose levels at approximately $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ to ensure that the brain and other tissues that are dependent on glucose for the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) have a continuous supply. The lack of dietary glucose, signaled by a decrease of the insulin/glucagon ratio, activates liver glycogenolysis and inhibits glycogen synthesis. Epinephrine, which signals an increased use of blood glucose and other fuels for exercise or emergency situations, also activates liver glycogenolysis. The hormones that regulate liver glycogen metabolism work principally through changes in the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase in the biosynthetic pathway and glycogen phosphorylase in the degradative pathway.

In skeletal muscle, glycogen supplies glucose 6-phosphate for ATP synthesis in the glycolytic pathway. Muscle glycogen phosphorylase is stimulated during exercise by the increase of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), an allosteric activator of the enzyme, and also by phosphorylation. The phosphorylation is stimulated by calcium released during contraction and by epinephrine, the fight-on-flight hormone. Glycogen synthesis is activated in resting muscles by the elevation of insulin after carbohydrate ingestion.

The neonate must rapidly adapt to an intermittent fuel supply after birth. Once the umbilical cord is clamped, the supply of glucose from the maternal circulation is interrupted. The combined effect of epinephrine and glucagon on the liver glycogen stores of the neonate rapidly restores glucose levels to normal.

# THE WAITING ROOM 

A newborn baby girl, Gretchen C., was born after a 38-week gestation. Her 36-year-old mother developed a significant viral infection that resulted in a prolonged severe loss of appetite with nausea in the month preceding delivery, leading to minimal food intake. Fetal bradycardia (slower than normal fetal heart rate) was detected at the end of each uterine contraction of labor, a sign of possible fetal distress, and the baby was delivered emergently.

At birth, Gretchen was cyanotic (a bluish discoloration caused by a lack of adequate oxygenation of tissues) and limp. She responded to several minutes of assisted ventilation. Her Apgar score of 3 was low at 1 minute after birth, but it improved to a score of 7 at 5 minutes. The Apgar score is an objective estimate of the overall condition of the newborn, determined at both 1 and 5 minutes after birth. A score of 7,8 , or 9 is normal. The highest score of 10 is less common.

Physical examination in the nursery at 10 minutes showed a thin, malnourished female newborn. Her body temperature was slightly low, her heart rate was rapid, and her respiratory rate of 55 breaths/minute was elevated. Gretchen's birth weight was only $2,100 \mathrm{~g}$, compared with a normal value of $>2,500 \mathrm{~g}$. Her length was 47 cm , and her head circumference was 33 cm (low normal). The laboratory reported that Gretchen's serum glucose level when she was unresponsive was $14 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. A glucose value $<40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(2.5 \mathrm{mM})$ is considered to be abnormal in newborn infants.

At 5 hours of age, she was apneic (not breathing) and unresponsive. Ventilatory resuscitation was initiated and a cannula placed in the umbilical vein. Blood for a glucose level was drawn through this cannula, and 5 mL of a $20 \%$ glucose solution was injected. Gretchen slowly responded to this therapy.

Jim B.'s treadmill exercise and most other types of moderate exercise involving whole-body movement (running, skiing, dancing, tennis) increase the use of blood glucose and other fuels by skeletal muscles. The blood glucose is normally supplied by the stimulation of liver glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

[^0]:    (1) Jim B., a 19-year-old body builder, was rushed to the hospital emergency department in a coma. One-half hour earlier, his mother had heard a loud crashing sound in the basement where Jim had been lifting weights and completing his daily workout on the treadmill. She found her son on the floor having severe jerking movements of all muscles (a grand mal seizure).

    In the emergency department, the doctors learned that despite the objections of his family and friends, Jim regularly used androgens, other anabolic steroids, and insulin in an effort to bulk up his muscle mass.

On initial physical examination, he was comatose, with occasional involuntary jerking movements of his extremities. Foamy saliva dripped from his mouth. He had bitten his tongue and had lost bowel and bladder control at the height of the seizure.

The laboratory reported a serum glucose level of $18 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (extremely low). The intravenous infusion of $5 \%$ glucose ( 5 g of glucose per 100 mL of solution), which had been started earlier, was increased to $10 \%$. In addition, 50 g of glucose was given over 30 seconds through the intravenous tubing.

## I. Structure of Glycogen

Glycogen, the storage form of glucose, is a branched glucose polysaccharide composed of chains of glucosyl units linked by $\alpha-1,4$-bonds with $\alpha-1,6$-branches every 8 to 10 residues (see Fig. 26.1). In a molecule of this highly branched structure, only one glucosyl residue has an anomeric carbon that is not linked to another glucose residue. This anomeric carbon at the beginning of the chain is attached to the protein glycogenin. The other ends of the chains are called nonreducing ends (see Chapter 5). The branched structure permits rapid degradation and rapid synthesis of glycogen because enzymes can work on several chains simultaneously from the multiple nonreducing ends.

Glycogen is present in tissues as polymers of very high molecular weight ( $10^{7}$ to $10^{8} \mathrm{Da}$ ) collected together in glycogen particles. The enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and degradation and some of the regulatory enzymes are bound to the surface of the glycogen particles.

## II. Function of Glycogen in Skeletal Muscle and Liver

Glycogen is found in most cell types, where it serves as a reservoir of glucosyl units for ATP generation from glycolysis.

Glycogen is degraded mainly to glucose 1-phosphate (glucose 1-P), which is converted to glucose 6-phosphate (glucose 6-P). In skeletal muscle and other cell types, glucose 6-P enters the glycolytic pathway (Fig. 26.2). Glycogen is an extremely important fuel source for skeletal muscle when ATP demands are high and when glucose 6-P is used rapidly in anaerobic glycolysis. In many other cell types, the small glycogen reservoir serves a similar purpose; it is an emergency fuel source that supplies glucose for the generation of ATP in the absence of oxygen or during restricted blood flow. In general, glycogenolysis and glycolysis are activated together in these cells.

Glycogen serves a very different purpose in liver than in skeletal muscle and other tissues (see Fig. 26.2). Liver glycogen is the first and immediate source of glucose for the maintenance of blood glucose levels. In the liver, the glucose 6-P that is generated from glycogen degradation is hydrolyzed to glucose by glucose 6-phosphatase, an enzyme that is present only in the liver and kidneys. Glycogen degradation thus provides a readily mobilized source of blood glucose as dietary glucose decreases or as exercise increases the use of blood glucose by muscles.

The pathways of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver both supply blood glucose, and, consequently, these two pathways are activated together by glucagon. Gluconeogenesis, the synthesis of glucose from amino acids and other gluconeogenic precursors (discussed in detail in Chapter 28), also forms glucose 6-P, so that glucose 6-phosphatase serves as a "gateway" to the blood for both pathways (see Fig. 26.2).

Regulation of glycogen synthesis serves to prevent futile cycling and waste of ATP. Futile cycling (or substrate cycling) refers to a situation in which a substrate is converted to a product through one pathway, and the product is converted back to the substrate through another pathway. Because the biosynthetic pathway is

FIGURE 26.2 Glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle and liver. Glycogen stores serve different functions in muscle cells and liver. In the muscle and most other cell types, glycogen stores serve as a fuel source for the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In the liver, glycogen stores serve as a source of blood glucose.

energy-requiring, futile cycling results in a waste of high-energy phosphate bonds. Thus, glycogen synthesis is activated when glycogen degradation is inhibited, and vice versa.

# III. Synthesis and Degradation of Glycogen 

Glycogen synthesis, like almost all the pathways of glucose metabolism, begins with the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-P by hexokinase or, in the liver, glucokinase (Fig. 26.3). Glucose 6-P is the precursor of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and pathways for the synthesis of other sugars. In the pathway for glycogen synthesis, glucose 6-P is converted to glucose 1-P by phosphoglucomutase, a reversible reaction.

Glycogen is both formed from and degraded to glucose 1-P, but the biosynthetic and degradative pathways are separate and involve different enzymes (see Fig. 26.3). The biosynthetic pathway is an energy-requiring pathway; high-energy phosphate from UTP is used to activate the glucosyl residues to UDP-glucose (Fig. 26.4). In the degradative pathway, the glycosidic bonds between the glucosyl residues in glycogen are simply cleaved by the addition of phosphate to produce glucose 1-P (or water to produce free glucose), and UDP-glucose is not resynthesized. The existence of separate pathways for the formation and degradation of important compounds is a common theme in metabolism. Because the synthesis and degradation pathways use different enzymes, one can be activated while the other is inhibited.

(S2) Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose (UDP-G) is synthesized from glucose 1-phosphate (glucose 1-P). UDP-glucose is the branch point for glycogen synthesis and other pathways that require the addition of carbohydrate units.

Pyrophosphate ( $\mathrm{PP}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ), released by the reaction, is cleaved to two inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$.

# A. Glycogen Synthesis 

Glycogen synthesis requires the formation of $\alpha-1,4$-glycosidic bonds to link glucosyl residues in long chains and the formation of an $\alpha-1,6$-branch every 8 to 10 residues (Fig. 26.5). Most of glycogen synthesis occurs through the lengthening of the polysaccharide chains of a preexisting glycogen molecule (a glycogen primer) in which the reducing end of the glycogen is attached to the protein glycogenin. To lengthen the glycogen chains, glucosyl residues are added from UDP-glucose to the nonreducing ends of the chain by glycogen synthase. The anomeric carbon of each glucosyl residue is attached in an $\alpha-1,4$-bond to the hydroxyl on carbon 4 of the terminal glucosyl residue. When the chain reaches approximately 11 residues in length, a 6 - to 8 -residue piece is cleaved by amylo-4,6-transferase (also known as branching enzyme) and reattached to a glucosyl unit by an $\alpha-1,6$-bond. Both chains continue to lengthen until they are long enough to produce two new branches. This process continues, producing highly branched molecules. Glycogen synthase, the enzyme that attaches the glucosyl residues in $\alpha-1,4$-bonds, is the regulated step in the pathway. Branching of glycogen serves two major roles: increased sites for synthesis and degradation, and enhancing the solubility of the molecule.

The synthesis of new glycogen primer molecules also occurs. Glycogenin, the protein to which glycogen is attached, glycosylates itself (autoglycosylation) by attaching the glucosyl residue of UDP-glucose to the hydroxyl side chain of a serine residue in the protein. The protein then extends the carbohydrate chain (using UDP-glucose as the substrate) until the glucosyl chain is long enough to serve as a substrate for glycogen synthase.

## B. Glycogen Degradation

Glycogen is degraded by two enzymes, glycogen phosphorylase and the debrancher enzyme (Fig. 26.6). Glycogen degradation is a phosphorolysis reaction (breaking of a bond using a phosphate ion as a nucleophile). Enzymes that catalyze phosphorolysis reactions are named phosphorylase. Because more than one type of phosphorylase exists, the substrate usually is included in the name of the enzyme, such as glycogen phosphorylase or purine nucleoside phosphorylase.

The enzyme glycogen phosphorylase starts at the nonreducing end of a chain and successively cleaves glucosyl residues by adding phosphate to the anomeric carbon of the terminal glycosidic bond, thereby releasing glucose 1-P and producing a free $4^{\prime}$-hydroxyl group on the glucose residue now at the end of the glycogen chain. However, glycogen phosphorylase cannot act on the glycosidic bonds of the four glucosyl residues closest to a branch point because the branching chain sterically hinders a proper fit into the catalytic site of the enzyme. The debrancher enzyme,

A genetic defect of lysosomal glucosidase, called type II glycogen storage disease, or Pompe disease, leads to the accumulation of glycogen particles in large, membrane-endosed residual bodies, which disrupt the function of liver and muscle cells. The disorder can be treated with enzyme replacement therapy (Lumizyme [alglucosidase alfa], Sanofi Gerzyme, Cambridge, MA), which requires periodic enzyme infusions for the life of the patient. In the absence of treatment, the disorder is fatal.
which catalyzes the removal of the four residues closest to the branch point, has two catalytic activities: It acts as a transferase and as an $\alpha-1,6$-glucosidase. As a transferase, the debrancher first removes a unit containing three glucose residues and adds it to the end of a longer chain by an $\alpha-1,4$-glycosidic bond. The one glucosyl residue remaining at the $\alpha-1,6$-branch is hydrolyzed by the amylo-1,6-glucosidase activity of the debrancher, resulting in the release of free glucose. Thus, one glucose and approximately seven to nine glucose 1-P residues are released for every branchpoint.

Some degradation of glycogen also occurs within lysosomes when glycogen particles become surrounded by membranes that then fuse with the lysosomal membranes. A lysosomal $\alpha$-glucosidase hydrolyzes this glycogen to glucose.

In order to confirm a diagnosis of phosphorylase deficiency (in either muscle or liver), a biopsy must be obtained, followed by a sensitive assay for phosphorylase activity within the biopsied tissue. There are several procedures to do this. The first is to incubate glycogen, inorganic phosphate, and a sample of the extracted biopsy tissue. If phosphorylase activity is present, glucose 1-P will be produced. One can determine the amount of glucose 1-P produced by converting it to glucose 6-P, using the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. The glucose 6-P levels are then measured by the conversion of glucose 6-P to 6-phosphogluconate using the enzyme glucose 6-P dehydrogenase. Glucose 6-P dehydrogenase requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADP+), generating NADPH during the course of the reaction. The formation of NADPH can be followed spectrophotometrically as the absorbance at 340 rm will increase as NADPH is produced, and the increase in NADPH levels will be directly proportional to the amount of glucose 1-P produced by phosphorylase. A second assay to measure phosphorylase activity uses radioactive glycogen as a substrate. The labeled glycogen is incubated with inorganic phosphate and sample extract, generating labeled glucose 1-P. The radioactive glucose 1-P is then separated from the glycogen and measured. A variation of this method is to use ${ }^{32} \mathrm{P}$-labeled inorganic phosphate and measure the radioactive glucose 1-P produced. A third assay for phosphorylase activity is to measure the reverse reaction (glycogen synthesis). Under appropriate conditions, the phosphorylase reaction can go backward, in which the glucose residue from glucose 1-P is added to an existing glycogen chain, releasing inorganic phosphate. The phosphate produced using this method is then measured in a sensitive spectrophotometric assay.

# IV. Disorders of Glycogen Metabolism 

A series of inborn errors of metabolism, the glycogen storage diseases, result from deficiencies in the enzymes of glycogenolysis (Table 26.1). The diseases are labeled I through XI, and O. Several disorders have different subtypes, as indicated in the legend to Table 26.1. Glycogen phosphorylase, the key regulatory enzyme of glycogen degradation, is encoded by different genes in the muscle and liver (tissuespecific isozymes), and thus, a person may have a defect in one and not the other.

Why do you think that a genetic deficiency in muscle glycogen phosphorylase (McArdle disease) is a mere inconvenience, whereas a deficiency of liver glycogen phosphorylase (Hers disease) can be lethal?

## V. Regulation of Glycogen Synthesis and Degradation

The regulation of glycogen synthesis in different tissues matches the function of glycogen in each tissue. Liver glycogen serves principally for the support of blood glucose during fasting or during extreme need (e.g., exercise), and the degradative and biosynthetic pathways are regulated principally by changes in the insulin/ glucagon ratio and by blood glucose levels, which reflect the availability of dietary

Muscle glycogen is used within the muscle to support exercise. Thus, an individual with McArdle disease (type V glycogen storage disease) experiences no symptoms except unusual fatigue and muscle cramps during exercise. These symptoms may be accompanied by myoglobinuria and release of muscle creatine kinase into the blood.

Liver glycogen is the first reservoir for the support of blood glucose levels, and a deficiency in glycogen phosphorylase or any of the other enzymes of liver glycogen degradation can result in fasting hypoglycemia. The hypoglycemia is usually mild because patients can still synthesize glucose from gluconeogenesis (see Table 26.1).

Maternal blood glucose readily crosses the placenta to enter the fetal circulation. During the last 9 or 10 weeks of gestation, glycogen formed from maternal glucose is deposited in the fetal liver under the influence of the insulin-dominated hormonal milieu of that period. At birth, maternal glucose supplies cease, causing a temporary physiologic drop in glucose levels in the newborn's blood, even in normal healthy infants. This drop serves as one of the signals for glucagon release from the newborn's pancreas, which, in turn, stimulates glycogenolysis. As a result, the glucose levels in the newborn return to normal.

Healthy full-term babies have adequate stores of liver glycogen to survive short periods ( 12 hours) of caloric deprivation provided that other aspects of fuel metabolism are normal. Because
Gretchen C.'s mother was markedly anorexic during the critical period when the fetal liver is normally synthesizing glycogen from glucose supplied in the maternal blood. Gretchen's liver glycogen stores were below normal. Thus, because fetal glycogen is the major source of fuel for the newborn in the early hours of life, Gretchen became profoundly hypoglycemic within 5 hours of birth because of her low levels of stored carbohydrate.

glucose (Table 26.2). Degradation of liver glycogen is also activated by epinephrine, which is released in response to exercise, hypoglycemia, or other stress situations in which there is an immediate demand for blood glucose. In contrast, in skeletal muscles, glycogen is a reservoir of glucosyl units for the generation of ATP from glycolysis and glucose oxidation. As a consequence, muscle glycogenolysis is regulated principally by AMP, which signals a lack of ATP, and by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ released during contraction. Epinephrine, which is released in response to exercise and other stress situations, also activates skeletal muscle glycogenolysis. The glycogen stores of resting muscle decrease very little during fasting.

## A. Regulation of Glycogen Metabolism in Liver

Liver glycogen is synthesized after a carbohydrate meal when blood glucose levels are elevated, and it is degraded as blood glucose levels decrease. When an individual eats a carbohydrate-containing meal, blood glucose levels immediately increase, insulin levels increase, and glucagon levels decrease (see Fig. 19.8). The increase of blood glucose levels and the rise of the insulin/glucagon ratio inhibit glycogen degradation and stimulate glycogen synthesis. The immediate increased transport of glucose into peripheral tissues, and storage of blood glucose as glycogen helps to bring circulating blood glucose levels back to the normal range, 80 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, of the fasted state. As the length of time after a carbohydrate-containing meal increases, insulin levels decrease and glucagon levels increase. The fall of the insulin/ glucagon ratio results in inhibition of the biosynthetic pathway and activation of the degradative pathway. As a result, liver glycogen is rapidly degraded to glucose, which is released into the blood.

Although glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are activated together by the same regulatory mechanisms, glycogenolysis responds more rapidly, with a greater outpouring of glucose. A substantial proportion of liver glycogen is degraded within the first few hours after eating ( $30 \%$ after 4 hours) (Table 26.3). The rate

| TABLE 26.3 Effect of Fasting on Liver Glycogen Content in Humans |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| LENGTH OF FAST (h) | GLYCOGEN CONTENT <br> ( $\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{g}$ liver) | RATE OF GLYCOGENOLYSIS <br> ( $\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{kg}-\mathrm{min}$ ) |

| 24 | 42 | 1.7 |

of glycogenolysis decreases significantly in a prolonged fast as the liver glycogen supplies dwindle. Liver glycogen stores are therefore a rapidly rebuilt and degraded store of glucose, ever responsive to small and rapid changes of blood glucose levels.

## 1. Nomenclature of Enzymes Metabolizing Glycogen

Both glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase will be covalently modified to regulate their activity. When activated by covalent modification, glycogen phosphorylase is referred to as glycogen phosphorylase a (remember a for active); when the covalent modification is removed and the enzyme is inactive, it is referred to as glycogen phosphorylase b. Glycogen synthase, when it is not covalently modified, is active and can be designated glycogen synthase a or glycogen synthase I (the $I$ stands for independent of modifiers for activity). When glycogen synthase is covalently modified, it is inactive, in the form of glycogen synthase $b$ or glycogen synthase $D$ (for dependent on a modifier for activity).

## 2. Regulation of Liver Glycogen Metabolism by Insulin and Glucagon

Insulin and glucagon regulate liver glycogen metabolism by changing the phosphorylation state of glycogen phosphorylase in the degradative pathway and glycogen synthase in the biosynthetic pathway. An increase of glucagon and decrease of insulin during the fasting state initiates a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-directed phosphorylation cascade, which results in the phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase to an active enzyme and the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase to an inactive enzyme (Fig. 26.7). As a consequence, glycogen degradation is stimulated and glycogen synthesis is inhibited.

## 3. Activation of a Phosphorylation Cascade by Glucagon

Glucagon regulates glycogen metabolism through its intracellular second messenger cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) (see Chapter 19). Glucagon, by binding to its cell membrane receptor, transmits a signal through G-proteins that activates adenylate cyclase, causing cAMP levels to increase (see Fig. 26.7). cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits of PKA, which dissociate from the catalytic subunits. The catalytic subunits of PKA are activated by the dissociation and phosphorylate the enzyme phosphorylase kinase, activating it. Phosphorylase kinase is the protein kinase that converts the inactive liver glycogen phosphorylase b to the active glycogen phosphorylase a by transferring a phosphate from ATP to a specific serine residue on the phosphorylase subunits. The addition of the phosphate triggers a conformational change in the enzyme, thereby activating it. As a result of the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, glycogenolysis is stimulated.

## 4. Inhibition of Glycogen Synthase by Glucagon-Directed Phosphorylation

When glycogen degradation is activated by the cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation cascade, glycogen synthesis is simultaneously inhibited. The enzyme glycogen synthase is also phosphorylated by PKA, but this phosphorylation results in a less active form, glycogen synthase b.

0A a patient was diagnosed as an infant with type III glycogen storage disease, a deficiency of debrancher enzyme (see Table 26.1). The patient had hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver) and experienced bouts of mild hypoglycemia. To diagnose the disease, glycogen was obtained from the patient's liver by biopsy after the patient had fasted overnight and was compared with normal glycogen. The glycogen samples were treated with a preparation of commercial glycogen phosphorylase and commercial debrancher enzyme. The amounts of glucose I-P and glucose produced in the assay were then measured. The ratio of glucose I-P to glucose for the normal glycogen sample was $9: 1$, and the ratio for the patient was 31 . Can you explain these results?

FIGURE 26.7 Regulation of glycogen synthesis and degradation in the liver. (I) Glucagon binding to the serpentine glucagon receptor or epinephrine binding to a serpentine $\beta$-receptor in the liver activates adenylate cyclase, via G-proteins, which synthesizes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). (2) cAMP binds to protein kinase A (PKA; cAMP-dependent protein kinase), thereby activating the catalytic subunits. (3) PKA activates phosphorylase kinase by phosphorylation. (4) Phosphorylase kinase adds a phosphate to specific serine residues on glycogen phosphorylase $b$, thereby converting it to the active glycogen phosphorylase a. (5) PKA also phosphorylates glycogen synthase, thereby decreasing its activity.

The red dashed lines denote reactions that are decreased in the livers of fasting individuals. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate; $U D P$, uridine diphosphate.

(3)With a deficiency of debrancher enzyme but normal levels of glycogen phosphorylase, the glycogen chains of the patient could be degraded in vivo only to within four residues of the branch point. When the glycogen samples were treated with the commercial preparation containing normal enzymes, one glucose residue was released for each $\alpha-1,6$-branch. However, in the patient's glycogen sample, with the short outer branches, three glucose I-Ps and one glucose residue were obtained for each $\alpha-1,6$-branch. Normal glycogen has 8 to 10 glucosyl residues per branch and thus gives a ratio of approximately 9 mol of glucose I-P to I mol of glucose.

The phosphorylation of glycogen synthase is far more complex than glycogen phosphorylase. Glycogen synthase has multiple phosphorylation sites and is acted on by up to 10 different protein kinases. Phosphorylation by PKA does not, by itself, inactivate glycogen synthase. Instead, phosphorylation by PKA facilitates the subsequent addition of phosphate groups by other kinases, and these inactivate the enzyme. A term that has been applied to changes of activity resulting from multiple phosphorylations is hierarchical or synergistic phosphorylation; the phosphorylation of one site makes another site more reactive and easier to phosphorylate by a different protein kinase.

Most of the enzymes that are regulated by phosphorylation have multiple phosphorylation sites. Glycogen phosphorylase, which has only one serine per subunit and can be phosphorylated only by phosphorylase kinase, is the exception. For some enzymes, the phosphorylation sites are antagonistic, and phosphorylation initiated by one hormone counteracts the effects of other hormones. For other enzymes, the phosphorylation sites are synergistic, and phosphorylation at one site stimulated by one hormone can act synergistically with phosphorylation at another site.

## 5. Regulation by Protein Phosphatases

At the same time that PKA and phosphorylase kinase are adding phosphate groups to enzymes, the protein phosphatases that remove this phosphate are inhibited. Protein phosphatases remove the phosphate groups, bound to serine or other residues of enzymes, by hydrolysis. Hepatic protein phosphatase 1 (hepatic PP-1), one of the major protein phosphatases involved in glycogen metabolism, removes phosphate groups from phosphorylase kinase, glycogen phosphorylase, and glycogen synthase. During fasting, hepatic PP-1 is inactivated by several mechanisms. One is dissociation from the glycogen particle, such that the substrates are no longer available to the phosphatase. A second is the binding of inhibitor proteins, such as the protein called inhibitor-1, which, when phosphorylated by a glucagon (or epinephrine)-directed mechanism, binds to and inhibits phosphatase action. Insulin indirectly activates hepatic PP-1 through its own signal transduction cascade initiated at the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase.

PP-1 will bind to proteins that target the phosphatase to glycogen particles. There are four such targeting proteins: $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{M}}, \mathrm{G}_{1}, \mathrm{R} 6$, and R5/PTG (protein targeting to glycogen). $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{M}}$ is found in the heart and skeletal muscle, $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is found primarily in the liver, whereas R5/PTG and R6 are found in most tissues. The targeting subunits all bind to the same hydrophobic site on PP-1, leading to just one targeting subunit bound per PP-1 molecule. The targeting subunits allow for compartmentalized activation of PP-1 under the appropriate conditions, whereas other tissues, or cellular compartments, may still express an inhibited PP-1. Regulation of the phosphatase involves complex interactions between the target enzymes, the targeting subunits, the phosphatase, and protein inhibitor 1 and will not be considered further.

## 6. Insulin in Liver Glycogen Metabolism

Insulin is antagonistic to glucagon in the degradation and synthesis of glycogen. The glucose level in the blood is the signal that controls the secretion of insulin and glucagon. Glucose stimulates insulin release and suppresses glucagon release; after a high-carbohydrate meal, one increases while the other decreases. However, insulin levels in the blood change to a greater degree with the fasting-feeding cycle than do the glucagon levels, and thus, insulin is considered the principal regulator of glycogen synthesis and degradation. The role of insulin in glycogen metabolism is often overlooked because the mechanisms by which insulin reverses all of the effects of glucagon on individual metabolic enzymes is still under investigation. In addition to the activation of hepatic PP-1 through the insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation cascade, insulin may activate the phosphodiesterase that converts cAMP to AMP, thereby decreasing cAMP levels and inactivating PKA. Regardless of the mechanisms involved, insulin is able to reverse all of the effects of glucagon and is the most important hormonal regulator of blood glucose levels.

## 7. Blood Glucose Levels and Glycogen Synthesis and Degradation

When an individual eats a high-carbohydrate meal, glycogen degradation immediately stops. Although the changes in insulin and glucagon levels are relatively rapid ( 10 to 15 minutes), the direct inhibitory effect of rising glucose levels on glycogen degradation is even more rapid. Glucose, as an allosteric effector, inhibits liver glycogen phosphorylase a by stimulating dephosphorylation of this enzyme. As insulin levels rise and glucagon levels fall, cAMP levels decrease and PKA reassociates with its inhibitory subunits and becomes inactive. The protein phosphatases are activated, and phosphorylase a and glycogen synthase D are dephosphorylated. The collective result of these effects is rapid inhibition of glycogen degradation and rapid activation of glycogen synthesis.

## 8. Epinephrine and Calcium in the Regulation of Liver Glycogen

Epinephrine, the fight-or-flight hormone, is released from the adrenal medulla in response to neural signals reflecting an increased demand for glucose. To flee from a dangerous

0Most of the enzymes that are regulated by phosphorylation also can be converted to the active conformation by allosteric effectors. Glycogen synthase b, the less active form of glycogen synthase, can be activated by the accumulation of glucose $6-P$ above physiologic levels. The activation of glycogen synthase by glucose $6-P$ may be important in individuals with glucose 6-phosphatase deficiency, a disorder known as type I or von Gerke glycogen storage disease (see Table 26.1). When glucose 6-P produced from gluconeogenesis accumulates in the liver, it activates glycogen synthesis even though the individual may be hypoglycemic and have low insulin levels. Glucose I-P is also elevated, resulting in the inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase. As a consequence, large glycogen deposits accumulate in certain tissues, including the liver, and hepatomegaly occurs.

0An inability of liver and muscle to store glucose as glycogen contributes to the hyperglycemia in patients, such as
Dianne A. with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in patients, such as Deborah S., with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The absence of insulin in patients with type I diabetes mellitus and the high levels of glucagon result in decreased activity of glycogen synthase. Glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscles of type I patients is also limited by the lack of insulinstimulated glucose transport. Insulin resistance in type 2 patients has the same effect.

An injection of insulin suppresses glucagon release and alters the insulin/glucagon ratio. The result is rapid uptake of glucose into skeletal muscle and rapid conversion of glucose to glycogen in skeletal muscle and liver.

In the neonate, the release of epinephrine during labor and birth normally contributes to restoring blood glucose levels. Unfortunately, Gretchen C. did not have adequate liver glycogen stores to support a rise in her blood glucose levels.
situation, skeletal muscles use increased amounts of blood glucose to generate ATP. As a result, liver glycogenolysis must be stimulated. In the liver, epinephrine stimulates glycogenolysis through two different types of receptors, the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-agonist receptors.

## a. Epinephrine Acting at $\beta$-Receptors

Epinephrine, acting at the $\beta$-receptors, transmits a signal through G-proteins to adenylate cyclase, which increases cAMP and activates PKA. Hence, regulation of glycogen degradation and synthesis in liver by epinephrine and glucagon are similar (see Fig. 26.7).

## b. Epinephrine Acting at $\alpha$-Receptors

Epinephrine also binds to $\alpha$-receptors in the hepatocyte. This binding activates glycogenolysis and inhibits glycogen synthesis principally by increasing the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ levels in the liver. The effects of epinephrine at the $\alpha$-agonist receptor are mediated by the phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{PIP}_{2}\right)-\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signal transduction system, one of the principal intracellular second-messenger systems used by many hormones (Fig. 26.8) (see Chapter 11).

In the $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}-\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signal transduction system, the signal is transferred from the epinephrine receptor to membrane-bound phospholipase C by G-proteins. Phospholipase C hydrolyzes $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ to form diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right) . \mathrm{IP}_{3}$ stimulates the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the endoplasmic reticulum. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and DAG activate protein kinase C. The amount of calcium bound to one of the calciumbinding proteins, calmodulin, is also increased.
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin associates as a subunit with several enzymes and modifies their activities. It binds to inactive phosphorylase kinase, thereby partially activating this enzyme. (The fully activated enzyme is both bound to the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin subunit and phosphorylated.) Phosphorylase kinase then phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase b, thereby activating glycogen degradation. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin is also a modifier protein that activates one of the glycogen synthase kinases $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right.$-calmodulin synthase kinase). Protein kinase C, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin synthase kinase, and phosphorylase kinase all phosphorylate glycogen synthase at different serine residues on the enzyme, thereby inhibiting glycogen synthase and thus glycogen synthesis.
![ma143181198a6](ma143181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 26.8 Regulation of glycogen synthesis and degradation by epinephrine and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. (I) The effect of epinephrine binding to $\alpha$-agonist receptors in liver transmits a signal via G-proteins to phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{PIP}_{2}\right)$ to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$. (2) $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ stimulates the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the endoplasmic reticulum. (3) $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to the modifier protein calmodulin, which activates calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and phosphorylase kinase. Both $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and DAG activate protein kinase C . (4) These three kinases phosphorylate glycogen synthase at different sites and decrease its activity. (5) Phosphorylase kinase phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase b to the active form. It therefore activates glycogenolysis as well as inhibiting glycogen synthesis. GTP, guanosine triphosphate.

The effect of epinephrine in the liver, therefore, enhances or is synergistic with the effects of glucagon. Epinephrine release during bouts of hypoglycemia or during exercise can stimulate hepatic glycogenolysis and inhibit glycogen synthesis very rapidly.

# B. Regulation of Glycogen Synthesis and Degradation in Skeletal Muscle 

The regulation of glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle is related to the availability of ATP for muscular contraction. Skeletal muscle glycogen produces glucose 1-P and a small amount of free glucose. Glucose 1-P is converted to glucose 6-P, which is committed to the glycolytic pathway; the absence of glucose 6-phosphatase in skeletal muscle prevents conversion of the glucosyl units from glycogen to blood glucose. Skeletal muscle glycogen is therefore degraded only when the demand for ATP generation from glycolysis is high. The highest demands occur during anaerobic glycolysis, which requires more moles of glucose for each ATP produced than oxidation of glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (see Chapter 24). Anaerobic glycolysis occurs in tissues that have fewer mitochondria, a higher content of glycolytic enzymes, and higher levels of glycogen or in those that have fast-twitch glycolytic fibers. It occurs most frequently at the onset of exercise-before vasodilation occurs to bring in bloodborne fuels. The regulation of skeletal muscle glycogen degradation, therefore, must respond very rapidly to the need for ATP, indicated by the increase in AMP.

The regulation of skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis and degradation differs from that in liver in several important respects:

1. Glucagon has no effect on muscle, and thus, glycogen levels in muscle do not vary with the fasting/feeding state.
2. AMP is an allosteric activator of the muscle isozyme of glycogen phosphorylase but not liver glycogen phosphorylase (Fig. 26.9).
![ma144181198a6](ma144181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 26.9 Activation of muscle glycogen phosphorylase during exercise. Glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle is initiated by muscle contraction, neural impulses, and epinephrine. (I) Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) produced from the degradation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during muscular contraction allosterically activates glycogen phosphorylase b. (2) The neural impulses that initiate contraction release $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to calmodulin, which is a modifier protein that activates phosphorylase kinase. (3) Phosphorylase kinase is also activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A. The formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the resultant activation of protein kinase A are initiated by the binding of epinephrine to plasma membrane receptors. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.

Jim B. gradually regained consciousness with continued infusions of high-concentration glucose titrated to keep his serum glucose level between 120 and $160 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Although he remained somnolent and moderately confused over the next 12 hours, he was eventually able to tell his physicians that he had self-injected approximately 25 units of regular (short-acting) insulin every 6 hours while eating a high-carbohydrate diet for the last 2 days preceding his seizure. Normal subjects under basal conditions secrete an average of 40 U of insulin daily. He had last injected insulin just before exercising. An article in a body-building magazine that he had read recently cited the anabolic effects of insulin on increasing muscle mass. He had purchased the insulin and necessary syringes from the same underground drug source from whom he regularly bought his anabolic steroids.

Normally, muscle glycogenolysis supplies the glucose required for the kinds of high-intensity exercise that require anaerobic glycolysis, such as weightlifting. Jim's treadmill exercise also uses blood glucose, which is supplied by liver glycogenolysis. The high serum insulin levels, resulting from the injection he gave himself just before his workout, activated both glucose transport into skeletal muscle and glycogen synthesis, while inhibiting glycogen degradation. His exercise, which would continue to use blood glucose, could normally be supported by breakdown of liver glycogen. However, glycogen synthesis in his liver was activated, and glycogen degradation was inhibited by the insulin injection.
3. The effects of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in muscle result principally from the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum after neural stimulation and not from epinephrine-stimulated uptake.
4. Glucose is not a physiologic inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase a in muscle.
5. Glycogen is a stronger feedback inhibitor of muscle glycogen synthase than of liver glycogen synthase, resulting in a smaller amount of stored glycogen per gram weight of muscle tissue.
However, the effects of epinephrine-stimulated phosphorylation by PKA on skeletal muscle glycogen degradation and glycogen synthesis are similar to those occurring in liver (see Fig. 26.7).

Muscle glycogen phosphorylase is a genetically distinct isoenzyme of liver glycogen phosphorylase and contains an amino acid sequence that has a purine nucle-otide-binding site. When AMP binds to this site, it changes the conformation at the catalytic site to a structure very similar to that in the phosphorylated enzyme. Thus, hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and the consequent increase of AMP generated by adenylate kinase during muscular contraction can directly stimulate glycogenolysis to provide fuel for the glycolytic pathway. AMP also stimulates glycolysis by activating phosphofructokinase-1, so this one effector activates both glycogenolysis and glycolysis. The activation of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin subunit of phosphorylase kinase by the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during muscle contraction also provides a direct and rapid means of stimulating glycogen degradation.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Gretchen C. Gretchen C.'s hypoglycemia illustrates the importance of glycogen stores in the neonate. At birth, the fetus must make two major adjustments in the way fuels are used: It must adapt to using a greater variety of fuels than were available in utero, and it must adjust to intermittent feeding. In utero, the fetus receives a relatively constant supply of glucose from the maternal circulation through the placenta, producing a level of glucose in the fetus that approximates $75 \%$ of maternal blood levels. With regard to the hormonal regulation of fuel use in utero, fetal tissues function in an environment dominated by insulin, which promotes growth. During the last 10 weeks of gestation, this hormonal milieu leads to glycogen formation and storage. At birth, the infant's diet changes to one containing greater amounts of fat and lactose (galactose and glucose in equal ratio), presented at intervals rather than in a constant fashion. At the same time, the neonate's need for glucose is relatively larger than that of the adult because the newborn's ratio of brain to liver weight is greater. Thus, the infant has even greater difficulty maintaining glucose homeostasis than the adult.

At the moment that the umbilical cord is clamped, the normal neonate is faced with a metabolic problem: The high insulin levels of late fetal existence must be quickly reversed to prevent hypoglycemia. This reversal is accomplished through the secretion of the counterregulatory hormones epinephrine and glucagon. Glucagon release is triggered by the normal decline of blood glucose after birth. The neural response that stimulates the release of both glucagon and epinephrine is activated by the anoxia, cord clamping, and tactile stimulation that are part of a normal delivery. These responses have been referred to as the "normal sensor function" of the neonate.

Within 3 to 4 hours of birth, these counterregulatory hormones reestablish normal serum glucose levels in the newborn's blood through their glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic actions. The failure of Gretchen's normal "sensor function" was partly the result of maternal malnutrition, which resulted in an inadequate deposition of glycogen in Gretchen's liver before birth. The consequence was a serious degree of postnatal hypoglycemia.

The ability to maintain glucose homeostasis during the first few days of life also depends on the activation of gluconeogenesis and the mobilization of fatty acids.

Fatty acid oxidation in the liver not only promotes gluconeogenesis (see Chapter 28), it also generates ketone bodies. The neonatal brain has an enhanced capacity to use ketone bodies relative to that of infants (4-fold) and adults (40-fold). This ability is consistent with the relatively high fat content of breast milk.

2
Jim B. attempted to build up his muscle mass with androgens and with insulin. The anabolic (nitrogen-retaining) effects of androgens on skeletal muscle cells enhance muscle mass by increasing amino acid flux into muscle and by stimulating protein synthesis. Exogenous insulin has the potential to increase muscle mass by similar actions and also by increasing the content of muscle glycogen.

The most serious side effect of exogenous insulin administration is the development of severe hypoglycemia, such as occurred in Jim's case. The immediate adverse effect relates to an inadequate flow of fuel (glucose) to the metabolizing brain. When hypoglycemia is extreme, the patient may suffer a seizure and, if the hypoglycemia worsens, irreversible brain damage may occur. If prolonged, the patient will lapse into a coma and die.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3. It should be clear that the regulation of glycogen metabolism is quite complex. Recent work has indicated that certain enzymes involved in regulating glycogen synthase activity also have farreaching effects on other aspects of cell metabolism, such as cell structure, motility, growth, and survival.

The best example of this is glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). The enzyme was first identified as being an inhibitor of glycogen synthase. GSK-3 refers to two isozymes: GSK3 $\alpha$ and GSK3 $\beta$. GSK-3 has been identified as a kinase that can phosphorylate $>60$ different proteins, including a large number of transcription factors. GSK-3 activity is also itself regulated by phosphorylation.

GSK-3 activity is reduced by phosphorylation of a serine residue near its amino terminus. PKA, Akt, and protein kinase C can all catalyze this inhibitory phosphorylation event. GSK-3 is most active on protein substrates that have already been phosphorylated by other kinases (the substrates are said to be primed for further phosphorylation events). For example, GSK-3 will add phosphates to glycogen synthase but only after glycogen synthase had been phosphorylated by PKA.

GSK-3 binds to several proteins that sequester GSK-3 in certain pathways. This includes the Wnt signaling pathway, disruption of which is a significant component of colon cancer, the Patched-Smoothened signal transduction pathway (see Chapter 18), and the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins, which leads to altered cell motility. Activation of GSK-3 has also been linked to apoptosis, although GSK-3 activity is also required for cell survival.

One of the effects of insulin is to phosphorylate GSK-3, via activation of Akt, rendering the GSK-3 inactive. Loss of activity of GSK-3 will lead to activation of glycogen synthase activity and the pathways of energy storage. In animal models of type 2 diabetes, there is a loss of inhibitory control of GSK-3, leading to greater-than-normal GSK-3 activity, which antagonizes insulin action (promoting insulin resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes). Studies in rats have shown that inhibitors of GSK-3 lowered blood glucose levels and stimulated glucose transport into muscles of insulin-resistant animals. Inappropriate stimulation of GSK-3 has also been implicated in Alzheimer disease.

Current research concerning GSK-3 is geared toward understanding all of the roles of GSK-3 in cell growth and survival and to decipher its actions in the multitude of multiprotein complexes with which it is associated. Inhibitors of GSK-3 are being examined as possible agents to treat diabetes, but interpretation of results is difficult because of the multitude of roles GSK-3 plays within cells. It is possible that in the future, such drugs will be available to treat type 2 diabetes.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Glycogen is the storage form of glucose, composed of glucosyl units linked by $\alpha-1,4$-glycosidic bonds with $\alpha-1,6$-branches occurring about every 8 to 10 glucosyl units.
- Glycogen synthesis requires energy.
- Glycogen synthase transfers a glucosyl residue from the activated intermediate UDP-glucose to the nonreducing ends of existing glycogen chains during glycogen synthesis. The branching enzyme creates $\alpha-1,6$-linkages in the glycogen chain.
- Glycogenolysis is the degradation of glycogen. Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes a phosphorolysis reaction, using exogenous inorganic phosphate to break $\alpha-1,4$-linkages at the ends of glycogen chains, releasing glucose 1-phosphate. The debranching enzyme hydrolyzes the $\alpha-1,6$-linkages in glycogen, releasing free glucose.
- Liver glycogen supplies blood glucose.
- Glycogen synthesis and degradation are regulated in the liver by hormonal changes that signify either a deficiency of or an excess of blood glucose.
- Lack of dietary glucose, signaled by a decrease of the insulin/glucagon ratio, activates liver glycogenolysis and inhibits glycogen synthesis. Epinephrine also activates liver glycogenolysis.
- Glucagon and epinephrine release lead to phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (inactivating it) and glycogen phosphorylase (activating it).
- Glycogenolysis in muscle supplies glucose 6-phosphate for ATP synthesis in the glycolytic pathway.
- Muscle glycogen phosphorylase is allosterically activated by AMP as well as by phosphorylation.
- Increases in sarcoplasmic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stimulates phosphorylation of muscle glycogen phosphorylase.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 26.4.

10. A baby weighing 7.5 lb was delivered at 40 weeks of gestation by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. At 1 hour, the baby's blood glucose level was determined to be $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and at 2 hours post-birth was $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. These glucose numbers indicate which process?
A. Maternal malnutrition
B. Glycogen storage disease
C. Normal physiologic change
D. Insulin was given to the baby.
E. IV dextrose 50 was given to the baby.

1. The answer is B. Glycogen phosphorylase produces glucose 1-P; the debranching enzyme hydrolyzes branch points and thus releases free glucose. Ninety percent of the glycogen contains $\alpha-(1,4)$-bonds, and only $10 \%$ are $\alpha-(1,6)$-bonds, so more glucose 1-P will be produced than glucose.
2. The answer is D. If, after fasting, the branches were shorter than normal, glycogen phosphorylase must be functional and capable of being activated by glucagon (thus, A and B are incorrect). The branching enzyme (amylo-4,6-transferase) is also normal because branch points are present within the glycogen (thus, E is incorrect). Because glycogen is also present, glycogenin is present in order to build the carbohydrate chains, indicating that C is incorrect. If the debranching activity is abnormal (the amylo-1,6-glucosidase), glycogen phosphorylase would break the glycogen down up to four residues from branch points and would then stop. With no debranching activity, the resultant glycogen would contain the normal number of branches, but the branched chains would be shorter than normal.
3. The answer is C. The patient has McArdle disease, a glycogen storage disease caused by a deficiency of muscle glycogen phosphorylase. Because she cannot degrade glycogen to produce energy for muscle contraction, she becomes fatigued more readily than a normal person (thus, A is incorrect), the glycogen levels in her muscle will be higher than normal as a result of the inability to degrade them (thus, D is incorrect), and her blood lactate levels will be lower because of the lack of glucose for entry into glycolysis. She will, however, draw on the glucose in her circulation for energy, so her forearm blood glucose levels will be decreased (thus B is incorrect), and because the liver is not affected, blood glucose levels can be maintained by liver glycogenolysis (thus, E is incorrect).
4. The answer is A. After ingestion of glucose, insulin levels rise, cAMP levels within the cell drop (thus, E is incorrect), and PP-1 is activated (thus, D is incorrect). Glycogen phosphorylase a is converted to glycogen phosphorylase b by the phosphatase (thus, B is incorrect), and glycogen synthase is activated by the phosphatase. Red blood cells continue to use glucose at their normal rate; hence, lactate formation will remain the same (thus, C is incorrect).
5. The answer is F. In the absence of insulin, glucagonstimulated activities predominate. This leads to the activation of PKA, the phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase, the phosphorylation and activation
of phosphorylase kinase, and the phosphorylation and activation of glycogen phosphorylase.
6. The answer is A. Calcium activates a calmodulin subunit in phosphorylase kinase which will allow phosphorylase kinase to phosphorylate, and activate, glycogen phosphorylase. Glucose is an allosteric inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase a in liver but has no effect in muscle. Glucose 1-P has no effect on muscle phosphorylase, whereas glucose 6-P is an allosteric inhibitor of muscle glycogen phosphorylase a. The levels of magnesium have no effect on muscle glycogen phosphorylase activity. Normally, glucagon or epinephrine would activate the cAMP-dependent PKA, but this is not occurring under these conditions.
7. The answer is B. Glycogen in the liver provides glucose for the circulation. Glycogen in the heart, brain, or muscle cannot provide glucose for the circulation. In the liver, glucose 6-phosphatase hydrolyzes glucose 6-P to glucose, which is released into the bloodstream. The liver generates glucose 6-P from either glycogen degradation or gluconeogenesis. Muscle does not contain glucose 6-phosphatase.
8. The answer is D. Glycogen is both formed from and degrades to glucose 1-P. A high-energy phosphate bond from UTP is required to produce UDP-glucose in glycogen synthesis, but UDP-glucose is not resynthesized when glycogen is degraded. The pathways of glycogen synthesis and degradation use different enzymes and are not reversible reactions. In this way, the pathways can be regulated independently.
9. The answer is E. Type O glycogen storage disease is caused by a reduced level of liver glycogen synthase activity, so in this disease, very little liver glycogen is formed so glycogen deposits would not be found in the liver. All of the other glycogen storage diseases are characterized by glycogen deposits. Not all are fatal, some are mild, and some have an adult-onset form. Some glycogen storage disorders involve the liver, whereas others involve the muscle. Only those involving the liver will produce hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia.
10. The answer is C. At birth, maternal glucose supply to the baby ceases, causing a temporary physiologic drop in glucose even in normal healthy infants. This drop signals glycogenolysis in the newborn liver, returning the blood glucose to normal levels. Exogenous insulin would precipitously drop the blood glucose into hypoglycemic levels, and an exogenous bolus of dextrose would raise blood glucose levels above normal levels. This physiologic drop does not necessarily mean maternal malnutrition or evidence of a glycogen storage disease.

# Pentose Phosphate Pathway and the Synthesis of Glycosides, Lactose, Glycoproteins, and Glycolipids 

Glucose is used in several pathways other than glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. The pentose phosphate pathway (also known as the hexose monophosphate shunt, or HMP shunt) consists of both oxidative and nonoxidative components (Fig. 27.I). In the oxidative pathway, glucose 6-phosphate (glucose 6-P) is oxidized to ribulose 5-phosphate (ribulose 5-P), carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Ribulose 5-P, a pentose, can be converted to ribose 5-phosphate (ribose 5-P) for nucleotide biosynthesis. The NADPH is used for reductive pathways, such as fatty acid biosynthesis. detoxification of drugs by monooxygenases, and the glutathione defense system against injury by reactive oxygen species (ROS).
![ma145181198a6](ma145181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 27.I Overview of the pentose phosphate pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway generates reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) for reactions that require reducing equivalents (electrons) or ribose 5-phosphate for nucleotide biosynthesis. Glucose 6-phosphate is a substrate for both the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis. The five-carbon sugar intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway are reversibly interconverted to intermediates of glycolysis. The portion of glycolysis that is not part of the pentose phosphate pathway is shown in red. ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

B
Blood typing in a clinical lab uses antibodies that recognize either the $A$ antigen, the $B$ antigen, or the $\mathrm{Rh}(\mathrm{D})$ antigen. Each antigen is distinctive, in part, because of the different carbohydrate chains attached to the protein. The blood sample is mixed with each antibody individually. If cell clumping (agglutination) occurs, the red blood cells are expressing the carbohydrate that is recognized by the antibody (recall from Chapter 7 that antibodies are bivalent; the agglutination occurs because one arm of the antibody binds to antigen on one cell, whereas the other arm binds to antigen on a second cell, thereby bringing the cells together). If neither the A nor B antibodies cause agglutination, the blood type is $O$, indicating a lack of either antigen.

In the nonoxidative phase of the pathway, ribulose 5-P is converted to ribose 5-P and to intermediates of the glycolytic pathway. This portion of the pathway is reversible; therefore, ribose 5-P can also be formed from intermediates of glycolysis. One of the enzymes involved in these sugar interconversions, transketolase, uses thiamin pyrophosphate as a coenzyme.

The sugars produced by the pentose phosphate pathway enter glycolysis as fructose 6-phosphate (fructose 6-P) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (glyceraldehyde 3-P), and their further metabolism in the glycolytic pathway generates NADH, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and pyruvate. The overall equation for the conversion of glucose 6-P to fructose 6-P and glyceraldehyde 3-P through both the oxidative and nonoxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway is

$$
\begin{aligned}
3 \text { Glucose 6-P }+6 \mathrm{NADP}^{+} & \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+6 \mathrm{NADPH}+6 \mathrm{H}^{+} \\
& +2 \text { fructose 6-P }+ \text { glyceraldehyde 3-P }
\end{aligned}
$$

As had been seen previously in glycogen synthesis, several pathways for interconversion of sugars or the formation of sugar derivatives use activated sugars attached to nucleotides. Both uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose and UDP-galactose are used for glycosyltransferase reactions in many systems. Lactose, for example, is synthesized from UDP-galactose and glucose in the mammary gland. UDP-glucose also can be oxidized to form UDP-glucuronate, which is used to form glucuronide derivatives of bilirubin and xenobiotic compounds. Glucuronide derivatives are generally more readily excreted in urine or bile than the parent compound.

In addition to serving as fuel, carbohydrates are often found in glycoproteins (carbohydrate chains attached to proteins) and glycolipids (carbohydrate chains attached to lipids). Nucleotide sugars are used to donate sugar residues for the formation of the glycosidic bonds in both glycoproteins and glycolipids. These carbohydrate groups have many different types of functions.

Glycoproteins contain short chains of carbohydrates (oligosaccharides) that are usually branched. These oligosaccharides are generally composed of glucose, galactose, and their amino derivatives. In addition, mannose, L-fucose, and N -acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) are frequently present. The carbohydrate chains grow by the sequential addition of sugars to a serine or threonine residue of the protein. Nucleotide sugars are the precursors. Branched carbohydrate chains also may be attached to the amide nitrogen of asparagine in the protein. In this case, the chains are synthesized on dolichol phosphate and subsequently transferred to the protein. Glycoproteins are found in mucus, in the blood, in compartments within the cell (such as lysosomes), in the extracellular matrix, and embedded in the cell membrane with the carbohydrate portion extending into the extracellular space.

Glycolipids belong to the class of sphingolipids. They are synthesized from nucleotide sugars that add monosaccharides sequentially to the hydroxymethyl group of the lipid ceramide (related to sphingosine). They often contain branches of NANA produced from cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-NANA. They are found in the cell membrane with the carbohydrate portion extruding from the cell surface. These carbohydrates, as well as some of the carbohydrates of glycoproteins, serve as cell recognition factors.

## THE WAITING ROOM

After Al M. had been released from the hospital, where he had been treated for thiamin deficiency, he quickly fell off the wagon and injured his arm after falling down in the street while intoxicated. Two days after hurting his arm, Al's friends took him to the hospital when he developed a fever of $101.5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. One of the physicians noticed that one of the lacerations on Mr. M.'s arm was red and swollen, with some pus drainage. The pus was cultured and gram-positive cocci were found and identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Because his friends stated that he had an allergy to penicillin, and because of the concern over methicillin-resistant

S. aureus, Al was started on a course of the antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP/sulfa). To his friends' knowledge, he had never been treated with a sulfa drug previously.

On the third day of therapy with TMP/sulfa for his infection, Mr. M. was slightly jaundiced. His hemoglobin level had fallen by $3.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ from its value at admission, and his urine was red-brown because of the presence of free hemoglobin. Mr. M. had apparently suffered acute hemolysis (lysis or destruction of some of his red blood cells) induced by his infection and exposure to the sulfa drug.

(1)To help support herself through medical school, Edna R. works evenings in a hospital blood bank. She is responsible for ensuring that compatible donor blood is available to patients who need blood transfusions. As part of her training, Edna has learned that the external surfaces of all blood cells contain large numbers of antigenic determinants. These determinants are often glycoproteins or glycolipids that differ from one individual to another. As a result, all blood transfusions expose the recipient to many foreign immunogens. Most of these, fortunately, do not induce antibodies, or they induce antibodies that elicit little or no immunologic response. For routine blood transfusions, therefore, tests are performed only for the presence of antigens that determine whether the patient's blood type is $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{AB}$, or O and $\mathrm{Rh}(\mathrm{D})$-positive or -negative.

(2)Jay S.'s psychomotor development has become progressively more abnormal (see Chapter 15). At 2 years of age, he is obviously severely developmentally delayed and nearly blind. His muscle weakness has progressed to the point that he cannot sit up or even crawl. As the result of a weak cough reflex, he is unable to clear his normal respiratory secretions and has had recurrent respiratory infections.

## I. The Pentose Phosphate Pathway

The pentose phosphate pathway is essentially a scenic bypass route around the first stage of glycolysis that generates NADPH and ribose 5-P (as well as other pentose sugars). Glucose 6-P is the common precursor for both pathways. The oxidative first stage of the pentose phosphate pathway generates 2 mol of NADPH per mole of glucose 6-P oxidized. The second stage of the pentose phosphate pathway generates ribose 5-P and converts unused intermediates to fructose 6-P and glyceraldehyde 3-P in the glycolytic pathway (see Fig. 27.1). All cells require NADPH for reductive detoxification, and most cells require ribose 5-P for nucleotide synthesis. Consequently, the pathway is present in all cells. The enzymes reside in the cytosol, as do the enzymes of glycolysis.

## A. Oxidative Phase of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway

In the oxidative first phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, glucose 6-P undergoes an oxidation and decarboxylation to a pentose sugar, ribulose 5-P (Fig. 27.2). The first enzyme of this pathway, glucose 6-P dehydrogenase, oxidizes the aldehyde at carbon 1 and reduces $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$to NADPH. The gluconolactone that is formed is rapidly hydrolyzed to 6 -phosphogluconate, a sugar acid with a carboxylic acid group at carbon 1. The next oxidation step releases this carboxyl group as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, with the electrons being transferred to $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$. This reaction is mechanistically very similar to the one catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Thus, 2 mol of NADPH per mole of glucose 6-P are formed from this portion of the pathway.

NADPH, rather than NADH, is generally used in the cell in pathways that require the input of electrons for reductive reactions, because the ratio of NADPH/NADP ${ }^{+}$is much greater than the NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio. The NADH generated from fuel oxidation

Ribulose 5-phosphate
FIGURE 27.2 Oxidative portion of the pentose phosphate pathway. Carbon I of glucose 6-phosphate is oxidized to an acid and then released as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in an oxidation followed by a decarboxylation reaction. Each of the oxidation steps generate a reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH).

The transketolase activity of red blood cells can be used to measure thiamin nutritional status and diagnose the presence of thiamin deficiency. The activity of transketolase is measured in the presence and absence of added thiamin pyrophosphate. If the thiamin intake of a patient is adequate, the addition of thiamin pyrophosphate does not increase the activity of transketolase because it already contains bound thiamin pyrophosphate. If the patient is thiamin-deficient, transketolase activity will be low, and adding thiamin pyrophosphate will greatly stimulate the reaction. In Chapter 24,
Al M, was diagnosed as having berberi heart disease, resulting from thiamin deficiency, by direct measurement of thiamin, which is the more commonly used test currently.

How does the net energy yield from the metabolism of 3 mol of glucose 6-P through the pentose phosphate pathway to pyruvate compare with the yield of 3 mol of glucose 6-P through glycolysis?

Ribulose 5-phosphate

is rapidly oxidized back to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$by NADH dehydrogenase in the electron-transport chain, so the level of NADH in the cell is very low.

NADPH can be generated from several reactions in the liver and other tissues but not red blood cells. For example, in tissues with mitochondria, an energyrequiring transhydrogenase located near the complexes of the electron-transport chain can transfer reducing equivalents from NADH to $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$to generate NADPH.

NADPH, however, cannot be oxidized directly by the electron-transport chain, and the ratio of NADPH to NADP ${ }^{+}$in cells is $>1$. The reduction potential of NADPH, therefore, can contribute to the energy needed for biosynthetic processes and provide a constant source of reducing power for detoxification reactions.

The ribulose 5-P formed from the action of the two oxidative steps is isomerized to produce ribose 5-P (a ketose-to-aldose conversion, similar to fructose 6-P being isomerized to glucose 6-P). The ribose 5-P can then enter the pathway for nucleotide synthesis, if needed, or it can be converted to glycolytic intermediates, as described in the following section for the nonoxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway. The pathway through which the ribose 5-P travels is determined by the needs of the cell at the time of its synthesis.

## B. Nonoxidative Phase of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway

The nonoxidative reactions of this pathway are reversible reactions that allow intermediates of glycolysis (specifically, glyceraldehyde 3-P and fructose 6-P) to be converted to five-carbon sugars (such as ribose 5-P), and vice versa. The needs of the cell determine in which direction this pathway proceeds. If the cell has produced ribose 5-P but does not need to synthesize nucleotides, then the ribose 5-P is converted to glycolytic intermediates. If the cell still requires NADPH, the ribose 5-P is converted back into glucose 6-P using nonoxidative reactions (see the next section). And finally, if the cell already has a high level of NADPH but needs to produce nucleotides, the oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway are inhibited, and the glycolytic intermediates fructose 6-P and glyceraldehyde 3-P are used to produce the five-carbon sugars using exclusively the nonoxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway.

## I. Conversion of Ribulose 5-Phosphate to Glycolytic Intermediates

The nonoxidative portion of the pentose phosphate pathway consists of a series of rearrangement and transfer reactions that first convert ribulose 5-P to ribose 5-P and xylulose 5-phosphate (xylulose 5-P), and then the ribose 5-P and xylulose 5-P are converted to intermediates of the glycolytic pathway. The enzymes involved are an epimerase, an isomerase, transketolase, and transaldolase.

The epimerase and isomerase convert ribulose 5-P to two other five-carbon sugars (Fig. 27.3). The isomerase converts ribulose 5-P to ribose 5-P. The epimerase changes the stereochemical position of one hydroxyl group (at carbon 3), converting ribulose 5-P to xylulose 5-P.

Transketolase transfers two-carbon fragments of keto sugars (sugars with a keto group at carbon 2) to other sugars. Transketolase picks up a two-carbon fragment from xylulose 5-P by cleaving the carbon-carbon bond between the keto group and the adjacent carbon, thereby releasing glyceraldehyde 3-P (Fig. 27.4). The two-carbon fragment is covalently bound to thiamin pyrophosphate, which transfers it to the aldehyde carbon of another sugar, forming a new ketose. The role of thiamin pyrophosphate here is thus very similar to its role in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate (see Chapter 24, Section III.C). Two reactions in the pentose phosphate pathway use transketolase: In the first, the two-carbon keto fragment from xylulose 5-P is transferred to ribose 5-P to form sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (sedoheptulose 7-P); and in the other, a two-carbon keto fragment (usually derived from xylulose 5-P) is transferred to erythrose 4-phosphate (erythrose 4-P) to form fructose 6-P.

Transaldolase transfers a three-carbon keto fragment from sedoheptulose 7-P to glyceraldehyde 3-P to form erythrose 4-P and fructose 6-P (Fig. 27.5). The aldol cleavage occurs between the two hydroxyl carbons adjacent to the keto group (on carbons 3 and 4 of the sugar). This reaction is similar to the aldolase reaction in glycolysis, and the enzyme uses an active amino group, from the side chain of lysine, to catalyze the reaction.

The net result of the metabolism of 3 mol of ribulose 5-P in the pentose phosphate pathway is the formation of 2 mol of fructose 6-P and 1 mol of glyceraldehyde 3-P, which then continue through the glycolytic pathway with the production of NADH, ATP, and pyruvate. Because the pentose phosphate pathway begins with glucose 6-P and feeds back into the glycolytic pathway, it is sometimes called the HMP shunt (a shunt or a pathway for glucose 6-P). The reaction sequence starting from glucose 6-P and involving both the oxidative and nonoxidative phases of the pathway is shown in Figure 27.6.

(1)The net energy yield from 3 mol of glucose 6-P metabolized through the pentose phosphate pathway and then the last portion of the glycolytic pathway is 6 mol of NADPH, 3 mol of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, 5 \mathrm{~mol}$ of NADH, 8 mol of ATP, and 5 mol of pyruvate. In contrast, the metabolism of 3 mol of glucose 6-P through glycolysis is 6 mol of NADH, 9 mol of ATP, and 6 mol of pyruvate.

# 2. Generation of Ribose 5-Phosphate from Intermediates of Glycolysis 

The reactions catalyzed by the epimerase, isomerase, transketolase, and transaldolase are all reversible reactions under physiologic conditions. Thus, ribose 5-P required for purine and pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis can be generated from intermediates of the glycolytic pathway, as well as from the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway. The sequence of reactions that generate ribose 5-P from intermediates of glycolysis is as follows:
(1) Fructose 6-P + glyceraldehyde 3-P $\longleftarrow \xrightarrow{\text { Transketolase }} \gg$ Erythrose 4-P + xylulose 5-P
(2) Erythrose 4-P + fructose 6-P $\longleftarrow \xrightarrow{\text { Transaldolase }} \gg$ Sedoheptulose 7-P + glyceraldehyde 3-P
(3) Sedoheptulose 7-P + glyceraldehyde 3-P $\longleftarrow \xrightarrow{\text { Transketolase }} \gg$ Ribose 5-P + xylulose 5-P
(4) 2 Xylulose 5-P $\longleftarrow$ Epimerase $\gg 2$ Ribulose 5-P
(5) 2 Ribulose 5-P $\longleftarrow$ Isomerase $\gg 2$ Ribose 5-P

Net equation: 2 Fructose 6-P + glyceraldehyde 3-P $\leftrightarrow 3$ Ribose 5-P

## C. Role of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway in Generation of NADPH

In general, the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway is the major source of NADPH in cells. NADPH provides the reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions and for oxidation-reduction reactions involved in protection against the toxicity of ROS (see Chapter 25). The glutathione-mediated defense against oxidative stress is common to all cell types (including red blood cells), and the requirement for NADPH to maintain levels of reduced glutathione probably accounts for the universal distribution of the pentose phosphate pathway among different types of cells. Figure 27.7 illustrates the importance of this pathway in maintaining the membrane integrity of the red blood cells. NADPH is also used for anabolic pathways, such as fatty acid synthesis, cholesterol synthesis, and fatty acid chain elongation (Table 27.1). It is the source of reducing equivalents for cytochrome P450 hydroxylation

![ma159181198a6](ma159181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 27.7 Hemolysis caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). (1) Maintenance of the integrity of the erythrocyte membrane depends on its ability to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) from glycolysis. (2) NADPH is generated by the pentose phosphate pathway. (3) NADPH is used for the reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH). Glutathione is necessary for the removal of hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ and lipid peroxides generated by ROS. (4) In the erythrocytes of healthy individuals, the continuous generation of superoxide ion from the nonenzymatic oxidation of hemoglobin provides a source of ROS. The glutathione defense system is compromised by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, infections, certain drugs, and the purine glycosides of fava beans. (5) As a consequence, Heinz bodies, aggregates of cross-linked hemoglobin, form on the cell membranes and subject the cell to mechanical stress as it tries to go through small capillaries. The action of the ROS on the cell membrane as well as mechanical stress from the lack of deformability result in hemolysis. Met Hb, methemoglobin; $O x y \mathrm{Hb}$, oxyhemoglobin.
of aromatic compounds, steroids, alcohols, and drugs. The highest concentrations of glucose 6-P dehydrogenase are found in phagocytic cells, where NADPH oxidase uses NADPH to form superoxide from molecular oxygen. The superoxide then generates hydrogen peroxide, which kills the microorganisms taken up by the phagocytic cells (see Chapter 25).

The entry of glucose 6-P into the pentose phosphate pathway is controlled by the cellular concentration of NADPH. NADPH is a strong product inhibitor of glucose 6-P dehydrogenase, the first enzyme of the pathway. As NADPH is oxidized in other pathways, the product inhibition of glucose 6-P dehydrogenase is relieved, and the rate of the enzyme is accelerated to produce more NADPH.

In the liver, the synthesis of fatty acids from glucose is a major route of NADPH reoxidation. The synthesis of liver glucose 6-P dehydrogenase, like the key enzymes of glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis, is induced by the increased

(1) Doctors suspected that the underlying factor in the destruction of $\mathbf{A I} \mathbf{M} . \mathbf{s}$ red blood cells was an X-linked defect in the gene that codes for glucose 6-P dehydrogenase. The red blood cell is dependent on this enzyme for a source of NADPH to maintain reduced levels of glutathione, one of its major defenses against oxidative stress (see Chapter 25). Glucose 6-P dehydrogenase deficiency is the most common known enzymopathy, affecting approximately $7 \%$ of the world's population and about $2 \%$ of the US population. Most glucose 6-P dehydrogenase-deficient individuals are asymptomatic but can undergo an episode of hemolytic anemia if they are exposed to certain drugs or to certain types of infections, or if they ingest fava beans. When questioned, AI M, replied that he did not know what a fava bean was and had no idea whether he was sensitive to them.

## II. Interconversions Involving Nucleotide Sugars

Activated sugars attached to nucleotides are converted to other sugars; oxidized to sugar acids; and joined to proteins, lipids, or other sugars through glycosidic bonds.

## A. Reactions of Uridine Diphosphate-Glucose

$U D P$-glucose is an activated sugar nucleotide that is a precursor of glycogen and lactose; UDP-glucuronate and glucuronides; and the carbohydrate chains in proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids (Fig. 27.8). Both proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans are discussed further in Chapter 47. In the synthesis of many of the carbohydrate portions of these compounds, a sugar is transferred from the
![ma160181198a6](ma160181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 27.8 An overview of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose metabolism. The activated glucose moiety of UDP-glucose can be attached by a glycosidic bond to other sugars, as in glycogen or the sugar oligosaccharide and polysaccharide side chains of proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. UDP-glucose also can be oxidized to UDP-glucuronate, or epimerized to UDP-galactose, a precursor of lactose. UTP, uridine triphosphate.

![ma161181198a6](ma161181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 27.9 Glycosyltransferases. These enzymes transfer sugars from nucleotide sugars to nucleophilic amino acid residues on proteins, such as the hydroxyl group of serine or the amide group of asparagine. Other transferases transfer specific sugars from a nucleotide sugar to a hydroxyl group of other sugars. The bond formed between the anomeric carbon of the sugar and the nucleophilic group of another compound is a glycosidic bond. UDP, uridine diphosphate.

FIGURE 27.10 Metabolic routes of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronate. UDP-glucuronate is formed from UDP-glucose (shown in black). Glucuronate from UDP-glucuronate is incorporated into glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), where certain of the glucuronate residues are converted to iduronate (see Chapter 47). UDP-glucuronate is a precursor of UDP-xylose, another sugar residue incorporated into GAGs. Glucuronate is also transferred to the carboxyl groups of bilirubin or the alcohol groups of steroids, drugs, and xenobiotics to form glucuronides. The "-ide" in the name glucuronide denotes that these compounds are glycosides. Xenobiotics are pharmacologically, endocrinologically, or toxicologically active substances not produced endogenously and, therefore, are foreign to an organism. Drugs are an example of xenobiotics.
nucleotide sugar to an alcohol or other nucleophilic group to form a glycosidic bond (Fig. 27.9). The use of UDP as a leaving group in this reaction provides the energy for formation of the new bond. The enzymes that form glycosidic bonds are sugar transferases (e.g., glycogen synthase is a glucosyltransferase). Transferases are also involved in the formation of the glycosidic bonds in bilirubin glucuronides, proteoglycans, and lactose.

## B. Uridine Diphosphate-Glucuronate:A Source of Negative Charges

One of the major routes of UDP-glucose metabolism is the formation of UDPglucuronate, which serves as a precursor of other sugars and of glucuronides (Fig. 27.10). Glucuronate is formed by the oxidation of the alcohol on carbon 6 of glucose to an acid (through two oxidation states) by an $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$-dependent dehydrogenase (Fig. 27.11). Glucuronate is also present in the diet and can be formed from the degradation of inositol (the sugar alcohol that forms inositol trisphosphate $\left[\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right]$ ), an intracellular second messenger for many hormones.

## C. Glucuronides:A Source of Negative Charges

The function of glucuronate in the excretion of bilirubin, drugs, xenobiotics, and other compounds containing a hydroxyl group is to add negative charges and increase their solubility. Bilirubin is a degradation product of heme that is formed in the reticuloendothelial system and is only slightly soluble in plasma. It is transported, bound to albumin, to the liver. In the liver, glucuronate residues are transferred from UDP-glucuronate to two carboxyl groups on bilirubin, sequentially forming bilirubin monoglucuronide and bilirubin diglucuronide, the "conjugated" forms of bilirubin (Fig. 27.12). The more soluble bilirubin diglucuronide (as compared with unconjugated bilirubin) is then actively transported into the bile for excretion.

Many xenobiotics, drugs, steroids, and other compounds with hydroxyl groups and low solubility in water are converted to glucuronides in a similar fashion by glucuronyltransferases present in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm of the liver and kidney (Table 27.3). This is one of the major conjugation pathways for excretion of these compounds.

What is the difference in structure between 6-phosphogluconate and glucuronic acid?

$\oplus$A failure of the liver to transport, store, or conjugate bilirubin results in the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood jaundice (or icterus), the yellowish tinge to the skin and the whites of the eyes (sclerae) experienced by Erin G. (see Chapter 22), occurs when plasma becomes supersaturated with bilirubin ( $>2$ to $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), and the excess diffuses into tissues. When bilirubin levels are measured in the blood (see Chapter 6), one can either measure indirect bilirubin (this is the nonconjugated form of bilirubin, which is bound to albumin), direct bilirubin (the conjugated, water-soluble form), or total bilirubin (the sum of the direct and indirect levels). If total bilirubin levels are high, then a determination of direct and indirect bilirubin is needed to appropriately determine a cause for the elevation of total bilirubin.

6-Phosphogluconate is produced by the first oxidative reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway, in which carbon I of glucose is oxidized to a carboxylate. In contrast, glucuronic acid is oxidized at carbon 6 to the carboxylate form.

FIGURE 27.II Formation of glucuronate and glucuronides. A glycosidic bond is formed between the anomeric hydroxyl of glucuronate (at carbon I) and the hydroxyl group of a nonpolar compound.

The hydrogen atoms on the sugars have been omitted from the figure for clarity.

Progesterone (steroid hormone)

Morphine (painkiller)

Glucuronate, once formed, can reenter the pathways of glucose metabolism through reactions that eventually convert it to D-xylulose 5-P, an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway. In most mammals other than humans, an intermediate of this pathway is the precursor of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Humans, however, are deficient in this pathway and cannot synthesize vitamin C.

## D. Synthesis of Uridine Diphosphate-Galactose and Lactose from Glucose

Lactose is synthesized from UDP-galactose and glucose (Fig. 27.13). However, galactose is not required in the diet for lactose synthesis because galactose can be synthesized from glucose.

## I. Conversion of Glucose to Galactose

Galactose and glucose are epimers; they differ only in the stereochemical position of one hydroxyl group, at carbon 4. Thus, the formation of UDP-galactose from UDP-glucose is an epimerization (Fig. 27.14). The epimerase does not actually transfer the hydroxyl group; it oxidizes the hydroxyl to a ketone by transferring electrons to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and then donates electrons back to re-form the alcohol group on the other side of the carbon.

Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-galactose for the synthesis of lactose in the mammary gland is usually formed from the epimerization of UDP-glucose. Lactose synthase catalyzes the attack of the C4 alcohol group of glucose on the anomeric carbon of the galactose, releasing UDP and forming a glycosidic bond. Lactose synthase is composed of a galactosyltransferase and $\alpha$-lactalbumin, which is a regulatory subunit. $P P_{i}$, pyrophosphate; $U T P$, uridine triphosphate.

Many full-term newborns develop jaundice, termed neonatal jaundice. It is usually caused by an increased destruction of red blood cells after birth (the fetus has an unusually large number of red blood cells) and an immature bilirubin conjugating system in the liver. This leads to elevated levels of nonconjugated bilirubin, which is deposited in hydrophobic (fat) environments. If bilirubin levels reach a certain threshold at the age of 48 hours, the newborn is a candidate for phototherapy, $n$ which the child is placed under lamps or on a "biliblanket" that emits light between the wavelengths of 425 and 475 nm . Bilirubin absorbs this light, undergoes chemical changes, and becomes more water-soluble. Usually, within a week of birth, the newborn's liver can handle the load generated from red blood cell turnover.

2High concentrations of galactose 1-phosphate (galactose 1-P) inhibit phosphoglucomutase, the enzyme that converts glucose 6-P to glucose 1-P. How can this inhibition account for the hypoglycemia and jaundice that accompany galactose 1-P uridylyltransferase deficiency?
![ma166181198a6](ma166181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 27.14 Epimerization of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose to UDP-galactose. The epimerization of glucose to galactose occurs on UDP-sugars. The epimerase uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$ to oxidize the alcohol to a ketone, and then it reduces the ketone back to an alcohol. The reaction is reversible; glucose being converted to galactose forms galactose for lactose synthesis, and galactose being converted to glucose is part of the pathway for the metabolism of dietary galactose. The hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity.

The inhibition of phosphoglucomutase by galactose I-P results in hypoglycemia by interfering with both the formation of UDP-glucose (the glycogen precursor) and the degradation of glycogen back to glucose 6-P. Ninety percent of glycogen degradation leads to glucose I-P, which can only be converted to glucose 6-P by phosphoglucomutase. When phosphoglucomutase activity is inhibited, less glucose 6-P production occurs, and hence, less glucose is available for export. Thus, the stored glycogen is only approximately $10 \%$ efficient in raising blood glucose levels, and hypoglycemia results. UDP-glucose levels are reduced because glucose I-P is required to synthesize UDP-glucose, and in the absence of phosphoglucomutase activity, glucose 6-P (derived from either the glucokinase reaction or gluconeogenesis) cannot be converted to glucose I-P.This prevents the formation of UDP-glucuronate, which is necessary to convert bilirubin to the diglucuronide form for transport into the bile. Bilirubin accumulates in tissues, giving them a yellow color (jaundice).

0A pregnant woman who was extremely lactose intolerant asked her physician if she would still be able to breastfeed her infant even though she could not drink milk or dairy products. What advice should she be given?

## 2. Lactose Synthesis

Lactose is unique in that it is synthesized only in the mammary gland of the adult female for short periods during lactation. Lactose synthase, an enzyme present in the endoplasmic reticulum of the lactating mammary gland, catalyzes the last step in lactose biosynthesis, the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to glucose (see Fig. 27.13). Lactose synthase has two protein subunits, a galactosyltransferase and $\alpha$-lactalbumin. $\alpha$-Lactalbumin is a modifier protein synthesized after parturition (childbirth) in response to the hormone prolactin. This enzyme subunit lowers the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the galactosyltransferase for glucose from 1,200 to 1 mM , thereby increasing the rate of lactose synthesis. In the absence of $\alpha$-lactalbumin, galactosyltransferase transfers galactosyl units to glycoproteins.

## E. Formation of Sugars for Glycolipid and Glycoprotein Synthesis

The transferases that produce the oligosaccharide and polysaccharide side chains of glycolipids and attach sugar residues to proteins are specific for the sugar moiety and for the donating nucleotide (e.g., UDP, CMP, or guanosine diphosphate [GDP]). Some of the sugar nucleotides used for glycoprotein, proteoglycan (see Chapter 47), and glycolipid formation are listed in Table 27.4. They include the derivatives of glucose and galactose that we have already discussed, as well as acetylated amino sugars and derivatives of mannose. The reason for the large variety of sugars attached to proteins and lipids is that they have relatively specific and different functions, such as targeting a protein toward a membrane; providing recognition sites on the cell surface for other cells, hormones, or viruses; or acting as lubricants or molecular sieves (see Chapter 47).

The pathways for use and formation of many of these sugars are summarized in Figure 27.15. Note that many of the steps are reversible so that glucose and other dietary sugars enter a common pool from which the diverse sugars can be formed.

The amino sugars are all derived from glucosamine 6-phosphate (glucosamine 6-P). To synthesize glucosamine 6-P an amino group is transferred from the amide of glutamine to fructose 6-P (Fig. 27.16). Amino sugars, such as glucosamine, can then be $N$-acetylated by an acetyltransferase. $N$-Acetyltransferases are present in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol and provide another means of chemically modifying sugars, metabolites, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds. Individuals may vary greatly in their capacity for acetylation reactions.

Mannose is found in the diet in small amounts. Like galactose, it is an epimer of glucose, and mannose and glucose are interconverted by epimerization reactions at carbon 2. The interconversion can take place either at the level of fructose 6-P to mannose 6-phosphate (mannose 6-P) or at the level of the derivatized sugars (see Fig. 27.15). N -Acetylmannosamine is the precursor of NANA (a sialic acid) and GDP-mannose is the precursor of GDP-fucose (see Fig. 27.15). The negative charge on NANA is obtained by the addition of a three-carbon carboxyl moiety from phosphoenolpyruvate.

FIGURE 27.15 Pathways for the interconversion of sugars. All of the different sugars found in glycosaminoglycans, gangliosides, and other compounds in the body can be synthesized from glucose. Dietary glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, and other sugars enter a common pool from which other sugars are derived. The activated sugar is transferred from the nucleotide sugar, shown in yellow boxes, to form a glycosidic bond with another sugar or amino acid residue. The green box next to each nucleotide sugar lists some of the compounds that contain the sugar. Iduronic acid, in the upper right corner of the diagram, is formed only after glucuronic acid is incorporated into a glycosaminoglycan (which is discussed in more detail in Chapter 47).

Although the lactose in dairy products is a major source of galactose, the ingestion of lactose is not required for lactation. UDP-galactose in the mammary gland is derived principally from the epimerization of glucose. Dairy products are, however, a major dietary source of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, so breastfeeding mothers need increased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from another source.

By identifying the nature of antigenic determinants on the surface of the donor's red blood cells, Edna R. is able to classify the donor's blood as belonging to certain specific blood groups. These antigenic determinants are located in the oligosaccharides of the glycoproteins and glycolipids of the cell membranes. The most important blood group in humans is the ABO group, which comprises two antigens, A and B. Individuals with the A antigen on their cells belong to blood group A. Those with B belong to group B, and those with both A and B belong to group AB . The absence of both the $A$ and $B$ antigens results in blood type $O$ (see Fig. 27.23).

FIGURE 27.18 Structure of salivary mucin. The sugars form hydrogen bonds with water. Sialic acid provides a negatively charged carboxylate group. The protein is extremely large, and the negatively charged sialic acids extend the carbohydrate chains (by charge repulsion) so the molecules occupy a large space. All of the salivary glycoproteins contain O-linked sugars. N-Acetylneuraminic acid is a sialic acid.

## III. Glycoproteins

## A. Structure and Function

Glycoproteins contain short carbohydrate chains covalently linked to either serine/ threonine or asparagine residues in the protein. These oligosaccharide chains are often branched and they do not contain repeating disaccharides (Fig. 27.17). Most proteins in the blood are glycoproteins. They serve as hormones, antibodies, enzymes (including those of the blood clotting cascade), and as structural components of the extracellular matrix. Collagen contains galactosyl units and disaccharides composed of galactosyl-glucose attached to hydroxylysine residues (see Chapter 47). The secretions of mucus-producing cells, such as salivary mucin, are glycoproteins (Fig. 27.18).

Although most glycoproteins are secreted from cells, some are segregated in lysosomes, where they serve as the lysosomal enzymes that degrade various types of cellular and extracellular material. Other glycoproteins are produced like secretory proteins, but hydrophobic regions of the protein remain attached to the cell membrane, and the carbohydrate portion extends into the extracellular space (also see Chapter 15, Section VIII). These glycoproteins serve as receptors for compounds such as hormones, as transport proteins, and as cell attachment and cell-cell recognition sites. Bacteria and viruses also bind to these sites.

## B. Synthesis

The protein portion of glycoproteins is synthesized on ribosomes attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The carbohydrate chains are attached to the protein in the lumen of the ER and the Golgi complex. In some cases, the initial sugar is added to a serine or a threonine residue in the protein, and the carbohydrate chain is extended by the sequential addition of sugar residues to the nonreducing end. As seen in Table 27.4, UDP-sugars are the precursors for the addition of four of the seven sugars that are usually found in glycoproteins-glucose, galactose, N -acetylglucosamine, and N -acetylgalactosamine. GDP-sugars are the precursors for the addition of mannose and L-fucose, and CMP-NANA is the precursor for NANA. Dolichol phosphate (Fig. 27.19) (which is synthesized from isoprene

FIGURE 27.19 Structure of dolichol phosphate. In humans, the isoprene unit (in brackets) is repeated approximately 17 times $(n=\sim 17)$.
![ma170181198a6](ma170181198a6.jpg)
units, as discussed in Chapter 32) is involved in transferring branched sugar chains to the amide nitrogen of asparagine residues. Sugars are removed and added as the glycoprotein moves from the ER through the Golgi complex (Fig. 27.20). As discussed in Chapter 10, the carbohydrate chain is used as a targeting marker for lysosomal enzymes.

Transfer of the branched oligosaccharide from dolichol phosphate to a protein in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) (step I) and processing of the oligosaccharide (steps 2-II). Steps I through 4 occur in the RER. The glycoprotein is transferred in vesicles to the Golgi complex, where further modifications of the oligosaccharides occur (steps 5-II).

The pathway for phosphorylating a mannose residue within the protein-attached oligosaccharide requires two steps.

I-cell (inclusion cell) disease is a rare condition in which lysosomal enzymes lack the mannose phosphate marker that targets them to lysosomes. The enzyme that is deficient in I-cell disease is a phosphotransferase located in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 27.21). The phosphotransferase has the unique ability to recognize lysosomal proteins because of their three-dimensional structure, such that they can all be appropriately tagged for transport to the lysosomes. Consequently, as a result of the lack of mannose phosphate, lysosomal enzymes are secreted from the cells. Because lysosomes lack their normal complement of enzymes, undegraded molecules accumulate within the nonfunctional lysosomes inside these cells, forming inclusion bodies.

## IV. Glycolipids

## A. Function and Structure

Glycolipids are derivatives of the lipid sphingosine. These sphingolipids include the cerebrosides and the gangliosides (Fig. 27.22; see also Chapter 5, Fig. 5.20). They contain ceramide, with carbohydrate moieties attached to its hydroxymethyl group.

Glycolipids are involved in intercellular communication. Oligosaccharides of identical composition are present in both the glycolipids and glycoproteins associated with the cell membrane, where they serve as cell recognition factors. For example, carbohydrate residues in these oligosaccharides are the antigens of the ABO blood group substances (Fig. 27.23).

## B. Synthesis

Cerebrosides are synthesized from ceramide and UDP-glucose or UDP-galactose. They contain a single sugar (a monosaccharide). Gangliosides contain oligosaccharides produced from UDP-sugars and CMP-NANA, which is the precursor for

the NANA residues that branch from the linear chain. The synthesis of the sphingolipids is described in more detail in Chapter 31. Defects in the degradation of sphingolipids lead to the sphingolipidoses (also known as the gangliosidoses), as outlined in Table 27.5.

Sphingolipids are produced in the Golgi complex. Their lipid component becomes part of the membrane of the secretory vesicle that buds from the trans face of the Golgi. After the vesicle membrane fuses with the cell membrane, the lipid component of the glycolipid remains in the outer layer of the cell membrane, and the carbohydrate component extends into the extracellular space. Sometimes, the carbohydrate component is used as a recognition signal for foreign proteins; for example, cholera toxin (which affected Dennis V.; see Chapter 10) binds to the carbohydrate portion of the $\mathrm{GM}_{1}$-ganglioside to allow its catalytic subunit to enter the cell.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

AI M. AI M.'s pus culture, sent on the second day of his admission for fever from a cut on his arm, grew out S. aureus. This organism can be resistant to a variety of antibiotics, so TMP/sulfa treatment was initiated. Unfortunately, it appeared that Mr. M. had suffered an acute hemolysis (lysis or destruction of some of his red blood cells), probably induced by exposure to the sulfa drug and his infection with S. aureus. The hemoglobin that escaped from the lysed red blood cells was filtered by his kidneys and appeared in his urine.

By mechanisms that are not fully delineated, certain drugs (such as sulfa drugs and antimalarials), a variety of infectious agents, and exposure to fava beans can cause red blood cell destruction in individuals with a genetic deficiency of glucose 6-P dehydrogenase. Presumably, these patients cannot generate enough reduced NADPH to defend against the ROS. Although erythrocytes lack most of the

(1)The blood group substances are oligosaccharide components of glycolipids and glycoproteins found in most cell membranes. Those located on red blood cells have been studied extensively. A single genetic locus with two alleles determines an individual's blood type. These genes encode glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of the oligosaccharides of the blood group substances.

Most individuals can synthesize the H substance, an oligosaccharide that contains a fucose linked to a galactose at the nonreducing end of the blood group substance (see Fig. 27.23). Type A individuals produce an N -acetylgalactosamine transferase (encoded by the A gene) that attaches N -acetylgalactosamine to the galactose residue of the H substance. Type B individuals produce a galactosyltransferase (encoded by the $B$ gene) that links galactose to the galactose residue of the H substance. Type AB individuals have both alleles and produce both transferases. Thus, some of the oligosaccharides of their blood group substances contain N -acetylgalactosamine and some contain galactose. Type O individuals produce a defective transferase, and, therefore, they do not attach either N -acetylgalactosamine or galactose to the H substance. Thus, individuals of blood type O have only the H substance.

0Edna R. determined that a patient's blood type was AB. The new surgical resident was eager to give this patient a blood transfusion and, because AB blood is rare and an adequate amount was not available in the blood bank, he requested type A blood. Should Edna give him type A blood for his patient?
other enzymatic sources of NADPH for the glutathione antioxidant system, they do have the defense mechanisms provided by the antioxidant vitamins E and C and catalase. Thus, individuals who are not totally deficient in glucose 6-P dehydrogenase remain asymptomatic unless an additional oxidative stress, such as an infection, generates additional oxygen radicals.

Some drugs, such as the antimalarial primaquine and the sulfonamide that Mr. M. is taking, affect the ability of red blood cells to defend against oxidative stress. Fava beans, which look like fat string beans and are sometimes called broad beans, contain the purine glycosides vicine and isouramil. These compounds react with glutathione. It has been suggested that cellular levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) decrease to such an extent that critical sulfhydryl groups in some key proteins cannot be maintained in reduced form.

The highest prevalence rates for glucose 6-P dehydrogenase deficiency are found in tropical Africa and Asia, in some areas of the Middle East and the Mediterranean, and in Papua New Guinea. The geographic distribution of this deficiency is similar to that of sickle cell trait and is probably also related to the relative resistance it confers against the malaria parasite.

Because individuals with this deficiency are asymptomatic unless they are exposed to an "oxidant challenge," the clinical course of the hemolytic anemia is usually self-limited if the causative agent is removed. However, genetic polymorphism accounts for a substantial variability in the severity of the disease. Severely affected patients may have a chronic hemolytic anemia and other sequelae even without known exposure to drugs, infection, and other causative factors. In such patients, neonatal jaundice is also common and can be severe enough to cause death.

Al M.'s antibiotic was changed and his infection, and symptoms caused by the lack of glucose 6-P dehydrogenase deficiency, abated.

0Edna R. During her stint in the hospital blood bank, Edna R. learned that the importance of the ABO blood group system in transfusion therapy is based on two principles (Table 27.6): (1) Antibodies to A and to B antigens occur naturally in the blood serum of people whose red blood cell surfaces lack the corresponding antigen (i.e., individuals with A antigens on their red blood cells have B antibodies in their serum, and vice versa). These antibodies may arise as a result of previous exposure to cross-reacting antigens in bacteria and foods or to blood transfusions. (2) Antibodies to A and B are usually present in high titers and are capable of activating the entire complement system. As a result, these antibodies may cause intravascular destruction of a large number of incompatible red blood cells given inadvertently during a blood transfusion. Individuals with type AB blood have both A and B antigens and do not produce antibodies to either. Hence, they are "universal" recipients. They can safely receive red blood cells from individuals of A, $\mathrm{B}, \mathrm{AB}$, or O blood type. (However, they cannot safely receive serum from these individuals, because it contains antibodies to A or B antigens.) Those with type O blood do not have either antigen. They are "universal" donors; that is, their red cells can safely be infused into type $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{O}$, or AB individuals. (However, their serum contains antibodies to both A and B antigens and cannot be given safely to recipients with those antigens.)

TABLE 27.6 Characteristics of the ABO Blood Groups

| RED CELL TYPE | O | A | B | AB |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Possible genotypes | OO | AA or AO | BB or BO | AB |
| Antibodies in serum | Anti-A and B | Anti-B | Anti-A | None |
| Frequency (in whites) | $45 \%$ | $40 \%$ | $10 \%$ | $5 \%$ |
| Can accept blood types | O | A, O | B, O | A, B,AB, O |

The second important red blood cell group is the Rh group. It is important because one of its antigenic determinants, the D antigen, is a very potent immunogen, stimulating the production of a large number of antibodies. The unique carbohydrate composition of the glycoproteins that constitute the antigenic determinants on red blood cells in part contributes to the relative immunogenicity of the $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and $\mathrm{Rh}(\mathrm{D})$ red blood cell groups in human blood.

3Jay S. Tay-Sachs disease, the problem afflicting Jay S., is an autosomalrecessive disorder that is rare in the general population (1 in 300,000 births), but its prevalence in Jews of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) extraction (who make up $90 \%$ of the Jewish population in the United States) is much higher ( 1 in 3,600 births). One in 28 Ashkenazi Jews carries this defective gene. Its presence can be discovered by measuring the serum hexosaminidase A enzymatic activity or by recombinant DNA techniques.

Carriers of the affected gene have a reduced but functional level of this enzyme that normally hydrolyzes a specific bond between an $N$-acetyl-D-galactosamine and a D-galactose residue in the polar head of the ganglioside.

No effective therapy is available. Enzyme replacement has met with little success because of the difficulties in getting the enzyme across the blood-brain barrier.

Tay-Sachs disease, which is one of the gangliosidoses, is a multifaceted disorder. The sphingolipidoses, which include Fabry and Gaucher diseases, affect mainly the brain, the skin, and the reticuloendothelial system (e.g., liver and spleen). In these diseases, complex lipids accumulate. Each of these lipids contains a ceramide as part of its structure (see Table 27.5). The rate at which the lipid is synthesized is normal. However, the lysosomal enzyme required to degrade it is not very active, either because it is made in deficient quantities as a result of a mutation in a gene that specifically codes for the enzyme or because a critical protein required to activate the enzyme is deficient. Because the lipid cannot be degraded, it accumulates and causes degeneration of the affected tissues, with progressive malfunction, such as the psychomotor deficits that occur as a result of the central nervous system involvement seen in most of these storage diseases.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Biochemistry of Tay-Sachs Disease. Hexosaminidase A, the defective enzyme in Tay-Sachs disease, is actually composed of two subunits, an $\alpha$ and a $\beta$-chain. The stoichiometry is currently considered to be $\alpha \beta$ (a dimer). The $\alpha$-subunit is coded for by the HexA gene, whereas the $\beta$-subunit is coded for by the HexB gene. In Tay-Sachs disease, the $\alpha$-subunit is defective, and hexosaminidase A activity is lost. However, the $\beta$-subunit can form active dimers in the absence of the $\alpha$-subunit, and this activity, named hexosaminidase B , which cleaves the glycolipid globoside, retains activity in children with Tay-Sachs disease. Thus, children with Tay-Sachs disease accumulate the ganglioside $\mathrm{GM}_{2}$ but not globoside (Fig. 27.24).

Mutation of the HexB gene, and production of a defective $\beta$-subunit, leads to inactivation of both hexosaminidase A and B activity. Such a mutation leads to Sandhoff disease. Both activities are lost because both activities require a functional $\beta$-subunit. The clinical course of this disease is similar to Tay-Sachs but with an accelerated timetable because of the initial accumulation of both $\mathrm{GM}_{2}$ and globoside in the lysosomes.

A third type of mutation also can lead to disease symptoms similar to those of Tay-Sachs disease. Children were identified with Tay-Sachs symptoms, but when both hexosaminidase A and B activities were measured in a test tube, they were normal. This disease, ultimately named Sandhoff activator disease, is caused by a mutation in a protein that is needed to activate hexosaminidase A activity. In the absence of the activator, hexosaminidase A activity is minimal, and $\mathrm{GM}_{2}$ initially accumulates in lysosomes. This mutation has no effect on hexosaminidase B activity.

The patient could safely receive type A blood cells from another person because he has both A and B antigens on his own cells and does not have antibodies in his serum to either type A or B cells. However, he should not be given type A serum (or type A whole blood), because type A serum contains antibodies to type B antigens, which are present on his cells.

FIGURE 27.24 Substrate specificities of hexosaminidase A, B, and the function of the activator protein. Defects in the $\beta$-subunit inactivate both HexA and HexB activities, leading to $\mathrm{GM}_{1}$ and globoside accumulation. A defect in Sandhoff activator protein also leads to $\mathrm{GM}_{1}$ accumulation, as HexA activity is reduced. Defects in the $\alpha$-subunit inactivate only HexA activity, such that HexB activity toward globoside is unaffected. Gal, galactose; Glc, glucose; NAcGal, N-acetylgalactosamine.

When a glycolipid cannot be degraded because of an enzymatic mutation, it accumulates in residual bodies (vacuoles that contain material that lysosomal enzymes cannot digest). Normal cells contain a small number of residual bodies, but in diseases of lysosomal enzymes, large numbers of residual bodies accumulate within the cell, eventually interfering with normal cell function.

In $70 \%$ of the cases of Tay-Sachs disease in people of Ashkenazi Jewish background, exon 11 of the gene for the $\alpha$-chain of hexosaminidase A contains a mutation. The normal gene sequence encodes a protein with the amino acids Arg-Ile-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Pro-Asp in this region, as shown here:

$$
\begin{gathered}
5^{\prime}-\mathrm{CGTATATCCTATGGCCCTGAC} \\
\text { Arg-Ile-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Pro-Asp }
\end{gathered}
$$

The mutant DNA sequence for this area is

$$
\begin{gathered}
5^{\prime}-\mathrm{CGTATATCTATCCTATGGCCCTGAC} \\
\text { Arg-Ile-Ser-Ile-Leu-Trp-Pro-Stop }
\end{gathered}
$$

A four-base insertion (underlined) occurs in the mutated gene, which alters the reading frame of the protein and also introduces a premature stop codon farther down the protein, so no functional $\alpha$-subunit can be produced.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- The pentose phosphate pathway consists of both oxidative and nonoxidative reactions.
- The oxidative steps of the pentose phosphate pathway generate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and ribulose 5-phosphate from glucose 6-phosphate.
- Ribulose 5-phosphate is converted to ribose 5-phosphate for nucleotide biosynthesis.
- NADPH is used as reducing power for biosynthetic pathways.
- The nonoxidative steps of the pentose phosphate pathway reversibly convert five-carbon sugars to fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

- The needs of the cell dictate whether the cell will use the oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway, the non-oxidative reactions, or both sets of reactions.
- Reactions between sugars or the formation of sugar derivatives use sugars activated by attachment to nucleotides (a nucleotide sugar).
- Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose and UDP-galactose are substrates for many glycosyltransferase reactions.
- Lactose is formed from UDP-galactose and glucose.
- UDP-glucose is oxidized to UDP-glucuronate, which forms glucuronide derivatives of various hydrophobic compounds, making them more readily excreted in urine or bile than the parent compound.
- Glycoproteins and glycolipids contain various types of carbohydrate residues.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is B. Galactose metabolism requires the phosphorylation of galactose to galactose 1-P, which is then converted to UDP-galactose (which is the step that is defective in the patient), and then epimerized to UDP-glucose. Although the mother cannot convert galactose to lactose because of the enzyme deficiency, she can make UDP-glucose from glucose 6-P, and once she has made UDP-glucose, she can epimerize it to form UDP-galactose and can synthesize lactose (thus, A is incorrect). However, because of her enzyme deficiency, the mother cannot convert galactose 1-P to UDP-galactose or UDP-glucose, so the dietary galactose cannot be used for glycogen synthesis or glucose production (thus, C and D are incorrect). After ingesting milk, the galactose levels will be elevated in
the serum because of the metabolic block in the cells (thus, E is incorrect).
2. The answer is D. Nucleotide sugars, such as UDPglucose, UDP-galactose, and CMP-sialic acid, donate sugars to the growing carbohydrate chain. The other activated sugars listed do not contribute to glycolipid or glycoprotein synthesis.
3. The answer is C. Bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid residues to enhance its solubility. Glucuronic acid is glucose oxidized at position 6; gluconic acid is glucose oxidized at position 1 and is generated by the HMP shunt pathway. The activated form of glucuronic acid is UDP-glucuronate.
4. The answer is C. Glutamine donates the amide nitrogen to fructose 6-P to form glucosamine 6-P. None of

the other nitrogen-containing compounds (A, B, and D) donate their nitrogen to carbohydrates. Dolichol contains no nitrogens and is the carrier for carbohydrate chain synthesis of $N$-linked glycoproteins.
5. The answer is C. Sandhoff disease is a deficiency of both hexosaminidase A and B activity, resulting from loss of activity of the $\beta$-subunit in both of these enzymes. The degradative step at which amino sugars need to be removed from the glycolipids would be defective, such that globoside and $\mathrm{GM}_{2}$ accumulate in this disease. The other answers are incorrect; $\mathrm{GM}_{1}$ does contain an amino sugar, but it is converted to $\mathrm{GM}_{2}$ before the block in Sandhoff disease is apparent.
6. The answer is A. Galactose is phosphorylated by galactokinase and the galactose 1-P formed reacts with UDP-glucose to form glucose 1-P and UDP-galactose. The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is galactose 1-P uridylyltransferase. UDP-glucose is absolutely required for further galactose metabolism. UDP-glucose is formed from UTP and glucose 1-P by the enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, so a deficiency in this enzyme would lead to reduced galactose metabolism, caused by a lack of UDP-glucose. Galactose is phosphorylated by galactokinase, not by hexokinase. Glucose 6-P dehydrogenase is not required for galactose metabolism; it converts glucose 6-P to 6-phosphogluconate in the first step of the HMP shunt pathway. Triose kinase is also not required for galactose metabolism because this enzyme converts glyceraldehyde to glyceraldehyde 3-P. Pyruvate carboxylase is also not required for galactose metabolism, because it converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate.
7. The answer is D. Lactose synthase is composed of two subunits, a galactosyltransferase and $\alpha$-lactalbumin. In the absence of $\alpha$-lactalbumin, the galactosyltransferase is active in glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis but is relatively inactive for lactose synthesis. At birth, $\alpha$-lactalbumin is induced and alters the specificity of the galactosyltransferase such that lactose can now be synthesized. Because glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis was normal, the mutation could not be in the galactosyltransferase subunit. Lactase is the enzyme that digests lactose in the intestine, and a lactosyltransferase enzyme, if such an enzyme did exist, would not answer the question, because it would require lactose as a sub-
strate. A glucosyltransferase is not required for lactose synthesis (lactose synthase is).
8. The answer is B. The patient has glucose 6-P dehydrogenase deficiency and cannot generate NADPH from glucose 6-P. In the red blood cells, which lack mitochondria, this is the only pathway through which NADPH can be generated. In the absence of NADPH, the molecule which protects against oxidative damage (glutathione) is oxidized preferentially to protect membrane lipids and proteins. There is only limited glutathione in the membrane, so once it is oxidized, it needs to be converted back to reduced glutathione (the protective form). The enzyme that does this, glutathione reductase, requires NADPH to supply the electrons to reduce the oxidized glutathione. In the absence of NADPH, the glutathione cannot be reduced, and the protection offered by reduced glutathione is eliminated, leading to membrane damage and cell lysis. Because the life of a red cell is so short ( 120 days in circulation), there is usually sufficient glutathione to protect the cell in the absence of an exogenous oxidizing agent. However, once such an agent is present (such as a drug), the red cells are easily lysed, leading to the anemia. The hemolytic anemia is not caused by a lowering of hydrogen peroxide levels nor by an increase in the production of glucose 6-P.
9. The answer is D. A person with type AB blood would carry both the A and B antigens, so the blood cells would bind to antibodies directed against either the type A antigen or the type B antigen. Type O blood, which does not express either the type A or type B antigens, would not react with either antibody. Type A blood would react to antibodies to antigen A but not to antigen B. Type B blood would react to antibodies to antigen B but not to antibodies directed against antigen A.
10. The answer is B. The pentose phosphate pathway is operative in the cytosol of all cells because all cells require NADPH for reductive detoxification. NADPH is also used for fatty-acid synthesis and detoxification of medications. NADPH does not donate electrons to complex I of the electron-transfer chain, so oxidative phosphorylation would not be impaired. Fructose 6-P and glyceraldehyde 3-P can be generated via glycolysis; the pentose phosphate pathway is not required for their synthesis. NADPH is used for both biosynthetic reactions and to protect cells from ROS, not NADH (which is generated via glycolysis).

# Gluconeogenesis and Maintenance of Blood Glucose Levels 

During fasting, many of the reactions of glycolysis are reversed as the liver produces glucose to maintain blood glucose levels. This process of glucose production is called gluconeogenesis.

Gluconeogenesis, which occurs primarily in the liver, is the pathway for the synthesis of glucose from compounds other than carbohydrates. In humans, the major precursors of glucose are lactate, glycerol, and amino acids, particularly alanine. Except for three key sequences, the reactions of gluconeogenesis are reversals of the steps of glycolysis (Fig. 28.1). The sequences of gluconeogenesis that do not use enzymes of glycolysis involve the irreversible, regulated steps of glycolysis. These three sequences are the conversion of (1) pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), (2) fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate, and (3) glucose 6-phosphate to glucose.

Some tissues of the body, such as the brain and red blood cells, cannot synthesize glucose on their own but depend on glucose for energy. On a long-term basis, most tissues also require glucose for other functions, such as synthesis of the ribose moiety of nucleotides or the carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Therefore, to survive, humans must have mechanisms for maintaining blood glucose levels.

After a meal containing carbohydrates, blood glucose levels rise (Fig. 28.2). Some of the glucose from the diet is stored in the liver as glycogen. After 2 or 3 hours of fasting, this glycogen begins to be degraded by the process of glycogenolysis, and glucose is released into the blood. As glycogen stores decrease, adipose triacylglycerols are also degraded, providing fatty acids as an alternative fuel and glycerol for the synthesis of glucose by gluconeogenesis. Amino acids are also released from the muscle to serve as gluconeogenic precursors.

During an overnight fast, blood glucose levels are maintained by both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. However, after approximately 30 hours of fasting, liver glycogen stores are mostly depleted. Subsequently, gluconeogenesis is the only source of blood glucose.

Changes in the metabolism of glucose that occur during the switch from the fed to the fasting state are regulated by the hormones insulin and glucagon. Insulin is elevated in the fed state, and glucagon is elevated during fasting. Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose into certain cells such as those in muscle and adipose tissue. Insulin also alters the activity of key enzymes that regulate metabolism, stimulating the storage of fuels. Glucagon counters the effects of insulin, stimulating the release of stored fuels and the conversion of lactate, amino acids, and glycerol to glucose.

Blood glucose levels are maintained not only during fasting but also during exercise, when muscle cells take up glucose from the blood and oxidize it for energy. During exercise, the liver supplies glucose to the blood by the processes of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$AI M., a known alcoholic, was brought to the emergency department by his landlady, who stated that he had been drinking heavily for the past week. During this time, his appetite had gradually diminished, and he had not eaten any food for the past 3 days. He was confused, combative, tremulous, and sweating profusely. His speech was slurred. His heart rate was rapid (110 beats/ minute). As his blood pressure was being determined, he had a grand mal seizure. His blood glucose, drawn just before the onset of the seizure, was $28 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ or 1.6 mM (reference range for overnight fasting blood glucose, 80 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ or 4.4 to 5.6 mM ). His blood ethanol level drawn at the same time was $295 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (intoxication level, i.e., "confused" stage, 150 to $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ).

(1)Emma W. presented to the emergency department 3 days after being discharged from the hospital following a 7-day admission for a severe asthma exacerbation. She was intubated and required high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (a synthetic anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid) for the first 4 days of her stay. After 3 additional days on oral prednisone, she was discharged on substantial pharmacologic doses of this steroid and instructed to return to her physician's office in 5 days. She presented now with marked polyuria (increased urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), and muscle weakness. Her blood glucose was $275 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ or 15 mM (reference range, 80 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ or 4.4 to 5.6 mM ).

(2)Dianne A. took her morning insulin but then didn't feel well, so she did not eat and took a nap. When her friend came over later, she was unresponsive. The friend called an ambulance, and Dianne was rushed to the hospital emergency department in a coma. Her pulse and blood pressure at admission were normal. Her skin was flushed and slightly moist. Her respirations were slightly slow.

(3)Ann R. continues to resist efforts on the part of her psychiatrist and family physician to convince her to increase her caloric intake. Her body weight varies between 97 and 99 lb , far below the desirable weight for a woman who is 5 ft 7 in tall. In spite of her severe diet, her fasting blood glucose levels range from 55 to $70 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. She denies having any hypoglycemic symptoms.

(4)Otto S. has complied with his calorie-restricted diet and aerobic exercise program. He has lost another 7 lb and is closing in on his goal of weighing 154 lb . He notes increasing energy during the day, and he remains alert during lectures and assimilates the lecture material noticeably better than he did before starting his weight-loss and exercise program. He jogs for 45 minutes each morning before breakfast.

## I. Glucose Metabolism in the Liver

Glucose serves as a fuel for most tissues of the body. It is the major fuel for certain tissues such as the brain and red blood cells. After a meal, food is the source of blood glucose. The liver oxidizes glucose and stores the excess as glycogen. The liver also uses the pathway of glycolysis to convert glucose to pyruvate, which provides carbon for the synthesis of fatty acids. Glycerol 3-phosphate, produced from glycolytic intermediates, combines with fatty acids to form triacylglycerols, which are secreted into the blood in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL; explained further in Chapter 31). During fasting, the liver releases glucose into the blood, so that glucose-dependent tissues do not suffer from a lack of energy. Two mechanisms are involved in this process: glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

Hormones, particularly insulin and glucagon, dictate whether glucose flows through glycolysis or whether the reactions are reversed and glucose is produced via gluconeogenesis.

## II. Gluconeogenesis

Gluconeogenesis, the process by which glucose is synthesized from noncarbohydrate precursors, occurs mainly in the liver under fasting conditions. Under the more extreme conditions of starvation, the kidney cortex also may produce glucose. For the most part, the glucose produced by the kidney cortex is used by the kidney medulla, but some may enter the bloodstream.

Starting with pyruvate, most of the steps of gluconeogenesis are simply reversals of those of glycolysis (Fig. 28.3). In fact, these pathways differ at only three points. Enzymes involved in catalyzing these steps are regulated so that either glycolysis or gluconeogenesis predominates, depending on physiologic conditions.
![ma179181198a6](ma179181198a6.jpg)

(1)The measurement of ketones (acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate; see Chapter 3) in the blood and urine can indicate the level of starvation or the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). There are several methods to detect ketones. One is the use of reagent strips for urine (based on the reaction of sodium nitroprusside with acetoacetate), but this method does not detect the major blood ketone ( $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate). A cyclic enzymatic method has been developed to overcome this, in which blood or plasma samples are incubated with acetoacetate decarboxylase, which removes all acetoacetate from the sample (converting it to acetone and carbon dioxide). Once this has been accomplished, $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase is then incubated with the sample, along with thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (thio-NAD ${ }^{+}$). The thio-NAD ${ }^{+}$is converted to thio-NADH, generating a colored product and acetoacetate.Thio-NADH absorbs light at 405 nm , in the visible range, as compared to NADH, which absorbs at 340 nm , in the ultraviolet range. The use of thio-$\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$allows clinical laboratory instrumentation to be used. The acetoacetate is then recycled back to $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, in which NADH is converted to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. The $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate produced is then cycled back to acetoacetate, generating more thio-NADH. The cycling enhances the sensitivity of the assay. Once equilibrium is reached, one can calculate, from the change in absorbance per minute, the concentration of the $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate in the sample.

Comatose patients in DKA have the smell of acetone (a derivative of the ketone body acetoacetate) on their breath. In addition, DKA patients have deep, relatively rapid respirations typical of acidotic patients (Kussmaul respirations). These respirations result from an acidosis-induced stimulation of the respiratory center in the brain. More $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is exhaled in an attempt to reduce the amount of acid in the body: $\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (exhaled). These signs are not observed in a hypoglycemic coma.

The severe hyperglycemia of DKA also causes osmotic diuresis (i.e., glucose entering the urine carries water with it), which, in turn, causes a contraction of blood volume. Volume depletion may be aggravated by vomiting, which is common in patients with DKA. DKA may cause dehydration (dry skin), low blood pressure, and a rapid heartbeat. These respiratory and hemodynamic alterations are not seen in patients with hypoglycemic coma. The flushed, wet skin of hypoglycemic coma is in contrast to the dry skin observed in DKA.

Most of the steps of gluconeogenesis use the same enzymes that catalyze the process of glycolysis. The flow of carbon, of course, is in the reverse direction. Three reaction sequences of gluconeogenesis differ from the corresponding steps of glycolysis. They involve the conversion of pyruvate to PEP and the reactions that remove phosphate from fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fructose 1,6-bisP) to form fructose 6-phosphate (fructose 6-P) and from glucose 6-phosphate (glucose 6-P) to form glucose (see Fig. 28.3). The conversion of pyruvate to PEP is catalyzed during gluconeogenesis by a series of enzymes instead of the single enzyme used for glycolysis. The reactions that remove phosphate from fructose 1,6-bisP and from glucose 6-P each use single enzymes that differ from the corresponding enzymes of glycolysis. Although phosphate is added during glycolysis by kinases, which use adenosine triphosphate (ATP), it is removed during gluconeogenesis by phosphatases that release inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ via hydrolysis reactions.

## A. Precursors for Gluconeogenesis

The three major carbon sources for gluconeogenesis in humans are lactate, glycerol, and amino acids, particularly alanine. Lactate is produced by anaerobic glycolysis in tissues such as exercising muscle or red blood cells as well as by adipocytes during the fed state. Glycerol is released from adipose stores of triacylglycerol, and amino acids come mainly from amino acid pools in muscle, where they may be obtained by degradation of muscle protein. Alanine, the major gluconeogenic amino acid, is produced in the muscle from other amino acids and from glucose (see Chapter 37). Because ethanol metabolism only gives rise to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), the carbons of ethanol cannot be used for gluconeogenesis.

## B. Formation of Gluconeogenic Intermediates from Carbon Sources

The carbon sources for gluconeogenesis form pyruvate, intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, or intermediates that are common to both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) should be suspected if a venous plasma glucose level drawn regardless of when food was last eaten (a "random" sample of blood glucose) is "unequivocally elevated" (i.e., $>200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), particularly in a patient who manifests the classic signs and symptoms of chronic hyperglycemia (polydipsia, polyuria, blurred vision, headaches, rapid weight loss, sometimes accompanied by nausea and vomiting). To confirm the diagnosis, the patient should fast overnight ( 10 to 16 hours), and the blood glucose measurement should be repeated. Values of $<100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ are considered normal. Values $\geq 126 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ are indicative of DM. The level of glycosylated hemoglobin $\left(\mathrm{HbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}\right)$ also can be measured to make the diagnosis, and if $>6.5 \%$, it is diagnostic for DM. The levels of $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ can also gauge the extent of hyperglycemia over the past 4 to 8 weeks and is used to guide treatment. Values of fasting blood glucose between 100 and $125 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ are designated as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (or prediabetes), and further testing should be performed to determine whether these individuals will eventually develop overt DM. Individuals with blood glucose levels in this range have been defined as having "prediabetes." The determination that fasting blood glucose levels of $126 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, or a percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin of $>6.5 \%$, is diagnostic for DM is based on data indicating that at these levels of glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin, patients begin to develop complications of DM, specifically retinopathy.

The renal tubular transport maximum in the average healthy subject is such that glucose will not appear in the urine until the blood glucose level is $>180 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. As a result, reagent tapes (Tes-Tape or Dextrostix) designed to detect the presence of glucose in the urine are not sensitive enough to establish a diagnosis of early DM.

## I. Lactate, Amino Acids, and Glycerol

Pyruvate is produced in the liver from the gluconeogenic precursors lactate and alanine. Lactate dehydrogenase oxidizes lactate to pyruvate, generating reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) (Fig. 28.4A), and alanine aminotransferase converts alanine to pyruvate (see Fig. 28.4B).

Although alanine is the major gluconeogenic amino acid, other amino acids, such as serine, serve as carbon sources for the synthesis of glucose because they also form pyruvate, the substrate for the initial step in the process. Some amino acids form intermediates of the TCA cycle (see Chapter 23), which can enter the gluconeogenic pathway.

The carbons of glycerol are gluconeogenic because they form dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), a glycolytic intermediate (see Fig. 28.4C).

## 2. Propionate

Fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms, which are obtained mainly from vegetables in the diet, produce propionyl coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA) from the three carbons at the $\omega$-end of the chain (see Chapter 30). These carbons are relatively minor precursors of glucose in humans. Propionyl-CoA is converted to methylmalonyl coenzyme A (methylmalonyl-CoA), which is rearranged to form succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA), a four-carbon intermediate of the TCA cycle that can be used for gluconeogenesis. The remaining carbons of an odd-chain fatty acid form acetyl-CoA, from which no net synthesis of glucose occurs. In some species, propionate is a major source of carbon for gluconeogenesis. Ruminants can produce massive amounts of glucose from propionate. In cows, the cellulose in grass is converted to propionate by bacteria in the rumen. This substrate is then used to generate more than 5 lb of glucose each day by the process of gluconeogenesis.
$\beta$-Oxidation of fatty acids produces acetyl-CoA (see Chapter 30). Because the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction is thermodynamically and kinetically irreversible, acetyl-CoA does not form pyruvate for gluconeogenesis. Therefore, if acetyl-CoA is to produce glucose, it must enter the TCA cycle and be converted to malate. For every two carbons of acetyl-CoA that are converted to malate, two carbons are

Glucocorticoids are naturally occurring steroid hormones. In humans, the major glucocorticoid is cortisol. Glucocorticoids are produced in the adrenal cortex in response to various types of stress (see Chapter 41). One of their actions is to stimulate the degradation of muscle protein. Thus, increased amounts of amino acids become available as substrates for gluconeogenesis. Emma W. noted muscle weakness, a result of the muscle-degrading action of the synthetic glucocorticoid prednisone, which she was taking for its anti-inflammatory effects.

# C. Pathway of Gluconeogenesis 

Gluconeogenesis occurs by a pathway that reverses many, but not all, of the steps of glycolysis.

## I. Conversion of Pyruvate to Phosphoenolpyruvate

In glycolysis, PEP is converted to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase. In gluconeogenesis, a series of steps is required to accomplish the reversal of this reaction (Fig. 28.5). Pyruvate is carboxylated by pyruvate carboxylase to form oxaloacetate (OAA). This enzyme, which requires biotin, is the catalyst of an anaplerotic (refilling) reaction

FIGURE 28.5 Conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the liver. Follow the shaded circled numbers on the diagram, starting with the precursors alanine and lactate. The first step is the conversion of alanine and lactate to pyruvate. Pyruvate then enters the mitochondria and is converted to oxaloacetate (OAA) (circle 2) by pyruvate carboxylase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase has been inactivated by both the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and acetyl coenzyme A generated from fatty acid oxidation, which allows OAA production for gluconeogenesis. The OAA formed in the mitochondria is converted to either malate or aspartate to enter the cytoplasm via the malate/aspartate shuttle. In the cytoplasm, the malate or aspartate is converted back into OAA (circle 3), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase converts it to PEP (circle 4). The PEP formed is not converted to pyruvate because pyruvate kinase has been inactivated by phosphorylation by the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase under these conditions. The white circled numbers are alternative routes for exit of carbon from the mitochondrion using the malate/aspartate shuttle.

of the TCA cycle (see Chapter 23). In gluconeogenesis, this reaction replenishes the OAA that is used for the synthesis of glucose (Fig. 28.6).

The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that was added to pyruvate to form OAA is released in the reaction catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), which generates PEP (Fig. 28.7A). For this reaction, guanosine triphosphate (GTP) provides a source of energy as well as the phosphate group of PEP. Pyruvate carboxylase is found in mitochondria. In various species, PEPCK is located either in the cytosol or in mitochondria, or it is distributed between these two compartments. In humans, the enzyme is distributed about equally in each compartment.

OAA, generated from pyruvate by pyruvate carboxylase or from amino acids that form intermediates of the TCA cycle, does not readily cross the mitochondrial membrane. It is either decarboxylated to form PEP by the mitochondrial PEPCK or it is converted to malate or aspartate (see Fig. 28.7B and C). The conversion of OAA to malate requires NADH. PEP, malate, and aspartate can be transported into the cytosol.

After malate or aspartate traverses the mitochondrial membrane (acting as a carrier of OAA) and enters the cytosol, it is reconverted to OAA by reversal of the reactions given previously (see Fig. 28.7B and C). The conversion of malate to OAA generates NADH. Whether OAA is transported across the mitochondrial membrane as malate or aspartate depends on the need for reducing equivalents in the cytosol. NADH is required to reduce 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (glyceraldehyde 3-P) during gluconeogenesis.

OAA, produced from malate or aspartate in the cytosol, is converted to PEP by the cytosolic PEPCK (see Fig. 28.7A).

0Excessive ethanol metabolism blocks the production of gluconeogenic precursors. Cells have limited amounts of NAD, which exists either as $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$or as NADH. As the levels of NADH rise, those of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$fall, and the ratio of the concentrations of NADH and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ ([NADH]/[NAD+]) increases. In the presence of ethanol, which is very rapidly oxidized in the liver, the $[\mathrm{NADH}] /\left[\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right]$ratio is much higher than it is in the normal fasting liver (see Chapter 33). High levels of NADH drive the lactate dehydrogenase reaction toward lactate. Therefore, lactate cannot enter the gluconeogenic pathway, and pyruvate that is generated from alanine is converted to lactate. Because glycerol is oxidized by $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$during its conversion to DHAP, the conversion of glycerol to glucose is also inhibited when NADH levels are elevated. Consequently, the major precursors lactate, alanine, and glycerol are not used for gluconeogenesis under conditions in which alcohol metabolism is high.

Acetaldehyde
![ma186181198a6](ma186181198a6.jpg)

Only the three carbons at the $\omega$-end of an odd-chain fatty acid that form propionyl-CoA are converted to glucose. The remaining 16 carbons of a fatty acid with 19 carbons form acetyl-CoA, which does not form any net glucose.

# 2. Conversion of Phosphoenolpyruvate to Fructose 1,6-Bisphosphate 

The remaining steps of gluconeogenesis occur in the cytosol (Fig. 28.8). Starting with PEP as a substrate, the steps of glycolysis are reversed to form glyceraldehyde 3-P. For every two molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-P that are formed, one is converted to DHAP. These two triose phosphates, DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-P, condense to form fructose 1,6-bisP by a reversal of the aldolase reaction. Because glycerol forms DHAP, it enters the gluconeogenic pathway at this level.

## 3. Conversion of Fructose 1,6-Bisphosphate to Fructose 6-Phosphate

The enzyme fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase releases inorganic phosphate from fructose 1,6 -bisP to form fructose 6-P. This is not a reversal of the phosphofructoki-nase-1 (PFK-1) reaction; ATP is not produced when the phosphate is removed from the 1-position of fructose 1,6-bisP because that is a low-energy phosphate bond.
![ma187181198a6](ma187181198a6.jpg)

FIGURE 28.8 Conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate and glycerol to glucose. Gluconeogenic reactions are indicated by the red arrows. Glucokinase is inactive because of the low levels of glucose in the cell (below the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for glucokinase), whereas phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) is inactive because of the low concentration of the allosteric activators adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, coupled to high concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), an allosteric inhibitor.

Rather, inorganic phosphate is released in this hydrolysis reaction. In the next reaction of gluconeogenesis, fructose 6-P is converted to glucose 6-P by the same isomerase used in glycolysis (phosphoglucoisomerase).

## 4. Conversion of Glucose 6-Phosphate to Glucose

Glucose 6-phosphatase hydrolyzes P , from glucose 6-P, and free glucose is released into the blood. As with fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, this is not a reversal of the glucokinase reaction because the phosphate bond in glucose 6-P is a low-energy bond, and ATP is not generated at this step.

Glucose 6-phosphatase is located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. It is used not only in gluconeogenesis but also to produce blood glucose from the breakdown of liver glycogen.

## D. Regulation of Gluconeogenesis

Although gluconeogenesis occurs during fasting, it is also stimulated during prolonged exercise, by a high-protein diet, and under conditions of stress. The factors that promote the overall flow of carbon from pyruvate to glucose include the availability of substrate and changes in the activity or amount of certain key enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

## I. Availability of Substrate

Gluconeogenesis is stimulated by the flow of its major substrates (glycerol, lactate, and amino acids) from peripheral tissues to the liver. Glycerol is released from adipose tissue whenever the levels of insulin are low and the levels of glucagon or the "stress" hormones, epinephrine and cortisol (a glucocorticoid), are elevated in the blood (see Chapter 19). Lactate is produced by muscle during exercise and by red blood cells. Amino acids are released from muscle whenever insulin is low or when cortisol is elevated. Amino acids are also available for gluconeogenesis when the dietary intake of protein is high and intake of carbohydrate is low.

## 2. Activity or Amount of Key Enzymes

Three sequences in the pathway of gluconeogenesis are regulated:

1. Pyruvate $\rightarrow$ PEP
2. Fructose 1,6-bisP $\rightarrow$ fructose 6-P
3. Glucose 6-P $\rightarrow$ glucose

These steps correspond to those in glycolysis that are catalyzed by regulatory enzymes. The enzymes involved in these steps of gluconeogenesis differ from those that catalyze the reverse reactions in glycolysis. The net flow of carbon, whether from glucose to pyruvate (glycolysis) or from pyruvate to glucose (gluconeogenesis), depends on the relative activity or amount of these glycolytic or gluconeogenic enzymes (Fig. 28.9 and Table 28.1).

## 3. Conversion of Pyruvate to Phosphoenolpyruvate

Pyruvate, a key substrate for gluconeogenesis, is derived from lactate and amino acids, particularly alanine. Pyruvate is not converted to acetyl-CoA under conditions that favor gluconeogenesis because pyruvate dehydrogenase is relatively inactive. Instead, pyruvate is converted to OAA by pyruvate carboxylase. Subsequently, OAA is converted to PEP by PEPCK. The following is a description of activity states of enzymes under which PEP will be used to form glucose rather than pyruvate.

- Pyruvate dehydrogenase is inactive. Under conditions of fasting, insulin levels are low and glucagon levels are elevated. Consequently, fatty acids and glycerol are released from the triacylglycerol stores of adipose tissue. Fatty acids travel to the liver, where they undergo $\beta$-oxidation, producing acetylCoA, NADH, and ATP (see Chapter 31). As a consequence, the concentration of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) decreases. These changes result in the

(1)Al M. had not eaten for 3 days, so he had no dietary source of glucose and his liver glycogen stores were essentially depleted. He was solely dependent on gluconeogenesis to maintain his blood glucose levels. One of the consequences of ethanol ingestion and the subsequent rise in NADH levels is that the major carbon sources for gluconeogenesis cannot readily be converted to glucose (the high NADH/NAD+ ratio favors lactate formation from pyruvate, malate formation from OAA, and glycerol 3-P formation from DHAP). Intermediates of the TCA cycle derived from amino acids are converted to malate, which enters the cytosol and is converted to OAA, which proceeds through gluconeogenesis to form glucose. When excessive amounts of ethanol are ingested, elevated NADH levels inhibit the conversion of malate to OAA in the cytosol. During his alcoholic binges, Al M. became hypoglycemic. His blood glucose level was $28 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase to the inactive form. Therefore, pyruvate is not converted to acetyl-CoA (see Chapter 30).

- Pyruvate carboxylase is active. Acetyl-CoA, which is produced by oxidation of fatty acids, activates pyruvate carboxylase. Therefore, pyruvate, derived from lactate or alanine, is converted to OAA. Acetyl-CoA levels, then, reciprocally regulate pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase. High levels of acetyl-CoA inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase while activating pyruvate carboxylase.
- Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is induced. OAA produces PEP in a reaction catalyzed by PEPCK. Cytosolic PEPCK is an inducible enzyme, which means that the quantity of the enzyme in the cell increases because of increased transcription of its gene and increased translation of its messenger RNA (mRNA). The major inducer is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which is increased by hormones that activate adenylate cyclase. Adenylate cyclase produces cAMP from ATP. Glucagon is the hormone that causes cAMP to rise during fasting, whereas epinephrine acts during exercise or stress. cAMP activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates a set of specific transcription factors (cAMP response element-binding protein

[CREB]) that stimulate transcription of the PEPCK gene (see Chapter 16 and Fig. 16.17). Increased synthesis of mRNA for PEPCK results in increased synthesis of the enzyme. Cortisol, the major human glucocorticoid, also induces PEPCK but through a different regulatory site on the PEPCK promoter.

- Pyruvate kinase is inactive. When glucagon is elevated, liver pyruvate kinase is phosphorylated and inactivated by a mechanism that involves cAMP and protein kinase A. Therefore, PEP is not reconverted to pyruvate. Rather, it continues along the pathway of gluconeogenesis. If PEP were reconverted to pyruvate, these substrates would simply cycle, causing a net loss of energy with no net generation of useful products. The inactivation of pyruvate kinase prevents such futile cycling and promotes the net synthesis of glucose.


## 4. Conversion of Fructose 1,6-Bisphosphate to Fructose 6-Phosphate

The carbons of PEP reverse the steps of glycolysis, forming fructose 1,6-bisP. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase acts on this bisphosphate to release inorganic phosphate and produce fructose 6-P. A futile substrate cycle is prevented at this step because, under conditions that favor gluconeogenesis, the concentrations of the compounds that activate the glycolytic enzyme PFK-1 are low. These same compounds, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (fructose 2,6-bisP; whose levels are regulated by insulin and glucagon) and AMP, are allosteric inhibitors of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. When the concentrations of these allosteric effectors are low, PFK-1 is less active, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is more active, and the net flow of carbon is toward fructose 6-P and, thus, toward glucose. The synthesis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is also induced during fasting.

## 5. Conversion of Glucose 6-Phosphate to Glucose

Glucose 6-phosphatase catalyzes the conversion of glucose 6-P to glucose, which is released from the liver cell (Fig. 28.10). The glycolytic enzyme glucokinase, which catalyzes the reverse reaction, is relatively inactive during gluconeogenesis. Glucokinase, which has a high $S_{0.5}\left(K_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ for glucose (see Chapter 9, Fig. 9.4), is not very active during fasting because the blood glucose level is lower ( $\sim 5 \mathrm{mM}$ ) than the $S_{0.5}$ of the enzyme.

FIGURE 28.II Blood glucose concentrations at various times after a meal.

Glucokinase is also an inducible enzyme. The concentration of the enzyme increases in the fed state, when blood glucose and insulin levels are elevated, and decreases in the fasting state, when glucose and insulin are low.

## E. Energy Is Required for the Synthesis of Glucose

During the gluconeogenic reactions, 6 mol of high-energy phosphate bonds are cleaved. Two moles of pyruvate are required for the synthesis of 1 mol of glucose. As 2 mol of pyruvate are carboxylated by pyruvate carboxylase, 2 mol of ATP are hydrolyzed. PEPCK requires 2 mol of GTP (the equivalent of 2 mol of ATP) to convert 2 mol of OAA to 2 mol of PEP. An additional 2 mol of ATP are used when 2 mol of 3-phosphoglycerate are phosphorylated, forming 2 mol of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Energy in the form of reducing equivalents (NADH) is also required for the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to glyceraldehyde 3-P. Under fasting conditions, the energy required for gluconeogenesis is obtained from $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids. Defects in fatty acid oxidation can lead to hypoglycemia in part because of reduced fatty acid-derived energy production within the liver.

## III. Changes in Blood Glucose Levels after a Meal

After a high-carbohydrate meal, blood glucose rises from a fasting level of approximately 80 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(\sim 5 \mathrm{mM})$ to a level of approximately 120 to $140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ $(8 \mathrm{mM})$ within a period of 30 minutes to 1 hour (Fig. 28.11). The concentration of glucose in the blood then begins to decrease, returning to the fasting range by approximately 2 hours after the meal (see also Chapter 19).

Blood glucose levels increase as dietary glucose is digested and absorbed. The values go no higher than approximately $140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in a normal, healthy person because tissues take up glucose from the blood, storing it for subsequent use and oxidizing it for energy. After the meal is digested and absorbed, blood glucose levels decline because cells continue to metabolize glucose.

If blood glucose levels continued to rise after a meal, the high concentration of glucose would cause the release of water from tissues as a result of the osmotic effect of glucose. Tissues would become dehydrated, and their function would be affected. If hyperglycemia becomes severe, a hyperosmolar coma could result from dehydration of the brain.

Conversely, if blood glucose levels continued to drop after a meal, tissues that depend on glucose would suffer from a lack of energy. If blood glucose levels dropped abruptly, the brain would not be able to produce an adequate amount of ATP. Light-headedness and dizziness would result, followed by drowsiness and, eventually, coma. Red blood cells would not be able to produce enough ATP to maintain the integrity of their membranes. Hemolysis of these cells would decrease the transport of oxygen to the tissues of the body. Eventually, all tissues that rely on oxygen for energy production would fail to perform their normal functions. If the problem were severe enough, death could result.

Devastating consequences of glucose excess or insufficiency are normally avoided because the body is able to regulate its blood glucose levels. As the concentration of blood glucose approaches the normal fasting range of 80 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ roughly 2 hours after a meal, the process of glycogenolysis is activated in the liver. Liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose during the first few hours of fasting. Subsequently, gluconeogenesis begins to play a role as an additional source of blood glucose. The carbon for gluconeogenesis, a process that occurs in the liver, is supplied by other tissues. Exercising muscle and red blood cells provide lactate through glycolysis, muscle also provides amino acids by degradation of protein, and glycerol is released from adipose tissue as triacylglycerol stores are mobilized.

Even during a prolonged fast, blood glucose levels do not decrease dramatically. After 5 to 6 weeks of starvation, blood glucose levels decrease to only approximately $65 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (Table 28.2).

## A. Blood Glucose Levels in the Fed State

The major factors involved in regulating blood glucose levels are the blood glucose concentration itself and hormones, particularly insulin and glucagon.

As blood glucose levels rise after a meal, the increased glucose concentration stimulates the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas to release insulin (Fig. 28.12). Certain amino acids, particularly arginine and leucine, also stimulate insulin release from the pancreas.

Blood levels of glucagon, which is secreted by the $\alpha$-cells of the pancreas, may increase or decrease, depending on the content of the meal. Glucagon levels decrease in response to a high-carbohydrate meal, but they increase in response to a high-protein meal. After a typical mixed meal containing carbohydrate, protein, and fat, glucagon levels remain relatively constant, whereas insulin levels increase.

## I. Fate of Dietary Glucose in the Liver

After a meal, the liver oxidizes glucose to meet its immediate energy needs. Any excess glucose is converted to stored fuels. Glycogen is synthesized and stored in the liver, and glucose is converted to fatty acids and to the glycerol moiety that reacts with the fatty acids to produce triacylglycerols. These triacylglycerols are packaged in VLDL (see Chapter 29) and transported to adipose tissue, where the fatty acids are stored in adipose triacylglycerols. The VLDL can also deliver triglycerides (fatty acids) to the muscle for immediate oxidation, if required.

Regulatory mechanisms control the conversion of glucose to stored fuels. As the concentration of glucose increases in the hepatic portal vein, the concentration of glucose in the liver may increase from the fasting level of 80 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(\sim 5 \mathrm{mM})$ to a concentration of 180 to $360 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( 10 to 20 mM ). Consequently, the velocity of the glucokinase reaction increases because this enzyme has a high $S_{0.5}\left(K_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ for glucose (see Fig. 9.4). Glucokinase is also induced by a high-carbohydrate diet; the quantity of the enzyme increases in response to elevated insulin levels.

Insulin promotes the storage of glucose as glycogen by countering the effects of glucagon-stimulated phosphorylation. The response to insulin activates the phosphatases that dephosphorylate glycogen synthase (which leads to glycogen synthase activation) and glycogen phosphorylase (which leads to inhibition of the enzyme) (Fig. 28.13A). Insulin also promotes the synthesis of the triacylglycerols that are released from the liver into the blood as VLDL. The regulatory mechanisms for this process are described in Chapter 31.

## 2. Fate of Dietary Glucose in Peripheral Tissues

Almost every cell in the body oxidizes glucose for energy. Certain critical tissues, particularly the brain, other nervous system tissues, and red blood cells, depend especially on glucose for their energy supply. The brain requires approximately 150 g of glucose per day. In addition, approximately 40 g of glucose per day is required by other glucose-dependent tissues. Furthermore, all tissues require glucose for the pentose phosphate pathway, and many tissues use glucose for synthesis of glycoproteins and other carbohydrate-containing compounds.

When Dianne A. inadvertently injected insulin without eating, she caused an acute reduction in her blood glucose levels 1 to 2 hours later. Had she been awake, she would have first experienced symptoms caused by hypoglycemia-induced hyperactivity of her sympathetic nervous system (e.g., sweating, tremulousness, palpitations). Eventually, as her hypoglycemia became more profound, she would have experienced symptoms of neuroglycopenia (inadequate glucose supply to the brain), such as confusion, speech disturbances, emotional instability, possible seizure activity, and, finally, coma.

Ann R. who is recovering from anorexia nervosa and whose intake of glucose and of glucose precursors has been severely restricted, has not developed any of these manifestations. Her lack of hypoglycemic symptoms can be explained by the very gradual reduction of her blood glucose levels as a consequence of near-starvation and her ability to maintain blood glucose levels within an acceptable fasting range through hepatic gluconeogenesis. In addition, lipolysis of adipose triacylglycerols produces fatty acids, which are used as fuel and converted to ketone bodies by the liver. The oxidation of fatty acids and ketone bodies by the brain and muscle reduces the need for blood glucose.

In Dianne A.'s case, the excessive dose of insulin inhibited lipolysis and ketone body synthesis, so these alternative fuels were not available to spare blood glucose. The rapidity with which hypoglycemia was induced could not be compensated for quickly enough by hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, which are inhibited by the insulin, and hypoglycemia ensued.

An immediate fingerstick revealed that Dianne's capillary blood glucose level was $<20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. An intravenous infusion of a 50\% solution of glucose was started, and her blood glucose level was determined frequently. When Di regained consciousness, the intravenous solution was eventually changed to $10 \%$ glucose. After 6 hours, her blood glucose levels stayed in the upper-normal range, and she was able to tolerate oral feedings. By the next morning, her previous diabetes treatment regimen could be reestablished. The reasons that she had developed hypoglycemic coma were explained to Di, and she was discharged to the care of her family doctor.

Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose into adipose and muscle cells by promoting the recruitment of glucose transporters to the cell membrane (see Fig. 28.13C). Other tissues, such as the liver, brain, and red blood cells, have a different type of glucose transporter that is not as significantly affected by insulin.

In muscle, glycogen is synthesized after a meal by a mechanism similar to that in the liver (see Fig. 28.13B). Metabolic differences exist between these tissues (see Chapter 26), but, in essence, insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis in resting muscle as it does in the liver. A key difference between muscle and liver is that insulin greatly stimulates the transport of glucose into muscle cells but only slightly stimulates its transport into liver cells.

## 3. Return of Blood Glucose to Fasting Levels

After a meal has been digested and absorbed, blood glucose levels reach a peak and then begin to decline. The uptake of dietary glucose by cells, particularly those in the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, lowers blood glucose levels. By 2 hours after a meal, blood glucose levels return to the normal fasting level of $<100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

## B. Blood Glucose Levels in the Fasting State

## I. Changes in Insulin and Glucagon Levels

During fasting, as blood glucose levels decrease, insulin levels decrease and glucagon levels rise. These hormonal changes cause the liver to degrade glycogen by the process of glycogenolysis and to produce glucose by the process of gluconeogenesis so that blood glucose levels are maintained.

## 2. Stimulation of Glycogenolysis

Within a few hours after a high-carbohydrate meal, glucagon levels begin to rise. Glucagon binds to cell surface receptors and activates adenylate cyclase, causing cAMP levels in liver cells to rise (see Fig. 26.7). cAMP activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates and inactivates glycogen synthase. Therefore, glycogen synthesis decreases.

At the same time, protein kinase A stimulates glycogen degradation by a twostep mechanism. Protein kinase A phosphorylates and activates phosphorylase kinase. This enzyme, in turn, phosphorylates and activates glycogen phosphorylase.

Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the phosphorolysis of glycogen, producing glucose 1-phosphate, which is converted to glucose 6-P. Dephosphorylation of glu-$\operatorname{cos} 6-\mathrm{P}$ by glucose 6 -phosphatase produces free glucose, which then enters the blood.

## 3. Stimulation of Gluconeogenesis

By 4 hours after a meal, the liver is supplying glucose to the blood not only by the process of glycogenolysis but also by the process of gluconeogenesis. Hormonal changes cause peripheral tissues to release precursors that provide carbon for gluconeogenesis, specifically lactate, amino acids, and glycerol.

Regulatory mechanisms promote the conversion of gluconeogenic precursors to glucose (Fig. 28.14). These mechanisms prevent the occurrence of potential futile cycles, which would continuously convert substrates to products while consuming energy but producing no useful result.

These regulatory mechanisms inactivate the glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase, PFK-1, and glucokinase during fasting and promote the flow of carbon to glucose via gluconeogenesis. These mechanisms operate at the three steps where glycolysis and gluconeogenesis differ:

1. Pyruvate (derived from lactate and alanine) is converted by the gluconeogenic pathway to PEP. PEP is not reconverted to pyruvate (a potentially futile cycle) because glucagon-stimulated phosphorylation inactivates pyruvate kinase. Therefore, PEP reverses the steps of glycolysis and forms fructose 1,6-bisP.
2. Fructose 1,6-bisP is converted to fructose 6-P by a bisphosphatase. Because the glycolytic enzyme PFK-1 is relatively inactive, mainly as a result of low fructose 2,6-bisP levels, fructose 6-P is not converted back to fructose 1,6-bisP, and a second potential futile cycle is avoided. The low fructose 2,6-bisP levels are attributable in part to the phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase-2 by protein kinase A, which has been activated in response to glucagon. Fructose 6-P is converted to glucose 6-P.
3. Glucose 6-P is dephosphorylated by glucose 6-phosphatase, forming free glucose. Because glucokinase has a high $S_{0.5}\left(K_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ for glucose, and glucose concentrations are relatively low in liver cells during fasting,

The pathophysiology leading to an elevation of blood glucose after a meal differs between patients with type I DM and those with type 2 DM. Dianne A., who has type I disease, cannot secrete insulin adequately in response to a meal because of a defect in the $\beta$-cells of her pancreas. Deborah S., however, has type 2 disease. In this form of the disorder, the cause of glucose intolerance is more complex, involving at least a delay in the release of relatively appropriate amounts of insulin after a meal combined with a degree of resistance to the actions of insulin in skeletal muscle and adipocytes. Excessive hepatic gluconeogenesis occurs even though blood glucose levels are elevated.

glucose is released into the blood. Therefore, the third potential futile cycle does not occur.
4. Enzymes that participate in gluconeogenesis, but not in glycolysis, are active under fasting conditions. Pyruvate carboxylase is activated by acetyl-CoA, derived from oxidation of fatty acids. PEPCK, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, and glucose 6-phosphatase are induced; that is, the quantity of the enzymes increases. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is also active because levels of fructose 2,6-bisP, an inhibitor of the enzyme, are low.

# 4. Stimulation of Lipolysis 

The hormonal changes that occur during fasting stimulate the breakdown of adipose triacylglycerols (see Chapters 3, 31, and 41). Consequently, fatty acids and glycerol are released into the blood (Fig. 28.15). Glycerol serves as a source of carbon for gluconeogenesis. Fatty acids become the major fuel of the body and are oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ by various tissues, which enables these tissues to decrease their use of glucose. Fatty acids are also oxidized to acetyl-CoA in the liver to provide energy for gluconeogenesis. In a prolonged fast, acetyl-CoA is converted to ketone bodies, which enter the blood and serve as an additional fuel source for the muscle and the brain.

# C. Blood Glucose Levels during Prolonged Fasting (Starvation) 

During prolonged fasting, several changes occur in fuel use. These changes cause tissues to use less glucose than they use during a brief fast and to use predominantly fuels derived from adipose triacylglycerols (i.e., fatty acids and their derivatives, the ketone bodies). Therefore, blood glucose levels do not decrease drastically. In fact, even after 5 to 6 weeks of starvation, blood glucose levels are still in the range of $65 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (Fig. 28.16; see Table 28.2).

The major change that occurs in starvation is a dramatic elevation of blood ketone body levels after 3 to 5 days of fasting (see Fig. 28.16). At these levels, the brain and other nervous tissues begin to use ketone bodies, and consequently, they oxidize less glucose, requiring roughly one-third as much glucose ( $\sim 40 \mathrm{~g} /$ day) as under normal dietary conditions. As a result of reduced glucose use, the rate of gluconeogenesis in the liver decreases, as does the production of urea (see Fig. 28.16). Because in this stage of starvation amino acids, obtained from the degradation of existing proteins, are the major gluconeogenic precursor, reducing glucose requirements in tissues reduces the rate of protein degradation and hence the rate of urea formation. Protein from muscle and other tissues is, therefore, spared because there is less need for amino acids for gluconeogenesis.

Body protein, particularly muscle protein, is not primarily a storage form of fuel in the same sense as glycogen or triacylglycerol; proteins have many functions besides fuel storage. For example, proteins function as enzymes, as structural proteins, and in muscle contraction. If tissue protein is degraded to too great an extent, body function can be severely compromised. If starvation continues and no other problems, such as infections, occur, a starving individual usually dies because of severe protein loss that causes malfunction of major organs such as the heart. Therefore, the increase in ketone body levels that results in the sparing of body protein allows individuals to survive for extended periods without ingesting food.

## D. Summary of Sources of Blood Glucose

Immediately after a meal, dietary carbohydrates serve as the major source of blood glucose (Fig. 28.17). As blood glucose levels return to the fasting range within 2 hours after a meal, glycogenolysis is stimulated and begins to supply glucose to the blood. Subsequently, glucose is also produced by gluconeogenesis.

During a 12-hour fast, glycogenolysis is the major source of blood glucose. Thus, it is the major pathway by which glucose is produced in the basal state (after a 12-hour fast). However, by approximately 16 hours of fasting, glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis contribute equally to the maintenance of blood glucose.

By 30 hours after a meal, liver glycogen stores are substantially depleted. Subsequently, gluconeogenesis is the primary source of blood glucose.

The mechanisms that cause fats to be used as the major fuel and that allow blood glucose levels to be maintained during periods of food deprivation result in the conservation of body protein and, consequently, permit survival during prolonged fasting for periods often exceeding 1 month or more.

## E. Blood Glucose Levels during Exercise

During exercise, mechanisms very similar to those that are used during fasting operate to maintain blood glucose levels. The liver maintains blood glucose levels through both glucagon- and epinephrine-induced glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The use of fuels by muscle during exercise, including the uptake and use of blood glucose, is discussed in Chapter 45. Recall that muscle glycogen is not used to maintain blood glucose levels; muscle cells lack glucose 6-phosphatase, so glucose cannot be produced from glucose 6-P for export.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

AI M. The chronic excessive ingestion of ethanol concurrent with a recent reduction in nutrient intake caused AI M.'s blood glucose level to decrease to $28 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. This degree of hypoglycemia caused the release of several "counterregulatory" hormones into the blood, including glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, and epinephrine (adrenaline).

Some of the patient's signs and symptoms are primarily the result of an increase in adrenergic nervous system activity after a rapid decrease in blood glucose. The subsequent increase in epinephrine levels in the blood leads to tremulousness, excessive sweating, and rapid heart rate. Other manifestations arise when the brain has insufficient glucose, hence the term neuroglycopenic symptoms. Mr. M. was confused

and combative, had slurred speech, and eventually had a grand mal seizure. If he was not treated quickly with intravenous glucose administration, Mr. M. might have lapsed into a coma. Permanent neurologic deficits and even death may result if severe hypoglycemia is not corrected in 6 to 10 hours.

4
Emma W. The elevation in blood glucose that occurred in Emma W.'s case was primarily a consequence of the large pharmacologic doses of a glucocorticoid that she received in an effort to reduce the intrabronchial inflammation characteristic of an asthma exacerbation. Although the development of hyperglycemia in this case could be classified as a "secondary" form of DM (because of the activation of liver glucose export by the drug), most patients treated with glucocorticoids do not develop glucose intolerance. Ms. W., therefore, may have a predisposition to the eventual development of "primary" DM.

In hyperglycemia, increased amounts of glucose enter the urine, causing large amounts of water to be excreted. This "osmotic diuresis" is responsible for the increased volume of urine (polyuria) noted by the patient. Because of increased urinary water loss, the effective circulating blood volume is reduced. Therefore, less blood reaches volume-sensitive receptors in the central nervous system, which then trigger the sensation of thirst, causing increased drinking activity (polydipsia).

A diabetic diet and the tapering of her steroid dose over a period of several weeks gradually returned Ms. W.'s blood glucose level to the normal range.

5Dianne A. and Deborah S. Chronically elevated levels of glucose in the blood may contribute to the development of the microvascular complications of DM, such as diabetic retinal damage, kidney damage, and nerve damage as well as macrovascular complications such as cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular, and coronary artery disease. The precise mechanism by which long-term hyperglycemia induces these vascular changes is not fully established.

One postulated mechanism proposes that nonenzymatic glycation (glycosylation) of proteins in vascular tissue alters the structure and functions of these proteins. A protein that is exposed to chronically increased levels of glucose will covalently bind glucose, a process called glycation or glycosylation. This process is not regulated by enzymes (see Chapter 9). These nonenzymatically glycated proteins slowly form cross-linked protein adducts (often called advanced glycosylation end products) within the microvasculature and macrovasculature.

By cross-linking vascular matrix proteins and plasma proteins, chronic hyperglycemia may cause narrowing of the luminal diameter of the microvessels in the retina (causing diabetic retinopathy), the renal glomeruli (causing diabetic nephropathy), and the microvessels supplying peripheral and autonomic nerve fibers (causing diabetic neuropathy). The same process has been postulated to accelerate atherosclerotic change in the macrovasculature, particularly in the brain (causing strokes), the coronary arteries (causing heart attacks), and the peripheral arteries (causing peripheral arterial insufficiency and possibly gangrene). The abnormal lipid metabolism associated with poorly controlled DM also may contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis associated with this metabolic disorder (see Chapters 31 and 32).

The publication of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial followed by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study were the first large human studies to show that maintaining long-term controlled blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes, such as Dianne A. and Deborah S. (who has type 2 diabetes), favorably affects the course of microvascular complications. More recent studies have confirmed this, and although it is thought that controlling blood sugar decreases macrovascular complications, this has been more difficult to demonstrate in human studies.

FIGURE 28.18 Recycling of glucose.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

Glucose Production. Plants are the ultimate source of Earth's supply of glucose. Plants produce glucose from atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by the process of photosynthesis (Fig. 28.18A). In contrast to plants, humans cannot synthesize glucose by the fixation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Although we have a process called gluconeogenesis, the term may really be a misnomer. Glucose is not generated anew by gluconeogenesis; compounds produced from glucose are simply recycled to glucose. We obtain glucose from the plants, including bacteria, that we eat and, to some extent, from animals in our food supply. We use this glucose both as a fuel and as a source of carbon for the synthesis of fatty acids, amino acids, and other sugars (see Fig. 28.18B). We store glucose as glycogen, which, along with gluconeogenesis, provides glucose when needed for energy (see Fig. 28.18C).

Lactate, one of the carbon sources for gluconeogenesis, is actually produced from glucose by tissues that obtain energy by oxidizing glucose to pyruvate through glycolysis. The pyruvate is then reduced to lactate, released into the bloodstream, and reconverted to glucose by the process of gluconeogenesis in the liver. This process is known as the Cori cycle (Fig. 28.18D).

Carbons of alanine, another carbon source for gluconeogenesis, may be produced from glucose. In muscle, glucose is converted via glycolysis to pyruvate and transaminated to alanine. Alanine from muscle is recycled to glucose in the liver. This process is known as the glucose-alanine cycle (Fig. 28.18E). Glucose also may be used to produce nonessential amino acids other than alanine, which are subsequently reconverted to glucose in the liver by gluconeogenesis. Even the essential amino acids that we obtain from dietary proteins are synthesized in plants and bacteria using glucose as the major source of carbon. Therefore, all amino acids that are converted to glucose in humans, including the essential amino acids, were originally synthesized from glucose.

The production of glucose from glycerol, the third major source of carbon for gluconeogenesis, is also a recycling process. Glycerol is derived from glucose via the DHAP intermediate of glycolysis. Fatty acids are then esterified to the glycerol and stored as triacylglycerol. When these fatty acids are released from the triacylglycerol, the glycerol moiety can travel to the liver and be reconverted to glucose (see Fig. 28.18F).

## KEY CONCEPTS

- The process of glucose production is termed gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis occurs primarily in the liver.
- The major precursors for glucose production are lactate, glycerol, and amino acids.
- The gluconeogenic pathway uses the reversible reactions of glycolysis, plus additional reactions to bypass the irreversible steps.
- Pyruvate carboxylase (pyruvate to oxaloacetate [OAA]) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK, OAA to phosphoenolpyruvate [PEP]) bypass the pyruvate kinase step.
- Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate) bypasses the phosphofructokinase-1 step.
- Glucose 6-phosphatase (glucose 6-phosphate to glucose) bypasses the glucokinase step.
- Gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis are carefully regulated so that blood glucose levels can be maintained at a constant level during fasting. The regulation of triglyceride metabolism is also linked to the regulation of blood glucose levels.
- Table 28.3 summarizes the diseases discussed in this chapter.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is D. Glycerol is converted to glycerol 3-P, which is oxidized to form glyceraldehyde 3-P. The glyceraldehyde 3-P formed then follows the gluconeogenic pathway to glucose. Lactate is converted to pyruvate, which is then carboxylated to form OAA. The OAA is decarboxylated to form PEP and then run through gluconeogenesis to glucose. Because glycerol enters the gluconeogenic pathway at the glyceraldehyde 3-P step and lactate at the PEP step, the only compounds in common between these two starting points are the steps from glyceraldehyde 3-P to glucose. Of the choices listed in the question, only glucose 6-P is in that part of the pathway.
2. The answer is A. PEPCK converts OAA to PEP. In combination with pyruvate carboxylase, it is used to bypass the pyruvate kinase reaction. Thus, compounds that enter gluconeogenesis between PEP and OAA (such as lactate, alanine, or any TCA cycle intermediate) must use PEPCK to produce PEP. Glycerol enters gluconeogenesis as glyceraldehyde 3-P, bypassing the PEPCK step. Galactose is converted to glucose 1-phosphate, then glucose 6-P, also bypassing the PEPCK step. Even-chain fatty acids can only give rise to acetyl-CoA, which cannot be used to synthesize glucose.
3. The answer is B. High blood glucose levels signal the release of insulin from the pancreas; glucagon levels either stay the same or decrease slightly.
4. The answer is D. The hyperglycemia in an untreated diabetic creates osmotic diuresis, which means that excessive water is lost through urination. This can lead to a contraction of blood volume, leading to low blood pressure and a rapid heartbeat. It also leads to dehydration. The rapid respirations results from acidosis-induced stimulation of the respiratory center of the brain in order to reduce the amount of acid in the blood. Ketone bodies have accumulated, leading to DKA (thus, B is incorrect). A patient in a hypoglycemic coma (which can be caused by excessive insulin administration) does not exhibit dehydration, low blood pressure, or rapid respirations; in fact, the patient will sweat profusely as a result of epinephrine release (thus, C and E are incorrect). Answer A is incorrect because lack of a pancreas would be fatal.
5. The answer is A. The high levels of glucagon will antagonize the effects of insulin and will lead to hyperglycemia because glucagon stimulates glucose export from the liver by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Owing to the overriding effects of glucagon, blood glucose cannot enter muscle and fat cells, and fat oxidation is stimulated to provide energy for these tissues. This leads to a loss of stored triglyceride, which, in turn, leads to weight loss. Insulin is required to stimulate protein synthesis in muscles (glucagon does not have this effect), and glucagon

signals export of glucose from the liver, which means that the rate of glycolysis is suppressed in hepatic cells under these conditions. Glucagon also stimulates lipolysis in adipocytes to provide fatty acids as an energy source for muscle and liver.
6. The answer is B. The key to answering this question correctly relates to the absence of detectable C-peptide levels in the blood. An overproduction of insulin by the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas can lead to hypoglycemia severe enough to cause loss of consciousness, but because there was no detectable C-peptide in the blood, the loss of consciousness was most likely the result of the administration of exogenous insulin, which lacks the C-peptide (see Chapter 19). An overdose of glucagon (either through injection or from a glucagon-producing tumor), or epinephrine, would promote glucose release by the liver and not lead to hypoglycemia.
7. The answer is D. GLUT 1 is the carrier for glucose across the blood brain-barrier (as well as red blood cells). When blood glucose levels drop below the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for this transporter, then the nervous system does not receive sufficient glucose to keep functioning properly-hence, the signs of hypoglycemia. The GLUT 2 and GLUT 5 transporters are not responsible for glucose entry into the nervous system (the liver and pancreas use GLUT 2 , whereas GLUT 5 primarily transports fructose, not glucose). GLUT 4 transporters are insulin-responsive transporters, expressed primarily in the muscle and fat
cells. Altering the number of GLUT 4 transporters will not affect glucose entry into the nervous system.
8. The answer is A. During a fast, liver glycogen stores are exhausted after about 30 hours, so the only pathway through which the liver can produce glucose is via gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis requires energy, which is provided by fatty acid oxidation. Glycerol is a substrate for gluconeogenesis, but it is not oxidized to provide energy for gluconeogenesis. Muscle glycogen stores can provide glucose 1-phosphate for use by the muscle, but the glucose produced from muscle glycogen cannot enter the blood to be used by any other tissue. The liver will produce ketone bodies from fatty acid oxidation, but the liver does not express the coenzyme A transferase needed to metabolize ketone bodies.
9. The answer is B. Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose into adipose and muscle cells by promoting the recruitment of GLUT 4 glucose transporters to the cell membrane. Liver, brain, intestine, and red blood cells have different types of glucose transporters that are not significantly affected by insulin.
10. The answer is B. The liver can convert dietary glucose into fatty acids and glycerol to produce triacetylglycerols, which are packaged into VLDL for transport to adipose tissue (for storage) or to the muscle for immediate oxidation if necessary. A low-fat diet, if excessive in overall calories, will lead to triglyceride formation and storage of the triglyceride in adipose tissue.




# Lipid Metabolism 

Most of the lipids found in the body fall into the categories of fatty acids and triacylglycerols; glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids; eicosanoids; cholesterol, bile salts, and steroid hormones; and fat-soluble vitamins. These lipids have very diverse chemical structures and functions. However, they are related by a common property: their relative insolubility in water.

Fatty acids are a major fuel in the body. After eating, we store excess fatty acids and carbohydrates that are not oxidized as fat (triacylglycerols) in adipose tissue. Between meals, these fatty acids are released and circulate in blood bound to albumin (Fig. V.1). In muscle, liver, and other tissues, fatty acids are oxidized to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in the pathway of $\beta$-oxidation. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD[2H]) generated from $\beta$-oxidation are reoxidized by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the electron-transport chain, thereby generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Small amounts of certain fatty acids are oxidized through other pathways that convert them to either oxidizable fuels or urinary excretion products (e.g., peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation).

Not all acetyl-CoA generated from $\beta$-oxidation enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In the liver, acetyl-CoA generated from $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids can also be converted to the ketone bodies acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate. Ketone bodies are taken up by muscle and other tissues, which convert them back to acetyl-CoA for oxidation in the TCA cycle. They become a major fuel for the brain during prolonged fasting.

Glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, which contain esterified fatty acids, are found in membranes and in blood lipoproteins at the interfaces between the lipid components of these structures and the surrounding water. These membrane lipids form hydrophobic barriers between subcellular compartments and between cellular constituents and the extracellular milieu. Polyunsaturated fatty acids containing 20 carbons form the eicosanoids, which regulate many cellular processes (Fig. V.2).

Cholesterol adds stability to the phospholipid bilayer of membranes. It serves as the precursor of the bile salts, detergentlike compounds that function in the process of lipid digestion and absorption (Fig. V.3). Cholesterol also serves as the precursor of the steroid hormones, which have many actions, including the regulation of metabolism, growth, and reproduction.

The fat-soluble vitamins are lipids that are involved in such varied functions as vision, growth, and differentiation (vitamin A); blood clotting (vitamin K); prevention of oxidative damage to cells (vitamin E); and calcium metabolism (vitamin D).

Triacylglycerols, the major dietary lipids, are digested in the lumen of the intestine (Fig. V.4). The initial digestive products, free fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol, are reconverted to triacylglycerols in intestinal epithelial cells, packaged in lipoproteins known as chylomicrons (so they can safely enter the circulation), and secreted into the lymph. Ultimately, chylomicrons enter the blood, serving as one of the major blood lipoproteins.

Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is produced in the liver, mainly from dietary carbohydrate. Lipogenesis is an insulin-stimulated process through which glucose is converted to fatty acids, which are subsequently esterified to glycerol to form the triacylglycerols that are packaged in VLDL and secreted from the liver. Thus, chylomicrons primarily transport dietary lipids, and VLDL transports endogenously synthesized lipids.

The triacylglycerols of chylomicrons and VLDL are digested by lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme found attached to capillary endothelial cells (see Fig. V.4).
