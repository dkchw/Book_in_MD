# Tissue Metabolism 

Although many of the pathways described previously are present in all tissues of the body, many tissues also carry out specialized functions and contain unique biochemical pathways. This section describes several such tissues and, in some cases, how the tissues interact with the rest of the body to coordinate their functions. Previous chapters have focused primarily on insulin and glucagon as the major mediators for regulating metabolic pathways; however, a large number of other hormones also regulate the storage and use of metabolic fuels (see Chapter 41). These hormones primarily counteract the effects of insulin and are called counterregulatory hormones. They include growth hormone; thyroid hormone; glucocorticoids, such as cortisol; small peptides, such as the somatostatins; and small molecules, such as the catecholamines. Growth hormone works, in part, by inducing the synthesis of the insulinlike growth factors. These hormones can exert their effects rapidly (through covalent modification of selected enzymes) or long-term (through alterations in the rate of synthesis of selected enzymes). The interplay of these hormones with insulin and glucagon is discussed, as are the synthesis, secretion, and conditions leading to secretion of each hormone.

The proteins and cells in the blood form their own tissue system (see Chapter 42). All blood cells are derived from a common precursor, the stem cell, in the bone marrow. Different cytokine signals trigger differentiation of a particular blood cell lineage. For example, when oxygen supply to the tissues is decreased, the kidney responds by releasing erythropoietin. This hormone specifically stimulates the production of red blood cells.

Red blood cells have limited metabolic functions, owing to their lack of internal organelles. Their main function is to deliver oxygen to the tissues through the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin. When the number of red blood cells is decreased, that, by definition, represents anemia. This can be attributable to many causes, including nutritional deficiencies or mutations (hereditary anemias). The morphology of the red blood cell can sometimes aid in distinguishing the various types of anemia.

Red blood cell metabolism is geared toward preserving the ability of these cells to transport oxygen, as well as to regulate oxygen binding to hemoglobin. Glycolysis provides energy and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to protect the oxidation state of the heme-bound iron. The hexose monophosphate shunt pathway generates NADPH to protect red blood cell membranes from oxidation. Heme synthesis, which uses succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) and glycine for all of the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the structure, occurs in the precursors of red blood cells. Inherited defects in heme synthesis lead to a class of diseases known as the porphyrias. Because red blood cells normally pass through the very narrow capillaries, their membranes must be easily deformable. This deformability is, in part, attributable to the complex cytoskeletal structure that surrounds the erythrocyte. Mutations in these structural proteins can lead to less deformable cells, which are more easily lysed as they circulate in the bloodstream. This, in turn, can result in hemolytic anemia.

Among other functions, the hematologic system is responsible for hemostasis as well as for maintaining a constant blood volume (see Chapter 43). A tear in the wall of a vessel can lead to blood loss, which, when extensive, can be fatal. Repairing vessel damage, whether internal or external, is accomplished by a complicated series of zymogen activations of circulating blood proteins resulting in the formation of a fibrin clot (the coagulation cascade). Platelets play a critical role in hemostasis not

only through their release of procoagulants but through their ability to form aggregates within the thrombus (clot) as well. Clots function as a plug, allowing defects or rents in vessel walls to repair and thereby preventing further blood loss. Conversely, inappropriate or accelerated clot formation in the lumen of vessels that supply blood to vital organs or tissues can cause an intraluminal obstruction to flow that may lead to an acute cerebral or myocardial infarction. Because clotting must be tightly controlled, intricate mechanisms exist that regulate this important hematologic function.

The liver is an altruistic organ that provides multiple services for other tissues (see Chapter 44). It supplies glucose and ketone bodies to the rest of the body when fuel stores are limited. It disposes of ammonia as urea when amino acid degradation occurs. It is the site of detoxification of xenobiotics, and it synthesizes many of the proteins found in the blood. The liver synthesizes triacylglycerols and cholesterol and distributes them to other tissues in the form of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). The liver also synthesizes bile acids for fat digestion in the intestine. The liver recycles cholesterol and triglyceride through its uptake of intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), chylomicron and VLDL remnants, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Because of its protective nature and its strategic location between the gut and the systemic circulation, the liver has "first crack" at all compounds that enter the blood through the enterohepatic circulation. Thus, xenobiotic compounds can be detoxified as they enter the liver, before they have a chance to reach other tissues.

Muscle cells contain unique pathways that allow them to store energy as creatine phosphate and to regulate closely their use of fatty acids as an energy source (see Chapter 45). The adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase is an important regulator of muscle energy metabolism. Muscle is comprised of different types of contractile fibers that derive their energy from different sources. For example, the slow-twitch type I fibers use oxidative energy pathways, whereas the type II fast-twitch fibers use the glycolytic pathway for their energy requirements.

The nervous system consists of various cell types that are functionally interconnected to allow efficient signal transmission throughout the system (see Chapter 46). The cells of the central nervous system are protected from potentially toxic compounds by the blood-brain barrier, which restricts entry of potentially toxic compounds into the nervous system (ammonia, however, is a notable exception). The brain cells communicate with each other and with other organs through the synthesis of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Many of the neurotransmitters are derived from amino acids, most of which are synthesized within the nerve cells. Because the pathways of amino acid and neurotransmitter biosynthesis require cofactors (such as pyridoxal phosphate, thiamine pyrophosphate, and vita$\min \mathrm{B}_{12}$ ), deficiencies of these cofactors can lead to neuropathies (dysfunction of specific neurons in the nervous system).

Because of the restrictions imposed by the blood-brain barrier, the brain also must synthesize its own lipids. An adequate supply of lipids is vital to the central nervous system because lipids are constituents of the myelin sheath that surrounds the neurons and allows them to conduct impulses normally. The neurodegenerative disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, are a consequence of varying degrees of demyelination of the neurons.

Connective tissue, which consists primarily of fibroblasts, produces extracellular matrix materials that surround cells and tissues, determining their appropriate position within the organ (see Chapter 47). These materials include structural proteins (collagen and elastin), adhesive proteins (fibronectin), and glycosaminoglycans (heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate). The unique structures of the proteins and carbohydrates in the extracellular matrix allow tissues and organs to carry out their many functions. Loss of these supportive and barrier functions of connective tissue sometimes leads to significant clinical consequences, such as those that result from the microvascular alterations that lead to blindness, renal failure, or peripheral neuropathies in patients with diabetes mellitus.

# Actions of Hormones that Regulate Fuel Metabolism 

Many hormones affect fuel metabolism, including those that regulate appetite as well as those that influence absorption, transport, and oxidation of foodstuffs. The major hormones that influence nutrient metabolism and their actions on muscle, liver, and adipose tissue are listed in Table 4 I.I.

Insulin is the major anabolic hormone. It promotes the storage of nutrients as glycogen in liver and muscle and as triacylglycerols in adipose tissue. It also stimulates the synthesis of proteins in tissues such as muscle. At the same time, insulin acts to inhibit fuel mobilization.

Glucagon is the major counterregulatory hormone. The term counterregulatory means that its actions are generally opposed to those of insulin (contrainsular). The major action of glucagon is to mobilize fuel reserves by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. These actions ensure that glucose will be available to glucose-dependent tissues between meals.

Epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, somatostatin, and growth hormone also have contrainsular activity. Thyroid hormone also must be classified as an insulin-counterregulatory hormone because it increases the rate of fuel consumption and also increases the sensitivity of the target cells to other insulincounterregulatory hormones.

Insulin and the counterregulatory hormones exert two types of metabolic regulation (see Chapter 19). The first type of control occurs within minutes to hours of the hormone-receptor interaction and usually results from changes in the catalytic activity or kinetics of key preexisting enzymes, caused by phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of these enzymes. The second type of control involves regulation of the synthesis of key enzymes by mechanisms that stimulate or inhibit transcription and translation of messenger RNA (mRNA). These processes are slow and require hours to days.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Otto S., now a third-year medical student, was assigned to do a history and physical examination on a newly admitted 47-year-old patient named Chet $\mathbf{S}$. Mr. S. had consulted his physician for increasing weakness and fatigue and was found to have a severely elevated serum glucose level. While he was examining the patient, Otto noted marked redness of Mr. S.'s facial skin as well as reddish-purple stripes (striae) in the skin of his lower abdomen and thighs. The patient's body fat was unusually distributed in that it appeared to be excessively deposited centrally in his face, neck, upper back, chest, and abdomen, whereas the distal portions of his arms and legs appeared to be almost devoid of fat. Mr. S.'s skin appeared thinned and large bruises were present over many areas of his body, for which Mr. S. had no explanation. The neurologic examination showed severe muscle weakness, especially in the proximal arms and legs, where the muscles seemed to have atrophied.

Sam A., a 42-year-old jeweler, noted increasingly severe headaches behind his eyes that were sometimes associated with a "flash of light" in his visual field. At times, his vision seemed blurred, making it difficult to perform some of the intricate work required of a jeweler. He consulted his ophthalmologist, who was impressed with the striking change in Sam's facial features that had occurred since he last saw the patient 5 years earlier. The normal skin creases in Sam's face had grown much deeper, his skin appeared to be thickened, his nose and lips appeared more bulbous, and his jaw seemed more prominent. The doctor also noted that Sam's hands appeared bulky, and his voice had deepened. An eye examination showed that Sam's optic nerves appeared slightly atrophied, and there was a loss of the upper outer quadrants of his visual fields.

## I. Physiologic Effects of Insulin and Amylin

The effects of insulin on fuel metabolism and substrate flux were considered in many of the earlier chapters of this book, particularly in Chapter 19. Insulin stimulates the storage of glycogen in liver and muscle and the synthesis of fatty acids and triacylglycerols and their storage in adipose tissue. In addition, insulin stimulates the synthesis in various tissues of $>50$ proteins, some of which contribute to the growth of the organism. In fact, it is difficult to separate the effects of insulin on cell growth from those of a family of proteins known as the somatomedins or the insulinlike growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2) (see Section III.B.6).

Finally, insulin has paracrine actions within the pancreatic islet cells. When insulin is released from the $\beta$-cells, it suppresses glucagon release from the $\alpha$-cells.

Amylin is a 37-amino-acid peptide that is synthesized in the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas and is cosecreted with insulin when blood glucose levels rise. Amylin has been demonstrated to suppress the postprandial glucagon secretion (thereby enhancing the effect of insulin by keeping the insulin:glucagon ratio high), to slow gastric emptying, which decreases the rate at which food reaches the intestine, and the bloodstream (thereby blunting a large increase in blood nutrient levels immediately after a meal), and to reduce food intake (and thereby body weight). All of amylin's actions are geared toward reducing blood glucose levels, just as insulin does when it is released from the pancreas. Individuals with type 1 diabetes, who experience destruction of the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas, lose the ability to secrete both insulin and amylin in response to an increase in blood nutrient levels, and this may partially explain why insulin therapy for individuals with type 1 diabetes often is inadequate in preventing the long-term complications of diabetes.

## II. Physiologic Effects of Glucagon

Glucagon is one of several counterregulatory (contrainsular) hormones. It is synthesized as part of a large precursor protein called proglucagon. Proglucagon is produced in the $\alpha$-cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas and in the L-cells

(1)The measurement of hormone levels in blood is best performed using immunologic reagents that specifically recognize the hormone being measured. Such techniques are further described in the "Biochemical Comments" in this chapter.

(2)Pramlintide is an amyIin analog that is used to treat individuals with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Pramlintide will bind to amylin receptors and elicit amylinlike responses. It can cause nausea in almost half of patients; less commonly, it causes vomiting. This can lead to discontinuing the drug.

Tolbutamide, a sulfonylurea drug that increases insulin secretion, also increases the secretion of pancreatic somatostatin.
of the intestine. It contains several peptides linked in tandem: glicentin-related peptide, glucagon, glucagon-related peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucagon-related peptide 2 (GLP-2). Proteolytic cleavage of proglucagon releases various combinations of its constituent peptides. Glucagon is cleaved from proglucagon in the pancreas and constitutes $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ of the immunoreactive glucagon in the blood. The remaining immunoreactivity is caused by other cleavage products of proglucagon released from the pancreas and the intestine. Pancreatic glucagon has a plasma half-life of 3 to 6 minutes and is removed mainly by the liver and kidney.

Glucagon promotes glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis by stimulating the generation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in target cells. The liver is the major target organ for glucagon, in part because the concentrations of this hormone bathing the liver cells in the portal blood are higher than in the peripheral circulation. Levels of glucagon in the portal vein may reach concentrations as high as $500 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$.

Finally, glucagon stimulates insulin release from the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas. Whether this is a paracrine effect or an endocrine effect has not been established. The pattern of blood flow in the pancreatic islet cells is believed to bathe the $\beta$-cells first and then the $\alpha$-cells. Therefore, the $\beta$-cells may influence $\alpha$-cell function by an endocrine mechanism, whereas the influence of $\alpha$-cell hormone on $\beta$-cell function is more likely to be paracrine. The glucagon-stimulated insulin release is most likely necessary to maintain blood glucose levels in the physiologic range.

## III. Physiologic Effects of Other Counterregulatory Hormones

## A. Somatostatin

## I. Biochemistry

Preprosomatostatin, a 116-amino-acid peptide, is encoded by a gene located on the long arm of chromosome 3. Somatostatin (SS-14), a cyclic peptide with a molecular weight of $1,600 \mathrm{Da}$, is produced from the 14 amino acids at the C terminus of this precursor molecule. SS-14 was first isolated from the hypothalamus and named for its ability to inhibit the release of growth hormone (GH, somatotropin) from the anterior pituitary. It also inhibits the release of insulin. In addition to the hypothalamus, somatostatin is also secreted from the D-cells ( $\delta$-cells) of the pancreatic islets, many areas of the central nervous system (CNS) outside of the hypothalamus, and gastric and duodenal mucosal cells. SS-14 predominates in the CNS and is the sole form secreted by the $\delta$-cells of the pancreas. In the gut, however, prosomatostatin (SS-28), which has 14 additional amino acids extending from the C-terminal portion of the precursor, makes up $70 \%$ to $75 \%$ of the immunoreactivity (the amount of hormone that reacts with antibodies to SS-14). The prohormone SS-28 is 7 to 10 times more potent in inhibiting the release of GH and insulin than is SS-14.

## 2. Secretion of Somatostatin

The secretagogues for somatostatin are similar to those that cause secretion of insulin. The metabolites that increase somatostatin release include glucose, arginine, and leucine. The hormones that stimulate somatostatin secretion include glucagon, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and cholecystokinin (CCK). Insulin, however, does not influence somatostatin secretion directly.

## 3. Physiologic Effects of Somatostatin

Five somatostatin receptors have been identified and characterized, all of which are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Four of the five receptors do not distinguish between SS-14 and SS-28. Somatostatin binds to its plasma membrane receptors on target cells. These "activated" receptors interact with a variety of intracellular signaling pathways, depending on the cell type expressing the receptor

and which somatostatin receptor is being expressed. These pathways include inactivation of adenylate cyclase (via an inhibitory G-protein), regulation of phosphotyrosine phosphatases and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and alterations of intracellular ion concentrations (calcium and potassium). The inactivation of adenylate cyclases reduces the production of cAMP, and protein kinase A is not activated. This inhibitory effect suppresses secretion of GH and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary gland as well as the secretion of insulin and glucagon from the pancreatic islets. If one were to summarize the action of somatostatin in one phrase, it would be "somatostatin inhibits the secretion of many other hormones." As such, it acts to regulate the effects of those other hormones. In addition to these effects on hormones that regulate fuel metabolism, somatostatin also reduces nutrient absorption from the gut by prolonging gastric emptying time (through a decrease in the secretion of gastrin, which reduces gastric acid secretion), by diminishing pancreatic exocrine secretions (i.e., digestive enzymes, bicarbonate, and water), and by decreasing visceral blood flow. Thus, somatostatin exerts a broad, albeit indirect, influence on nutrient absorption and, therefore, on the use of fuels.

Somatostatin and its synthetic analogs are used clinically to treat a variety of secretory neoplasms such as GH-secreting tumors of the pituitary. Such tumors can cause gigantism if GH is secreted in excess before the closure of the growth centers of the ends of long bones, or acromegaly if excess GH is chronically secreted after the closure of these centers (as in Sam A.).

## B. Growth Hormone

## I. Biochemistry

GH is a polypeptide that, as its name implies, stimulates growth. Many of its effects are mediated by IGFs, also known as somatomedins, that are produced by cells in response to the binding of GH to its cell membrane receptors (see Section III.B.6). However, GH also has direct effects on fuel metabolism.

Human GH is a water-soluble 22-kDa polypeptide with a plasma half-life of 20 to 50 minutes. It is composed of a single chain of 191 amino acids having two intramolecular disulfide bonds (Fig. 41.1). The gene for GH is located on chromosome 17. It is secreted by the somatotroph cells (the cells that synthesize and release GH) in the lateral areas of the anterior pituitary. GH is structurally related to human prolactin and to human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS) from the placenta, a polypeptide that stimulates growth of the developing fetus. Yet, the hCS peptide has only $0.1 \%$ of the growth-inducing potency of GH. GH is the most abundant trophic hormone in the anterior pituitary, being present in concentrations of 5 to 15 mg per gram of tissue. The other anterior pituitary hormones are present in quantities of micrograms per gram of tissue.

Human growth hormone
FIGURE 41.1 Structure of human growth hormone. (From Murray RK, Granner DK, Mayes PA, Rodwey VW. Harper's Biochemistry. 23rd ed. Stamford, CT: Appleton \& Lange; 1993:502.)

0In addition to its effects on normal GH secretion, somatostatin also suppresses the pathologic increase in GH that occurs in acromegaly (caused by a GH-secreting pituitary tumor), diabetes mellitus, and carcinoid tumors (tumors that secrete serotonin). Somatostatin also suppresses the basal secretion of TSH, TRH, insulin, and glucagon. The hormone also has a suppressive effect on a wide variety of nonendocrine secretions.

The major limitation in the clinical use of native somatostatin is its short half-life of $<3$ minutes in the circulation. Analogs of native somatostatin, however, have been developed that are resistant to degradation and, therefore, have a longer half-life. One such analog is octreotide, an octapeptide variant of somatostatin with a half-life of approximately 110 minutes.

0A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of Sam A.'s brain showed a macroadenoma (a tumor $>10 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter) in the pituitary gland, with superior extension that compressed the optic nerve as it crossed above the sella turcica, causing his visual problems. The skeletal and visceral changes noted by the ophthalmologist are characteristic of patients with acromegaly who have chronically elevated serum levels of GH and IGF-I.

Therapy for acromegaly caused by a GHsecreting tumor of the anterior pituitary gland includes surgery if the mass is amenable or, if not amendable to surgery, lifelong medical therapy. Medical therapy includes a somatostatin analog, such as octreotide, or a dopamine agonist that inhibits the secretion of GH, such as cabergoline. If a somatostatin analog is not tolerated or is not successful, a GH-receptor antagonist such as pegvisomant can be used. Another therapeutic option is stereotactic radiation therapy if other treatments are not successful. If the excessive secretion of GH is controlled successfully, some of the visceral or soft-tissue changes of acromegaly may slowly subside to varying degrees. The skeletal changes, however, cannot be reversed.

The ophthalmologist ordered a morning fasting serum GH level on Sam A. which was elevated, at $56 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$, (normal, 0 to $5 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ ), as well as a determination of circulating IGF-I levels.

Sam A. was given an oral dose of 100 g of glucose syrup. This dose would suppress serum GH levels to $<2 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$, in normal subjects but not in patients with acromegaly who have an autonomously secreting pituitary tumor making GH. Because Sam's serum GH level was $41 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$, after the oral glucose load, a diagnosis of acromegaly was made. The patient was referred to an endocrinologist for further evaluation.

GH stimulates IGF-I gene expression not only in the liver but in several extrahepatic tissues as well. In people with acromegaly, rising levels of IGF-I cause a gradual generalized increase in skeletal, muscular, and visceral growth. As a consequence, a diffuse increase occurs in the bulk of all tissues (megaly means enlargement) especially in the acral (most peripheral) tissues of the body, such as the face, the hands, and the feet; hence, the term acromegaly.

Sam A.'s coarse facial features and bulky hands are typical of patients with acromegaly.

The actions of GH can be classified as those that occur as a consequence of the hormone's direct effect on target cells and those that occur indirectly through the ability of GH to generate other factors, particularly IGF-1.

The IGF-1-independent actions of GH are exerted primarily in hepatocytes. GH administration is followed by an early increase in the synthesis of 8 to 10 proteins, among which are IGF-1, $\alpha_{2}$-macroglobulin, and the serine protease inhibitors Spi 2.1 and Spi 2.3. Expression of the gene for ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme that is active in polyamine synthesis (and, therefore, in the regulation of cell proliferation), is also significantly increased by GH.

Muscle and adipocyte cell membranes contain GH receptors that mediate direct, rapid metabolic effects on glucose and amino acid transport as well as on lipolysis. These receptors use associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases for signal transduction (such as the janus kinases; see Chapter 11, Section III.C.). STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) transcription factors are activated, and, depending on the tissue, the MAP kinase pathway and/or the AKT pathway is also activated. For example, in adipose tissue, GH has acute insulinlike effects followed by increased lipolysis, inhibition of lipoprotein lipase, stimulation of hormone-sensitive lipase, decreased glucose transport, and decreased lipogenesis. In muscle, GH causes increased amino acid transport, increased nitrogen retention, increased fat-free (lean) tissue, and increased energy expenditure. GH also has growth-promoting effects. GH receptors are present on a variety of tissues in which GH increases IGF-1 gene expression. The subsequent rise in IGF-1 levels contributes to cell multiplication and differentiation by autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. These, in turn, lead to skeletal, muscular, and visceral growth. These actions are accompanied by a direct anabolic influence of GH on protein metabolism with a diversion of amino acids from oxidation to protein synthesis and a shift to a positive nitrogen balance.

## 2. Control of Secretion of Growth Hormone

Although the regulation of GH secretion is complex, the major influence is hormonal (Fig. 41.2). The pulsatile pattern of GH secretion reflects the interplay of two hypothalamic regulatory peptides. Release is stimulated by GH-releasing hormone (GHRH, also called somatocrinin). The structure of GHRH was identified in 1982 (Fig. 41.3). It exists as both a 40 - and a 44 -amino-acid peptide encoded on chromosome 20 and produced exclusively in cells of the arcuate nucleus. Its $C$-terminal leucine residue is amidated. Full biologic activity of this releasing hormone resides in the first 29 amino acids of the $N$-terminal portion of the molecule. GHRH interacts with specific receptors on the plasma membranes of the somatotrophs. The intracellular signaling mechanisms that result in GH synthesis and release appear to be multiple because cAMP and calcium-calmodulin both stimulate GH release.

Conversely, GH secretion is suppressed by GH release-inhibiting hormone (GHRIH, the same as somatostatin, which has already been discussed). In addition, IGF-1, produced primarily in the liver in response to the action of GH on hepatocytes, feeds back negatively on the somatotrophs to limit GH secretion. Other physiologic factors (e.g., exercise and sleep) and many pathologic factors also control its release (Table S41.1 in the online supplement).

In addition, GH release is modulated by plasma levels of all of the metabolic fuels, including proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. A rising level of glucose in the blood normally suppresses GH release, whereas hypoglycemia increases GH secretion in normal subjects. Amino acids, such as arginine, stimulate release of GH when their concentrations rise in the blood. Rising levels of fatty acids may blunt the GH response to arginine or a rapidly dropping blood glucose level. However, prolonged fasting, in which fatty acids are mobilized in an effort to spare protein, is associated with a rise in GH secretion. Some of the physiologic, pharmacologic, and pathologic influences on GH secretion are given in Table S41.1. These modulators of GH secretion provide the basis for clinical suppression and stimulation tests in patients suspected of having excessive or deficient GH secretion.

## 3. Effects of Growth Hormone on Energy Metabolism

GH affects the uptake and oxidation of fuels in adipose tissue, muscle, and liver and indirectly influences energy metabolism through its actions on the islet cells of the pancreas. In summary, GH increases the availability of fatty acids, which are oxidized for energy. This and other effects of GH spare glucose and protein; that is, GH indirectly decreases the oxidation of glucose and amino acids (Fig. 41.4).

## 4. Effects of Growth Hormone on Adipose Tissue

GH increases the sensitivity of the adipocyte to the lipolytic action of the catecholamines and decreases its sensitivity to the lipogenic action of insulin. These actions lead to the release of free fatty acids and glycerol into the blood to be metabolized by the liver. GH also decreases esterification of fatty acids, thereby reducing triacylglycerol synthesis within the fat cell. Recent evidence suggests that GH may impair glucose uptake by both fat and muscle cells by a postreceptor inhibition of insulin action. As a result of the metabolic effects of GH, the clinical course of acromegaly (increased GH secretion) may be complicated by impaired glucose tolerance or even overt diabetes mellitus.

## 5. Effects of Growth Hormone on Muscle

The lipolytic effects of GH increase free fatty acid levels in the blood that bathes muscle. These fatty acids are used preferentially as fuel, indirectly suppressing glucose uptake by muscle cells. Through the effects on glucose uptake, the rate of glycolysis is proportionately reduced.

GH increases the transport of amino acids into muscle cells, providing substrate for protein synthesis. Through a separate mechanism, GH increases the synthesis of DNA and RNA. The positive effect on nitrogen balance is reinforced by the proteinsparing effect of GH-induced lipolysis that makes fatty acids available to muscle as an alternative fuel source.

## 6. Effects of Growth Hormone on the Liver

When plasma insulin levels are low, as in the fasting state, GH enhances fatty acid oxidation to acetyl-CoA. This effect, in concert with the increased flow of fatty

FIGURE 41.2 Control of growth hormone secretion. Various factors stimulate the release of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) from the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus also releases somatostatin in response to other stimuli. GHRH stimulates and somatostatin inhibits the release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary. Growth hormone causes the release of insulinlike growth factor-I (IGF-I) from liver and other tissues. IGF-I inhibits GHRH release and stimulates somatostatin release.

(1)While Sam A. was trying to decide which of the major alternatives to choose for the treatment of his GH-secreting pituitary tumor, he noted progressive fatigue and the onset of increasing urinary frequency associated with a marked increase in thirst. In addition, he had lost 4 b over the course of the last 6 weeks in spite of a good appetite. His physician suspected that Mr. A. had developed diabetes mellitus perhaps related to the chronic hypersecretion of GH. This suspicion was confirmed when Sam's serum glucose level, drawn before breakfast, was reported to be $236 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

FIGURE 41.5 Production and action of insulinlike growth factors (IGFs). The hypothalamus produces growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which stimulates somatotrophs in the anterior pituitary to release growth hormone (GH). GH release-inhibiting hormone (GHRIH) inhibits GH release. GH binds to cell surface receptors and stimulates IGF production and release by liver and other tissues. IGF binds to cell-surface receptors and stimulates the phosphorylation of proteins that lead to cell division and growth.

acids from adipose tissue, enhances ketogenesis. The increased amount of glycerol reaching the liver as a consequence of enhanced lipolysis acts as a substrate for gluconeogenesis.

Hepatic glycogen synthesis is also stimulated by GH in part because of the increased gluconeogenesis in the liver. Finally, glucose metabolism is suppressed by GH at several steps in the glycolytic pathway.

A major effect of GH on liver is to stimulate production and release of IGFs. The IGFs are also known as somatomedins. The two somatomedins in humans share structural homologies with proinsulin, and both have substantial insulinlike growth activity-hence, the designations insulinlike growth factor 1 (human IGF-1, or somatomedin-C) and insulinlike growth factor 2 (human IGF-2, or somatomedin A). IGF-1 is a single-chain basic peptide that has 70 amino acids, and IGF-2 is slightly acidic, with 67 amino acids. These two peptides are identical to insulin in half of their residues. In addition, they contain a structural domain that is homologous to the C-peptide of proinsulin.

A broad spectrum of normal cells responds to high doses of insulin by increasing thymidine uptake and initiating cell propagation. In most instances, IGF-1 causes the same response as insulin in these cells but at significantly lower, more physiologic concentrations. Thus, the IGFs are more potent than insulin in their growth-promoting actions.

Evidence suggests that the IGFs exert their effects through either an endocrine or a paracrine/autocrine mechanism. IGF-1 appears to stimulate cell propagation and growth by binding to specific IGF-1 receptors on the plasma membrane of target cells rather than binding to GH receptors (Fig. 41.5).

Like insulin, the intracellular portion of the plasma membrane receptor for IGF-1 (but not IGF-2) has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The fact that the receptors for insulin and several other growth factors have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation initiates the process of cellular replication and growth. Subsequently, a chain of kinases is activated, which include several protooncogene products (see Chapters 11 and 18).

Most cells of the body have messenger RNA (mRNA) for IGF, but the liver has the greatest concentration of these messages, followed by kidney and heart.

The synthesis of IGF-1 is regulated, for the most part, by GH, whereas hepatic production of IGF-2 is independent of GH levels in the blood.

## C. Catecholamines (Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, Dopamine)

The catecholamines belong to a family of bioamines and are secretory products of the sympathoadrenal system. They are required for the body to adapt to a great variety of acute and chronic stresses. Epinephrine ( $80 \%$ to $85 \%$ of stored catecholamines) is synthesized primarily in the cells of the adrenal medulla, whereas norepinephrine ( $15 \%$ to $20 \%$ of stored catecholamines) is synthesized and stored not only in the adrenal medulla but also in various areas of the CNS and in the nerve endings of the adrenergic nervous system. Dopamine, another catecholamine, acts primarily as a neurotransmitter and has little effect on fuel metabolism.

The first total chemical synthesis of epinephrine was accomplished by Stolz et al. in 1904. In 1950, Sutherland was the first to demonstrate that epinephrine (and glucagon) induces glycogenolysis. This marked the beginning of our understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which hormones act.

## I. Synthesis of the Catecholamines

Tyrosine is the precursor of the catecholamines. The pathway for the biosynthesis of these molecules is described in Chapter 46.

## 2. Secretion of the Catecholamines

Secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla is stimulated by a variety of stresses, including pain, hemorrhage, exercise, hypoglycemia, and hypoxia. Release is mediated by stress-induced transmission of nerve impulses emanating from adrenergic nuclei in the hypothalamus. These impulses stimulate the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from preganglionic neurons that innervate the adrenomedullary cells. Acetylcholine depolarizes the plasma membranes of these cells, allowing the rapid entry of extracellular calcium $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right)$ into the cytosol. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stimulates the synthesis and release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the chromaffin granules into the extracellular space by exocytosis.

## 3. Physiologic Effects of Epinephrine and Norepinephrine

The catecholamines act through two major types of receptors on the plasma membrane of target cells, the $\alpha$-adrenergic and the $\beta$-adrenergic receptors (see Chapter 19, Section IV.C).

The actions of epinephrine and norepinephrine in the liver, the adipocyte, the skeletal muscle cell, and the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-cells of the pancreas directly influence fuel metabolism (Fig. 41.6). These catecholamines are counterregulatory hormones that have metabolic effects directed toward mobilization of fuels from their storage sites for oxidation by cells to meet the increased energy requirements of acute and chronic stress. They simultaneously suppress insulin secretion, which ensures that fuel fluxes will continue in the direction of fuel use rather than storage as long as the stressful stimulus persists.

In addition, norepinephrine works as a neurotransmitter and affects the sympathetic nervous system in the heart, lungs, blood vessels, bladder, gut, and other organs. These effects of catecholamines on the heart and blood vessels increase cardiac output and systemic blood pressure, hemodynamic changes that facilitate the delivery of bloodborne fuels to metabolically active tissues.

Epinephrine has a short half-life in the blood, and to be effective pharmacologically, it must be administered parenterally. It may be used clinically to support the beating of the heart, to dilate inflamed bronchial muscles, and even to decrease bleeding from organs during surgery.

(2)High levels of circulating IGF-I have been linked to the development of breast, prostate, colon, and lung cancer. In addition, experimental modulation of IGF-I receptor activity can alter the growth of different types of tumor cells. Current research is aimed at targeting the interaction of IGF-I and its receptor to reduce tumor cell proliferation. Clinical studies using monoclonal antibodies to the IFG-I receptor, or specific IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are under way, with promising results.

(3)In patients suspected of having a neoplasm of the adrenal medulla that is secreting excessive quantities of epinephrine or norepinephrine (a pheochromocytoma), either the catecholamines themselves (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) or their metabolites (the metanephrines and vanillylmandelic acid [VMA]), may be measured in a 24-hour urine collection, or the level of catecholamines in the blood may be measured. A patient who has consistently elevated levels in the blood or urine should be considered to have a pheochromocytoma, particularly if the patient has signs and symptoms of catecholamine excess, such as excessive sweating, palpitations, tremulousness, and hypertension.

(4)A relatively rare form of secondary hypertension (high blood pressure) is caused by a catecholamine-secreting neoplasm of the adrenal medulla, known as a pheochromocytoma. Patients with this kind of tumor periodically secrete large amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine into the bloodstream. Symptoms related to this secretion include a sudden and often severe increase in blood pressure, heart palpitations, a throbbing headache, and inappropriate and diffuse sweating. In addition, chronic hypersecretion of these catecholamines may lead to impaired glucose tolerance or even overt diabetes mellitus. Describe the actions of these hormones that lead to the significant rise in glucose levels.

The catecholamines are counterregulatory hormones that mobilize fuels from their storage sites for oxidation in target cells to meet the increased energy requirements that occur during acute or chronic stress or, in this case, the release of catecholamines by a tumor in the adrenal medulla. These actions provide the liver, for example, with increased levels of substrate needed for gluconeogenesis. Although in normal individuals, most of the glucose generated through this mechanism is oxidized, blood glucose levels rise in the process. In addition, the catecholamines suppress insulin secretion to ensure that fuels will continue to flow in the direction of use rather than into storage under these circumstances. Hence, blood glucose levels may rise in patients who have a pheochromocytoma.

FIGURE 41.7 Regulation of cortisol secretion. Various factors act on the hypothalamus to stimulate the release of corticotropinreleasing hormone (CRH). CRH stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary, which stimulates the release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. Cortisol inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH via negative feedback loops.
![ma08039756a7](ma08039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 41.6 Effects of epinephrine on fuel metabolism and pancreatic endocrine function. Epinephrine (Epi) stimulates glycogen breakdown in muscle and liver, gluconeogenesis in liver, and lipolysis in adipose tissue. Epinephrine further reinforces these effects because it increases the secretion of glucagon, a hormone that shares many of the same effects as epinephrine. Epi also inhibits insulin release while stimulating glucagon release from the pancreas. FA, fatty acid; TG, triglyceride.

## 4. Metabolism and Inactivation of Catecholamines

Catecholamines have a relatively low affinity for both $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-receptors. After binding, the catecholamine disassociates from its receptor quickly, causing the duration of the biologic response to be brief. The free hormone is degraded in several ways, as outlined in Chapter 46.

## D. Glucocorticoids

## I. Biochemistry

Cortisol (hydrocortisone) is the major physiologic glucocorticoid (GC) in humans, although corticosterone also has some GC activity. GCs, such as cortisol, were named for their ability to raise blood glucose levels. These steroids are among the "counterregulatory" hormones that protect the body from insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The biosynthesis of steroid hormones and their basic mechanism of action has been described in Chapters 32 and 16.

## 2. Secretion of Glucocorticoids

The synthesis and secretion of cortisol are controlled by a cascade of neural and endocrine signals linked in tandem in the cerebrocortical-hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenocortical axis. Cerebrocortical signals to the midbrain are initiated in the cerebral cortex by "stressful" signals such as pain, hypoglycemia, hemorrhage, and exercise (Fig. 41.7). These nonspecific "stresses" elicit the production of monoamines in the cell bodies of neurons of the midbrain. Those that stimulate the

synthesis and release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) are acetylcholine and serotonin. These neurotransmitters then induce the production of CRH by neurons originating in the paraventricular nucleus. These neurons discharge CRH into the hypothalamico-hypophyseal portal blood. CRH is delivered through these portal vessels to specific receptors on the cell membrane of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting cells of the anterior pituitary gland (corticotrophs). This hormone-receptor interaction causes ACTH to be released into the general circulation, eventually to interact with specific receptors for ACTH on the plasma membranes of cells in the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex. The major trophic influence of ACTH on cortisol synthesis is at the level of the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, from which the adrenal steroid hormones are derived (see Chapter 32 for the biosynthesis of the steroid hormones).

Cortisol is secreted from the adrenal cortex in response to ACTH. The concentration of free (unbound) cortisol that bathes the CRH-producing cells of the hypothalamus and the ACTH-producing cells of the anterior pituitary acts as a negative feedback signal that has a regulatory influence on the release of CRH and ACTH (see Fig. 41.7). High cortisol levels in the blood suppress CRH and ACTH secretion, and low cortisol levels stimulate secretion. In severe stress, however, the negative feedback signal on ACTH secretion exerted by high cortisol levels in the blood is overridden by the stress-induced activity of the higher portions of the axis (see Fig. 41.7).

The effects of GCs on fuel metabolism in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue are outlined in Table 41.1 and in Figure 41.8. Their effects on other tissues are diverse and, in many instances, essential for life. Some of the nonmetabolic actions of GCs are listed in Table S41.2 of the online supplement.

## 3. Effects of Glucocorticoids

GCs have diverse actions that affect most tissues of the body. At first glance, some of these effects may appear to be contradictory (such as inhibition of glucose uptake by certain tissues), but taken together, they promote survival in times of stress.
![ma09039756a7](ma09039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 41.8 Effects of glucocorticoids (GC) on fuel metabolism. GCs stimulate lipolysis in adipose tissue and the release of amino acids from muscle protein. In liver, glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis and the synthesis of glycogen. The breakdown of liver glycogen is stimulated by epinephrine.

(1)When Otto S. was writing his list of differential diagnoses to explain the clinical presentation of Chet S., he suddenly thought of a relatively rare endocrine disorder that could explain all of the presenting signs and symptoms. He made a provisional diagnosis of excessive secretion of cortisol secondary to an excess secretion of ACTH (Cushing disease) or by a primary increase of cortisol production by an adrenocortical tumor (Cushing syndrome).

Otto suggested that resting fasting plasma cortisol and ACTH levels be measured at 8:00 the next morning. These studies showed that $\mathrm{Mr}: \mathrm{S}$ 's morning plasma ACTH and cortisol levels were both significantly above the reference range. Therefore, Otto concluded that $\mathrm{Mr}: \mathrm{S}$ probably had a tumor that was producing ACTH autonomously (i.e., not subject to normal feedback inhibition by cortisol). The high plasma levels of ACTH were stimulating the adrenal cortex to produce excessive amounts of cortisol. Additional laboratory and imaging studies indicated that the hypercortisolemia was caused by a benign ACTH-secreting adenoma of the anterior pituitary gland (Cushing disease).

0
Otto S. was now able to explain the mechanism for most of Chet S.'s signs and symptoms. For example, Otto knew the metabolic explanation for the patient's hyperglycemia. Some of Mr S.'s muscle wasting and weakness were caused by the catabolic effect of hypercortisolism on protein stores, such as those in skeletal muscle, to provide amino acids as precursors for gluconeogenesis. This catabolic action also resulted in the degradation of elastin, a major supportive protein of the skin, as well as an increased fragility of the walls of the capillaries of the cutaneous tissues. These changes resulted in the easy bruisability and the torn subcutaneous tissues of the lower abdomen, which resulted in red striae (stripes). The plethora (redness) of Mr S.'s facial skin was also caused in part by the thinning of the skin as well as by a cortisol-induced increase in the bone marrow production of red blood cells, which enhanced the redness of the subcutaneous tissues.

0
If Chet S.'s problem had been caused by a neoplasm of the adrenal cortex, what would his levels of blood ACTH and cortisol have been?

In many tissues, GCs inhibit DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and stimulate the degradation of these macromolecules. In response to chronic stress, GCs act to make fuels available, so that when the acute alarm sounds and epinephrine is released, the organism can fight or flee. When GCs are elevated, glucose uptake by the cells of many tissues is inhibited, lipolysis occurs in peripheral adipose tissue, and proteolysis occurs in skin, lymphoid cells, and muscle. The fatty acids that are released are oxidized by the liver for energy, and the glycerol and amino acids serve in the liver as substrates for the production of glucose, which is converted to glycogen and stored. The alarm signal of epinephrine stimulates liver glycogen breakdown, making glucose available as fuel to combat the acute stress.

The mechanism by which GCs exert these effects involves binding of the steroid to intracellular receptors, interaction of the steroid-receptor complex with GC response elements on DNA, transcription of genes, and synthesis of specific proteins (see Chapter 16, Section III.C.2). In some cases, the specific proteins responsible for the GC effect are known (e.g., the induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase that stimulates gluconeogenesis). In other cases, the proteins responsible for the GC effect have not yet been identified.

## E. Thyroid Hormone

## I. Biochemistry

The secretory products of the thyroid acinar cells are tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine, $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ ) and triiodothyronine ( $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ ). Their structures are shown in Figure 41.9. The basic steps in the synthesis of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ in these cells involve the transport or trapping of iodide from the blood into the thyroid acinar cell against an electrochemical gradient, the oxidation of iodide to form an iodinating species, the iodination of tyrosyl residues on the protein thyroglobulin to form iodotyrosines, and the coupling of residues of monoiodo- and diiodotyrosine (DIT) in thyroglobulin to form residues of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ (Fig. 41.10). Proteolytic cleavage of thyroglobulin releases free $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$. The steps in thyroid hormone synthesis are stimulated by TSH, a glycoprotein produced by the anterior pituitary. Approximately $35 \%$ of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ is deiodinated at the $5^{\prime}$-position to form $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, and $41 \%$ is deiodinated at the 5 -position to form the inactive "reverse" $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. Further deiodination or oxidative deamination leads to formation of compounds that have no biologic activity.

Iodide transport from the blood into the thyroid acinar cell is accomplished through an energy-requiring, iodide-trapping mechanism that requires symport with sodium. The sodium-iodide symporter (NIS, encoded by the SLC5A5 gene) is driven by the electrochemical gradient across the membrane that is established by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase. For each iodide anion transported across the membrane, two sodium ions are cotransported to facilitate and drive the translocation of the ions. Loss of NIS activity leads to a congenital iodide transport defect.

The protein thyroglobulin (Tgb) is synthesized in thyroid follicular cells and secreted into the colloid. lodination and coupling of tyrosine residues in Tgb produce $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ residues, which are released from Tgb by pinocytosis (endocytosis) and lysosomal action. The coupling of a monoiodotyrosine with a diiodotyrosine (DIT) to form $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is not depicted here. NIS, sodium-iodide symporter; PD, pendrin; RER, rough endoplasmic reticulum.
![ma11039756a7](ma11039756a7.jpg)

The rate of iodide transport is influenced by the absolute concentration of iodide within the thyroid cell. An internal autoregulatory mechanism decreases transport of iodide into the cell when the intracellular iodide concentration exceeds a certain threshold and increases transport when intracellular iodide falls below this threshold level. The iodide-concentrating or trapping process in the plasma membrane of thyroid acinar cells creates iodide levels within the thyroid cell that are several hundredfold greater than those in the blood, depending on the current size of the total body iodide pool and the present need for new hormone synthesis.

The oxidation of intracellular iodide is catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase (located at the apical border of the thyroid acinar cell) in what may be a two-electron oxidation step forming $\mathrm{I}^{-}$(iodinium ion). Iodinium ion may react with a tyrosine residue in the protein thyroglobulin to form a tyrosine quinoid and then a $3^{\prime}$-monoiodotyrosine (MIT) residue. It has been suggested that a second iodide is added to the ring by similar mechanisms to form a 3,5-DIT residue. Because iodide is added to these organic compounds, iodination is also referred to as the organization of iodide.

The biosynthesis of thyroid hormone proceeds with the coupling of an MIT and a DIT residue to form a $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ residue or the coupling of two DIT residues to form a $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ residue. $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ are stored in the thyroid follicle as amino acid residues in thyroglobulin. Under most circumstances, the $\mathrm{T}_{4} / \mathrm{T}_{3}$ ratio in thyroglobulin is approximately $13: 1$. Normally, the thyroid gland secretes 80 to $100 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and approximately $5 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ per day. The additional 22 to $25 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ "produced" daily is the result of the deiodination of the $5^{\prime}$-carbon of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ in peripheral tissues. $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is believed to be the predominant biologically active form of thyroid hormone in the body. The thyroid gland is unique in that it has the capacity to store large amounts of hormone as amino acid residues in thyroglobulin within its colloid space. This storage accounts for the low overall turnover rate of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ in the body.

0If Chet S.'s problem had resulted from primary hypersecretion of cortisol by a neoplasm of the adrenal cortex, his blood cortisol levels would have been elevated. The cortisol would have acted on the CRH-producing cells of the hypothalamus and the ACTH-secreting cells of the anterior pituitary by a negative feedback mechanism to decrease ACTH levels in the blood.

Because his cortisol and ACTH levels were both high, Mr. S's tumor was most likely in the pituitary gland or possibly in neoplastic extrapituitary tissue that was secreting ACTH "ectopically" (Ectopic means that the tumor or neoplasm is producing and secreting a substance that is not ordinarily made or secreted by the tissue from which the tumor developed.) Mr. S's tumor was in the anterior pituitary, not in an extrapituitary ACTH-producing site.

(1)Once iodide anion enters the thyroid follicular cell, it must be transported across the apical membrane to react with thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin. The apical iodide transporter is pendrin (encoded by the SLC26A4 gene), and mutations in pendrin lead to Pendred syndrome. Children with this syndrome display a total loss of hearing, goiter (swelling of the thyroid gland), and metabolic defects in iodide organification.

The "central" deposition of fat in patients such as Chet $\mathbf{S}$, with Cushing disease or syndrome is not readily explained because GCs actually cause lipolysis in adipose tissue. The increased appetite caused by an excess of GC and the lipogenic effects of the hyperinsulinemia that accompanies the GC-induced chronic increase in blood glucose levels have been suggested as possible causes. Why the fat is deposited centrally under these circumstances, however, is not understood. This central deposition leads to the development of a large fat pad at the center of the upper back ("buffalo hump"), to accumulation of fat in the cheeks and jowls ("moon facies") and neck area, as well as a marked increase in abdominal fat. Simultaneously, there is a loss of adipose and muscle tissue below the elbows and knees, exaggerating the appearance of "central obesity" in Cushing disease or syndrome.

(1)In areas of the world in which the soil is deficient in iodide, hypothyroidism is common. The thyroid gland enlarges (forms a goiter) in an attempt to produce more thyroid hormone. In the United States, table salt $(\mathrm{NaCl})$ enriched with iodide (iodized salt) is used to prevent hypothyroidism caused by iodine deficiency.

The plasma half-life of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ is approximately 7 days, and that of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is 1 to 1.5 days. These relatively long plasma half-lives result from binding of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to several transport proteins in the blood. Of these transport proteins, thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) has the highest affinity for these hormones and carries approximately $70 \%$ of bound $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$. Only $0.03 \%$ of total $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $0.3 \%$ of total $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ in the blood are in the unbound state. This free fraction of hormone has biologic activity because it is the only form that is capable of diffusing across target cell membranes to interact with intracellular receptors. The transport proteins, therefore, serve as a large reservoir of hormone that can release additional free hormone as the metabolic need arises.

The thyroid hormones are degraded in liver, kidney, muscle, and other tissues by deiodination, which produces compounds with no biologic activity.

## 2. Secretion of Thyroid Hormone

The release of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ from thyroglobulin is controlled by TSH from the anterior pituitary. TSH stimulates the endocytosis of thyroglobulin to form endocytic vesicles within the thyroid acinar cells (see Fig. 41.10). Lysosomes fuse with these vesicles, and lysosomal proteases hydrolyze thyroglobulin, releasing free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ into the blood in a 10:1 ratio. In various tissues, $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ is deiodinated, forming $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, which is the active form of the hormone.

TSH is synthesized in the thyrotropic cells of the anterior pituitary. Its secretion is regulated primarily by a balance between the stimulatory action of hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and the inhibitory (negative feedback) influence of thyroid hormone (primarily $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ ) at levels above a critical threshold in the blood bathing the pituitary thyrotrophs. TSH secretion occurs in a circadian pattern, a surge beginning late in the afternoon and peaking before the onset of sleep. In addition, TSH is secreted in a pulsatile fashion, with intervals of 2 to 6 hours between peaks.

TSH stimulates all phases of thyroid hormone synthesis by the thyroid gland, including iodide trapping from the plasma, organification of iodide, coupling of monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine, endocytosis of thyroglobulin, and proteolysis of thyroglobulin to release $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ (see Fig. 41.10). In addition, the vascularity of the thyroid gland increases as TSH stimulates hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the thyroid acinar cells.

The predominant mechanism of action of TSH is mediated by binding of TSH to its G-protein-coupled receptor on the plasma membrane of the thyroid acinar cell, leading to an increase in the concentration of cytosolic cAMP (through $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{ss}}$ ) and calcium (through $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{sq}}$ ). The increase in calcium is brought about by activation of phospholipase C, eventually leading to the activation of the MAP kinase pathway.

The large protein thyroglobulin, which contains $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ in peptide linkage, is stored extracellularly in the colloid that fills the central space of each thyroid follicle. Each of the biochemical reactions that leads to the release and eventual secretion of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$, such as those that lead to their formation in thyroglobulins, is TSH-dependent. Rising levels of serum TSH stimulate the endocytosis of stored thyroglobulin into the thyroid acinar cell. Lysosomal enzymes then cleave $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ from thyroglobulin. $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ are secreted into the bloodstream in response to rising levels of TSH.

As the free $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ level in the blood bathing the thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland rises, the feedback loop is closed. Secretion of TSH is inhibited until the free $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ levels in the systemic circulation fall just below a critical level, which once again signals the release of TSH. This feedback mechanism ensures an uninterrupted supply of biologically active free $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ in the blood (Fig. 41.11). High levels of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ also inhibit the release of TRH from the hypothalamus.

## 3. Physiologic Effects of Thyroid Hormone

Only those physiologic actions of thyroid hormone that influence fuel metabolism are considered here. It is important to stress the term physiologic because the effects

of supraphysiologic concentrations of thyroid hormone on fuel metabolism may not be simple extensions of their physiologic effects. For example, when $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is present in excess, it has severe catabolic effects that increase the flow of amino acids from muscle into the blood and eventually to the liver. In general, the following comments apply to the effects of thyroid hormone on energy metabolism in individuals who have normal thyroid hormone levels in their blood.

## a. Effects of Thyroid Hormone on the Liver

Several actions of thyroid hormone affect carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the liver. Thyroid hormone increases glycolysis and cholesterol synthesis and increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile salts. Through its action of increasing the sensitivity of the hepatocyte to the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic actions of epinephrine, $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ indirectly increases hepatic glucose production (permissive or facilitatory action). Because of its ability to sensitize the adipocyte to the lipolytic action of epinephrine, $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ increases the flow of fatty acids to the liver and thereby indirectly increases hepatic triacylglycerol synthesis. The concurrent increase in the flow of glycerol to the liver (as a result of increased lipolysis) further enhances hepatic gluconeogenesis.

## b. Effects of Thyroid Hormone on the Adipocyte

$\mathrm{T}_{3}$ has an amplifying or facilitatory effect on the lipolytic action of epinephrine on fat cells. Yet, thyroid hormone has a bipolar effect on lipid storage because it increases the availability of glucose to the fat cells, which serves as a precursor for fatty acid and glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis. The major determinant of the rate of lipogenesis, however, is not $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ but rather the amount of glucose and insulin available to the adipocyte for triacylglycerol synthesis.

## c. Effects of Thyroid Hormone on Muscle

In physiologic concentrations, $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ increases glucose uptake by muscle cells. It also stimulates protein synthesis, and, therefore, growth of muscle through its stimulatory actions on gene expression.

In physiologic concentrations, thyroid hormone sensitizes the muscle cell to the glycogenolytic actions of epinephrine. Glycolysis in muscle is increased by this action of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$.

## d. Effects of Thyroid Hormone on the Pancreas

Thyroid hormone increases the sensitivity of the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas to those stimuli that normally promote insulin release and is required for optimal insulin secretion.

## 4. Calorigenic Effects of Thyroid Hormone

The oxidation of fuels converts approximately $25 \%$ of the potential energy present in the foods ingested by humans to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This relative inefficiency of the human "engine" leads to the production of heat as a consequence of fuel use. This inefficiency, in part, allows homeothermic animals to maintain a constant body temperature in spite of rapidly changing environmental conditions. The acute response to cold exposure is shivering, which is probably secondary to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system in response to this "stressful" stimulus.

Thyroid hormone participates in this acute response by sensitizing the sympathetic nervous system to the stimulatory effect of cold exposure. The ability of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ to increase heat production is related to its effects on the pathways of fuel oxidation, which both generate ATP and release energy as heat. The effects of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ on the sympathetic nervous system increase the release of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine stimulates the uncoupling protein thermogenin in brown adipose tissue (BAT), resulting in increased heat production from the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (see Chapter 24). Very little residual brown fat persists in normal adult human beings, however.

FIGURE 41.II Feedback regulation of thyroid hormone levels. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary, which stimulates the release of triiodothyronine $\left(T_{3}\right)$ and tetraiodothyronine $\left(T_{4}\right)$ from the thyroid. $T_{4}$ is converted to $T_{3}$ in the liver and other cells. $T_{3}$ inhibit the release of TSH from the anterior pituitary and of TRH from the hypothalamus.

0A a patient presents with the following clinical and laboratory profile: the serum free and total $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and the serum TSH levels are elevated, but the patient has symptoms of mild hypothyroidism, including a diffuse, palpable goiter. What single abnormality in the pituitary-thyroid-thyroid hormone target cell axis would explain all of these findings?

A generalized (i.e., involving all of the target cells for thyroid hormone in the body) but incomplete resistance of cells to the actions of thyroid hormone could explain the profile of the patient. In Refetoff disorder, a mutation in the portion of the gene that encodes the ligand-binding domain of the $\beta$-subunit of the thyroid hormonereceptor protein (expressed in all thyroid hormoneresponsive cells) causes a relative resistance to the suppressive action of thyroid hormone on the secretion of TSH by the thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland. Therefore, the gland releases more TSH than normal into the blood. The elevated level of TSH causes an enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter) as well as an increase in the secretion of thyroid hormone into the blood. As a result, the serum levels of both $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$ rise in the blood. The increase in the secretion of thyroid hormone may or may not be adequate to fully compensate for the relative resistance of the peripheral tissues to thyroid hormone. If the compensatory increase in the secretion of thyroid hormone is inadequate, the patient may develop the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.

0In hypothyroid patients, insulin release may be suboptimal, although glucose intolerance on this basis alone is uncommon.

In hyperthyroidism, the degradation and the clearance of insulin are increased. These effects, plus the increased demand for insulin caused by the changes in glucose metabolism, may lead to varying degrees of glucose intolerance in these patients (a condition called metathyroid diabetes mellitus). A patient with uncomplicated hyperthyroidism, however, rarely develops significant diabetes mellitus.

Ghrelin, a hormone identified as a GH secretagogue, has recently been linked to appetite stimulation. The mechanism whereby this occurs is through the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase in the hypothalamus. The activation of this kinase leads to the release of neuropeptide Y, which increases appetite. Research geared toward interrupting the ghrelin/ghrelin receptor signaling system is increasing in order to develop new anti-obesity agents.

Norepinephrine also increases the permeability of BAT and skeletal muscle to sodium. Because an increase of intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is potentially toxic to cells, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase is stimulated to transport $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$out of the cell in exchange for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. The increased hydrolysis of ATP by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase stimulates the oxidation of fuels and the regeneration of more ATP and heat from oxidative phosphorylation. Over a longer time course, thyroid hormone also increases the level of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}-$ ATPase and many of the enzymes of fuel oxidation. Because even at normal room temperature, ATP use by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase accounts for $20 \%$ or more of our basal metabolic rate (BMR), changes in its activity can cause relatively large increases in heat production.

Thyroid hormone also may increase heat production by stimulating ATP use in futile cycles (in which reversible ATP-consuming conversions of substrate to product and back to substrate use fuels and, therefore, produce heat).

## F. Gastrointestinal-Derived Hormones that Affect Fuel Metabolism

In addition to insulin and the counterregulatory hormones discussed so far, a variety of peptides synthesized in the endocrine cells of the pancreatic islets, or the cells of the enteric nervous system, or the endocrine cells of the stomach, small bowel, and large bowel, as well as certain cells of the central and peripheral nervous system, influence fuel metabolism directly. Some of these peptides and their tissues of origin, their actions on fuel metabolism, and the factors that stimulate (or suppress) their secretion are listed in Table 41.2. In addition to these peptides, others, such as gastrin, motilin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), peptide YY (PYY), and secretin may also influence fuel metabolism but by indirect effects on the synthesis or secretion of insulin or the counterregulatory hormones (Table S41.3, online supplement). For example, gastrin induces gastric acid secretion, which ultimately affects nutrient absorption and metabolism. Motilin, secreted by enteroendocrine M-cells of the proximal small bowel, stimulates gastric and pancreatic enzyme secretion, which, in turn, influences nutrient digestion. PP from the pancreatic islets reduces gastric emptying and slows upper intestinal motility. PYY from the $\alpha$-cells in the mature pancreatic islets inhibits gastric acid secretion. Finally, secretin, produced by the enteroendocrine S-cells in the proximal small bowel, regulates pancreatic enzyme secretion and inhibits gastrin release and secretion of gastric acid. Although these "gut" hormones do not influence fuel metabolism directly, they have a significant impact on how ingested nutrients are digested and prepared for absorption. If digestion or absorption of fuels is altered through a disturbance in the delicate interplay among all of the peptides, fuel metabolism will be altered as well.

Several of these gastrointestinal peptides, such as glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), do not act as direct insulin secretagogues when blood glucose levels are normal but do so after a meal large enough to cause an increase in the blood glucose concentration. The release of these peptides may explain why the modest postprandial increase in serum glucose that is seen in normal subjects has a relatively robust stimulatory effect on insulin release, whereas a similar glucose concentration in vitro elicits a significantly smaller increase in insulin secretion. Likewise, this effect (certain factors potentiating insulin release), known as the incretin effect, could account for the greater $\beta$-cell response seen after an oral glucose load as opposed to that seen after the administration of glucose intravenously. This phenomenon is estimated to account for approximately $50 \%$ to $70 \%$ of the total insulin secreted after oral glucose administration. It is clear, then, that the gastrointestinal tract plays a critical role in peripheral energy homeostasis through its ability to influence the digestion, absorption, and assimilation of ingested nutrients. Importantly, the incretin hormones also regulate the amount of nutrients ingested, through their central action as satiety signals.

In Table 41.3 the actions of GLP-1 and GIP on key target organs that are important for the control of glucose homeostasis are given. Both GLP-1 and GIP enhance the synthesis and release of insulin as well as exerting a positive influence on the survival of pancreatic islet cells. In addition, GLP-1 contributes to the regulation of glucose homeostasis by inhibiting the secretion of glucagon from the $\alpha$-cells of the pancreas as well as by slowing the rate of gastric emptying. GIP, but not GLP-1, interacts with GIP receptors on adipocytes, an interaction that is coupled to energy storage. Figure 41.12 summarizes the key effects of GLP-1 and GIP on energy metabolism.

![ma13039756a7](ma13039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 4I. 12 Actions of selected peptides on vital tissues involved in glucose homeostasis. Both glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-I) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) increase insulin secretion and $\beta$-cell survival. GLP-I has additional actions related to glucose metabolism. In contrast, gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) do not acutely regulate plasma glucose levels but appear to increase $\beta$-cell proliferation.

As the biologic effects of the incretins were being discovered it was hypothesized that agents that would increase the levels of the incretins, or increase their half-life in circulation, may provide an effective means of treating type 2 diabetes by increasing insulin secretion from the pancreas. The half-lives of GIP and GLP-1 in the circulation are on the order of 2.5 minutes. The protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), found on the surface of kidneys, intestine, liver, and many other tissues, is responsible for inactivating GIP and GLP-1. In order to increase the efficacy of the incretins, synthetic incretin mimetics with longer half-lives, were developed, along with drugs which inhibit DPP-4, thereby increasing the serum half-lives of GIP and GLP-1. These types of medications are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The first are potent GLP-1 receptor agonists. Exendin-4 or exenatide (Byetta) isolated from the venom of a lizard, Heloderma suspectum, was the first drug approved for such treatment. This agonist of the GLP-1 receptor must be administered subcutaneously, but because of its relative resistance to enzymatic cleavage by DPP-4 (unlike native GLP-1, which is rapidly cleaved by this enzyme), its biologic half-life in the plasma allows it to be administered only twice daily. DPP-4 cleaves GLP-1 after amino acid 2 (alanine) and breaks the alanine-glutamate peptide bond at that position. Exenatide has a glycine-glutamate sequence at amino acids 2 and 3, rendering this peptide more resistant to DPP-4 action than GLP-1. A second GLP-1 receptor agonist is liraglutide, which is a modified version of GLP-1. Liraglutide has a substitution, at position 34 of the peptide, of an arginine for a lysine (K34R), along with the addition of a palmitate at position K26 (covalently linked to the lysine side chain). Addition of the fatty acid to the peptide allows liraglutide to bind to albumin in the circulation, protecting it from DPP-4 and allowing just a single daily dosing.

The second class of agents (first marketed in October 2006 as sitagliptin [Januvia]) are orally administered inhibitors of DPP-4. Through this action, sitagliptin slows the rate of catalytic cleavage of GIP and of GLP-1 by DPP-4 and, therefore, prolongs their half-lives in the blood, allowing sitagliptin to be administered just twice daily. The contrasting actions of GLP-1 receptor agonists and the DPP-4 inhibitors are listed in Table 41.4. Since the introduction of sitagliptin, other DPP-4 inhibitors have been introduced, including alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, and vildagliptin. All have been approved by the FDA for use in the United States, and some are bundled in combinations with other drugs to treat type 2 diabetes.

Early estimates of their glucose-lowering efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus suggest that the drugs that boost incretin action lower the blood hemoglobin $\mathrm{A}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ level to approximately the same extent as do the other currently available oral antidiabetic agents (see the "Biochemical Comments" in Chapter 32) such as the sulfonylureas, metformin, and the thiazolidine diones (e.g., rosiglitazone [Avandia] and pioglitazone [Actos]).

It has long been noted that when obese individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergo gastric bypass procedure, their type 2 diabetes is resolved very shortly after surgery and before there is significant weight loss. This effect has been linked to a rapid and sustained increase in both amylin and GLP-1, which is greater than in individuals who have not had the procedure done. The incretin effect of GLP-1 leads to insulin and amylin release and to a reduction of high blood glucose levels in the patient.

To establish the diagnosis of a secretory tumor of an endocrine gland, one must first demonstrate that basal serum levels of the hormone in question are regularly elevated. More important, one must show that the hypersecretion of the hormone (and hence, its elevated level in the peripheral blood) cannot be adequately inhibited by "maneuvers" that are known to suppress secretion from a normally functioning gland (i.e., one must show that the hypersecretion is "autonomous").

To ensure that both the basal and the postsuppression levels of the specific hormone to be tested will reflect the true secretory rate of the suspected endocrine tumor, all of the known factors that can stimulate the synthesis of the hormone must be eliminated. For GH, for example, the secretagogues (stimulants to secretion) include nutritional factors; the patient's level of activity, consciousness, and stress; and certain drugs. GH secretion is stimulated by a high-protein meal or by a low level of fatty acids or of glucose in the blood. Vigorous exercise, stage III-IV sleep, psychologic and physical stress, and levodopa, clonidine, and estrogens also increase GH release.

The suppression test used to demonstrate the autonomous hypersecretion of GH involves giving the patient an oral glucose load and measuring GH levels subsequently. A sudden rise in blood glucose suppresses serum GH to $2 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ or less in normal subjects but not in patients with active acromegaly.

If one attempts to demonstrate autonomous hypersecretion of GH in a patient suspected of having acromegaly, therefore, before drawing the blood for both the basal (pre-glucose load) serum GH level and the post-glucose load serum GH level, one must be certain that the patient has not eaten for 6 to 8 hours, has not done vigorous exercise for at least 4 hours, remains fully awake during the entire testing period (in a nonstressed state to the extent possible), and has not taken any drugs known to increase GH secretion for at least 1 week.

Under these carefully controlled circumstances, if both the basal and postsuppression serum levels of the suspect hormone are elevated, one can conclude that autonomous hypersecretion is probably present. At this point, localization procedures (such as an MRI of the pituitary gland in a patient with suspected acromegaly) are performed to further confirm the diagnosis.

## G. Neural Factors that Control Secretion of Insulin and Counterregulatory Hormones

Although a full treatment is beyond the scope of this text, the gastrointestinal neuroendocrine system is described briefly here with regard to its effects on fuel metabolism. The pancreatic islet cells are innervated by both the adrenergic and the cholinergic limbs of the autonomic nervous system. Although stimulation of both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems increases glucagon secretion, insulin secretion is increased by vagus nerve fibers and suppressed by sympathetic fibers via the $\alpha$-adrenoreceptors. Evidence also suggests that the sympathetic nervous system regulates pancreatic $\beta$-cell function indirectly, through stimulation or suppression of the secretion of somatostatin, $\beta_{2}$-adrenergic receptor number, and the neuropeptides neuropeptide Y and galanin.

A tightly controlled interaction between the hormonal and neural factors that control nutrient metabolism is necessary to maintain normal fuel and hence energy homeostasis.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Chet S. One of the functions of cortisol is to prepare the body to deal with periods of stress. In response to cortisol, the body re-sorts its fuel stores so that they can rapidly be made available for the "fight-or-flight" response to the alarm signal sounded by epinephrine. Cortisol causes gluconeogenic substrates to move from peripheral tissues to the liver, where they are converted to glucose and stored as glycogen. The release of epinephrine stimulates the breakdown of glycogen, increasing the supply of glucose to the blood. Thus, fuel becomes available for muscle to fight or flee.

Cushing syndrome is a prolonged and inappropriate increased level of cortisol. The most common cause is Cushing disease, the cause of Chet S.'s current problems. This results from prolonged hypersecretion of ACTH from a benign pituitary tumor. ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol, and blood levels of this steroid hormone rise.

Other nonpituitary causes of Cushing syndrome include a primary tumor of the adrenal cortex secreting excessive amounts of cortisol directly into the bloodstream. This disorder also can result from the release of ACTH from secretory nonendocrine, nonpituitary neoplasms ("ectopic" ACTH syndrome). Cushing syndrome often is caused by excessive doses of synthetic GCs used to treat a variety of disorders because of their potent antiinflammatory effects (iatrogenic Cushing syndrome).

Sam A. The diabetogenic potential of chronically elevated GH levels in the blood is manifest by the significant incidence of diabetes mellitus (25\%) and impaired glucose tolerance (33\%) in patients with acromegaly, such as Sam A. Under normal circumstances, however, physiologic concentrations of GH (as well as of cortisol and thyroid hormone) have a facilitatory or permissive effect on the quantity of insulin released in response to hyperglycemia and other insulin secretagogues. This "proinsular" effect is probably intended to act as a "brake" to dampen any potentially excessive "contrainsular" effects that increments in GH and the other counterregulatory hormones exert.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

Radioimmunoassays. Most hormones are present in body fluids in picomolar to nanomolar amounts, requiring highly sensitive assays to determine their concentration in the blood or urine. Radioimmunoassays (RIAs), developed in the 1960s, use an antibody, generated in animals, against a specific antigen (the hormone to be measured). Determining the concentration of the hormone in the sample involves incubating the plasma or urine sample with the antibody and then quantifying the level of antigen-antibody complex formed during the incubation by one of several techniques.

The classic RIA uses very high-affinity antibodies, which have been fixed (immobilized) on the inner surface of a test tube, a Teflon bead, or a magnetized particle. A standard curve is prepared using a set amount of the antibody and various known concentrations of the unlabeled hormone to be measured. In addition to a known concentration of the unlabeled hormone, each tube contains the same small, carefully measured amount of radiolabeled hormone. The labeled hormone and the unlabeled hormone compete for binding to the antibody. The higher the amount of unlabeled hormone in the sample, the less radiolabeled hormone is bound. A standard curve is plotted (Fig. 41.13). The sample from the patient's blood or urine, containing the unlabeled hormone to be measured, is incubated with the immobilized antibody in the presence of the same small, carefully measured amount of radiolabeled hormone. The amount of radiolabeled hormone bound to the antibody is determined, and the standard curve is used to quantitate the amount of unlabeled hormone in the patient sample.

The same principle is used in immunoradiometric assays (IRMAs), but with this technique, the antibody, rather than the antigen to be measured, is radiolabeled.

The sensitivity of RIAs can be enhanced using a "sandwich technique." This method uses two different monoclonal antibodies (antibodies generated by a single clone of plasma cells rather than multiple clones), each of which recognizes a different specific portion of the hormone's structure. The first antibody, attached to a solid support matrix such as a plastic culture dish, binds the hormone to be assayed. After exposure of the patient sample to this first antibody, the excess plasma is washed away, and the second antibody (which is radiolabeled) is then incubated with the first antibody-hormone complex. The amount of binding of the second (labeled) antibody to the first complex is proportional to the concentration of the hormone in the sample.

The sandwich technique can be improved even further if the second antibody is attached to an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase. The enzyme rapidly converts an added colorless substrate into a colored product, or a nonfluorescent substrate into a highly fluorescent product. These changes can be quantitated if the degree of change in color or fluorescence is proportional to the amount of hormone present in the patient sample. Less than a nanogram $\left(10^{-9} \mathrm{~g}\right)$ of a protein can be measured by such an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

## KEY CONCEPTS

- Insulin is the major anabolic hormone of the body.
- Hormones that counteract the action of insulin are known as counterregulatory (contrainsular) hormones.
- Glucagon is the major counterregulatory hormone.
- Other contrainsular hormones are
- Epinephrine
- Norepinephrine
- Cortisol
- Somatostatin
- Growth hormone
- Thyroid hormone
- Somatostatin inhibits insulin secretion as well as the secretion of a large number of other hormones.
- Growth hormone (GH) exhibits a wide variety of effects.
- GH increases lipolysis in adipose tissue, which increases the availability of fatty acids for oxidation, thereby reducing the oxidation of glucose and amino acids.
- GH increases amino acid uptake into muscle cells, thereby increasing muscle protein synthesis.
- GH stimulates gluconeogenesis (from amino acid substrates) and glycogen production in the liver.

FIGURE 41.13 Standard curve for a radioimmunoassay. A constant amount of radioactive tetraiodothyronine $\left(T_{4}\right)$ is added to a series of tubes, each of which contains a different amount of nonradioactive $T_{4}$. The amount of radioactive hormone that binds to an antibody that is specific for the hormone is measured and plotted against the nonradioactive hormone concentration. When more nonradioactive $T_{4}$ is present in the tube, less radioactive $T_{4}$ binds to the antibody.

The catecholamines have metabolic effects directed toward mobilization of fuels from their storage sites for oxidation by cells while simultaneously suppressing insulin secretion.
Cortisol (a glucocorticoid) promotes survival in times of stress, primarily via alteration of gene expression.

ATP-requiring processes, such as DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, are inhibited.
Fuels are made available.
Fat-cell lipolysis is stimulated.
Muscle proteolysis is stimulated.
Glucose uptake by many tissues is inhibited to provide the nervous system with the glucose.

The liver uses the carbons of the amino acids for gluconeogenesis and glycogen storage.
Thyroid hormone secretion is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).
Thyroid hormone effects in the liver include
Increases in glycolysis and cholesterol synthesis
Increase in the synthesis of bile salts
Increase in triglyceride synthesis
Thyroid hormone effects on fat cells include
Increased lipolysis
Increased glycerol release to the liver
Thyroid hormone also stimulates heat production via a variety of mechanisms. The intestine and stomach (the gut) also secrete a variety of factors that affect fuel metabolism by working with (or against) the other hormones already described.
The incretins glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are synthesized in specialized cells of the gastrointestinal tract.
GLP-1 and GIP influence nutrient homeostasis by increasing insulin release from the pancreatic $\beta$-cells in a glucose-dependent manner.
Incretin action facilitates the uptake of glucose by muscle tissue and by the liver while simultaneously suppressing glucagon secretion by the $\alpha$-cells of the pancreas.
The incretins also increase the levels of cAMP in the islets, leading to expansion of $\beta$-cell mass and resistance to $\beta$-cell apoptosis.
Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 41.5.

C. Cortisol, DHEA, epinephrine, aldosterone
D. Aldosterone, DHEA, cortisol, epinephrine
E. DHEA, aldosterone, epinephrine, cortisol

1. The answer is E. A tumor of the adrenal cortex is secreting excessive amounts of cortisol into the blood, which adversely affects glucose tolerance; suppresses pituitary secretion of ACTH; and, through chronic hypercortisolemia, causes the physical changes described in this patient. Uncomplicated non-insulin-dependent and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus can be eliminated as possible diagnoses because they are not associated with elevated plasma cortisol levels and low plasma ACTH levels. In this patient, hyperglycemia resulted from the diabetogenic effects of chronic hypercortisolemia. An ACTH-secreting tumor of the anterior pituitary gland would cause hypercortisolemia, which, in turn, could adversely affect glucose tolerance; however, in this case, the plasma ACTH levels would have been high rather than $0 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$. The posterior pituitary gland secretes oxytocin and vasopressin, neither of which influences blood glucose, cortisol, or ACTH levels.
2. The answer is A. High blood glucose levels cause a decrease in GH levels in the blood. This fact serves as the basis for the glucose suppression test for GH. Answers B, C, and D all would cause GH levels to increase, whereas answer E would have no effect on the test.
3. The answer is B. When iodine is deficient in the diet, the thyroid does not make normal amounts of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$. Consequently, there is less feedback inhibition of TSH production and release; hence, an increased secretion of TSH would be observed. There is no direct effect on thyroglobulin synthesis (thus, A is incorrect). TRH is released by the hypothalamus to release TSH from the pituitary; a lack of thyroid hormone would increase production of TRH, not decrease it (thus, C is incorrect). An overproduction of thyroid hormone leads to increased heat production and weight loss; lack of thyroid hormone does not lead to these symptoms (thus, D and E are incorrect).
4. The answer is A. The woman is experiencing hypothyroidism; TSH is elevated in an attempt to secrete more thyroid hormone because the existing dose is too low to suppress TSH release.
5. The answer is C. Glucagon, epinephrine, and norepinephrine decrease glycogenesis (the synthesis of glycogen). Growth and thyroid hormones have no effect on glycogenesis. The only counterregulatory hormone
to increase glycogenesis is cortisol, which is preparing the body for future needs by storing amino acid carbons (obtained from protein degradation in the muscle) as glycogen in the liver.
6. The answer is D. Counterregulatory hormones oppose the actions of insulin. Glucagon is the major counterregulatory hormone, but epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, somatostatin, GH, and thyroid hormone are all classified as counterregulatory hormones because all affect fuel metabolism in a manner opposite that of insulin's action on fuel metabolism. Erythropoietin stimulates bone marrow production of red blood cells and does not oppose the actions of insulin.
7. The answer is D. Somatostatin leads to the inactivation of adenylate cyclase, thereby reducing cAMP levels. This reduces the secretion of GH, TSH, insulin, glucagon, serotonin, and TRH. The reduction of TRH and TSH would reduce thyroid hormone production. Somatostatin will not reduce the secretion of GCs, catecholamines (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine), and erythropoietin.
8. The answer is E. A pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-producing tumor of the adrenal glands that overproduces and secretes epinephrine and other catecholamines. VMA and the metanephrines are the degradation products from these hormones. Because the levels of the degradation products are elevated, the tumor is secreting catecholamines, which also explains the symptoms. None of the other tumors listed will produce VMA as a degradation product.
9. The answer is D. GIP and GLP-1 accentuate insulin release after a meal large enough to cause an increase in blood glucose concentration (so they should be increased as a treatment for diabetes). Both GIP and GLP-1 have a very short half-life owing to inactivation by DPP-4. Reducing the levels of DPP-4 would allow more GLP-1 and GIP to stimulate insulin release and lower postprandial blood glucose levels. Somatostatin and glucagon are counterregulatory hormones and would antagonize the effects of insulin.
10. The answer is B. The outermost layer of the adrenal cortex produces mineralocorticoids (aldosterone). The intermediate layer produces GCs (cortisol). The inner most layer of the cortex produces adrenal androgens (DHEA). The adrenal medulla (inside the cortex) produces catecholamines such as epinephrine.

# The Biochemistry of Erythrocytes and Other Blood Cells 

The cells of the blood are classified as erythrocytes, leukocytes, or thrombocytes. The erythrocytes (red cells) carry oxygen to the tissues and are the most numerous cells in the blood. The leukocytes (white cells) are involved in defense against infection, and the thrombocytes (platelets) function in blood clotting. All of the cells in the blood can be generated from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow on demand. For example, in response to infection, leukocytes secrete cytokines called interleukins that stimulate the production of additional leukocytes to fight the infection. Decreased supply of oxygen to the tissues signals the kidney to release erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of red cells.

The red cell has limited metabolic function, owing to its lack of internal organelles. Glycolysis is the main energy-generating pathway, with lactate production regenerating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$) for glycolysis to continue. The NADH produced in glycolysis is also used to reduce the ferric form of hemoglobin, methemoglobin, to the normal ferrous state. Glycolysis also leads to a side pathway in which 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) is produced, which is a major allosteric effector for oxygen binding to hemoglobin (see Chapter 7). The hexose monophosphate shunt pathway generates NADPH to protect red cell membrane lipids and proteins from oxidation, through regeneration of reduced glutathione. Heme synthesis occurs in the precursors of red cells and is a complex pathway that originates from succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) and glycine. Mutations in any of the steps of heme synthesis lead to a group of diseases known collectively as porphyrias.

The red cell membrane must be highly deformable to allow it to travel throughout the capillary system in the body. This is because of a complex cytoskeletal structure that consists of the major proteins spectrin, ankyrin, and band 3 protein. Mutations in these proteins lead to improper formation of the membrane cytoskeleton, ultimately resulting in malformed red cells, spherocytes, in the circulation. Spherocytes have a shortened life span, leading to loss of blood cells.

When the body does not have sufficient red cells, the patient is said to be anemic. Anemia can result from many causes. Nutritional deficiencies of iron, folate, or vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{12}$ prevent the formation of adequate numbers of red cells. Mutations in the genes that encode red cell metabolic enzymes, membrane structural proteins, and globins cause hereditary anemias. The appearance of red cells on a blood smear frequently provides clues to the cause of an anemia. Because the mutations that give rise to hereditary anemias also provide some protection against malaria, hereditary anemias are some of the most common genetic diseases known.

In human, globin gene expression is altered during development, a process known as hemoglobin switching. The switch between expression of one gene to another is regulated by transcription factor binding to the promoter regions of these genes. Current research is attempting to reactivate fetal hemoglobin genes to combat sickle cell disease and thalassemia.

# THE WAITING ROOM 

$\square$Lisa N., who has $\beta^{+}$-thalassemia, complains of pain in her lower spine (see Chapters 14 and 15). A quantitative computed tomogram (CT) of the vertebral bodies of the lumbar spine shows evidence of an area of early spinal cord compression in the upper lumbar region. She is suffering from severe anemia, resulting in stimulation of production of red blood cell (RBC) precursors (the erythroid mass) from the stem cells in her bone marrow. This expansion of marrow volume causes osteoporosis, leading to compression fractures in the lumbar spine area, which, in turn, cause pain. In addition to treatment of the osteoporosis, local irradiation to reduce the marrow volume in the lumbar spine is considered, as is a program of regular blood transfusions to maintain the oxygen-carrying capacity of circulating RBCs. The results of special studies related to the genetic defect underlying her thalassemia are pending, although preliminary studies have shown that she has elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin, which, in part, moderates the manifestations of her disease. Lisa N.'s parents have returned to the clinic to discuss the results of these tests.

Edward R. is a 21-year-old college student who complains of feeling tired all the time. Two years previously he had had gallstones removed, which consisted mostly of bilirubin. His spleen is palpable, and jaundice (icterus) is evidenced by yellowing of the whites of his eyes. His hemoglobin is low ( $8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$; reference value, 13.5 to $17.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). A blood smear showed dark, rounded, abnormally small red cells called spherocytes as well as an increase in the number of circulating immature RBCs known as reticulocytes.

## I. Cells of the Blood

The blood, together with the bone marrow, composes the organ system that makes a significant contribution to achieving homeostasis, the maintenance of the normal composition of the body's internal environment. Blood can be considered a liquid tissue consisting of water, proteins, and specialized cells. The most abundant cells in the blood are the erythrocytes or RBCs, which transport oxygen to the tissues and contribute to buffering of the blood through the binding of protons by hemoglobin (see the material in Chapter 4, Section IV.B, and Chapter 7, Section VII). RBCs lose all internal organelles during the process of differentiation. The white blood cells (leukocytes) are nucleated cells present in blood that function in the defense against infection. The platelets (thrombocytes), which contain cytoplasmic organelles but no nucleus, are involved in the control of bleeding by contributing to normal thrombus (clot) formation within the lumen of the blood vessel. The average concentration of these cells in the blood of normal individuals is presented in Table 42.1.

## A. Classification and Functions of Leukocytes and Thrombocytes

The leukocytes can be classified either as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (granulocytes) or mononuclear leukocytes, depending on the morphology of the nucleus in

| TABLE-42 I Normal Values of Blood Cell Concentrations in Adults |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| CELLTYPE | MEAN (cells/mm ${ }^{3}$ ) |
| Erythrocytes | $5.2 \times 10^{9}$ (men) |
|  | $4.6 \times 10^{9}$ women |
| Neutrophils | 4,300 |
| Lymphocytes | 2,700 |
| Monocytes | 500 |
| Eosinophils | 230 |
| Basophils | 40 |

these cells. The mononuclear leukocyte has a rounded nucleus, whereas the polymorphonuclear leukocyte has a multilobed nucleus.

# I. The Granulocytes 

The granulocytes, so named because of the presence of secretory granules visible on staining, are the neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. When these cells are activated in response to chemical stimuli, the vesicle membranes fuse with the cell plasma membrane, resulting in the release of the granule contents (degranulation). The granules contain many cell-signaling molecules that mediate inflammatory processes. The granulocytes, in addition to displaying segmented nuclei (are polymorphonuclear), can be distinguished from each other by their staining properties (caused by different granular contents) in standard hematologic blood smears: Neutrophils stain pink, eosinophils stain red, and basophils stain blue.

Neutrophils are phagocytic cells that migrate rapidly to areas of infection or tissue damage. As part of the response to acute infection, neutrophils engulf foreign bodies and destroy them, in part, by initiating the respiratory burst (see Chapter 25). The respiratory burst creates oxygen radicals that rapidly destroy the foreign material found at the site of infection.

A primary function of eosinophils is to protect against parasites, such as worms, and to remove fibrin during inflammation. The eosinophilic granules are lysosomes containing hydrolytic enzymes and cationic proteins, which are toxic to parasitic worms. Increased eosinophils are also present in asthma and allergic responses, autoimmune diseases, and some cancers. Elucidating the function of eosinophils is currently an active area of research.

Basophils, the least abundant of the leukocytes, participate in hypersensitivity reactions, such as allergic responses. Histamine, produced by the decarboxylation of histidine, is stored in the secretory granules of basophils. Release of histamine during basophil activation stimulates smooth muscle cell contraction and increases vascular permeability. The granules also contain enzymes such as proteases, $\beta$-glucuronidase, and lysophospholipase. These enzymes degrade microbial structures and assist in the remodeling of damaged tissue.

## 2. Mononuclear Leukocytes

The mononuclear leukocytes consist of various classes of lymphocytes and the monocytes. Lymphocytes are small, round cells that were originally identified in lymph fluid. These cells have a high ratio of nuclear volume to cytoplasmic volume and are the primary antigen (foreign body)-recognizing cells. There are three major types of lymphocytes: T-cells, B-cells, and natural killer (NK)-cells. The precursors of T-cells (thymus-derived lymphocytes) are produced in the bone marrow and then migrate to the thymus, where they mature before being released to the circulation. Several subclasses of T-cells exist. These subclasses are identified by different surface membrane proteins, the presence of which correlate with the function of the subclass. Lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow are the B-cells, which secrete antibodies in response to antigen binding. The third class of lymphocytes is the NK-cells, which target virally infected and malignant cells for destruction.

Circulatory monocytes are the precursors of tissue macrophages. Macrophages ("large eaters") are phagocytic cells that enter inflammatory sites and consume microorganisms and necrotic host cell debris left behind by granulocyte attack of the foreign material. Macrophages in the spleen play an important role in maintaining the oxygen-delivering capabilities of the blood by removing damaged RBCs that have a reduced oxygen-carrying capacity.

## 3. The Thrombocytes

Platelets are heavily granulated disclike cells that aid in intravascular clotting. Like the erythrocyte, platelets lack a nucleus. Their function is discussed in the following chapter. Platelets arise by budding of the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes, multinucleated cells that reside in the bone marrow.

A complete blood count (CBC) is ordered when a physician suspects a problem in the cellular composition of a patient's blood. The cells within the collected blood are counted and typed using an automated analyzer, based on flow cytometry (counting cells one at a time as they flow through a detector). As each cell flows through the machine, a laser shines light at the cell, which leads to predictable light-scattering and absorbance depending on the cell type. Based on the light-scattering and absorption pattern, the machine keeps track of the results of each cell that flows through the machine, leading to a very accurate count of each cell type present in the sample. The data from this analysis will include the total number of red cells per liter; the amount of hemoglobin in the red cells (in grams per liter), the hematocrit (the fraction of whole blood that consists of RBCs), the MCV, the total number of white blood cells, as well as a count of the different types of white blood cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils).

An inherited deficiency in erythrocyte pyruvate kinase leads to hemolytic anemia (an anemia caused by the destruction of RBCs; hemoglobin values typically drop to 4 to $10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ in this condition, with normal values being 13.5 to 17.5 in males or 11.5 to 15.5 in females). Because the amount of ATP formed from glycolysis can be decreased by $50 \%$, RBC ion transporters cannot function effectively. The RBCs tend to gain $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and lose $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and water. The water loss increases the intracellular hemoglobin concentration. With the increase in intracellular hemoglobin concentration, the internal viscosity of the cell is increased to the point that the cell becomes rigid and, therefore, more susceptible to damage by shear forces in the circulation. Once they are damaged, the RBCs are removed from circulation, leading to the anemia. However, the effects of the anemia are frequently moderated by the twofold to threefold elevation in 2,3-BPG concentration that results from the blockage of the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. Because 2,3-BPG binding to hemoglobin decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, the RBCs that remain in circulation are highly efficient in releasing their bound oxygen to the tissues.

| TABLE 42.3 Normal Hemoglobin Levels in Blood (g/dL) |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| Adult |  |
| Males | $13.5-17.5$ |
| Females | $11.5-15.5$ |
| Children |  |
| Newborns | $15.0-21.0$ |
| 3-12 mo | $9.5-12.5$ |
| 1 y to puberty | $11.0-13.5$ |

## B. Anemia

The major function of erythrocytes is to deliver oxygen to the tissues. To do this, a sufficient concentration of hemoglobin in the RBCs is necessary for efficient oxygen delivery to occur. When the hemoglobin concentration falls below normal values (Table 42.2), the patient is classified as anemic. Anemias can be categorized based on red cell size and hemoglobin concentration. Red cells can be of normal size (normocytic), small (microcytic), or large (macrocytic). Cells containing a normal hemoglobin concentration are termed normochromic; those with decreased concentration are hypochromic. This classification system provides important diagnostic tools (Table 42.3) that enable one to properly classify, diagnose, and treat the anemia.

Other measurements used to classify the type of anemia present include the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The MCV is the average volume of the RBC, expressed in femtoliters $\left(10^{-15} \mathrm{~L}\right)$. Normal MCV values range from 80 to 100 fL . The MCHC is the average concentration of hemoglobin in each individual erythrocyte, expressed in grams per liter. The normal range is 32 to $37 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$; a value of $<32 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ indicates hypochromic cells. Thus, microcytic, hypochromic RBCs have an MCV of $<80 \mathrm{fL}$ and an MCHC of $<32 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$. Macrocytic, normochromic cells have an MCV of $>100 \mathrm{fL}$, with an MCHC between 32 and $37 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$.

## II. Erythrocyte Metabolism

## A. The Mature Erythrocyte

To understand how the erythrocyte can carry out its major function, a discussion of erythrocyte metabolism is required. Mature erythrocytes contain no intracellular organelles, so the metabolic enzymes of the RBC are limited to those found in the cytoplasm. In addition to hemoglobin, the cytosol of the RBC contains enzymes

| TABLE 42.3 Classification of the Anemias on the Basis of Red Cell Morphology |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| RED CELL <br> MORPHOLOGY | FUNCTIONAL DEFICIT | POSSIBLE CAUSES |
| Microcytic, hypochromic | Impaired hemoglobin synthesis | Iron deficiency, mutation leading to thalassemia, lead poisoning |
| Macrocytic, normochromic | Impaired DNA synthesis | Vitamin $B_{12}$ or folic acid deficiency, erythroleukemia |
| Normocytic, normochromic | Red cell loss | Acute bleeding, sickle cell disease, red cell metabolic defects, red cell membrane defects |

necessary for the prevention and repair of damage done by reactive oxygen species (ROS; see Chapter 25) and the generation of energy (Fig. 42.1). Erythrocytes can only generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by glycolysis (see Chapter 22). The ATP is used for ion transport across the cell membrane (primarily $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ), the phosphorylation of membrane proteins, and the priming reactions of glycolysis. Erythrocyte glycolysis also uses the Rapoport-Luebering shunt to generate 2,3-BPG. Red cells contain 4 to $5 \mathrm{mM} 2,3-\mathrm{BPG}$, compared with trace amounts in other cells. The trace amounts of 2,3-BPG found in cells other than erythrocytes is required for the phosphoglycerate mutase reaction of glycolysis, in which 3-phosphoglycerate is isomerized to 2-phosphoglycerate. Because the 2,3-BPG is regenerated during each reaction cycle, it is required in only catalytic amounts. As has been discussed in more detail in Chapter 7, 2,3-BPG is a modulator of oxygen binding to hemoglobin that stabilizes the deoxy form of hemoglobin, thereby facilitating the release of oxygen to the tissues.
![ma15039756a7](ma15039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 42.I Overview of erythrocyte metabolism. Glycolysis is the major pathway, with branches for the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt (for protection against oxidizing agents) and the Rapoport-Luebering shunt (which generates 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate [2,3-BPG], which moderates oxygen binding to hemoglobin). The reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) generated from glycolysis can be used to reduce methemoglobin $\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right)$ to normal hemoglobin $\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right)$, or to convert pyruvate to lactate, so that $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$can be regenerated and used for glycolysis. Pathways that are unique to the erythrocyte are indicated in red. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Fructose 1,6-BP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; Fructose 6-P, fructose 6-phosphate; Glucose 6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; Glyceraldehyde 3-P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; $P_{\mathrm{i}}$, inorganic phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.

Congenital methemoglobinemia, the presence of excess methemoglobin, is found in people with an enzymatic deficiency in cytochrome $b_{5}$ reductase or in people who have inherited hemoglobin M. In hemoglobin M, a single amino acid substitution in the heme-binding pocket stabilizes the ferric $\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right)$ oxygen. Individuals with congenital methemoglobinemia appear cyanotic but have few clinical problems. Methemoglobinemia can be acquired by ingestion of certain oxidants such as nitrites, quinones, aniline, and sulfonamides. Acquired methemoglobinemia can be treated by the administration of reducing agents, such as ascorbic acid or methylene blue.

Glucose 6-PD deficiency is the most common enzyme deficiency in humans, probably, in part, because individuals with glucose 6-PD deficiency have resistance to malaria. The resistance to malaria counterbalances the deleterious effects of the deficiency. Glucose 6-PD-deficient red cells have a shorter life span and are more likely to lyse under conditions of oxidative stress. When soldiers during the Korean War were given the antimalarial drug primaquine prophylactically, approximately $10 \%$ of the soldiers of African ancestry developed spontaneous anemia. Because the gene for glucose 6-PD is found on the $X$ chromosome, these men had only one copy of a variant G6PD gene.

All known G6PD variant genes contain small in-frame deletions or missense mutations. The corresponding proteins, therefore, have decreased stability or lowered activity, leading to a reduced half-life or life span for the red cell. No mutations have been found that result in complete absence of glucose 6-PD. Based on studies with knockout mice, those mutations would be expected to result in embryonic lethality.

To bind oxygen, the iron of hemoglobin must be in the ferrous ( +2 ) state. ROS can oxidize the iron to the ferric $(+3)$ state, producing methemoglobin. Some of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) produced by glycolysis is used to regenerate hemoglobin from methemoglobin by the NADH-cytochrome $b_{5}$-methemoglobin reductase system. Cytochrome $b_{5}$ reduces the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ of methemoglobin. The oxidized cytochrome $b_{5}$ is then reduced by a flavin-containing enzyme, cytochrome $b_{5}$ reductase (also called methemoglobin reductase), using NADH as the reducing agent.

Approximately $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the glucose metabolized by RBCs is used to generate NADPH by way of the hexose monophosphate shunt. The NADPH is used to maintain glutathione in the reduced state. The glutathione cycle is the RBC's chief defense against damage to proteins and lipids by ROS (see Chapter 25).

The enzyme that catalyzes the first step of the hexose monophosphate shunt is glucose 6-phosphate (glucose 6-P) dehydrogenase (glucose 6-PD). The lifetime of the RBC correlates with glucose 6-P activity. Lacking ribosomes, the RBC cannot synthesize new glucose 6-PD protein. Consequently, as the glucose 6-PD activity decreases, oxidative damage accumulates, leading to lysis of the erythrocyte. When RBC lysis (hemolysis) substantially exceeds the normal rate of RBC production, the number of erythrocytes in the blood drops below normal values, leading to hemolytic anemia.

## B. The Erythrocyte Precursor Cells and Heme Synthesis

## I. Heme Structure

Heme consists of a porphyrin ring coordinated with an atom of iron (Fig. 42.2). Four pyrrole rings are joined by methylene bridges $(=\mathrm{CH}-)$ to form the porphyrin ring (see Fig. 7.12). Eight side chains serve as substituents on the porphyrin ring, two on each pyrrole. These side chains may be acetate (A), propionate (P), methyl (M), or vinyl (V) groups. In heme, the order of these groups is M V M V M P P M. This order, in which the position of the methyl group is reversed on the fourth ring, is characteristic of the porphyrins of the type III series, the most abundant in nature.

Heme is the most common porphyrin found in the body. It is complexed with proteins to form hemoglobin, myoglobin, and the cytochromes (see Chapters 7 and 24), including cytochrome P450 (see Chapter 25).

## 2. Synthesis of Heme

Heme is synthesized from glycine and succinyl-CoA (Fig. 42.3), which condense in the initial reaction to form $\delta$-aminolevulinic acid ( $\delta$-ALA) (Fig. 42.4). The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction, $\delta$-ALA synthase, requires the participation of pyridoxal
![ma16039756a7](ma16039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 42.2 Structure of heme. The side chains can be abbreviated as MVMVMPPM: M, methyl $\left(-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right) ; \mathrm{P}$, propionate $\left(-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{COO}^{-}\right) ; \mathrm{V}$, vinyl $\left(-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}\right)$.

![ma17039756a7](ma17039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 42.3 Synthesis of heme. To produce one molecule of heme, eight molecules each of glycine and succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) are required. A series of porphyrinogens is generated in sequence. Finally, iron is added to produce heme. Heme regulates its own production by repressing the synthesis of $\delta$-aminolevulinic acid ( $\delta$-ALA) synthase ( $\boldsymbol{\Delta}$ ) and by directly inhibiting the activity of this enzyme $\Theta$. Deficiencies of enzymes in the pathway result in a series of diseases known as porphyrias (listed on the right, beside the deficient enzyme).
phosphate because the reaction is an amino acid decarboxylation reaction (glycine is decarboxylated; see Chapter 37).

The next reaction of heme synthesis is catalyzed by $\delta$-ALA dehydratase, in which two molecules of $\delta$-ALA condense to form the pyrrole, porphobilinogen (Fig. 42.5). Four of these pyrrole rings condense to form a linear chain and then a series of porphyrinogens. The side chains of these porphyrinogens initially contain acetate (A) and propionate (P) groups. The acetyl groups are decarboxylated to form methyl groups. Then, the first two propionyl side chains are decarboxylated and oxidized to vinyl groups, forming a protoporphyrinogen. The methylene bridges are subsequently oxidized to form protoporphyrin IX (see Fig. 42.3). Heme is red, and it is responsible for the color of RBCs and of muscles that contain a large number of mitochondria.

In the final step of the pathway, iron (as $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ) is incorporated into protoporphyrin IX in a reaction catalyzed by ferrochelatase (also known as heme synthase).

## 3. Source of Iron

Iron, which is obtained from the diet, has a US Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 10 mg for men and postmenopausal women and 15 mg for premenopausal women. The average daily US diet contains 10 to 50 mg of iron. However, only $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ is normally absorbed, and iron deficiencies are fairly common. The iron in meats is in the form of heme, which is readily absorbed. The nonheme iron

FIGURE 42.4 Synthesis of $\delta$-aminolevulinic acid ( $\delta$-ALA). The atoms in red in $\delta$-ALA are derived from glycine. CoA, coenzyme A; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; succinyl CoA, succinyl coenzyme A.

Pyridoxine (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ ) deficiencies are often associated with a microcytic, hypochromic anemia. Why would a vitamin $B_{6}$ deficiency result in small (microcytic), pale (hypochromic) RBCs?

$\Delta$ $\delta$-ALA dehydratase, which contains zinc, and ferrochelatase are inactivated by lead. Thus, in lead poisoning, $\delta$-ALA and protoporphyrin IX accumulate and the production of heme is decreased. Anemia results from a lack of hemoglobin, and energy production decreases because of the lack of cytochromes for the electron-transport chain.

In a vitamin $B_{6}$ deficiency, the rate of heme production is slow because the first reaction in heme synthesis requires pyridoxal phosphate (see Fig. 42.4). Thus, less heme is synthesized, causing RBCs to be small and pale. Iron stores are usually elevated.

Porphyrias are a group of rare inherited disorders resulting from deficiencies of enzymes in the pathway for heme biosynthesis (see Fig. 42.3). Intermediates of the pathway accumulate and may have toxic effects on the nervous system that cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. When porphyrinogens accumulate, they may be converted by light to porphyrins, which react with molecular oxygen to form oxygen radicals. These radicals may cause severe damage to the skin. Thus, individuals with excessive production of porphyrins are photosensitive. The scarring and increased growth of facial hair seen in some porphyrias may have contributed to the rise of the werewolf legends.

An inherited mutation in SLCl IA2 (the gene encoding DMT-1) leads to an iron deficiency anemia, as indicated by a refractory hypochromic microcytic anemia. The iron is trapped in endosomal vesicles and cannot be released to bind to ferritin or used in other necessary biosynthetic reactions. This leads to reduced heme synthesis, reduced globin synthesis, and anemia.
![ma19039756a7](ma19039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 42.5 Two molecules of $\delta$-aminolevulinic acid ( $\delta$-ALA) condense to form porphobilinogen.
in plants is not as readily absorbed, in part because plants often contain oxalates, phytates, tannins, and other phenolic compounds that chelate or form insoluble precipitates with iron, preventing its absorption. Conversely, vitamin C (ascorbic acid) increases the uptake of nonheme iron from the digestive tract. The uptake of iron is also increased in times of need by mechanisms that are not yet understood. Iron is absorbed in the ferrous $\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right)$ state (Fig. 42.6) but is oxidized to the ferric state by a ferroxidase known as ceruloplasmin (a copper-containing enzyme) for transport through the body.

Because free iron is toxic, it is usually found in the body bound to proteins (see Fig. 42.6). Iron is carried in the blood (as $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ) by the protein apotransferrin, with which it forms a complex known as transferrin. Transferrin is usually only one-third saturated with iron. The total iron-binding capacity of blood, owing mainly to its content of transferrin, is approximately $300 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$. Transferrin, with bound iron, binds to the transferrin receptor on the cell surface, and the complex is internalized into the cell. The internalized membrane develops into an endosome, with a slightly acidic pH . The iron is reduced by a membrane-bound oxidoreductase, and the ferrous iron is transported out of the endosome into the cytoplasm via the divalent metal ion transporter 1 (DMT-1). Once in the cytoplasm, the iron is shunted to necessary enzymes, or it can be oxidized and bind to ferritin for longterm storage.

Storage of iron occurs in most cells but especially those of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. In these cells, the storage protein apoferritin forms a complex with iron $\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right)$, known as ferritin. Normally, ferritin is present in the blood in small amounts. The level increases, however, as iron stores increase. Therefore, the amount of ferritin in the blood is the most sensitive indicator of the amount of iron in the body's stores.

Iron can be drawn from ferritin stores, transported in the blood as transferrin, and taken up via receptor-mediated endocytosis by cells that require iron (e.g., by

Feces
FIGURE 42.6 Iron metabolism. Iron is absorbed from the diet, transported in the blood by transferrin, stored in ferritin, and used for the synthesis of cytochromes, iron-containing enzymes, hemoglobin, and myoglobin. It is lost from the body with bleeding and sloughed-off cells, sweat, urine, and feces. Hemosiderin is the protein in which excess iron is stored. Small amounts of ferritin enter the blood and can be used to measure the adequacy of iron stores. RBC, red blood cells; $R E$, reticuloendothelial.
reticulocytes that are synthesizing hemoglobin). When excess iron is absorbed from the diet, it is stored as hemosiderin, a form of ferritin complexed with additional iron that cannot be readily mobilized.

## 4. Regulation of Heme Synthesis

Heme regulates its own synthesis by mechanisms that affect the first enzyme in the pathway, $\delta$-ALA synthase (see Fig. 42.3). Heme represses the synthesis of this enzyme and also directly inhibits the activity of the enzyme (an allosteric modifier). Thus, heme is synthesized when heme levels fall. As heme levels rise, the rate of heme synthesis decreases.

Heme also regulates the synthesis of hemoglobin by stimulating synthesis of the protein globin. Heme maintains the ribosomal initiation complex for globin synthesis in an active state (see Chapter 15).

## 5. Degradation of Heme

Heme is degraded to form bilirubin, which is conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in the bile (Fig. 42.7). Although heme from cytochromes and myoglobin also undergoes conversion to bilirubin, the major source of this bile pigment is hemoglobin. After RBCs reach the end of their life span ( $\sim 120$ days), they are phagocytosed by cells of the reticuloendothelial system. Globin is cleaved to its constituent amino acids, and iron is returned to the body's iron stores. Heme is oxidized and cleaved to produce carbon monoxide and biliverdin (Fig. 42.8). Biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin, which is transported to the liver complexed with serum albumin.

The iron lost by adult men ( $\sim 1 \mathrm{mg} /$ day) by desquamation of the skin and $n$ bile, feces, urine, and sweat is replaced by iron absorbed from the diet. Men are not as likely to suffer from iron deficiencies as premenopausal adult women, who also lose iron during menstruation and who must supply iron to meet the needs of a growing fetus during pregnancy. If a man eating a Western diet has iron deficiency anemia, his physician should suspect bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract as a result of ulcers or colon cancer.

Drugs, such as phenobarbital, induce enzymes of the drug-metabolizing systems of the endoplasmic reticulum that contain cytochrome P450. Because heme is used for synthesis of cytochrome P450, free heme levels fall and $\delta$-ALA synthase is induced to increase the rate of heme synthesis.

FIGURE 42.8 Conversion of heme to bilirubin. A methylene bridge in heme is cleaved, releasing carbon monoxide (CO) and iron. Then, the center methylene bridge is reduced. NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.

In the liver, bilirubin is converted to a more water-soluble compound by reacting with uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronate to form bilirubin monoglucuronide, which is converted to the diglucuronide (see Fig. 27.12). This conjugated form of bilirubin is excreted into the bile.

In the intestine, bacteria deconjugate bilirubin diglucuronide and convert the bilirubin to urobilinogens (see Fig. 42.7). Some urobilinogen is absorbed into the blood and excreted in the urine. However, most of the urobilinogen is oxidized to urobilins, such as stercobilin, and excreted in the feces. These pigments give feces their brown color.

## III. The Red Blood Cell Membrane

Under the microscope, the RBC appears to be a red disc with a pale central area (biconcave disc) (Fig. 42.9). The biconcave disc shape (as opposed to a spherical shape) serves to facilitate gas exchange across the cell membrane. The membrane proteins that maintain the shape of the RBC also allow the RBC to traverse the capillaries with very small luminal diameters to deliver oxygen to the tissues. The interior diameters of many capillaries are smaller than the approximately $7.5-\mu \mathrm{m}$ diameter of the red cell. Furthermore, in passing through the kidney, RBCs traverse hypertonic areas that are up to 6 times the normal isotonicity and back again, causing the red cell to shrink and expand during its travels. The spleen is the organ responsible for determining the viability of the RBCs. Erythrocytes pass through the spleen 120 times per day. The elliptical passageways through the spleen are approximately $3 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter, and normal red cells traverse them in approximately 30 seconds. Thus, to survive in the circulation, the red cell must be highly deformable. Damaged red cells that are no longer deformable become trapped in the passages in the spleen, where they are destroyed by macrophages. The reason for the erythrocyte's deformability lies in its shape and in the organization of the proteins that make up the RBC membrane.

The surface area of the red cell is approximately $140 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, which is greater than the surface of a sphere needed to enclose the contents of the red cell $\left(98 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)$. The presence of this extra membrane and the cytoskeleton that supports it allows the red cell to be stretched and deformed by mechanical stresses as the cell passes through narrow vascular beds. On the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, proteins form a two-dimensional lattice that gives the red cell its flexibility (Fig. 42.10). The major proteins are spectrin, actin, band 4.1, band 4.2, and ankyrin. Spectrin, the major protein, is a heterodimer composed of $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits wound around each other. The dimers self-associate at the heads. At the opposite end of the spectrin dimers, actin and band 4.1 bind near to each other. Multiple spectrins can bind to each actin filament, resulting in a branched membrane cytoskeleton.

The spectrin cytoskeleton is connected to the membrane lipid bilayer by ankyrin, which interacts with $\beta$-spectrin and the integral membrane protein band 3. Band 4.2 helps to stabilize this connection. Band 4.1 anchors the spectrin skeleton with the membrane by binding the integral membrane protein glycophorin C and the actin complex, which has bound multiple spectrin dimers.

When the RBC is subjected to mechanical stress, the spectrin network rearranges. Some spectrin molecules become uncoiled and extended; others become compressed, thereby changing the shape of the cell but not its surface area.

The mature erythrocyte cannot synthesize new membrane proteins or lipids. However, membrane lipids can be freely exchanged with circulating lipoprotein lipids. The glutathione system protects the proteins and lipids from oxidative damage.

The unusual names for some erythrocyte membrane proteins, such as band 4.1, arose through analysis of RBC membranes by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The stained bands observed in the gel were numbered according to molecular weight

In an iron deficiency, what characteristics will be evident in the blood?

![ma25039756a7](ma25039756a7.jpg)

Defects in erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins lead to hemolytic anemia. Shear stresses in the circulation result in the loss of pieces of the red cell membrane. As the membrane is lost, the RBC becomes more spherical and loses its deformability. As these cells become more spherical, they are more likely to lyse in response to mechanical stresses in the circulation or to be trapped and destroyed in the spleen.

Iron deficiency will result in a microcytic, hypochromic anemia. RBCs will be small and pale. In contrast to a vitamin $B_{6}$ deficiency, which also results in a microcytic, hypochromic anemia, iron stores are low in an iron deficiency anemia.

(e.g., band 1, band 2), and as functions were assigned to the proteins, more common names were assigned to the proteins (e.g., spectrin is actually band 1).

## IV. Hematopoiesis

The various types of cells (lineages) that make up the blood are constantly being produced in the bone marrow. All cell lineages are descended from hematopoietic stem cells-cells that are renewable throughout the life of the host. The population of hematopoietic stem cells is quite small. Estimates vary between 1 and 10 per $10^{5}$ bone marrow cells. In the presence of the appropriate signals, hematopoietic stem cells proliferate, differentiate, and mature into any of the types of cells that make up the blood (Fig. 42.11).

Hematopoietic differentiation is hierarchical. The number of fates a developing blood cell may adopt becomes progressively restricted. Hematopoietic progenitors are designated colony-forming unit-lineage, or colony-forming uniterythroid (CFU-E). Progenitors that form very large colonies are termed burstforming units.

## A. Cytokines and Hematopoiesis

Developing progenitor cells in the marrow grow in proximity with marrow stromal cells. These include fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes, and macrophages. The

![ma27039756a7](ma27039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 42.II The hematopoietic tree. All blood cells arise from the self-renewing pluripotent stem cell. Different cytokines are required at each step for these events to occur. $B F U$, burst-forming unit; $C F U$, colony-forming unit.
stromal cells form an extracellular matrix and secrete growth factors that regulate hematopoietic development.

The hematopoietic growth factors have multiple effects. An individual growth factor may stimulate proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of the progenitor cells and also may prevent apoptosis. These factors also may activate various functions within the mature cell. Some hematopoietic growth factors act on multiple lineages, whereas others have more limited targets.

Most hematopoietic growth factors are recognized by receptors belonging to the cytokine receptor superfamily. Binding of ligand to receptor results in

Leukemias, malignancies of the blood, arise when a differentiating hematopoietic cell does not complete its developmental program but remains in an immature, proliferative state. Leukemias have been found in every hematopoietic lineage.

In X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID), the most common form of SCID, circulating mature T-lymphocytes are not formed, and therefore, B-lymphocytes are not active. The affected gene encodes the $\gamma$-chain of the interleukin 2 receptor. Mutant receptors are unable to activate JAK3, and the cells are unresponsive to the cytokines that stimulate growth and differentiation. Recall also that adenosine deaminase deficiency (see Chapter 39), which is not X-linked, also leads to a form of SCID but for different reasons.

Families have been identified whose members have a mutant erythropoietin (Epo) receptor that is unable to bind SHP-1. Erythropoietin is the hematopoietic cytokine that stimulates production of RBCs. Individuals with the mutant Epo receptor have a higher-than-normal percentage of RBCs in the circulation because the mutant Epo receptor cannot be deactivated by SHP-1. Erythropoietin causes sustained activation of JAK2 and STAT 5 in these cases.
receptor aggregation, which induces phosphorylation of janus kinases (JAKs). The JAKs are a family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that are active when phosphorylated (see Chapter 11, Section III.C and Fig. 11.15). The activated JAKs then phosphorylate the cytokine receptor. Phosphorylation of the receptor creates docking regions where additional signal transduction molecules bind, including members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. The JAKs phosphorylate the STATs, which dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they activate target genes. Additional signal transduction proteins bind to the phosphorylated cytokine receptor, leading to activation of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways. Other pathways are also activated, some of which lead to an inhibition of apoptosis (see Chapter 18).

The response to cytokine binding is usually transient because the cell contains multiple negative regulators of cytokine signaling. The family of silencer of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins is induced by cytokine binding. One member of the family binds to the phosphorylated receptor and prevents the docking of signal transduction proteins. Other SOCS proteins bind to JAKs and inhibit them. Whether SOCS inhibition of JAKs is a consequence of steric inhibition or whether SOCS proteins recruit phosphatases that then dephosphorylate the JAKs (Fig. 42.12) is uncertain.

SHP-1 is a tyrosine phosphatase found primarily in hematopoietic cells that is necessary for proper development of myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Its function is to dephosphorylate JAK2, thereby inactivating it.

STATs are also inactivated. The protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS) family of proteins bind to phosphorylated STATs and prevent their dimerization or promote the dissociation of STAT dimers. STATs also may be inactivated by dephosphorylation, although the specific phosphatases have not yet been identified, or by targeting activated STATs for proteolytic degradation.

# B. Erythropoiesis 

The production of red cells is regulated by the demands of oxygen delivery to the tissues. In response to reduced tissue oxygenation, the kidney releases the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates the multiplication and maturation of erythroid

progenitors. The progression along the erythroid pathway begins with the stem cell and passes through the mixed myeloid progenitor cell (colony-forming unitgranulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, megakaryocyte [CFU-GEMM]), burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), CFU-E, and to the first recognizable red cell precursor, the normoblast. Each normoblast undergoes four more cycles of cell division. During these four cycles, the nucleus becomes smaller and more condensed. After the last division, the nucleus is extruded. The red cell at this state is called a reticulocyte. Reticulocytes still retain ribosomes and messenger RNA (mRNA) and are capable of synthesizing hemoglobin. They are released from the bone marrow and circulate for 1 to 2 days. Reticulocytes mature in the spleen, where the ribosomes and mRNA are lost (Fig. 42.13).

## C. Nutritional Anemias

Each person produces approximately $10^{12} \mathrm{RBCs}$ per day. Because so many cells must be produced, nutritional deficiencies in iron, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, and folate prevent adequate RBC formation. The physical appearance of the cells in the case of a nutritional anemia frequently provides a clue as to the nature of the deficiency.

In the case of iron deficiency, the cells are smaller and paler than normal. The lack of iron results in decreased heme synthesis, which in turn affects globin synthesis. Maturing red cells following their normal developmental program divide until their hemoglobin has reached the appropriate concentration. Iron- (and hemoglobin)-deficient developing RBCs continue dividing past their normal stopping point, resulting in small (microcytic) red cells. The cells are also pale because of the lack of hemoglobin, compared with normal cells (thus, a pale microcytic anemia results).

Deficiencies of folate or vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ can cause megaloblastic anemia, in which the cells are larger than normal. Folate and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ are required for DNA synthesis (see Chapters 38 and 39). When these vitamins are deficient, DNA replication and nuclear division do not keep pace with the maturation of the cytoplasm. Consequently, the nucleus is extruded before the requisite number of cell divisions has taken place, and the cell volume is greater than it should be, and fewer blood cells are produced.

Perturbed JAV/STAT signaling is associated with development of lymphoid and myeloid leukemias, severe congenital neutropenia (a condition in which levels of circulating neutrophils are severely reduced), and Fanconi anemia, which is characterized by bone marrow failure and increased susceptibility to malignancy.

0A complication of sickle cell disease is an increased formation of gallstones. A sickle cell crisis accompanied by the intravascular destruction of RBCs (hemolysis) experienced by patients with sickle cell disease, such as Will S., increases the amount of unconjugated bilirubin that is transported to the liver. If the concentration of this unconjugated bilirubin exceeds the capacity of the hepatocytes to conjugate it to the more soluble diglucuronide through interaction with hepatic UDP-glucuronate, both the total and the unconjugated bilirubin levels in the blood increase. More unconjugated bilirubin is then secreted by the liver into the bile. The increase in unconjugated bilirubin (which is not very water-soluble) results in its precipitation within the gallbladder lumen, leading to the formation of pigmented (calcium bilirubinate) gallstones.

![ma30039756a7](ma30039756a7.jpg)

HbC is found in high frequency in West Africa, in regions with a high frequency of HbS . Consequently, compound heterozygotes for HbS and HbC are not uncommon both in some African regions and among African Americans. HbS/HbC individuals have significantly more hematopathology than individuals with sickle cell trait (HbA/HbS). Polymerization of deoxygenated HbS is dependent on the HbS concentration within the cell. The presence of HbC in the compound heterozygote increases the HbS concentration by stimulating $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and water efflux from the cell. Because the HbC globin tends to precipitate, the proportion of HbS tends to be higher in HbS/HbC cells than in the cells of individuals with sickle cell trait ( $\mathrm{HbS} / \mathrm{HbA}$ ). The way in which multiple mutations ameliorate or exacerbate hematologic diseases has provided insights into the molecular mechanisms of hemoglobin function and developmental regulation.

There are two ways in which an individual might have two $\alpha$-globin genes deleted. In one case, one copy of chromosome 16 might have both $\alpha$-globin genes deleted, whereas the other copy had two functional $\alpha$-globin genes. In the second case, both chromosomes might have lost one of their two copies of the $\alpha$-globin gene. The former possibility is more common among Asians, the latter among Africans.

## V. Hemoglobinopathies, Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin, and Hemoglobin Switching

## A. Hemoglobinopathies: Disorders in the Structure or Amount of the Globin Chains

More than 700 different mutant hemoglobins have been discovered. Most arise from a single base substitution, resulting in a single amino acid replacement. Many have been discovered during population screenings and are not clinically significant. However, in patients with hemoglobin S (HbS; sickle cell anemia), the most common hemoglobin mutation, the amino acid substitution has a devastating effect in the homozygote (see Will S. in Chapter 6). Another common hemoglobin variant, HbC , results from a Glu-to-Lys replacement in the same position as the HbS mutation. This mutation has two effects. It promotes water loss from the cell by activating the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$transporter by an unknown mechanism, resulting in a higher-than-normal concentration of hemoglobin within the cell. The amino acid replacement also substantially lowers the hemoglobin solubility in the homozygote, resulting in a tendency of the mutant hemoglobin to precipitate within the red cell, although, unlike sickle cells, the cell does not become deformed. Homozygotes for the HbC mutation have a mild hemolytic anemia. Heterozygous individuals are clinically unaffected.

## B. Thalassemias

For optimal function, the hemoglobin $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-globin chains must have the proper structure and be synthesized in a $1: 1$ ratio. A large excess of one subunit over the other results in the class of diseases called thalassemias. These anemias are clinically very heterogeneous because they can arise by multiple mechanisms. Like sickle cell anemia, the thalassemia mutations provide resistance to malaria in the heterozygous state.

Hemoglobin single amino acid replacement mutations that give rise to a globin subunit of decreased stability is one mechanism by which thalassemia arises. More common, however, are mutations that result in decreased synthesis of one subunit. The $\alpha$-thalassemias usually arise from complete gene deletions. Two copies of the $\alpha$-globin gene are found on each chromosome 16, for a total of four $\alpha$-globin genes per precursor cell. If one copy of the gene is deleted, the size and hemoglobin concentration of the individual RBCs is minimally reduced. If two copies are deleted, the RBCs are of decreased size (microcytic) and reduced hemoglobin concentration (hypochromic). However, the individual usually does not have an anemia. The loss of three $\alpha$-globin genes causes a moderately severe microcytic hypochromic anemia (hemoglobin, 7 to $10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) with splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). The absence of four $\alpha$-globin genes (hydrops fetalis) is usually fatal in utero.

As discussed in Chapter 14, $\beta$-thalassemia is a very heterogeneous genetic disease. Insufficient $\beta$-globin synthesis can result from deletions, promoter mutations, and splice-junction mutations. Heterozygotes for $\beta^{+}$(some globin chain synthesis) or $\beta$-null ( $\beta^{0}$, no globin chain synthesis) are generally asymptomatic, although they typically have microcytic, hypochromic RBCs and may have mild anemia. $\beta^{+} / \beta^{+}$ homozygotes have anemia of variable severity, $\beta^{+} / \beta^{0}$ compound heterozygotes tend to be more severely affected, and $\beta^{0} / \beta^{0}$ homozygotes have severe disease. In general, diseases of $\beta$-chain deficiency are more severe than diseases of $\alpha$-chain deficiency. Excess $\beta$-chains form a homotetramer, hemoglobin $\mathrm{H}(\mathrm{HbH})$, which is ineffective for delivering oxygen to the tissues because of its high oxygen affinity. As RBCs age, HbH precipitates in the cells, forming inclusion bodies. RBCs with inclusion bodies have shortened life spans because they are more likely to be trapped and destroyed in the spleen. Excess $\alpha$-chains are unable to form a stable tetramer. However, excess $\alpha$-chains precipitate in erythrocytes at every developmental stage. The $\alpha$-chain precipitation in erythroid precursors results in their widespread destruction,

a process called ineffective erythropoiesis. The precipitated $\alpha$-chains also damage RBC membranes through the heme-facilitated lipid oxidation by ROS. Both lipids and proteins, particularly band 4.1, are damaged.

## C. Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin

Fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ), the predominant hemoglobin of the fetal period, consists of two $\alpha$-chains and two $\gamma$-chains, whereas adult Hb consists of two $\alpha$-chains and two $\beta$-chains. The process that regulates the conversion of HbF to HbA is called hemoglobin switching. Hemoglobin switching is not $100 \%$; most individuals continue to produce a small amount of HbF throughout life. However, some people, who are clinically normal, produce abnormally high levels (up to 100\%) of HbF in place of HbA . Patients with hemoglobinopathies such as $\beta$-thalassemia or sickle cell anemia frequently have less severe illnesses if their levels of HbF are elevated. One goal of much research on hemoglobin switching is to discover a way to reactivate transcription of the $\gamma$-globin genes to compensate for defective $\beta$-globin synthesis. Individuals who express HbF past birth have hereditary persistence of $\mathrm{HbF}(\mathrm{HPFH})$.

## I. Nondeletion Forms of HPFH

The nondeletion forms of HPFH are those that derive from point mutations in the $\mathrm{A} \gamma$ and $\mathrm{G} \gamma$ promoters. When these mutations are found with sickle cell or $\beta$-thalassemia mutations, they have an ameliorating effect on the disease because of the increased production of $\gamma$-chains.

## 2. Deletion Forms of HPFH

In deletion HPFH, both the entire $\delta$ - and $\beta$-genes have been deleted from one copy of chromosome 11, and only HbF can be produced. In some individuals, the fetal globins remain activated after birth, and enough HbF is produced that the individual is clinically normal. Other individuals with similar deletions that remove the entire $\delta$ - and $\beta$-genes do not produce enough HbF to compensate for the deletion and are considered to have $\delta^{0} \beta^{0}$-thalassemia. The difference between these two outcomes is believed to be the site at which the deletions end within the $\beta$-globin gene cluster. In deletion HPFH, powerful enhancer sequences $3^{\prime}$ of the $\beta$-globin gene are resituated because of the deletion so that they activate the $\gamma$-promoters. In individuals with $\delta^{0} \beta^{0}$-thalassemia, the enhancer sequences have not been relocated so that they can interact with the $\gamma$-promoters.

## D. Hemoglobin Switching: A Developmental Process Controlled by Transcription Factors

In humans, embryonic megaloblasts (the embryonic RBC is large and is termed a blast because it retains its nucleus) are first produced in the yolk sac approximately 15 days after fertilization. After 6 weeks, the site of erythropoiesis shifts to the liver. The liver, and to a lesser extent the spleen, are the major sites of fetal erythropoiesis. In the last few weeks before birth, the bone marrow begins producing RBCs. By 8 to 10 weeks after birth, the bone marrow is the sole site of erythrocyte production. The composition of the hemoglobin also changes with development because both the $\alpha$-globin locus and the $\beta$-globin locus have multiple genes that are differentially expressed during development (Fig. 42.14).

## E. Structure and Transcriptional Regulation of the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-Globin Gene Loci

The $\alpha$-globin locus on chromosome 16 contains the embryonic $\zeta$ (zeta) gene and two copies of the $\alpha$-gene, $\alpha_{2}$ and $\alpha_{1}$. The $\beta$-globin locus on chromosome 11 contains the embryonic $\varepsilon$-gene; two copies of the fetal $\beta$-globin gene, $\mathrm{G} \gamma$ and $\mathrm{A} \gamma$ (which differ by one amino acid); and two adult genes, $\delta$ and $\beta$. The order of the genes along

$\otimes$The difference in amino acid composition between the $\beta$-chains of HbA and the $\gamma$-chains of HbF results in structural changes that cause HbF to have a lower affinity for 2,3-BPG than HbA and thus a greater affinity for oxygen. Therefore, the oxygen released from the mother's hemoglobin ( HbA ) is readily bound by HbF in the fetus. Thus, the transfer of oxygen from the mother to the fetus is facilitated by the structural difference between the hemoglobin molecule of the mother and that of the fetus.

the chromosome parallels the order of expression of the genes during development (see Fig. 42.14). The embryonic hemoglobins are $\zeta_{2} \varepsilon_{2}$ (Gower 1), $\zeta_{2} \gamma_{2}$ (Portland), and $\alpha_{2} \gamma_{2}$ (Gower 2). HbF is predominantly $\alpha_{2} \mathrm{G} \gamma_{2}$. The major adult species is $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}$ (hemoglobin A); the minor adult species is $\alpha_{2} \delta_{2}$ (hemoglobin $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ ). The HbF found in adult cells is $\alpha_{2} \mathrm{~A} \gamma_{2}$. The timing of hemoglobin switching is controlled by a developmental clock that is not significantly altered by environmental conditions and is related to changes in expression of specific transcription factors. Premature newborns convert from HbF to HbA on schedule with their gestational ages.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

Edward R. Edward R.'s RBCs are deficient in spectrin. This deficiency impairs the ability of his erythrocytes to maintain the redundant surface area necessary to maintain deformability. Mechanical stresses in the circulation cause progressive loss of pieces of membrane. As membrane components are lost, Edward R.'s RBCs become spherical and unable to deform. His spleen is enlarged because of the large number of RBCs that have become trapped within it. His erythrocytes are lysed by mechanical stresses in the circulation and

by macrophages in the spleen. Consequently, this hemolytic process results in anemia. His gallstones were the result of the large amounts of bilirubin that were produced and stored in the gallbladder as a result of the hemolysis. The abnormally rounded red cells seen on a blood smear are characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis.

Mutations in the genes for ankyrin, $\beta$-spectrin, or band 3 account for threequarters of the cases of hereditary spherocytosis, whereas mutations in the genes for $\alpha$-spectrin or band 4.2 account for the remainder. The defective synthesis of any of the membrane cytoskeletal proteins results in improper formation of the membrane cytoskeleton. Excess membrane proteins are catabolized, resulting in a net deficiency of spectrin. Edward R. underwent a splenectomy. Because the spleen was the major site of destruction of his RBCs, his anemia improved significantly after surgery. He was discharged with the recommendation to take a folate supplement daily. It was explained to Mr. R. that because the spleen plays a major role in protection against certain bacterial agents, he would require immunizations against pneumococcus, meningococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b.

Lisa N. Lisa N. was found to be a compound heterozygote for mutations in the $\beta$-globin gene. On one gene, a mutation in position 6 of intron 1 converted a T to a C . The presence of this mutation, for unknown reasons, raises HbF production. The other $\beta$-globin gene had a mutation in position 110 of exon 1 (a C-to-T mutation). Both $\beta$-globin chains have reduced activity, but combined with the increased expression of HbF , the result is a $\beta^{+}$thalassemia.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Control of Hemoglobin Switching. How is hemoglobin switching controlled? Although there are still many unanswered questions, some of the molecular mechanisms have been identified. The $\alpha$-globin locus covers approximately 100 kb (kilobases). The major regulatory element, HS40, is a nuclease-sensitive region of DNA that lies $5^{\prime}$ of the $\zeta$-gene (see Fig. 42.14). HS40 acts as an erythroid-specific enhancer that interacts with the upstream regulatory regions of the $\zeta$ - and $\alpha$-genes and stimulates their transcription. The region immediately $5^{\prime}$ of the $\zeta$-gene contains the regulatory sequences responsible for silencing $\zeta$-gene transcription. However, the exact sequences and transcription factors responsible for this silencing have not yet been identified. Even after silencing, low levels of $\zeta$-gene transcripts are still produced after the embryonic period; however, they are not translated. This is because both the $\zeta$-globin and $\alpha$-globin transcripts have regions that bind to a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) stability-determining complex. Binding to this complex prevents the mRNA from being degraded. The $\alpha$-globin mRNA has a much higher affinity for the mRNP than the $\zeta$-globin message, which leads to the $\zeta$-globin message being rapidly degraded.

The $\beta$-globin locus covers approximately 100 kb . From 5 to 25 kb upstream of the $\varepsilon$-gene is the locus control region (LCR), containing five DNase hypersensitive sites. The LCR is necessary for the function of the $\beta$-globin locus. It maintains the chromatin of the entire locus in an active configuration and acts as an enhancer and entry point for the factors that transcribe the genes of the $\beta$-globin locus. One model of the control of hemoglobin switching postulates that proteins bound at the promoters of the $\varepsilon-, \gamma$-, and $\beta$-globin genes compete to interact with the enhancers of the LCR.

Each gene in the $\beta$-globin locus has individual regulatory elements-a promoter, silencers, or enhancers that control its developmental regulation. The promoters

that control the $\gamma$ - and $\beta$-globin genes have been intensively studied because of their clinical relevance.

The $\varepsilon$-globin gene, like the $\zeta$-globin gene, has silencers in the $5^{\prime}$-regulatory region. Binding of proteins to these regions turns off the $\varepsilon$-gene.

The proximal region of the $\gamma$-globin gene promoter has multiple transcription factor-binding sites (Fig. 42.15). Many HPFH mutations map to these transcription factor-binding sites, either by destroying a site or by creating a new one, but the exact mechanisms are still not understood. Two sites (out of many) that appear to be significant in the control of hemoglobin switching are the stage-selector proteinbinding (SSP) site and the CAAT box region. When the SSP complex (consisting of the transcription factors CP2 and NFE4) is bound to the promoter, the $\gamma$-globin gene has a competitive advantage over the $\beta$-globin promoter for interaction with the LCR. A second transcription factor, Sp1, also binds at the SSP-binding site, where it may act as a repressor, and competition between these two protein complexes for the SSP-binding site helps to determine the activity of the $\gamma$-globin gene. A similar mechanism appears to be operating at the CAAT box. CP1, thought to be a transcription activator, binds at the CAAT box. CAAT displacement protein (CDP) is a repressor that binds at the CAAT site and displaces CP1. Part of the mechanism of hemoglobin switching appears to be the binding of repressors at the $\varepsilon$-globin and $\gamma$-globin upstream regulatory regions.

The $\beta$-globin gene also has binding sites for multiple transcription factors in its regulatory regions. Mutations that affect binding of transcription factors can produce thalassemia by reducing the activity of the $\beta$-globin promoter. There is also

an enhancer $3^{\prime}$ of the poly $(\mathrm{A})$ signal that seems to be required for stage-specific activation of the $\beta$-globin promoter.

Further insights into the control of hemoglobin switching indicate that the transcription factor BCL11A is a strong repressor of $\gamma$-globin gene expression. BCL11A interacts with a variety of other transcription factors (GATA-1, FOG1, and the NURD [nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase] repressor complex) to repress $\gamma$-globin expression. This appears to be caused by BCL11A interfering with LCR interactions with the $\gamma$-globin gene promoter. Experiments that reduce, or eliminate, BCL11A expression lead to an increase in $\gamma$-globin synthesis. BCL11A expression is regulated by the transcription factor KLF1, which is essential for $\beta$-globin expression. KLF1 increases BCL11A expression, which blocks $\gamma$-globin gene expression, whereas KLF1 stimulates $\beta$-globin gene expression. These recent results suggest that drugs which interfere with KLF1 action would enhance and activate fetal globin gene expression in individuals with either $\beta$-thalassemia or sickle cell disease (see Fig. 42.15B).

The blood contains a wide variety of distinct cell types, each of whose function is necessary for maintaining the body's internal environment.
Erythrocytes transport oxygen throughout the body and return carbon dioxide back to the lung.

Erythrocytes lack nuclei and carry out limited metabolic reactions. Glycolysis provides energy and NADH.
The NADH maintains the iron in hemoglobin in the ferrous state.
The hexose monophosphate shunt provides NADPH to regenerate reduced glutathione to protect the membrane from oxidative damage.
1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) is converted to 2,3-BPGa a a by-product of glycolysis in order to regulate oxygen binding to hemoglobin.
Heme synthesis occurs in the erythrocyte precursor, using succinyl-CoA and glycine. Inherited defects in heme synthesis lead to porphyrias.
Iron, a critical part of heme, is carried throughout the body on protein carriers, because free iron is toxic.
The erythrocyte membrane is flexible as a result of its unique cytoskeletal structure, which allows erythrocytes to deform in order to travel through narrow capillaries.
Hematopoiesis is the generation of the unique blood cell types from a single precursor stem cell in the bone marrow.
Polymorphonuclear leukocytes consist of a variety of cells types that release chemical signals when activated (granulocytes), phagocytose foreign bodies (neutrophils), destroy parasites (eosinophils), and are involved in the allergic response (basophils).
Mononuclear leukocytes include the lymphocytes (necessary for the immune response) and monocytes (which develop into macrophages, which engulf debris left behind after granulocytes attack foreign material).
A wide variety of mutations can lead to alterations in hemoglobin function (hemoglobinopathies):

Sickle cell anemia
Thalassemias
Hereditary persistence of HbF (hemoglobin switching and its regulation)
Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 42.4.

| Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin | Genetic | Mutations in promoter and enhancer regions, leading to misexpression of the globin $\gamma$-gene and constant expression of the gene |
| Spherocytosis | Genetic | Mutations in any of several RBC membrane proteins (such as spectrin), leading to instability of the red cells, destruction of the RBCs, and an anemia |

5. A family has two children, one with a mild case of thalassemia, and a second with a severe case of thalassemia that requires frequent blood transfusions as part of the treatment plan. One parent is of Mediterranean descent; the other is of Asian descent. Neither parent exhibits clinical signs of thalassemia. Both children express 20\% of the expected level of $\beta$-globin; the more severely affected child expresses normal levels of $\alpha$-globin, whereas the less severely affected child expresses only $50 \%$ of the normal levels of $\alpha$-globin. Why is the child who has a deficiency in $\alpha$-globin expression less severely affected?
A. Thalassemia is caused by a mutation in the $\alpha$-gene, and the more severely affected child expresses more of it.
B. The less severely affected child must be synthesizing the $\zeta$-gene to make up for the deficiency in $\alpha$-chain synthesis.
C. The more severely affected child also has HPFH.
D. The more severely affected child produces more inactive globin tetramers than the less severely affected child.
E. Thalassemia is caused by an iron deficiency, and when the child is synthesizing normal levels of $\alpha$-globin, there is insufficient iron to populate all of the heme molecules synthesized.
6. An individual displays an anemic condition and upon molecular analysis is shown to be a compound heterozygote for $\mathrm{HbS} / \mathrm{HbC}$. The symptoms exhibited by the patient are more severe than those exhibited by patients with sickle cell trait $(\mathrm{HbA} / \mathrm{HbS})$ owing primarily to which one of the following?
A. Increased concentration of HbC molecules in the patient's RBCs
B. Increased volume of the patient's RBCs
C. Increased concentration of HbS in the patient's RBCs
D. Alterations in the patient's RBC morphology
E. Precipitation of HbS molecules within the patient's RBCs
7. A young boy has been observed to have bluish fingertips and toes. Blood work indicates a mild anemia, and molecular analysis indicates the child has an inherited erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency. This enzyme mutation leads to an increase in the 2,3-BPG levels in the erythrocyte, which helps to ameliorate the effects of the mutation. The increase in 2,3-BPG levels occurs because of which one of the following?
A. The lack of pyruvate kinase leads to an increase in 1,3-BPG levels, which is used to form 2,3-BPG by the Rapoport-Luebering shunt pathway.
B. The increase in phosphoenolpyruvate levels leads to the phosphorylation of 3-phosphoglycerate, forming 2,3-BPG.
C. The increase in phosphoenolpyruvate levels leads to the phosphorylation of 2-phosphoglycerate, forming 2,3-BPG.
D. The increase in phosphoenolpyruvate levels leads to an increase in 3-phosphoglycerate, which is phosphorylated by ATP to produce 2,3-BPG.
E. The lack of pyruvate kinase activity leads to an increase of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is oxidized by an isozyme of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase to form 2,3-BPG.
8. A young boy was recently diagnosed with anemia, and further analysis demonstrated that he had hereditary spherocytosis. This disease leads to anemia through which one of the following mechanisms?
A. Lack of NADPH to protect cell membrane lipids and proteins from oxidation
B. Nutritional deficiency of iron, folate, or vitamin $B_{12}$
C. Inability to reduce ferric hemoglobin to the normal ferrous state
D. Improper formation of the RBC membrane cytoskeleton
E. A mutation in heme synthesis

B. Squeeze fresh lemon juice on spinach salad.
C. Reassure him that iron in plants is readily absorbed.
D. Meat is the only dietary source of iron.
E. Taking a vitamin with vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ would help iron absorption.
10. The pluripotent stem cell of the bone marrow produces all blood cells through different lineages via induction of different differentiation pathways. Which one of the following is produced from the same cell line as RBCs?
A. NK-cells
B. B-lymphocytes
C. T-lymphocytes
D. Basophils
E. Platelets

1. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. Increased 2,3-BPG in the red cell will favor the deoxy conformation of hemoglobin and thus allow more oxygen to be released in the tissues. This is useful because the hemoglobin is not as saturated at high altitudes as at low elevations because of the lower concentration of oxygen at high altitudes. Answers C and D are incorrect because the red cells do not synthesize proteins. Answer E is incorrect because reducing the blood pH will not aid in oxygen delivery; the Bohr effect works best when tissue pH is lower than blood pH in order to stabilize the deoxy form of hemoglobin. If the pH of both the blood and the tissue are the same, the Bohr effect will not be able to occur.
2. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. The boy is suffering from lead poisoning, which interrupts heme synthesis at the ALA dehydratase and ferrochelatase steps. Without heme, the oxygen-carrying capability of blood is reduced, and the flow of electrons through the electron-transfer chain is reduced because of the lack of functional cytochromes. Together, these lead to an inability to generate energy, and fatigue results. Answer A is incorrect because although an iron deficiency would lead to the same symptoms, this would not be expected in the patient because of his daily vitamin uptake. Lead ingestion will not lead to an iron loss. Answers B and C are incorrect because vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate deficiencies will lead to macrocytic anemia, owing to disruption of DNA synthesis. Answer E is incorrect because the ingestion of paint chips is unlikely to lead to a vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ deficiency in a child, particularly one who is taking daily vitamins.
3. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Turning on a gene that would provide a functional alternative to the $\beta$-gene would enable the defective $\beta$-protein to be bypassed. Only the $\gamma$-chain can do this, but it is normally only found in HbF . The $\delta$-chain is also a $\beta$-replacement globin, but it was not listed as a potential answer. Answer D is incorrect because it is the $\beta$-chain that is mutated, and it is already being expressed. Unlike the $\alpha$-gene, of which there are two copies per chromosome, there is only one copy of the $\beta$-gene per chromosome. The other genes listed (answers $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and E ) are $\alpha$-chain replacements, and expression of these genes will not alleviate the problem inherent in the $\beta$-gene.
4. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. The only two types of blood cells that lack nuclei are the mature RBC and the platelet. Platelets arise from membrane budding from megakaryocytes and are essentially membrane sacs containing the cytoplasmic contents of their precursor cell. All of the other cell types listed contain a nucleus.
5. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. Thalassemias result from an imbalance in the synthesis of $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains. Excessive synthesis of $\alpha$-chains results in their precipitation in developing red cells, which often kills the developing cell. The more severely affected child has an $\alpha / \beta$ ratio of $1: 5$, whereas the less severely affected child has a ratio of 1:2.5. When $\beta$-chains are in excess, they form stable tetramers that bind but do
not release oxygen, thus reducing the red cell's ability to deliver oxygen. Thus, this difference in chain ratio makes an important difference in the functioning of the red cell.
6. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. HbC forms an insoluble tetramer that precipitates in RBCs. Because of this, the concentration of HbS is increased in the RBCs, leading to enhanced sickling as compared to someone who has a mixture of HbS and HbA molecules. The enhanced sickling is not directly the result of the precipitation of the HbC molecules, nor is it a result of an increased volume of RBCs (an increased volume would reduce the concentration of HbS , which would reduce sickling). The HbS molecules will form rods under low-oxygen conditions, but they do not precipitate in the cell as do the HbC molecules. Alterations in RBC morphology are a result of the sickling, not a cause of the sickling.
7. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. When pyruvate kinase activity is reduced, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) will accumulate. PEP is in equilibrium with 2-phosphoglycerate, which is in equilibrium with 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG). As 3-PG accumulates, the phosphoglycerate kinase reaction will be inhibited, increasing the levels of 1,3-BPG. As 1,3-BPG levels accumulate, some of it will be shunted to produce 2,3-BPG via 1,3-BPG mutase. The increase in 2,3-BPG levels will then affect the release of oxygen to the tissues from hemoglobin. PEP is not used as a phosphate donor in phosphorylation reactions in the generation of higher levels of 2,3-BPG. ATP is used in the conversion of 3-PG to 1,3-BPG but not to form 2,3-BPG. The oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (glyceraldehyde 3-P) does not generate 2,3-BPG; there is no isozyme of glyceraldehyde 3-P dehydrogenase which will produce 2,3-BPG from glyceraldehyde 3-P.
8. The answer is D. Mutations in spectrin, ankyrin, and band 3 proteins lead to improper formation of the RBC membrane cytoskeleton, resulting in malformed RBCs (spherocytes) which have a shortened life span, thus leading to anemia. Mutations in heme synthesis lead to porphyrias. Lack of NAPDH (such as in glucose 6-P dehydrogenase deficiency) leads to anemia via cell membrane oxidation and lysis. Oxidation of the heme iron to the ferric state results in reduced oxygen binding to hemoglobin. Nutritional deficiencies of iron, folate, or vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ would lead to a megaloblastic anemia (folate and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiencies) or a microcytic anemia (iron deficiency).
9. The answer is B. Meats, green leafy vegetables, and fortified cereals and grains are all sources of dietary iron, whereas potatoes are not. Plant nonheme iron is not readily absorbed from the diet, but the presence of vitamin C (citrus fruits) increases the uptake of nonheme iron from the digestive tract. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is not involved in iron absorption.
10. The answer is $\mathbf{E}$. Both platelets and RBCs are derived from the BFU-EMeg lineage. Basophils are derived from the CFU-Ba lineage, B- and T-lymphocytes from the lymphoid stem cell lineage, and NK-cells from NKprecursor.

# Blood Plasma Proteins, Coagulation, and Fibrinolysis 

The blood is the body's main transport system. Although the transport and delivery of oxygen to the cells of the tissues is carried out by specialized cells, other vital components such as nutrients, metabolites, electrolytes, and hormones are all carried in the noncellular fraction of the blood, the plasma. Some components, such as glucose, are dissolved in the plasma; others-for example, lipids and steroid hormones-are bound to carrier proteins for transport. The osmotic pressure exerted by the plasma proteins regulates the distribution of water between the blood and the tissues. Plasma proteins in conjunction with platelets maintain the integrity of the circulatory system through the process of clotting.

Blood normally circulates through endothelium-lined blood vessels. When a blood vessel is severed, a blood clot (called a thrombus, which is formed by the process of thrombosis) forms as part of hemostasis, the physiologic response that stops bleeding. Blood clots also form to repair damage to the endothelial lining, in which components of the subendothelial layer become accessible to plasma proteins.

In hemostasis and thrombosis, a primary hemostatic plug, consisting of aggregated platelets and a fibrin clot, forms at the site of injury. Platelets are attached to the subendothelial layer of the vessel principally through the protein von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) and are activated to bind fibrinogen. Fibrinogen binds the platelets to each other to form a platelet aggregate. The platelet aggregate is rapidly covered with layers of fibrin, which are formed from fibrinogen by the proteolytic enzyme thrombin.

Injury to the endothelium and exposure of tissue factor on the subendothelial layer to plasma proteins also activate the blood coagulation cascade, which ultimately activates thrombin and factor XIII. Factor XIII cross-links strands of polymerized fibrin monomers to form a stable clot (the secondary hemostatic plug). The blood coagulation cascade consists of a series of enzymes (such as factor $\mathbf{X}$ ), which are inactive until they are proteolytically cleaved by the preceding enzyme in the cascade. Other proteins (factor $\mathbf{V}$ and factor VIII) serve as binding proteins, which assemble factor complexes at the site of injury. $\mathbf{C a}^{2+}$ and $\gamma$-carboxyglutamate residues in the proteins (formed by a vitamin K-dependent process in the liver) attach the factor complexes to phospholipids exposed on platelet membranes. Consequently, thrombus formation is rapidly accelerated and localized to the site of injury.

Regulatory mechanisms within the blood coagulation cascade and antifibrinolytic mechanisms prevent random coagulation within blood vessels that might obstruct blood flow. Impairments in these mechanisms lead to thrombosis.

There are two basic assays for measuring the activity of factor VIII in a blood sample. The first is a functional (clotting) assay, the second is a coupled (to factor $X$ activation) enzyme system leading to the cleavage of a chromogenic substrate, generating a colored product.

For the functional assay, a sample of the patient's plasma is added to a factor VIII-deficient sample of plasma (which can be obtained commercially), and the time to generate clot formation is determined. Although clot formation is the end-product of this assay, one is measuring the eventual activation of factor II to IIa, which allows clot formation to initiate.

In the automated chromogenic assay, a sample of the unknown is mixed with purified factor IXa, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, phospholipid vesicles, the chromogenic substrate, and purified factor $X$. If the unknown sample contains factor VIII, factors VIII and IXa will synergize and activate factor $X$ to $X a$. Factor Xa will cleave the chromogenic substrate, forming a colored product whose concentration can be determined spectrophotometrically. Comparison to a standard curve of factor VIII addition enables an accurate estimate of the level of active factor VIII in the sample.

In cases of severe protein malnutrition (kwashiorkor), the concentration of the plasma proteins decreases, as a result of which the osmotic pressure of the blood decreases. As a result, fluid is not drawn back to the blood and instead accumulates in the interstitial space (edema). The distended bellies of famine victims are the result of fluid accumulation in the extravascular tissues because of the severely decreased concentration of plasma proteins, particularly albumin. Albumin synthesis decreases fairly early under conditions of protein malnutrition.

In spite of the importance of albumin in the maintenance of osmotic pressure in the blood, individuals who lack albumin (analbuminemia) have only moderate edema. Apparently, the concentration of other plasma proteins is increased to compensate for the lack of albumin. The frequency of analbuminemia is $<1$ per million individuals.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Peter K., a 6-month-old male infant, was brought to his pediatrician's office with a painful, expanding mass in his right upper thigh that was first noted just hours after he fell down three uncarpeted steps in his home. The child appeared to be in severe distress.

A radiograph showed no fractures, but a soft tissue swelling, consistent with a hematoma (bleeding into the tissues), was noted. Peter's mother related that soon after he began to crawl, his knees occasionally became swollen and seemed painful.

The pediatrician suspected a disorder of coagulation. A screening coagulation profile suggested a possible deficiency of factor VIII, a protein involved in the formation of blood clots. Peter's plasma factor VIII level was found to be only $3 \%$ of the average level found in normal subjects. A diagnosis of hemophilia A was made.

## I. Plasma Proteins Maintain Proper Distribution of Water between Blood and Tissues

When cells are removed from the blood, the remaining plasma is composed of water, nutrients, metabolites, hormones, electrolytes, and proteins. Plasma has essentially the same electrolyte composition as other extracellular fluids and constitutes approximately $25 \%$ of the body's total extracellular fluid. The plasma proteins serve several functions, including maintaining the proper distribution of water between the blood and the tissues; transporting nutrients, metabolites, and hormones throughout the body; defending against infection; and maintaining the integrity of the circulation through clotting. Many diseases alter the amounts of plasma proteins produced and hence their concentration in the blood. These changes can be determined by electrophoresis of plasma proteins over the course of a disease.

## A. Body Fluid Maintenance between Tissues and Blood

As the arterial blood enters the capillaries, fluid moves from the intravascular space into the interstitial space (that surrounding the capillaries) owing to Starling's forces. The hydrostatic pressure in the arteriolar end of the capillaries ( $\sim 37 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) exceeds the sum of the tissue pressure ( $\sim 1 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) and the osmotic pressure of the plasma proteins ( $\sim 25 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ). Thus, water tends to leave the capillaries and enter extravascular spaces. At the venous end of the capillaries, the hydrostatic pressure falls to approximately 17 mm Hg , whereas the osmotic pressure and the tissue pressure remain constant, resulting in movement of fluid back from the extravascular (interstitial) spaces and into the blood. Thus, most of the force bringing water back from the tissues into the plasma is the osmotic pressure mediated by the presence of proteins in the plasma.

## B. The Major Serum Protein,Albumin

As indicated in Table 43.1, the liver produces several transport or binding proteins and secretes them into the blood. The major protein synthesized is albumin, which constitutes approximately $60 \%$ of the total plasma protein, but because of its relatively small size ( 69 kDa ), it is thought to contribute $70 \%$ to $80 \%$ of the total osmotic pressure of the plasma. Albumin, like most plasma proteins, is a glycoprotein (GP) and is a carrier of free fatty acids, calcium, zinc, steroid hormones, copper, and bilirubin. Many drugs also bind to albumin, which may have important pharmacologic implications. For example, when a drug binds to albumin, such binding will likely lower the effective concentration of that drug and may lengthen its lifetime in the circulation. Drug dosimetry may need to be recalculated if a patient's plasma protein concentration is abnormal.

| TABLE 4.1 | Specific Plasma-Binding Proteins Synthesized in the Liver |
| :--: | :--: |
| Albumin | Binds free fatty acids, calcium, zinc, steroid hormones, copper, bilirubin |
| Ceruloplasmin | Binds copper; appears to be more important as a copper storage pool than as a transport protein; integrates iron and copper homeostasis |
| Corticosteroid-binding globulin | Binds cortisol |
| Haptoglobin | Binds extracorpuscular heme |
| Lipoproteins | Transport cholesterol and fatty acids |
| Retinol-binding protein | Binds vitamin A |
| Sex hormone-binding globulin | Binds estradiol and testosterone |
| Transferrin | Transports iron |
| Transthyretin | Binds tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine; $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ ); also forms a complex with retinol-binding protein |

## II. The Plasma Contains Proteins that Aid in Immune Defense

Two different sets of proteins aid in the immune response, the immunoglobulins and the complement proteins. The immunoglobulins are secreted by a subset of differentiated B-lymphocytes termed plasma cells and bind antigens at binding sites formed by the hypervariable regions of the proteins (see Chapter 7). Once the anti-body-antigen complex is formed, it must be cleared from the circulation. The complement system participates in this function. The complement system, consisting of approximately 20 proteins, becomes activated in either of two ways. The first is interaction with antigen-antibody complexes, and the second, specific for bacterial infections, is through interaction of bacterial cell polysaccharides with complement protein C3b. Activation of the complement system by either trigger results in a proteolytic activation cascade of the proteins of the complement system, resulting in the release of biologically active peptides or polypeptide fragments. These peptides mediate the inflammatory response, attract phagocytic cells to the area, initiate degranulation of granulocytes, and promote clearance of antigen-antibody complexes.

Protease inhibitors in plasma serve to carefully control the inflammatory response. Activated neutrophils release lysosomal proteases from their granules that can attack elastin, the various types of collagen, and other extracellular matrix proteins. The plasma proteins $\alpha_{1}$-antiproteinase ( $\alpha_{1}$-antitrypsin) and $\alpha_{2}$-macroglobulin limit proteolytic damage by forming noncovalent complexes with the proteases, thereby inactivating them. However, the product of neutrophil myeloperoxidase, HOCl , inactivates the protease inhibitors, thereby ensuring that the proteases are active at the site of infection.

## III. Plasma Proteins Maintain the Integrity of the Circulatory System

Blood is lost from the circulation when the endothelial lining of the blood vessels is damaged and the vessel wall is partly or wholly severed. When this occurs, the subendothelial cell layer is exposed, consisting of the basement membrane of the endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. In response to the damage, a barrier (the hemostatic plug, a fibrin clot), initiated by platelet binding to the damaged area, is formed at the site of injury. Regulatory mechanisms limit clot formation to the site of injury and control its size and stability. As the vessel heals, the clot is degraded (fibrinolysis). Plasma proteins are required for these processes to occur.
$\alpha_{1}$-Antiproteinase (AAP), also known as $\alpha_{1}$-antitrypsin, is the main serine protease inhibitor of human plasma. Individuals with a point mutation in exon 5 of the AAP gene, which results in a single amino acid substitution in the protein, have diminished secretion of AAP from the liver. These individuals are at increased risk for developing emphysema. When neutrophils degranulate in the lungs as part of the body's defense against microorganisms, insufficient levels of AAP are present to neutralize the elastase and other proteases released. The excess proteolytic activity damages lung tissue, leading to loss of alveolar elasticity and the development of emphysema.

Methionine 358 of AAP is necessary for AAP binding to the proteases. Oxidation of this methionine destroys the protease-binding capacity of AAP. Chemicals within cigarette smoke lead to the oxidation of Met-358, thereby increasing the risk of emphysema through the inactivation of AAP.

![ma33039756a7](ma33039756a7.jpg)

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease in which antibodies to platelet GPs are produced. Antibody binding to platelets results in their clearance by the spleen. An early symptom of the disorder is the appearance of small red spots on the skin (petechial hemorrhages) caused by blood leakage from capillaries. Minor damage to vascular endothelial cells is constantly being caused by mechanical forces related to blood flow. In patients with ITP, few platelets are available to repair the damage.

$2 \mathrm{vWF}$ is a large multimeric GP with a subunit molecular weight of 220,000 Da. Its size in the circulation ranges between 500 and $20,000 \mathrm{kDa}$, and its role in circulation is to stabilize factor VIII and protect it from degradation. The high-molecular-weight forms are concentrated in the endothelium of blood vessels and are released in response to stress hormones and endothelial damage. High-molecular-weight vWF released by the endothelium is cleaved by a specific metalloprotease in the serum, reducing the size of the circulating vWF. Large vWF multimers are more effective at forming complexes with platelets than are small vWF multimers.

vWF deficiency is the most common cause of inherited bleeding disorders. Both platelet adherence and the clotting cascade are affected because levels of factor VIII are low. In the absence of vWF, factor VIII is rapidly cleared from the system. The vWF gene is large, covering approximately 180 kb , and contains 52 exons. Multiple mutations are known, with varying clinical presentations.

## A. Formation of the Hemostatic Plug

## I. The Platelet

Platelets are nonnucleated cells in the blood whose major role is to form mechanical plugs at the site of vessel injury and to secrete regulators of the clotting process and vascular repair. In the absence of platelets, leakage of blood from rents in small vessels is common. Platelets are derived from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Megakaryocytes differentiate from the hematopoietic stem cell. As the megakaryocyte matures, it undergoes synchronous nuclear replication without cellular division, to form a cell with a multilobed nucleus and enlarged cytoplasm. At approximately the eight-nucleus stage, the cytoplasm becomes granular, and the platelets are budded off the cytoplasm. A single megakaryocyte gives rise to approximately 4,000 platelets.

In the nonactivated platelet (a platelet that is not involved in forming a clot), the plasma membrane invaginates extensively into the interior of the cell, forming an open membrane (canalicular) system. Because the plasma membrane contains receptors and phospholipids that accelerate the clotting process, the canalicular structure substantially increases the membrane surface area that is potentially available for clotting reactions. The platelet interior contains microfilaments and an extensive actin/myosin system. Platelet activation in response to endothelial injury causes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent changes in the contractile elements, which, in turn, substantially change the architecture of the plasma membrane. Long pseudopodia are generated, increasing the surface area of the membrane as clot formation is initiated.

Platelets contain three types of granules. The first are electron-dense granules, which contain calcium, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and serotonin. The second type of granule is the $\alpha$-granule, which contains a heparin antagonist (heparin interferes with blood clotting; see "Biochemical Comments"), platelet-derived growth factor, $\beta$-thromboglobulin, fibrinogen, vWF, and other clotting factors. The third type of granule is the lysosomal granule, which contains hydrolytic enzymes. During activation, the contents of these granules, which modulate platelet aggregation and clotting, are secreted.

## 2. Platelet Activation

Three fundamental mechanisms are involved in platelet function during blood coagulation: adhesion, aggregation, and secretion. Adhesion sets off a series of reactions termed platelet activation, which leads to platelet aggregation and secretion of platelet granule contents.

The adhesion step refers primarily to the platelet-subendothelial interaction that occurs when platelets initially adhere to the sites of blood vessel injury (Fig. 43.1). Blood vessel injury exposes collagen, subendothelial matrix-bound vWF, and other
![ma34039756a7](ma34039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 43.1 Adhesion of platelets to the subendothelial cell layer. (I) glycoprotein la (GPIa) initially binds to the exposed collagen, which results in changes in the threedimensional configuration of the complex, allowing GPIb to bind to von Willebrand factor (vWF) (2). (3) This second binding event exposes the GPIIb-GPIIIa complex, which also can bind to vWF and fibrinogen.

matrix components. vWF is a protein synthesized in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes and is located in the subendothelial matrix, in specific platelet granules, and in the circulation bound to factor VIII. The platelet cell membrane contains GPs that bind to collagen and to vWF, causing the platelet to adhere to the subendothelium. Binding to collagen by GPIa ( $\alpha_{2} \beta_{1}$ integrin) causes the platelet to change its shape from a flat disc to a spherical cell. The latter extrudes long pseudopods, which promote platelet-platelet interactions. Binding of subendothelial vWF by GPIb causes changes in the platelet membrane that expose GPIIb-IIIa ( $\alpha_{1 \mathrm{~b}} \beta_{3}$ integrin)-binding sites to fibrinogen and vWF.

The initial adherence of platelets sets off a series of reactions (platelet activation) that results in more platelets being recruited and aggregated at the site of injury. After initial adherence, some of the platelets release the contents of their dense granules and their $\alpha$-granules, with ADP release being of particular importance because ADP is a potent platelet activator. ADP released from the platelets and from damaged red blood cells binds to a receptor on the platelet membrane, which leads to the further unmasking of GPIIb-IIIa-binding sites. Aggregation of platelets cannot take place without ADP stimulation because ADP induces swelling of the activated platelets, promoting platelet-platelet contact and adherence.

Fibrinogen is a protein that circulates in the blood and is also found in platelet granules. It consists of two triple helices held together with disulfide bonds (Fig. 43.2). Binding of fibrinogen to activated platelets is necessary for aggregation, providing, in part, the mechanism by which platelets adhere to one another. Cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin (a protease that is activated by the coagulation cascade) produces fibrin monomers that polymerize and, together with platelets, form a "soft" clot. Thrombin itself is a potent activator of platelets, through binding to a specific receptor on the platelet surface.

## B. The Blood Coagulation Cascade

Thrombus (clot) formation is enhanced by thrombin activation, which is mediated by the complex interaction that constitutes the blood coagulation cascade. This cascade (Fig. 43.3) consists primarily of proteins that serve as enzymes or cofactors, which function to accelerate thrombin formation and localize it at the site of injury. These proteins are listed in Table 43.2. All of these proteins are present in the plasma as proproteins (zymogens). These precursor proteins are activated by cleavage of the polypeptide chain at one or more sites. The key to successful and appropriate thrombus formation is the regulation of the proteases that activate these zymogens.

The proenzymes (factors VII, XI, IX, X, and prothrombin) are serine proteases that, when activated by cleavage, cleave the next proenzyme in the cascade. Because of the sequential activation, great acceleration and amplification of the response is achieved. That cleavage and activation have occurred is indicated by the addition of an "a" to the name of the proenzyme (e.g., factor IX is cleaved to form the active factor IXa).

The cofactor proteins (tissue factor, factors V and VIII) serve as binding sites for other factors. Tissue factor is not related structurally to the other blood coagulation cofactors and is an integral membrane protein that does not require cleavage for active function. Factors V and VIII serve as procofactors, which, when activated by cleavage, function as binding sites for other factors.

Two additional proteins that are considered part of the blood coagulation cascade, protein $S$ and protein $C$, are regulatory proteins. Only protein $C$ is regulated by proteolytic cleavage, and when it is activated, it is itself a serine protease.

In addition, in response to collagen and thrombin, platelets release vasoconstrictors. Serotonin is released from the dense granules of the platelets, and the synthesis of thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ is stimulated. This reduces blood flow to the damaged area. Platelet-derived growth factor, which stimulates proliferation of vascular cells, is also released into the environment surrounding the damage.

Mutations in GPIb cause a bleeding disorder known as Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Platelet aggregation is affected because of the inability of GPIb to adhere to subendothelial vWF.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a disease characterized by the formation in the circulation of microclots (microthrombi) consisting of aggregated platelets. The microthrombi collect in the microvasculature and damage red blood cells, resulting in hemolytic anemia. They also damage vascular endothelium, exposing collagen and releasing high-molecularweight vWF, promoting more platelet aggregation. The subsequent depletion of platelets renders the patient susceptible to internal hemorrhage. Mortality in untreated TTP can approach $90 \%$.

Familial TTP, which is a less common cause of TTP, is associated with mutations in the vWF-specific metalloprotease, although not all individuals with defective protease develop TTP. Sporadic cases of TTP are associated with the development of an antibody to the metalloprotease.

![ma35039756a7](ma35039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 43.2 Cleavage of fibrinogen results in clot formation. A. Fibrinogen, the precursor protein of fibrin, is formed from two triple helices joined together at their N-terminal ends. The $\alpha, \beta$-peptides are held together by disulfide bonds, and the $\gamma$-peptides are joined to each other by disulfide bonds. The terminal $\alpha, \beta$-peptide regions, shown in red, contain negatively charged glutamate and aspartate residues that repel each other and prevent aggregation. B. Thrombin, a serine protease, cleaves the terminal portions of fibrinogen that contain negative charges. The fibrin monomers can then aggregate and form a "soft" clot. The soft clot is subsequently cross-linked by another enzyme.

## C. The Process of Blood Coagulation

Activation of the blood coagulation cascade is triggered by the reaction of plasma proteins with the subendothelium at the same time that platelets are adhering to the subendothelial layer. Historically, two different pathways were discovered, one dependent on external stimuli (such as blunt trauma, which initiates the extrinsic pathway) and one using internal stimuli (the intrinsic pathway). As our understanding of blood clotting has expanded, it has become obvious that these distinctions are no longer correct because there is overlap between the pathways, but the terms have persisted in the description of the pathways.

In the case of external trauma, damaged tissues present tissue factor to the blood at the injured site, thereby triggering the extrinsic phase of blood coagulation. Circulating factor VII binds to tissue factor, which autocatalyzes its own activation to factor VIIa. Factor VIIa then activates factor X (to Xa) in the extrinsic pathway and factor IX (to IXa) in the intrinsic pathway. Factor IXa, as part of the intrinsic pathway, also activates factor X. Therefore, activation of both the extrinsic and

![ma36039756a7](ma36039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 43.3 The blood coagulation cascade. Activation of clot formation occurs through interlocking pathways, termed the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The intrinsic pathway is activated when factor XI is converted to factor XIa by thrombin. The extrinsic pathway (external damage, such as a cut) is activated by tissue factor. The reactions designated by PL, Co are occurring through cofactors bound to phospholipids (PL) on the platelet and blood vessel endothelial cell surface in a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-coordination complex. Factors XIa, IXa, VIIa, Xa, and thrombin are serine proteases. Note the positive feedback regulation of thrombin on the activation of proteases earlier in the cascade sequence (indicated by the dashed lines).

FIGURE 43.4 The transamidation reaction catalyzed by factor XIIIa, transglutaminase. This reaction cross-links fibrin monomers, allowing "hard" clots to form.

Warfarin (Coumadin) is a slow- and long-acting blood anticoagulant with a structure resembling that of vitamin K . The structural similarity allows the compound to compete with vitamin K and prevent $\gamma$-carboxylation of glutamate residues in factors II, VII, IX, and X and proteins C and S. The noncarboxylated blood clotting protein precursors increase in both the blood and plasma, but they are unable to promote blood coagulation because they cannot bind calcium and thus cannot bind to their phospholipid membrane sites of activation.
![ma38039756a7](ma38039756a7.jpg)
intrinsic pathways results in the conversion of factor X to factor Xa. All of these conversions require access to membranes and calcium; the platelet membrane, which had adhered to the damaged site, is used as a scaffold for the activation reactions to occur. The $\gamma$-carboxylated clotting proteins are chelated to membrane surfaces via electrostatic interactions with calcium and negatively charged phospholipids of the platelet membrane. The protein cofactors VIIIa and Va serve as sites for assembling enzyme-cofactor complexes on the platelet surface, thereby accelerating and localizing the reaction. The result is thrombin formation, which augments its own formation by converting factors V, VIII, and XI into activated cofactors and stimulating platelet degranulation. The initial activation of prothrombin is slow because the activator cofactors, VIIIa and Va, are present only in small amounts. However, once a small amount of thrombin is activated, it accelerates its own production by cleaving factors V and VIII to their active forms. Note that these factors are in the intrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway is thought to sustain the coagulation response initiated by the extrinsic pathway. The major substrate of thrombin is fibrinogen, which is hydrolyzed to form fibrin monomers that undergo spontaneous polymerization to form the fibrin clot. This is considered a "soft" clot because the fibrin monomers are not cross-linked. Cross-linking requires factor XIIIa, which is activated by thrombin cleavage of factor XIII.

## I. Cross-Linking of Fibrin

Factor XIIIa catalyzes a transamidation reaction between glutamine and lysine side chains on adjacent fibrin monomers. The covalent cross-linking takes place in three dimensions, creating a strong network of fibers that is resistant to mechanical and proteolytic damage. This network of fibrin fibers traps the aggregated platelets and other cells, forming the clot that plugs the vent in the vascular wall (Fig. 43.4). Factor XIIIa is the only enzyme in the blood coagulation cascade that is not a serine protease.

## 2. Factor Complexes

In several of the essential steps in the blood coagulation cascade, the activated protease is bound in a complex attached to the surfaces of the platelets that have aggregated at the site of injury. Factors VII, IX, X, and prothrombin contain a domain in which one or more glutamate residues are carboxylated to $\gamma$-carboxyglutamate in a reaction that requires vitamin K (Fig. 43.5). Prothrombin and factor X both contain 10 or more $\gamma$-carboxyglutamate residues that bind $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ forms a coordination complex with the negatively charged platelet membrane phospholipids and the $\gamma$-carboxyglutamates, thereby localizing the complex assembly and thrombin formation to the platelet surface.

Cofactor Va contains a binding site for both factor Xa and prothrombin, the zymogen substrate of factor Xa. Upon binding to the factor Va-platelet complex, prothrombin undergoes a conformational change, rendering it more susceptible to enzymatic cleavage. Binding of factor Xa to the factor Va-prothrombin-platelet complex allows the prothrombin-to-thrombin conversion. Complex assembly accelerates the rate of this conversion 10,000- to 15,000 -fold as compared with non-complex formation.

Factor VIIIa forms a similar type of complex on the surface of activated platelets but binds factor IXa and its zymogen substrate, factor X. Tissue factor works slightly differently because it is an integral membrane protein. However, once it is exposed by injury, it also binds factor VIIa and initiates complex formation.

Complex assembly has two physiologically important consequences. First, it enhances the rate of thrombin formation by as much as several hundred thousandfold, enabling the clot to form rapidly enough to preserve hemostasis. Second, such explosive thrombin formation is localized to the site of vascular injury at which the negatively charged phospholipids are exposed. From our knowledge of the location of such phospholipids in cellular and subcellular organelle membranes, these surface binding sites are only exposed at an injury site in which cell rupture exposes

Vitamin K-dependent formation of $\gamma$-carboxyglutamate residues. Thrombin and factors VII, IX, and X are bound to their phospholipid activation sites on cell membranes by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, which adds the extra carboxyl group, uses a reduced form of vitamin $\mathrm{K}\left(\mathrm{KH}_{3}\right)$ as the electron donor and converts vitamin K to an epoxide.Vitamin K epoxide is reduced, in two steps, back to its active form by the enzymes vitamin K epoxide reductase and vitamin K reductase.
the internal membrane surface (recall that certain phospholipids face only the cytoplasm; if these lipids are now exposed to the environment, substantial cell damage must have occurred).

# 3. Vitamin K Requirement for Blood Coagulation 

The formation of the $\gamma$-carboxyglutamate residues on blood coagulation factors takes place in the hepatocyte before release of the protein. Within the hepatocyte, vitamin K (which is present in the quinone form) is reduced to form vitamin $\mathrm{KH}_{2}$ by a microsomal quinone reductase (see Fig. 43.5). Vitamin $\mathrm{KH}_{2}$ is a cofactor for carboxylases that add a carboxyl group to the appropriate glutamate residues in the proenzyme to form the carboxylated proenzyme (e.g., prothrombin). In the same reaction, vitamin K is converted to vitamin K epoxide. To recover active vitamin $\mathrm{KH}_{2}$, vitamin K is first reduced to the quinone form by vitamin K epoxide reductase, and then to the active hydroquinone form.

## D. Regulation through Feedback Amplification and Inhibition

Once the formation of the clot (thrombus) begins, clot formation is accelerated in an almost explosive manner by several processes that are collectively termed feedback amplification.

Warfarin is a commonly used rat poison and thus is occasionally encountered in emergency departments in cases of accidental poisoning. It is effective as a rat poison because it takes many hours to develop pathologic symptoms, which allows one poisoned trap to kill more than one rat.

Deficiency in the amount or functionality of protein C or protein S increases the risk of venous thromboembolism. Individuals who are homozygous for these mutations do not survive the neonatal period unless they are given replacement therapy.

In European populations, a point mutation in the factorV gene (factorV Leiden) causes the replacement of an Arg with a Gln in the preferred site for cleavage by activated protein C, rendering factorVa Leiden resistant to APC. Heterozygous individuals have a sixfold to eightfold increased risk of deep vein thromboses, and homozygous individuals have a 30- to 140-fold increased risk. The factorV Leiden mutation does not appear to be associated with increased risk of arterial thrombosis, such as myocardial infarction, except in young women who smoke.

Genetic studies suggest that the factorV Leiden mutation arose after the separation of the European, Asian, and African populations. The frequency of this variant indicates that it conferred some selective advantage at one time. In the developed world, inherited APC, resistance is the most prevalent risk factor for familial thrombotic disease.

FIGURE 43.6 Antithrombotic effects of thrombin. Thrombin, bound to thrombomodulin on the endothelial cell surface, activates protein C. Activated protein C, in complex with protein S, binds to the platelet membrane, and the activated complex destroys factorsVa and VIIIa, thereby inhibiting the coagulation cascade. PL, phospholipids.

## I. The Role of Thrombin in Regulation

Thrombin has both a prothrombotic regulatory role (feedback amplification) and an antithrombotic regulatory role (feedback inhibition). The prothrombotic action is initiated when thrombin stimulates its own formation by activating factors V, VIII, and XI, thereby accelerating the rate of clot formation (see Fig. 43.3). Thrombin also promotes clot formation by activating platelet aggregation, stimulating the release of factor VIII from vWF, and cleaving factor XIII to factor XIIIa.

Antithrombotic effects of thrombin result from its binding to an endothelial cell receptor called thrombomodulin (Fig. 43.6). Thrombomodulin abolishes the clotting function of thrombin and allows thrombin to activate protein C, which has anticoagulant effects.

## 2. Proteins $S$ and $C$

Protein C and its cofactor protein S serve to suppress the activity of the coagulation cascade. After activation, protein C forms a complex with protein S. Protein S anchors the activated protein C complex (APC) to the clot through $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} / \gamma$-carboxyglutamate binding to platelet phospholipids. The APC destroys the active blood coagulation cofactors factor VIIIa and Va by proteolytic cleavage, decreasing the production of thrombin. The APC also stimulates endothelial cells to increase secretion of the prostaglandin $\mathrm{I}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PGI}_{2}\right)$, which reduces platelet aggregation.

## 3. Serpins

Many proteases of the blood coagulation enzyme system are serine proteases. Because uncontrolled proteolytic activity would be destructive, modulating mechanisms control and limit intravascular proteolysis. The serpins (serine protease inhibitors) are a group of naturally occurring inhibitory proteins that are present in the plasma at high concentration ( $\sim 10 \%$ of the plasma proteins are serpins). At least eight major inhibitors have been found that share a common mechanism of action and inhibit proteases involved in coagulation and clot dissolution (fibrinolysis). Each inhibitor possesses a reactive site that appears to be an ideal substrate for a specific serine protease and thus acts as a trap for that protease. The bound serine protease attacks a peptide bond located at a critical amino acid residue within the serpin and forms a tight enzyme-inhibitor complex.

The activity of thrombin is controlled by the serpin antithrombin III (ATIII). Regulation of blood coagulation at the level of thrombin is critical because this enzyme affects the pathways of both coagulation and fibrinolysis (see Section III.F). One molecule of ATIII irreversibly inactivates one molecule of thrombin through reaction of an arginine residue in ATIII with the active-site serine residue of thrombin.

ATIII-thrombin complex formation is markedly enhanced in the presence of heparin. Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan (see Chapter 47) found in the secretory granules of mast cells and in the loose connective tissue around small vascular beds. Heparin binds to lysyl residues on ATIII and dramatically accelerates its rate of binding to thrombin. This is because of an allosteric alteration in ATIII such that the position of the critical arginine residue of ATIII is more readily available for interaction with thrombin. The formation of the ATIII-thrombin complex releases the heparin molecule so that it can be reused, and, therefore, the function of heparin is catalytic. Thrombin that is attached to a surface-for example, to thrombomodulin on the endothelial cell membrane-is no longer participating in clot formation and is not readily attacked by ATIII or the ATIII-heparin complex. The ATIII-heparin complex can also inactivate the serine protease factors XIIIa, XIa, IXa, and Xa but has no effect on factor VIIa or activated protein C.

# E. Thromboresistance of Vascular Endothelium 

Endothelial cells of blood vessels provide a selectively permeable barrier between the circulating blood and the tissues. The normal endothelial cell lining neither activates coagulation nor supports platelet adhesion; thus, it is called a nonthrombogenic surface. The thromboresistance of normal vascular endothelium is contributed to by several properties. Endothelial cells are highly negatively charged, a feature that may repel the negatively charged platelets. Endothelial cells synthesize $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ and nitric oxide, vasodilators and powerful inhibitors of platelet aggregation. $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ synthesis is stimulated by thrombin, epinephrine, and local vascular injury. Endothelial cells also synthesize two cofactors that each inhibit the action of thrombin: thrombomodulin and heparan sulfate. Heparan sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan similar to heparin that potentiates ATIII, but not as efficiently. The inactivation of thrombin is accelerated by heparan sulfate present on the endothelial cell surface. Thus, the intact endothelium has the capability of modifying thrombin action and inhibiting platelet aggregation.

## F. Fibrinolysis

After successful formation of a hemostatic plug, further propagation of the clot must be prevented. This is accomplished in part by switching off blood coagulation and in part by turning on fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis involves the degradation of fibrin in a clot by plasmin, a serine protease that is formed from its zymogen, plasminogen. Plasminogen is a circulating serum protein that has a high affinity for fibrin, promoting the incorporation of plasminogen in the developing clot. The activity of plasminogen is mediated by proteins known as plasminogen activators. The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by plasminogen activators can occur both in the liquid phase of the blood and at the clot surface; however, the latter process is by far more efficient. Activated protein C (APC), in addition to turning off the blood coagulation cascade, also stimulates the release of plasminogen activator from tissues (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA]) and simultaneously inactivates an inhibitor of plasminogen activator, PAI-1.

Plasminogen activator release can lead to plasmin formation in the circulation. However, the circulating plasmin is rapidly inactivated by binding with $\alpha_{2}$-antiplasmin, a circulating protease inhibitor. Clot-bound plasmin is not readily inactivated by $\alpha_{2}$-antiplasmin. Thus, plasminogen binding to fibrin facilitates its activation to plasmin, protects it from blood serpins, and localizes it on the fibrin substrate for subsequent efficient proteolytic attack. This mechanism allows for dissolution of fibrin in pathologic thrombi or oversized hemostatic plugs, and at the same time it prevents degradation of fibrinogen in the circulating blood.

Two endogenous plasminogen activators are most important; both are synthesized in a variety of cells. tPA is produced chiefly by the vascular endothelial cells, has a high binding affinity for fibrin, and plays a major role in fibrinolysis.

Both streptokinase and tPA have been approved for the treatment of myocardial infarction but have been used less frequently over the last several years. If there is cardiac catheterization available, this procedure will be used to treat a myocardial infarction. tPA can also be used to dissolve clots in an acute cerebral vascular accident (CVA; or stroke) or a massive pulmonary embolus (lung clot). Owing to the availability of newer drugs, streptokinase is rarely used at this time.
![ma41039756a7](ma41039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 43.7 Regulation of plasmin activation. Plasminogen can be activated by either tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or urokinase (uPA) ( $\oplus$ ). Plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-I) blocks tPA action ( $\odot$ ). Streptokinase binding to plasminogen allows autocatalysis to form plasmin. Circulating $\alpha_{2}$-antiplasmin blocks ( $\odot$ ) the activity of any soluble plasmin that may be in the blood.

Single-chain urokinase (uPA) is synthesized in most cells and tissues and has a moderate affinity for fibrin. Streptokinase, the bacterial exogenous plasminogen activator from $\beta$-hemolytic streptococci, is not an enzyme but an allosteric modifier of human plasminogen that allows an autocatalytic reaction such that plasmin is formed. In vivo, physical stress, hypoxia, and large numbers of low-molecularweight organic compounds promote increased synthesis and release of tPA and uPA from tissues into the blood. The balance between release of plasminogen activators, the availability of fibrin, and inhibitors of the activators and plasmin determines regulation of the fibrinolytic response, as indicated in Figure 43.7.

## G. Regulation of Fibrinolysis

Antiactivators regulate interaction of plasminogen in blood with plasminogen activators in a dynamic equilibrium. Even if minute amounts of plasmin are generated (e.g., after stress-induced release of vascular plasminogen activator), the enzyme is probably inactivated by antiplasmin. Upon activation of the blood coagulation system, a fibrin clot is formed, which not only strongly binds tPA and plasminogen from blood but also accelerates the rate of plasmin activation. The clot-bound plasmin is protected from inhibitors while attached to fibrin. The enzyme is inactivated by $\alpha_{2}$-antiplasmin and $\alpha_{2}$-macroglobulin after proteolytic dissolution of fibrin and its liberation into the liquid phase of blood. Thus, the fibrin network catalyzes both initiation and regulation of fibrinolysis.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

$\square$Peter K. Peter K. has hemophilia A, the most frequently encountered serious disorder of blood coagulation in humans, occurring in 1 in every 10,000 males. The disease is transmitted with an X-linked pattern of inheritance.

The most common manifestations of hemophilia A are those caused by bleeding into soft tissues (hematomas) such as muscle or into body spaces like the peritoneal cavity, joint spaces, or the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. When bleeding occurs repeatedly into joints (hemarthrosis), the joint may eventually become deformed and immobile.

In the past, bleeding episodes have been managed primarily by administration of factor VIII, sometimes referred to as antihemophilia cofactor. Unfortunately, the concentration of factor VIII in plasma is quite low ( 0.3 nM , compared with $8,800 \mathrm{nM}$ for fibrinogen), requiring that it be prepared from multiple human donors.

Before donor screening and virus-inactivation procedures during preparation essentially eliminated transmission with blood transfusions, $>50 \%$ of patients with hemophilia who were treated with factor VIII during the 1980s in Western Europe or North America became infected with HIV and hepatitis C. Recombinant factor VIII is now available for clinical use and mitigates the threat of HIV/hepatitis C transmission in these patients.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

$\rightarrow$Drugs that Inhibit Blood Coagulation. Several drugs have been developed that inhibit the blood coagulation cascade. Such drugs are useful in cases in which patients develop spontaneous thrombi, which, if left untreated, would result in a fatal pulmonary embolism. There are several major classes of such drugs: the heparins, vitamin K antagonists, specific inhibitors of thrombin, and P2Y12 inhibitors.

Heparin binds to and activates ATIII, which leads to thrombin inactivation. ATIII also blocks the activity of factors VIIIa, IXa, Xa, and XIa. Heparin can be administered in either of two forms: unfractionated, or high-molecular-weight (HMW) heparin; and fractionated, or low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin. HMW heparin is a heterogenous mixture of glycosaminoglycans that have an average chain length of 43 monosaccharides with an average molecular weight of 15 kDa (range, 3 to 30 kDa ). LMW heparins are fragments of HMW heparin, containing fewer than 18 monosaccharides with an average molecular weight of 4 to 5 kDa .

HMW heparin binds to plasma proteins and cell surfaces in addition to its prime target, ATIII. Because different individuals synthesize different levels of plasma proteins, the use of this form of heparin as an anticoagulant requires constant monitoring of the patient to ensure that the correct dosage has been given so that spontaneous thrombi do not develop but not so much that spontaneous bleeding occurs. LMW heparin has fewer nonspecific interactions than HMW heparin, and its effects are easier to predict on patients, so constant monitoring is not required.

A major complication of heparin therapy is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT; excessive blood clotting with a reduction in the number of circulating platelets). This unexpected result of heparin treatment is caused by heparin binding to a platelet protein, platelet factor 4 (PF4), which induces a conformational change in PF4 such that the immune system believes the complex is foreign. Thus, antibodies are developed against the heparin-PF4 complex. When the antibodies bind to the platelets, the platelets become activated, and thrombi develop. Treatment consists of removing the heparin and using a different form of antithrombotic agent.

The classic vitamin K antagonist is warfarin. Warfarin acts by blocking the vitamin K reductase enzymes required to regenerate active vitamin K (see Fig. 43.5). This results in reduced $\gamma$-carboxylation of factors II, VII, IX, and X. In the absence of $\gamma$-carboxylation, the factors cannot bind calcium or form the complexes necessary for the coagulation cascade to be initiated. However, warfarin also blocks the activity of proteins S and C , so both blood clotting and the regulation of clotting are impaired by warfarin administration.

Both heparin and warfarin therapy suffer from their lack of specificity, so drugs specific for single steps in the blood coagulation pathway have been sought and identified. Analysis of heparin potentiation of factor Xa binding to ATIII showed that a unique pentasaccharide sequence was required. An appropriate pentasaccharide, named fondaparinux, was developed that would specifically enhance ATIII interactions with factor Xa. Fondaparinux stimulates the binding of ATIII to factor Xa by 300 -fold and is specific for factor Xa inhibition. Fondaparinux does not affect thrombin or platelet activity, and it is not an activating agent of platelets. Because fondaparinux does not bind to PF4, HIT is not a complication with this therapy.

Direct thrombin inhibitors are based on the hirudin molecules, which were initially discovered in leeches and other blood-sucking organisms. These organisms

Another X-linked bleeding disorder is hemophilia B, which is caused by mutations in the gene for factor $I X$. Lack of factor IX activity leads to an inability to convert prothrombin to thrombin and to impaired clotting.

would not be able to feed if the blood clotted at the site of the puncture wound, so the organisms secrete thrombin inhibitors to prevent clotting from occurring. Hirudin treatment itself is dangerous in that formation of the hirudin-thrombin complex is irreversible, and use of the drug requires constant monitoring of the patient. Thus, to overcome this problem, rational drug design based on the hirudin structure was used, and a synthetic 20-amino-acid peptide known as bivalirudin was synthesized. This agent has a high binding affinity and specificity for thrombin, although its effects on thrombin are transient (not irreversible), making this a safer agent for longterm use. More recently, there have been multiple other direct-acting anticoagulants developed that inhibit either thrombin or factor Xa.

The P2Y12 receptor inhibitors (examples of which are clopidogrel [Plavix] and ticagrelor [Brilinta]) inhibit platelet aggregation by binding tightly to the ADP receptor on the platelet surface. These drugs are used in patients to prevent strokes and heart attacks in patients who have had a previous stroke or heart attack as well as in patients with cardiovascular disease who have had stents placed to correct narrowed coronary arteries. The use of the drugs prevents platelet aggregation on the newly placed stent. The P2Y12 receptor is coupled to an inhibitory G-protein. ADP is found in the platelet-dense granule, and when the platelet encounters an appropriate agent (such as thrombin), the granular contents are released and ADP binds to its receptor, which amplifies the platelet response and contributes to platelet aggregation. Blocking ADP binding to its receptor will prevent efficient platelet aggregation.

The plasma contains water, nutrients, metabolites, hormones, electrolytes, and proteins.
Plasma proteins provide osmotic pressure to maintain fluid balance between the tissues and the blood.
The plasma proteins provide transport for many molecules and also aid in immune defense.
The plasma proteins, in association with platelets, maintain the integrity of the circulatory system.

Platelets form mechanical plugs at the site of vessel injury and secrete regulators of the blood-clotting process.
Platelets become activated when bound to a site of injury, which leads to more platelet binding and aggregation at the injured site.
Circulating fibrinogen also binds to the activated platelets at sites of injury. Clot formation is carefully regulated such that overclotting (thrombosis) or underclotting (bleeding) does not occur.

The clotting cascade consists of a series of protease activation steps leading to the activation of thrombin, which converts fibrinogen to fibrin.
Thrombin also activates transglutaminase, which cross-links the fibrin and leads to "hard" clot formation.
Proteins S and C regulate the clotting cascade and are activated by thrombin. In order to form a clot, protein complexes must adhere to the activated platelets, which occurs via $\gamma$-carboxyglutamate binding to calcium and platelet membranes.
Serpins are serine protease inhibitors; the serpin antithrombin III (ATIII) aids in regulating blood coagulation by modulating thrombin activity.
Heparin enhances the interaction of thrombin with ATIII.
Plasmin, the active product of plasminogen, is the only protease that can dissolve fibrin clots.
Hemophilia A is caused by a lack of factor VIII, an essential factor required for thrombin activation.
Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 43.3.

| DISEASE OR DISORDER | ENVIRONMENTAL OR GENETIC | COMMENTS |

# REVIEW QUESTIONS-CHAPTER 43 

1. The edema observed in patients with non-calorie-protein malnutrition is caused by which of the following?

E. Protein C

5. Hemophilia B results in an inability to directly activate which one of the following factors?
A. Factor II
B. Factor IX
C. Factor X
D. Protein S
E. Protein C
6. An infant is born with a severe bleeding disorder. It is quickly determined via analysis of blood components that the patient has greatly decreased levels of circulating vWF. The bleeding disorder most likely results from which one of the following as a primary cause?
A. Inability to activate factor II
B. Inability of platelets to bind to blood vessel walls
C. Inability to activate factor IX
D. Inability to activate protein C
E. Inability of platelets to bind fibrinogen
7. An individual has a family history of factor V Leiden. Factor V Leiden leads to an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis owing to which one of the following?
A. The activated form of factor V Leiden is resistant to protein C cleavage.
B. Factor V Leiden does not need to be cleaved to be activated.
C. Factor V Leiden enhances factor XIIIa formation.
D. Factor V Leiden has a reduced need for phospholipids and calcium to activate other factors.
E. Factor V Leiden directly converts fibrinogen to fibrin.
8. The answer is D. Under conditions of reduced protein ingestion, essential amino acids are scarce and the liver reduces protein synthesis, including circulating plasma proteins. The reduction of protein in the plasma results in a lower osmotic pressure, so excess fluid in the extravascular spaces cannot return to the blood and remains outside of the circulation, collecting in tissues.
9. The answer is C. Warfarin inhibits the reduction of vitamin K epoxide, so active vitamin K levels decrease. The reduction in active vitamin K levels reduces the $\gamma$-carboxylation of clotting factors. In the absence of $\gamma$-carboxylation, the clotting factors cannot bind to calcium to form membrane-associated complexes with other clotting factors. Warfarin has no effect on the liver's ability to synthesize the clotting factor (the synthesized factor is not modified), nor does warfarin specifically inhibit the activation of factor XIII. The inhibition is more global than just attacking one step in the coagulation cascade. Plasma calcium levels are not altered by warfarin, and protein C activity is actually decreased in the presence of warfarin because protein C is one of the proteins that is $\gamma$-carboxylated in a vitamin K-dependent reaction.
10. An individual accidently ingested rat poison that interfered with vitamin K action. The activity of which one of the following clotting factors is vitamin K-dependent?
A. Factor II
B. Factor III
C. Factor V
D. Factor VIII
E. Factor XIII
11. A patient had a stroke (a cerebrovascular accident [CVA]) caused by a clot in the carotid circulation and received "clot busters" intravenously as emergency treatment. Which clot buster below is not normally found in the human body?
A. APC
B. PAI-1
C. tPA
D. Streptokinase
E. uPA
12. A patient had a deep vein thrombosis complicated by a pulmonary embolus and was placed on an anticoagulant as prevention of future clots. He decided to adopt a healthier lifestyle and changed his diet from primarily meat and potatoes to strict vegetarian. This change in diet could affect the efficiency of which one of his following medications?
A. Unfractionated heparin
B. LMW heparin
C. Warfarin
D. Fondaparinux
E. Direct thrombin inhibitor
13. The answer is C. APC turns off the clotting cascade; in the absence of protein C, regulation of clotting is impaired and clots can develop when not required. Mutations in any of the other answers listed would lead to excessive bleeding, because an essential component of the clotting cascade would be inactivated.
14. The answer is C. Classic hemophilia is absence of factor VIII, which is a necessary cofactor for the activation of factor X by factor IXa. Factor II is directly activated by factor Xa, and factor IX is directly activated by factor XIa. Proteins and $S$ are directly activated by thrombin, factor IIa.
15. The answer is B. Hemophilia B is an inactivating mutation in factor IX, such that factor IXa cannot be formed. Factor XIa is formed but its substrate, factor IX, is defective, and a nonactive protein results.
16. The answer is B. GPIb on the platelet membrane binds to vWF exposed on the subendothelial cell layer. In this patient, vWF levels are reduced and the initial platelet adhesion event is disturbed. Inability of platelets to adhere to the sites of injury leads to blockage of platelet aggregation, fibrinogen deposition, and clot formation. Owing to this problem, most clotting factors will not be activated, but the inability to activate these factors is not the primary cause of the disorder.

7. The answer is A. Factor V Leiden still needs to be converted to factor Va to be active, but once active, it is not inactivated by APC. Continued Va activity leads to dysregulation of the clotting cascade and the potential for thrombi formation when none is required. Factor Va aids in factor II activation, not factor XIII activation, and factor V Leiden does not have an altered phospholipid or calcium requirement for complex formation. Factor V Leiden also cannot convert fibrinogen to fibrin, which is the function of thrombin (factor IIa).
8. The answer is A. Factors VII, IX, X, and prothrombin (factor II) contain a domain in which glutamate residues are carboxylated to $\gamma$-carboxyglutamate in a reaction that requires vitamin K (vitamin K-dependent). The carboxylation is required to allow the factors to bind to positive charges on the forming clot surface, many times aided by the presence of calcium. Factors III, V, VIII, and XIII are not carboxylated in a vitamin K-dependent reaction.
9. The answer is D. Streptokinase is produced by $\beta$-hemolytic streptococci but has the ability to activate plasminogen
to plasmin. All the other proteins listed are produced in the human body. PAI-1 is an inhibitor of plasminogen activator promoting clot retention instead of "clot busting." uPA activates plasminogen to plasmin, as does tPA. Protein C is a normal component of the body and when activated works with protein $S$ to inhibit the clotting cascade.
10. The answer is C. Warfarin acts as a vitamin K antagonist. Green leafy vegetables are high in vitamin K and are a staple in vegetarian diets. The increased vitamin K in the patient's diet, and subsequently in his circulation, would greatly reduce warfarin's action and could put the patient at risk for further clots. Both types of heparin bind to and activate ATIII, which, when activated, directly inhibits thrombin. Direct thrombin inhibitors bind to thrombin directly to inhibit clotting. Fondaparinux enhances ATIII interaction with factor Xa, inhibiting Xa and blocking the clotting cascade. The mechanism of action of the heparins, fondaparinux, and direct thrombin inhibitors would not be influenced by a vegetarian diet and an increase in vitamin K levels.

# Liver Metabolism 

The liver is strategically interposed between the general circulation and the digestive tract. It receives $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ of the volume of blood leaving the heart each minute (the cardiac output) through the portal vein (which delivers absorbed nutrients and other substances from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver) and through the hepatic artery (which delivers blood from the general circulation back to the liver). Potentially toxic agents absorbed from the gut or delivered to the liver by the hepatic artery must pass through this metabolically active organ before they can reach the other organs of the body. The liver's relatively large size ( $\sim 3 \%$ of total body weight) allows extended residence time in the liver for nutrients to be properly metabolized as well as for potentially harmful substances to be detoxified and prepared for excretion into the urine or feces. Among other functions, therefore, the liver, along with the kidney and gut, is an excretory organ, equipped with a broad spectrum of detoxifying mechanisms. It can, for example, carry out metabolic conversion pathways and use secretory systems that allow the excretion of potentially toxic compounds. Concurrently, the liver contains highly specific and selective transport mechanisms for essential nutrients that are required not only to sustain its own energy but also to provide physiologically important substrates for the systemic needs of the organism. In addition to the myriad transport processes within the sinusoidal and canalicular plasma membrane sheets (see below), intracellular hepatocytic transport systems exist in organelles such as endosomes, mitochondria, and lysosomes as well as the nucleus. The sequential transport steps carried out by these organelles include (I) uptake, (2) intracellular binding and sequestration, (3) metabolism, (4) sinusoidal secretion, and (5) biliary excretion. The rate of hepatobiliary transport is determined, in part, by the rate of activity of each of these steps. The overall transport rate is also determined by such factors as hepatic blood flow, plasma protein binding, and the rate of canalicular reabsorption. The various aspects of the major metabolic processes performed by the liver have been discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this text. These previous sources will be referred to as the broad spectrum of the liver's contributions to overall health and diseases are described.

Jean T.'s family difficulties continued, and, in spite of a period of sobriety that lasted 6 months, she eventually started drinking increasing amounts of gin again in an effort to deal with her many anxieties. Her appetite for food declined slowly as well. She gradually withdrew from much of the social support system that her doctors and friends had attempted to build during her efforts for rehabilitation. Upper midabdominal pain became almost constant, and she noted increasing girth and distention of her abdomen. Early one morning, she was awakened with pain in her upper abdomen. She vomited dark-brown "coffee ground" material followed by copious amounts of bright red blood. She called a friend, who rushed her to the hospital emergency department.

0Amy B., a 23-year-old missionary, was brought to the hospital emergency department complaining of the abrupt onset of fever, chills, and severe pain in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen. The pain was constant and radiated to her right shoulder top. She vomited undigested food twice in the hour before arriving at the emergency department. This did not relieve her pain.

Her medical history indicated that, while serving as a missionary in western Belize, Central America, 2 months earlier, she had a 3-day illness that included fever, chills, and mild but persistent diarrhea. A friend of Amy's there, a medical missionary, had given her an unidentified medication for 7 days. Amy's diarrhea slowly resolved, and she felt well again until her current abdominal symptoms began.

On physical examination, she appeared toxic and had a temperature of $101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. She was sweating profusely. Her inferior anterior liver margin was palpable three fingerbreadths below the right rib cage, suggestive of an enlarged liver. The liver edge was rounded and tender. Gentle fist percussion of the lower posterior right rib cage caused severe pain. Routine laboratory studies were ordered, and a computed tomogram (CT) of the upper abdomen was scheduled to be done immediately.

## I. Liver Anatomy

The human liver consists of two lobes, each containing multiple lobules and sinusoids. The liver receives $75 \%$ of its blood supply from the portal vein, which carries blood returning to the heart from the small intestine, stomach, pancreas, and spleen. The remaining $25 \%$ of the liver's blood supply is arterial, carried to the liver by the hepatic artery.

Blood from both the portal vein and hepatic artery empty into a common conduit, mixing their contents as they enter the liver sinusoids (Fig. 44.1). The sinusoids are expandable vascular channels that run through the hepatic lobules. They are lined with endothelial cells that have been described as "leaky" because, as blood flows through the sinusoids, the contents of the plasma have relatively free access to the hepatocytes, which are located on the other side of the endothelial cells.

The liver is also an exocrine organ, secreting bile into the biliary drainage system. The hepatocytes secrete bile into the bile canaliculus, whose contents flow parallel to that in the sinusoids, but in the opposite direction. The canaliculi empty into the bile ducts. The lumina of the bile ducts then fuse, forming the common bile duct. The common duct then releases bile into the duodenum. Some of the liver's effluent is stored in the gallbladder and discharged into the duodenum postprandially to aid in digestion.

The entire liver surface is covered by a capsule of connective tissue that branches and extends throughout the liver. This capsule provides support for the blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and bile ducts that permeate the liver. In addition, this connective tissue sheet subdivides the liver lobes into the smaller lobules.
![ma42039756a7](ma42039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 44.1 Schematic view of liver anatomy.

The reports of Amy B.'s initial laboratory studies showed an elevation in her serum hepatic transaminases, her serum alkaline phosphatases, as well as her serum total bilirubin level.

## II. Liver Cell Types

The primary cell type of the liver is the hepatocyte. Hepatocytes, also known as hepatic parenchymal cells, form the liver lobules. Eighty percent of the liver volume is composed of hepatocytes, but only $60 \%$ of the total number of cells in the liver are hepatocytes. The other $40 \%$ of the cells are nonparenchymal cells and constitute the lining cells of the walls of the sinusoids. The lining cells comprise the endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells. In addition, intrahepatic lymphocytes, which include pit cells (liver-specific natural killer cells), are also present in the sinusoidal lining.

## A. Hepatocytes

The hepatocyte is the cell that carries out the many functions of the liver. Almost all pathways of metabolism are represented in the hepatocyte, and these pathways are controlled through the actions of hormones that bind to receptors located on the plasma membrane of their cells. Although hepatocytes are normally quiescent cells with low turnover and a long life span, they can be stimulated to grow if damage occurs to other cells in the liver. The liver mass has a relatively constant relationship to the total body mass of adult individuals. Deviation from the normal or optimal ratio (e.g., caused by a partial hepatectomy or significant hepatic cell death or injury) is rapidly corrected by hepatic growth caused by a proportional increase in hepatocyte replication.

## B. Endothelial Cells

The sinusoidal endothelial cells constitute the lining cells of the sinusoid. Unlike endothelial cells in other body tissues, these cells contain fenestrations with a mean diameter of 100 nm . They do not, therefore, form a tight basement membrane barrier between themselves and the hepatocytes. In this way, they allow for free diffusion of small molecules to the hepatocytes but not of particles the size of chylomicrons (chylomicron remnants, however, which are smaller than chylomicrons, do have free passage to the hepatocyte). The endothelial cells are capable of endocytosing many ligands and also may secrete cytokines when appropriately stimulated. Because of their positioning, lack of tight junctions, and absence of a tight basement membrane, the liver endothelial cells do not present a significant barrier to the movement of the contents of the sinusoids into hepatocytes. Their fenestrations or pores further promote the free passage of blood components through this membrane into the liver parenchymal cells.

## C. Kupffer Cells

Kupffer cells are located within the sinusoidal lining. They contain almost onequarter of all the lysosomes of the liver. The Kupffer cells are tissue macrophages with both endocytotic and phagocytic capacity. They phagocytose many substances such as denatured albumin, bacteria, and immune complexes. They protect the liver from gut-derived particulate materials and bacterial products. On stimulation by immunomodulators, these cells secrete potent mediators of the inflammatory response and play a role in liver immune defense through the release of cytokines that lead to the inactivation of substances considered foreign to the organism. The Kupffer cells also remove damaged erythrocytes from the circulation.

## D. Hepatic Stellate Cells

The stellate cells are also called perisinusoidal or Ito cells. There are approximately 5 to 20 of these cells per 100 hepatocytes. The stellate cells are lipid-filled cells and also serve as the primary storage site for vitamin A. They also control the turnover of hepatic connective tissue and extracellular matrix and regulate the contractility of

the sinusoids. When cirrhosis of the liver is present, the stellate cells are stimulated by various signals to increase their synthesis of extracellular matrix material. This, in turn, diffusely infiltrates the liver, eventually interfering with the function of the hepatocytes.

## E. Pit Cells

The hepatic pit cells, also known as liver-associated lymphocytes, are natural killer cells, which are a defense mechanism against the invasion of the liver by potentially toxic agents, such as tumor cells or viruses.

## III. Major Functions of the Liver

## A. The Liver Is a Central Receiving and Recycling Center for the Body

The liver can carry out a multitude of biochemical reactions. This is necessary because of its role in constantly monitoring, recycling, modifying, and distributing all of the various compounds absorbed from the digestive tract and delivered to the liver. If any portion of an ingested compound is potentially useful to that organism, the liver retrieves this portion and converts it to a substrate that can be used by hepatic and nonhepatic cells. At the same time, the liver removes many of the toxic compounds that are ingested or produced in the body and targets them for excretion in the urine or in the bile.

As mentioned previously, the liver receives nutrient-rich blood from the enteric circulation through the portal vein; thus, all of the compounds that enter the blood from the digestive tract pass through the liver on their way to other tissues. The enterohepatic circulation allows the liver first access to nutrients to fulfill specific functions (such as the synthesis of blood coagulation proteins, heme, purines, and pyrimidines) and first access to ingested toxic compounds (such as ethanol) and to such potentially harmful metabolic products (such as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$produced from bacterial metabolism in the gut).

In addition to the blood supply from the portal vein, the liver receives oxygenrich blood through the hepatic artery; this arterial blood mixes with the blood from the portal vein in the sinusoids. This unusual mixing process gives the liver access to various metabolites ingested and produced in the periphery and secreted into the peripheral circulation, such as glucose, individual amino acids, certain proteins, irontransferrin complexes, and waste metabolites as well as potential toxins produced during substrate metabolism. As mentioned, fenestrations in the endothelial cells, combined with gaps between the cells, the lack of a basement membrane between the endothelial cells and the hepatocytes, and low portal blood pressure (which results in slow blood flow), contribute to the efficient exchange of compounds between sinusoidal blood and the hepatocyte and clearance of unwanted compounds from the blood. Thus, large molecules targeted for processing, such as serum proteins and chylomicron remnants, can be removed by hepatocytes, degraded, and their components recycled. Similarly, newly synthesized molecules, such as very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and serum proteins, can be easily secreted into the blood. In addition, the liver can convert all of the amino acids found in proteins into glucose, fatty acids, or ketone bodies. The secretion of VLDL by the liver not only delivers excess calories to adipose tissue for storage of fatty acids in triacylglycerol but also delivers phospholipids and cholesterol to tissues that are in need of these compounds for synthesis of cell walls as well as other functions. The secretion of glycoproteins by the liver is accomplished through the liver's gluconeogenic capacity and its access to a variety of dietary sugars to form the oligosaccharide chains as well as its access to dietary amino acids with which it synthesizes proteins. Thus, the liver has the capacity to carry out a large number of biosynthetic reactions. It has the biochemical wherewithal to synthesize a myriad of compounds from a broad

(1)The CT scan of Amy B.'s upper abdomen showed an elevated right hemidiaphragm as well as several cystic masses in her liver, the largest of which was located in the superior portion of the right lobe. Her clinical history as well as her history of possible exposure to various parasites while working in a part of Belize, Central America, that is known to practice substandard sanitation, prompted her physicians to order a titer of serum antibodies against the parasite Entamoeba histolytica, in addition to measuring serum antibodies against other invasive parasites.

A knowledge of functional characteristics of liver cells has been used to design diagnostic agents to determine the normalcy of specific biochemical pathways of the hepatocytes. These "tailor-made" pharmaceuticals can be designed to be taken up by one or more of the transport mechanisms available to the liver. For example, receptor-related endocytic processes can be used as targets to probe specific receptor-mediated transport functions of the liver cells. The asialoglycoprotein receptor, also known as the hepatic binding protein, has been used in this diagnostic approach. The substrate ${ }^{99} \mathrm{~T} \mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{m}}$ galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin (NGA) was developed as a specific ligand for selective uptake via this hepatic receptor. The timing and extent of the assimilation of this probe into the hepatocytes, as determined by imaging the liver at precise intervals after the administration of this isotope, yields an estimate of hepatic blood flow as well as the transport capacity of this particular hepatic transporter protein.

Antibody titers against Entamoeba histolytica by use of an enzyme immunoassay were strongly reactive in Amy B.'s blood. A diagnosis of amoebiasis was made. Her physicians started a nitroimidazole amoebicide (metronidazole) orally in a dose of 750 mg every 8 hours for 10 days. By the third day of treatment, Amy began to feel noticeably better. Her physicians told her that they expected a full clinical response in $95 \%$ of patients with amoebic liver abscesses treated in this way, although her multiple hepatic abscesses adversely affected her prognosis to a degree. After her response to oral therapy for the liver abscess, she was also treated with a "luminal agent" (a drug which acts primarily in the lumen of the intestine) to clear the organism from her intestine.
spectrum of precursors. At the same time, the liver metabolizes compounds into biochemically useful products. Alternatively, it has the ability to degrade and excrete those compounds presented to it that cannot be further used by the body.

Each of the liver cells described contains specialized transport and uptake mechanisms for enzymes, infectious agents, drugs, and other xenobiotics that specifically target these substances to certain liver cell types. These are accomplished by linking these agents covalently by way of biodegradable bonds to their specific carrier. The latter then determines the particular fate of the drug by using specific cell recognition, uptake, transport, and biodegradation pathways.

## B. Inactivation and Detoxification of Xenobiotic Compounds and Metabolites

Xenobiotics are compounds that have no nutrient value (cannot be used by the body for energy requirements) and are potentially toxic. They are present as natural components of foods or they may be introduced into foods as additives or through processing. Pharmacologic and recreational drugs are also xenobiotic compounds. The liver is the principal site in the body for the degradation of these compounds. Because many of these substances are lipophilic, they are oxidized, hydroxylated, or hydrolyzed by enzymes in phase I reactions. Phase I reactions introduce or expose hydroxyl groups or other reactive sites that can be used for conjugation reactions (the phase II reactions). The conjugation reactions add a negatively charged group such as glycine, sulfate, or glucuronic acid to the molecule. Many xenobiotic compounds are transformed through several different pathways. A general scheme of inactivation is shown in Figure 44.2.

The conjugation and inactivation pathways are similar to those used by the liver to inactivate many of its own metabolic waste products. These pathways are intimately related to the biosynthetic cascades that exist in the liver. The liver can synthesize the precursors that are required for conjugation and inactivation reactions from other compounds. For example, sulfation is used by the liver to clear steroid hormones from the circulation. The sulfate used for this purpose can be obtained from the degradation of cysteine or methionine.

The liver, kidney, and intestine are the major sites in the body for biotransformation of xenobiotic compounds. Many xenobiotic compounds contain aromatic rings (such as benzopyrene in tobacco smoke) or heterocyclic ring structures (such as the nitrogen-containing rings of nicotine or pyridoxine) that we are unable to degrade or recycle into useful components. These structures are hydrophobic, causing the molecules to be retained in adipose tissue unless they are sequestered by the liver, kidney, or intestine for biotransformation reactions. Sometimes, however, the phase I and II reactions backfire, and harmless hydrophobic molecules are converted to toxins or potent chemical carcinogens.

## I. Cytochrome P450 and Xenobiotic Metabolism

The toxification/detoxification of xenobiotics is accomplished through the activity of a group of enzymes with a broad spectrum of biologic activity. Some examples of enzymes involved in xenobiotic transformation are described in Table 44.1. Of the

wide variety of enzymes that are involved in xenobiotic metabolism, only the cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase system is discussed here (see Chapter 33). The cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase enzymes are determinants in oxidative, peroxidative, and reductive degradation of exogenous (e.g., chemicals, carcinogens, pollutants) and endogenous (e.g., steroids, prostaglandins, retinoids) substances. The key enzymatic constituents of this system are the flavoprotein reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and cytochrome P450 (see Fig. 33.5). The latter is the terminal electron acceptor and substrate-binding site of the microsomal mixed-function oxidase complex, a very versatile catalytic system. The system got its name in 1962, when Omura and Sato found a pigment with unique spectral characteristics that was derived from liver microsomes of rabbits. When reduced and complexed with carbon monoxide, it exhibited a spectral absorbance maximum at 450 nm .

The major role of the cytochrome P450 enzymes (see Chapter 33) is to oxidize substrates and introduce oxygen to the structure. Similar reactions can be carried out by other flavin monooxygenases that do not contain cytochrome P450.

The human cytochrome P450 enzyme family contains 57 functional genes, which produce proteins with at least $40 \%$ sequence homology. These isozymes have different but overlapping specificities. The human enzymes are generally divided into nine major subfamilies, and each of these is further subdivided. For example, in the naming of the principal enzyme involved in the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, CYP2E1, the CYP denotes the cytochrome P450 family, the 2 denotes the subfamily, the $E$ denotes ethanol, and the $I$ denotes the specific isozyme.

The CYP3A4 isoform accounts for $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ of CYP450 enzymes in the liver and $70 \%$ of cytochrome enzymes in gut-wall enterocytes. It metabolizes the greatest number of drugs in humans. Specific drugs are substrates for CYP3A4. The concomitant ingestion of two CYP3A4 substrates could potentially induce competition for the binding site, which, in turn, could alter the blood levels of these two agents. The drug with the highest affinity for the enzyme will be preferentially metabolized, whereas the metabolism (and degradation) of the other drug will be reduced. The latter drug's concentration in the blood will then rise.

Moreover, many substances or drugs impair or inhibit the activity of the CYP3A4 enzyme, thereby impairing the body's ability to metabolize a drug. Some of the lipid-lowering agents known as the statins (hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitors) require CYP3A4 for degradation. Appropriate drug treatment and dosing takes into account the normal degradative pathway of the drug. However, a component of grapefruit juice is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4-mediated drug metabolism. Evidence suggests that if certain statins are regularly taken with grapefruit juice, its level in the blood may increase as much as 15 -fold. This marked increase in plasma concentration could increase the muscle and liver toxicity of the statin in question because side effects of the statins appear to be dose-related.

The cytochrome P450 isozymes all have certain features in common:

1. They all contain cytochrome P450, oxidize the substrate, and reduce oxygen.
2. They all have a flavin-containing reductase subunit that uses NADPH, and not NADH, as a substrate.
3. They are all found in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and are referred to as microsomal enzymes (e.g., CYP2E1 is also referred to as the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system [MEOS]).
4. They are all bound to the lipid portion of the membrane, probably to phosphatidylcholine.
5. They are all inducible by the presence of their own best substrate and somewhat less inducible by the substrates for other P450 isozymes.
6. They all generate a reactive free radical compound as an intermediate in the reaction.

# 2. Examples of Cytochrome P450 Detoxification Reactions 

## a. Vinyl Chloride

The detoxification of vinyl chloride provides an example of effective detoxification by a P450 isozyme (ethanol detoxification is discussed in Chapter 33). Vinyl chloride is used in the synthesis of plastics and can cause angiosarcoma in the liver of exposed workers. It is activated in a phase I reaction to a reactive epoxide by a hepatic P450 isozyme (CYP2E1), which can react with guanine in DNA or other cellular molecules. However, it also can be converted to chloroacetaldehyde, conjugated with reduced glutathione, and excreted in a series of phase II reactions (Fig. 44.3).

## b. Aflatoxin $B_{1}$

Aflatoxin $B_{1}$ is an example of a compound that is made more toxic by a cytochrome P450 reaction (CYP2A1). Current research suggests that ingested aflatoxin $B_{1}$ in contaminated food (it is produced by a fungus [Aspergillus flavus] that grows on peanuts that may have been stored in damp conditions) is directly involved in hepatocarcinogenesis in humans by introducing a $\mathrm{G} \rightarrow \mathrm{T}$ mutation into the $p 53$ gene. Aflatoxin is metabolically activated to its 8,9 -epoxide by two different isozymes of cytochrome P450. The epoxide modifies DNA by forming covalent adducts with guanine residues. In addition, the epoxide can combine with lysine residues in proteins and thus is also a hepatotoxin.

## c. Acetaminophen

Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is an example of a xenobiotic that is metabolized by the liver for safe excretion; however, it can be toxic if ingested in high doses. The pathways for acetaminophen metabolism are shown in Figure 44.4. As shown in the figure, acetaminophen can be glucuronylated or sulfated for safe excretion by the kidney. However, a cytochrome P450 enzyme produces the toxic intermediate N -acetyl- $p$-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which can be excreted safely in the urine after conjugation with glutathione.

![ma45039756a7](ma45039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 44.4 Pathways of acetaminophen detoxification. $N$-Acetylcysteine stimulates the production of glutathione, thereby reducing the levels of NAPQI, which can damage cellular proteins. Ethanol upregulates CYP2E1 activity (the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system [MEOS]). GSH, reduced glutathione; UDP, uridine diphosphate.

NAPQI is a dangerous and unstable metabolite that can damage cellular proteins and lead to death of the hepatocyte. Under normal conditions, when acetaminophen is taken in the correct therapeutic amounts, $<10 \%$ of the drug forms NAPQI, an amount that can be readily handled by the glutathione detoxifying system (phase II reactions). However, when taken in doses that are potentially toxic, the sulfotransferase and glucuronyl transferase systems are overwhelmed, and more acetaminophen is metabolized through the NAPQI route. When this occurs, the levels of glutathione in the hepatocyte are insufficient to detoxify NAPQI, and hepatocyte death can result.

The enzyme that produces NAPQI, CYP2E1, is induced by alcohol (see Chapter 33; MEOS). Thus, individuals who chronically abuse alcohol have increased sensitivity to acetaminophen toxicity, because a higher percentage of acetaminophen metabolism is directed toward NAPQI, compared with an individual with low levels of CYP2E1. Therefore, even recommended therapeutic doses of acetaminophen can be toxic to these individuals.

An effective treatment for acetaminophen poisoning involves the use of N -acetylcysteine. This compound supplies cysteine as a precursor for increased glutathione production, which, in turn, enhances the phase II reactions, which reduces the levels of the toxic intermediate.

# C. Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels 

One of the primary functions of the liver is to maintain blood glucose concentrations within the normal range. The manner in which the liver accomplishes this has been the subject of previous chapters (Chapters 19, 28, and 34). In brief, the pancreas monitors blood glucose levels and secretes insulin when blood glucose levels rise and glucagon when such levels decrease. These hormones initiate regulatory cascades that affect liver glycogenolysis, glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. In addition, sustained physiologic increases in growth hormone, cortisol, and catecholamine secretion help to sustain normal blood glucose levels during fasting (see Chapter 41).

Cirrhosis of the liver results in portal hypertension, which, because of increasing back pressure into the esophageal veins, promotes the development of dilated thin-walled esophageal veins (varices). At the same time, synthesis of blood coagulation proteins by the liver and required vitamin K-dependent reactions are greatly diminished (resulting in a prolonged prothrombin time; which, in turn, increases clotting time). When the esophageal varices rupture, massive bleeding into the thoracic or abdominal cavity as well as the stomach may occur. Much of the protein content of the blood entering the gastrointestinal tract is metabolized by intestinal bacteria, releasing ammonium ion, which enters the portal vein. Because hepatocellular function has been compromised, the urea-cycle capacity is inadequate, and the ammonium ion enters the peripheral circulation, thereby contributing to hepatic encephalopathy (brain toxicity owing to elevated ammonia levels).

When blood glucose levels drop, glycolysis and glycogen synthesis are inhibited, and gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis are activated. Concurrently, fatty acid oxidation is activated to provide energy for glucose synthesis. During an overnight fast, blood glucose levels are maintained primarily by glycogenolysis and, if gluconeogenesis is required, the energy (six ATP molecules are required to produce one molecule of glucose from two molecules of pyruvate) is obtained by fatty acid oxidation. On insulin release, the opposing pathways are activated such that excess fuels can be stored either as glycogen or fatty acids. The pathways are regulated by the activation or inhibition of two key kinases, the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase, and the AMP-activated protein kinase (see Fig. 34.8 for a review of these pathways). Recall that the liver can export glucose because it is one of only two tissues that express glucose 6-phosphatase.

## D. Synthesis and Export of Cholesterol and Triacylglycerol

When food supplies are plentiful, hormonal activation leads to fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and cholesterol synthesis. High dietary intake and intestinal absorption of cholesterol compensatorily reduces the rate of hepatic cholesterol synthesis, in which case the liver acts as a recycling depot for sending excess dietary cholesterol to the peripheral tissue when needed as well as accepting cholesterol from these tissues when required. The pathways of cholesterol metabolism were discussed in Chapter 32.

## E. Ammonia and the Urea Cycle

The liver is the primary organ for synthesizing urea and thus is the central depot for the disposition of ammonia in the body. Ammonia groups travel to the liver on glutamine and alanine, and the liver converts these ammonia nitrogens to urea for excretion in the urine. The reactions of the urea cycle were discussed in Chapter 36.

Table 44.2 lists some of the important nitrogen-containing compounds that are primarily synthesized or metabolized by the liver.

## F. Formation of Ketone Bodies

The liver is the only organ that can produce ketone bodies, yet it is one of the few that cannot use these molecules for energy production. Ketone bodies are produced when the rate of glucose synthesis is limited (i.e., substrates for gluconeogenesis are limited) and fatty acid oxidation is occurring rapidly. Ketone bodies can cross the blood-brain barrier and become a major fuel for the nervous system under conditions of starvation. Synthesis and metabolism of ketone bodies have been described in Chapter 30.

## G. Nucleotide Biosynthesis

The liver can synthesize and salvage all ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides for other cells to use. Certain cells have lost the capacity to produce nucleotides de novo but can use the salvage pathways to convert free bases to nucleotides. The liver can secrete free bases into the circulation for these cells to use for this purpose. Nucleotide synthesis and degradation are discussed in Chapter 39.

## H. Synthesis of Blood Proteins

The liver is the primary site of the synthesis of circulating proteins such as albumin and the clotting factors. When liver protein synthesis is compromised, the protein levels in the blood are reduced. Hypoproteinemia may lead to edema because of a decrease in the protein-mediated osmotic pressure in the blood. This, in turn, causes plasma water to leave the circulation and enter (and expand) the interstitial space, causing edema.

Most circulating plasma proteins are synthesized by the liver. Therefore, the hepatocyte has a well-developed endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi system, and cellular cytoskeleton, all of which function in the synthesis, processing, and secretion of proteins. The most abundant plasma protein produced by the liver is albumin, which represents $55 \%$ to $60 \%$ of the total plasma protein pool. Albumin serves as a carrier for a large number of hydrophobic compounds, such as fatty acids, steroids, hydrophobic amino acids, vitamins, and pharmacologic agents. It is also an important osmotic regulator in the maintenance of normal plasma osmotic pressure. The other proteins synthesized by the liver are, for the most part, glycoproteins. They function in hemostasis, transport, protease inhibition, and ligand binding, and as secretogogues for hormone release. The acute-phase proteins that are part of the immune response and the body's response to many forms of "injury" are also synthesized in the liver.

## I. The Synthesis of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans

The liver, because it is the site of synthesis of most of the blood proteins (including the glycoproteins), has a high requirement for the sugars that go into the oligosaccharide portion of glycoproteins. (The synthesis of glycoproteins was discussed in Chapter 27.) These include mannose, fructose, galactose, and amino sugars.

FIGURE 44.5 The general configuration of $O$-linked and $N$-linked glycoproteins. GalNAc, N -acetylgalactosamine.

One of the intriguing aspects of the hepatic biosynthetic pathways that use carbohydrate in the synthesis of these compounds is that the liver is not dependent on either dietary glucose or hepatic glucose to generate the precursor intermediates for these pathways. This is because the liver can generate carbohydrates from dietary amino acids (which enter gluconeogenesis generally as pyruvate or an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle), lactate (generated from anaerobic glycolysis in other tissues), and glycerol (generated by the release of free fatty acids from the adipocyte). Of course, if dietary carbohydrate is available, the liver can use that source as well.

Most of the sugars secreted by the liver are $O$-linked; that is, the carbohydrate is attached to the protein at its anomeric carbon through a glycosidic link to the -OH of a serine or a threonine residue. This is in contrast to the $N$-linked arrangement in which there is an $N$-glycosyl link to the amide nitrogen of an asparagine residue (Fig. 44.5). A particularly important $O$-linked sugar is $N$-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA or sialic acid), a nine-carbon sugar that is synthesized from fructose 6-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate (see Fig. 27.15). As circulating proteins age, NANA (sialic acid) residues are lost from the serum proteins. This change signals their removal from the circulation and their eventual degradation. An asialoglycoprotein receptor on the liver cell surface binds such proteins, and the receptor-ligand complex is endocytosed and transported to the lysosomes. The amino acids from the degraded protein are then recycled within the liver.

# J. The Pentose Phosphate Pathway 

The major functions of the pentose phosphate pathway (see Chapter 27) are the generation of NADPH and five-carbon sugars. All cell types, including red blood cells, can carry out this pathway because they need to generate NADPH so that the activity of glutathione reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) back to reduced glutathione (GSH) can be maintained. Without the activity of this enzyme, the protection against free-radical injury is lost. All cells also need this pathway for the generation of ribose, especially those cells that are dividing rapidly or that have high rates of DNA synthesis.

The liver has a much greater demand for NADPH than do most other organs. It uses NADPH for the biosynthesis of fatty acids (which are needed to produce phospholipids) and cholesterol, and for the synthesis of VLDL and bile salts. It also uses NADPH for other biosynthetic reactions, such as proline synthesis. NADPH is also used by mixed-function oxidases such as cytochrome P450 that are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and of a variety of pharmaceuticals. Because the liver participates in so many reactions that are capable of generating free radicals, the liver uses more glutathione and NADPH to maintain glutathione reductase and

catalase activity than any other tissue. Consequently, the concentration of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (the rate-limiting and regulated enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway) is high in the liver, and the rate of flux through this pathway may be as high as $30 \%$ of the rate of flux through glycolysis.

# IV. Fuels for the Liver 

The reactions used to modify and inactivate dietary toxins and waste metabolites are energy-requiring, as are the reactions used by anabolic (biosynthetic) pathways, such as gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis. Thus, the liver has a high energy requirement and consumes approximately $20 \%$ of the total oxygen used by the body. The principal forms in which energy is supplied to these reactions are the high-energy phosphate bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP), reduced NADPH, and acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) thioesters. The energy for the formation of these compounds is obtained directly from oxidative metabolism, the TCA cycle, or the electron-transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. After a mixed meal containing carbohydrate, the major fuels used by the liver are glucose, galactose, and fructose. If ethanol is consumed, the liver is the major site of ethanol oxidation, yielding principally acetate and then acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). During an overnight fast, fatty acids become the major fuel for the liver. They are oxidized to carbon dioxide or ketone bodies. The liver also can use all of the amino acids as fuels (although its use of branched-chain amino acids [BCAAs] is small compared to the muscles), converting many of them to glucose. The urea cycle disposes of the ammonia that is generated from amino acid oxidation.

## A. Carbohydrate Metabolism in the Liver

After a carbohydrate-containing meal, glucose, galactose, and fructose enter the portal circulation and flow to the liver. This organ serves as the major site in the body for the use of dietary galactose and fructose. It metabolizes these compounds by converting them to glucose and intermediates of glycolysis. Their fate is essentially the same as that of glucose (Table 44.3).

## B. Glucose as a Fuel

The entry of glucose into the liver is dependent on a high concentration of glucose in the portal vein after a high-carbohydrate meal. Because the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for both the glucose transporter (GLUT2) and glucokinase is so high ( $\sim 10 \mathrm{mM}$ ), glucose enters the liver principally after its concentration rises to 10 to 40 mM in the portal blood and

not at the lower 5 mM concentration in the hepatic artery. The increase in insulin secretion that follows a high-carbohydrate meal promotes the conversion of glucose to glycogen. In addition, the rate of glycolysis is increased (phosphofructokinase-2 [PFK-2] kinase activity is active; thus, phosphofructokinase-1 [PFK-1] is activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate) so that acetyl-CoA can be produced for fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by citrate; see Chapter 31). Thus, after a high-carbohydrate meal, the liver uses glucose as its major fuel while activating the pathways for glycogen and fatty acid synthesis.

The rate of glucose use by the liver is determined, in part, by the level of activity of glucokinase. Glucokinase activity is regulated by a glucokinase regulatory protein (RP), which is located in the nucleus. In the absence of glucose, glucokinase is partially sequestered within the nucleus, bound to RP, in an inactive form. High concentrations of fructose 6-phosphate promote the interaction of glucokinase with RP, whereas high levels of either glucose or fructose 1-phosphate (fructose 1-P) block glucokinase from binding to RP and promote the dissociation of the complex. Thus, as glucose levels rise in the cytoplasm and nucleus (e.g., because of increased blood glucose levels after a meal), there is a significant enhancement of glucose phosphorylation as glucokinase is released from the nucleus, travels to the cytoplasm, and phosphorylates glucose.

The major regulatory step for liver glycolysis is the PFK-1 step. Even under fasting conditions, the ATP concentration in the liver $(\sim 2.5 \mathrm{mM})$ is sufficiently high to inhibit PFK-1 activity. Thus, liver glycolysis is basically controlled by modulating the levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, the product of the PFK-2 reaction. As fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels increase (which will occur in the presence of insulin), the rate of glycolysis increases; when glucagon levels increase and protein kinase A is activated so that PFK-2 is phosphorylated and its kinase activity is inactive, glycolysis slows down and gluconeogenesis is enhanced (see Chapters 22 and 28).

## C. Lipid Metabolism

Long-chain fatty acids are a major fuel for the liver during periods of fasting, when they are released from adipose tissue triacylglycerols and travel to the liver as fatty acids bound to albumin. In the liver, they bind to fatty acid-binding proteins and are then activated on the outer mitochondrial membrane, the peroxisomal membrane, and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum by fatty acyl-CoA synthetases. The fatty acyl group is transferred from coenzyme A (CoA) to carnitine for transport through the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is reconverted back into fatty acyl-CoA and oxidized to acetyl-CoA in the $\beta$-oxidation spiral (see Chapter 30).

The enzymes in the pathways of fatty acid activation and $\beta$-oxidation (the synthetases, the carnitine acyl transferases, and the dehydrogenases of $\beta$-oxidation) are somewhat specific for the length of the fatty acid carbon chain. The chain-length specificity is divided into enzymes for very-long-chain fatty acids (C20 to $\sim \mathrm{C} 12$ ), medium-chain ( $\sim \mathrm{C} 12$ to C 4 ), and short-chain ( C 4 to C 2 ). The major lipids oxidized in the liver as fuels are the long-chain fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids), because these are the lipids that are synthesized in the liver, are the major lipids ingested from meat or dairy sources, and are the major form of fatty acids present in adipose tissue triacylglycerols. The liver, as well as many other tissues, uses fatty acids as fuels when the concentration of the fatty acid-albumin complex is increased in the blood.

## I. Medium-Chain-Length Fatty Acid Oxidation

The liver and certain cells in the kidney are the major sites for the oxidation of medium-chain-length fatty acids. These fatty acids usually enter the diet of infants in maternal milk as medium-chain-length triacylglycerols (MCTs). In the intestine, the MCTs are hydrolyzed by gastric lipase, bile salt-dependent lipases, and pancreatic lipase more readily than long-chain triacylglycerols. In the enterocytes, they are neither reconverted to triacylglycerols nor incorporated into chylomicrons.

Instead, they are released directly into the portal circulation (fatty acids of approximately eight-carbon chain lengths or less are water-soluble). In the liver, they diffuse through the inner mitochondrial membrane and are activated to acyl-CoA derivatives by medium-chain-length fatty acid-activating enzyme (MMFAE), a family of similar isozymes present only in liver and kidney. The medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA is then oxidized by the normal route, beginning with medium-chain-length acylCoA dehydrogenase (MCAD; see Chapter 30).

## 2. Peroxisomal Oxidation of Very-Long-Chain Fatty Acids

Peroxisomes are present in greater numbers in the liver than in other tissues. Liver peroxisomes contain the enzymes for the oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids such as C24:0 and phytanic acid, for the cleavage of the cholesterol side chain necessary for the synthesis of bile salts, for a step in the biosynthesis of ether lipids, and for several steps in arachidonic acid metabolism. Peroxisomes also contain catalase and are capable of detoxifying hydrogen peroxide.

Very-long-chain fatty acids of C20 to C26 or greater are activated to CoA derivatives by very-long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase present in the peroxisomal membrane. The very-long-chain acyl-CoA derivatives are then oxidized in liver peroxisomes to the eight-carbon octanoyl coenzyme A (octanoyl-CoA) level. In contrast to mitochondrial $\beta$-oxidation, the first enzyme in peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation introduces a double bond and generates hydrogen peroxide instead of reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD[2H]). The remainder of the cycle, however, remains the same, releasing NADH and acetyl-CoA. Peroxisomal catalase inactivates the hydrogen peroxide, and the acetyl-CoA can be used in biosynthetic pathways such as those of cholesterol and dolichol synthesis.

The octanoyl-CoA that is the end-product of peroxisomal oxidation leaves the peroxisomes and the octanoyl group is transferred through the inner mitochondrial membrane by medium-chain-length acylcarnitine transferase. In the mitochondria, it enters the regular $\beta$-oxidation pathway, beginning with MCAD.

## 3. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) play an important role in liver metabolism. These receptors obtained their name from the finding that certain agonists were able to induce the proliferation of peroxisomes in liver. These agonists included hypolipidemic agents, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, and environmental toxins. The receptors that bind these agents, the PPARs, are members of a nuclear receptor family and, when activated, stimulate new gene transcription. In the liver, the major form of PPAR regulates directly the activity of genes that are involved in fatty acid uptake and $\beta$ - and $\omega$-oxidation of fatty acids.

Although the roles of the PPARs have been discussed previously (see Section V of this text), it is worth reviewing them here. There are three major PPAR isoforms: $\alpha, \delta / \beta$, and $\gamma$. The major form found in the liver is the $\alpha$-form. Fatty acids are an endogenous ligand for PPAR $\alpha$, such that when the level of fatty acids in the circulation is increased (with a concurrent increase in the fatty acid content of hepatocytes), there is increased gene transcription for those proteins involved in regulating fatty acid metabolism (Table 44.4). Genetically altered mice have been generated that lack PPAR $\alpha$. These knockout mice exhibit no abnormal phenotype when they are fed a normal diet. When they are fasted, however, or when they are fed a high-fat diet, these mice develop severe fatty infiltration of the liver. The inability to increase the rate of fatty acid oxidation in this organ leads to excessive fatty acid buildup in the hepatocytes. It also leads to an insufficient energy supply with which to make glucose (leading to hypoglycemia) as well as an inability to produce ketone bodies. In normal fasted mice or mice fed a high-fat diet, fatty acids will eventually stimulate their own oxidation via peroxisome proliferation and by induction of other enzymes needed for their oxidation. The knockout mice cannot make these compensations.

$\Delta$Fructose I-P is produced from fructose metabolism. The major dietary source of fructose, the ingestion of which would lead to increased fructose I-P levels, is sucrose. Sucrose is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose. Thus, an elevation of fructose I-P usually indicates an elevation of glucose levels as well.

$\Delta$MCTs are important components of nutritional supplements used in patients with digestive disorders. They, therefore, can be used as an easily absorbed source of calories in patients who have a gastrointestinal disorder that may result in malabsorption of nutrients. These diseases include pancreatic insufficiency, intraluminal bile salt deficiency owing to cholestatic liver disease, biliary obstruction, ileal disease or resection, and disease that causes obstruction of intestinal lymphatics. Remember, however, that MCTs do not contain polyunsaturated fatty acids that can be used for synthesis of eicosanoids (see Chapter 3I).

$\Delta$Zellweger (cerebrohepatorenal) syndrome occurs in individuals with a rare inherited absence of peroxisomes in all tissues. Patients accumulate C26 to C38 polyenoic acids in brain tissue because of defective peroxisomal oxidation of the very-long-chain fatty acids synthesized in the brain for myelin formation. In liver, bile acid and ether lipid synthesis are affected, as is the oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids.

$\Delta$The fibrates (e.g., clofibrate) are a class of drugs that bind to PPARs to elicit changes in lipid metabolism. They are typically prescribed for individuals with elevated triglyceride levels because they increase the rate of triglyceride oxidation. This, in turn, leads to a reduction in serum triacylglycerol levels. Fibrates, through PPAR $\alpha$ stimulation, also suppress apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) synthesis and stimulate LPL activity.ApoCIII normally inhibits LPL activity, so by reducing CIII synthesis overall, LPL activity is increased.ApoCIII also blocks apolipoprotein E on intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) particles, causing the IDL particles to accumulate because they cannot be taken up by the apoE receptor in the liver. The suppression of apoCIII levels allows more IDL to be endocytosed, thereby also reducing circulating triacylglycerol levels.

Reye syndrome is characterized clinically by vomiting with signs of progressive central nervous system damage.
In addition, there are signs of hepatic injury and hypoglycemia. There is mitochondrial dysfunction, with decreased activity of hepatic mitochondrial enzymes. Hepatic coma may occur as serum ammonia levels rise. It is associated epidemiologically with the consumption of aspirin by children during a viral illness, but it may occur in the absence of exposure to salicylates. The incidence in the United States has decreased dramatically since the 1980s, when parents were made aware of the dangers of giving aspirin to children to reduce fever. Reye syndrome is not necessarily confined to children. In patients who die of this disease, the liver at autopsy shows swollen and disrupted mitochondria and extensive accumulation of lipid droplets with fatty vacuolization of cells in both the liver and the renal tubules.

## 4. Xenobiotics Metabolized as Fatty Acids

The liver uses the pathways of fatty acid metabolism to detoxify very hydrophobic and lipid-soluble xenobiotics that, like fatty acids, either have carboxylic acid groups or can be metabolized to compounds that contain carboxylic acids. Benzoate and salicylate are examples of xenobiotics that are metabolized in this way. Benzoate is naturally present in plant foods and is added to foods such as sodas as a preservative. Its structure is similar to that of salicylic acid (which is derived from the degradation of aspirin). Salicylic acid and benzoate are similar in size to medium-chain-length fatty acids and are activated to an acyl-CoA derivative by MMFAE (Fig. 44.6). The acyl group is then conjugated with glycine, which targets the compound for urinary excretion. The glycine derivatives of salicylate and benzoate are called salicylurate and hippurate, respectively. Salicylurate is the major urinary metabolite of aspirin in humans. Benzoate has been administered to treat hyperammonemia associated with congenital defects because urinary hippurate excretion tends to lower the free ammonia pool. Aspirin cannot be used for this purpose because it is toxic in the large doses required.

## 5. The Metabolism of Lipids in Liver Disease

Chronic parenchymal liver disease is associated with relatively predictable changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Some of these changes are related to a reduction in the activity of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). This plasma enzyme is synthesized and glycosylated in the liver; then, it enters the blood, where it catalyzes
![ma47039756a7](ma47039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 44.6 Benzoate and salicylate metabolism. AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CoA, coenzyme A; $P P_{i}$, pyrophosphate.

the transfer of a fatty acid from the 2-position of lecithin to the $3 \beta-\mathrm{OH}$ group of free cholesterol to produce cholesterol ester and lysolecithin. As expected, in severe parenchymal liver disease, in which LCAT activity is decreased, plasma levels of cholesterol ester are reduced and free cholesterol levels are normal or increased.

Plasma triacylglycerols are normally cleared by peripheral lipases (lipoprotein lipase [LPL] and hepatic triglyceride lipase [HTGL]). Because the activities of both LPL and HTGL are reduced in patients with hepatocellular disease, a relatively high level of plasma triacylglycerols may be found in both acute and chronic hepatitis, in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, and in patients with other diffuse hepatocellular disorders.

With low LCAT activity and the elevated triacylglycerol level described, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles have an abnormal composition. They are relatively triacylglycerol-rich and cholesterol ester-poor.

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism may be abnormal in chronic liver disease as well. For example, because the conversion of $\mathrm{HDL}_{3}$ (less antiatherosclerotic) to $\mathrm{HDL}_{2}$ (more antiatherosclerotic) is catalyzed by LCAT, the reduced activity of LCAT in patients with cirrhosis leads to a decrease in the $\mathrm{HDL}_{2} / \mathrm{HDL}_{3}$ ratio. Conversely, the conversion of $\mathrm{HDL}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{HDL}_{3}$ requires hepatic lipases. If the activity of this lipase is reduced, one would expect an elevation in the $\mathrm{HDL}_{2} / \mathrm{HDL}_{3}$ ratio. Because the $\mathrm{HDL}_{2} /$ $\mathrm{HDL}_{3}$ ratio is usually elevated in cirrhosis, the lipase deficiency appears to be the more dominant of the two mechanisms. These changes may result in an overall increase in serum total HDL levels. How this affects the efficiency of the reverse cholesterol transport mechanism and the predisposition to atherosclerosis is not fully understood.

With regard to triacylglycerol levels in patients with severe parenchymal liver disease, the hepatic production of the triacylglycerol-rich, VLDL particle is impaired. Yet, the total level of plasma triacylglycerols remains relatively normal because the LDL particle in such patients is triacylglycerol-rich, for reasons that have not been fully elucidated.

Nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels are elevated in patients with cirrhosis. This change might be expected because basal hepatic glucose output is low in these patients. As a result, more NEFA are presumably required (via increased lipolysis) to meet the fasting energy requirements of peripheral tissues.

## D. Amino Acid Metabolism in the Liver

The liver is the principal site of amino acid metabolism in humans. It essentially balances the free amino acid pool in the blood through the metabolism of amino acids supplied by the diet after a protein-containing meal and through metabolism of amino acids supplied principally by skeletal muscles during an overnight fast. In an adult who is no longer growing linearly, the total protein content of the body on a daily basis is approximately constant, so the net degradation of amino acids (either to other compounds or used for energy) is approximately equal to the amount consumed. The key points concerning hepatic amino acid metabolism are the following:

1. The liver contains all the pathways for catabolism of all of the amino acids (although its metabolism of the BCAAs is low) and can oxidize most of the carbon skeletons to carbon dioxide. A small proportion of the carbon skeletons is converted to ketone bodies. The liver also contains the pathways for converting amino acid carbon skeletons to glucose (gluconeogenesis) that can be released into the blood.
2. Because the liver is the principal site of amino acid catabolism, it also contains the urea cycle, the pathway that converts toxic ammonium ion to nontoxic urea. The urea is then excreted in the urine.
3. After a mixed or high-protein meal, the gut uses dietary aspartate, glutamate, and glutamine as fuel (during fasting, the gut uses glutamine from the blood as a major fuel). Thus, the ingested acidic amino acids do not enter the general circulation. The nitrogen from gut metabolism of these amino acids is passed to the liver as citrulline or ammonium ion via the portal vein.

(1)The level of NEFA levels in blood samples can be determined using enzyme-coupled reactions. The unknown sample is incubated with CoA and acyl-CoA synthetase, which adds the coenzyme to the NEFAs, creating acyl-CoA. The acyl-CoA produced is oxidized by acyl-CoA oxidase, which generates hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is used as a source of electrons by peroxidase to reduce a chromogenic substrate, which produces a colored reaction product. The concentration of the reaction product is determined spectrophotometrically and is directly proportional to the level of NEFA in the sample.

Unlike Amy B., whose hepatic amoebic disorder was more localized (abscesses), Jean T. had a diffuse hepatic disease, known as alcohol-induced cirrhosis (referred to historically as Laennec cirrhosis). The latter is characterized by diffuse fine scarring, a fairly uniform loss of hepatic cells, and the formation of small regenerative nodules (sometimes referred to as micronodular cirrhosis). With continued alcohol intake, fibroblasts and activated stellate cells deposit collagen at the site of persistent injury. This leads to the formation of weblike septa of connective tissue in periportal and pericentral zones. These eventually connect portal triads and central veins. With further exposure to alcohol, the liver shrinks and then becomes nodular and firm as end-stage cirrhosis develops. Unless they are successfully weaned from alcohol, these patients eventually de of liver failure. Amy B., however, can probably look forward to enjoying normal liver function after successful amebicidal therapy without evidence of residual hepatic scarring.
4. The BCAAs (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) can be used as a fuel by most cell types, including cells of the gut and skeletal muscle. After a highprotein meal, most of the BCAAs are not oxidized by the liver (because of very low activity of the BCAA transaminase) and instead enter the peripheral circulation to be used as a fuel by other tissues or for protein synthesis (these amino acids are essential amino acids). The liver does, however, take up whatever amino acids it needs to carry out its own protein synthesis.
5. Most tissues transfer the amino acid nitrogen to the liver to dispose of as urea. They, therefore, produce either alanine (from the pyruvate-glucose-alanine cycle in skeletal muscle, kidney, and intestinal mucosa) or glutamine (skeletal muscle, lungs, neural tissues) or serine (kidney), which are released into the blood and taken up by the liver.
6. The liver uses amino acids for the synthesis of proteins that it requires as well as for the synthesis of proteins to be used elsewhere. For example, the liver uses the carbon skeletons and nitrogens of amino acids for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds such as heme, purines, and pyrimidines. The amino acid precursors for these compounds are all nonessential because they can be synthesized in the liver.

## E. Amino Acid Metabolism in Liver Disease

The concentration of amino acids in the blood of patients with liver disease is often elevated. This change is, in part, attributable to a significantly increased rate of protein turnover (a general catabolic effect seen in severely ill patients) as well as to impaired amino acid uptake by the diseased liver. It is unlikely that the increased levels are the result of degradation of liver protein and the subsequent release of amino acids from the failing hepatocyte into the blood. This is true because the total protein content of the liver is only approximately 300 g . To account for the elevated amino acid levels in the blood, the entire protein content of the liver would have to be degraded within 6 to 8 hours to account for the increased protein turnover rates found. Because 18 to 20 times more protein is present in skeletal muscle (greater mass), the muscle is probably the major source of the elevated plasma levels of amino acids seen in catabolic states such as cirrhosis of the liver.

In cirrhotic patients, such as Jean T., the fasting blood $\alpha$-amino nitrogen level is elevated as a result of reduced clearance. Urea synthesis is reduced as well.

The plasma profile of amino acids in cirrhosis characteristically shows an elevation in aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine, and in free tryptophan and methionine. The latter changes may be caused by impaired hepatic use of these amino acids as well as by portosystemic shunting. Although the mechanism is not known, a reduction in fasting plasma levels of the BCAAs is also seen in cirrhotic patients. These findings, however, must be interpreted with caution because most of the free amino acid pool in humans is found in the intracellular space. Therefore, changes seen in their plasma concentrations do not necessarily reflect their general metabolic fate. Yet the elevation in aromatic amino acids and the suppression of the level of BCAAs in the blood of patients with cirrhosis have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.

## V. Diseases of the Liver

Diseases of the liver can be clinically and biochemically devastating because no other organ can compensate for the loss of the multitude of functions that the liver normally performs. Alcohol-induced liver disease has been discussed in Chapter 33. Several diseases can lead to hepatic fibrosis (see "Biochemical Comments") and cirrhosis. When this occurs to a great enough extent, liver function becomes inadequate for life. Signs and symptoms of liver disease include elevated levels of the enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the plasma (owing to hepatocyte injury or death with a consequent release of these enzymes

into the blood), jaundice (an accumulation of bilirubin in the blood caused by inefficient bilirubin glucuronidation by the liver; see Chapter 43), increased clotting times (the liver has difficulty producing clotting factors for secretion), edema (reduced albumin synthesis by the liver leads to a reduction in osmotic pressure in the blood), and hepatic encephalopathy (reduced urea cycle activity leading to excessive levels of ammonia and other toxic compounds in the central nervous system).

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

Jean T. Patients with cirrhosis of the liver who have no known genetic propensity to glucose intolerance, such as Jean T., tend to have higher blood glucose levels than do normal subjects in both fasting and fed states. The mechanisms that may increase glucose levels in the fasting state include a reduction in the metabolic clearance rate of glucose by $25 \%$ to $40 \%$ compared with normal subjects. This reduction in glucose clearance results, in part, from increased oxidation of fatty acids and ketone bodies and the consequent decrease in glucose oxidation by peripheral tissues in cirrhosis patients. This is suggested by the discovery that plasma NEFA levels are high in many patients with hepatocellular dysfunction, in part because of decreased hepatic clearance of NEFA and in part because of increased adipose tissue lipolysis. Another possible explanation for the reduction in wholebody glucose use in patients with cirrhosis relates to the finding that ketone body production is increased in some patients with cirrhosis. This could lead to enhanced use of ketone bodies for fuel by the central nervous system in such patients, thereby reducing the need for glucose oxidation by the highly metabolically active brain.

After glucose ingestion (fed state), many patients with liver disease have abnormally elevated blood glucose levels ("hepatogenous diabetes"). Using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, $60 \%$ to $80 \%$ of cirrhotic patients have varying degrees of glucose intolerance, and overt diabetes mellitus occurs 2 to 4 times as often in cirrhotics than it does in subjects without liver disease. The proposed mechanisms include a degree of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues; however, as the cirrhotic process progresses, these patients develop a marked impairment of insulin secretion as well. Although the mechanisms are not well understood, this decrease in insulin secretion leads to increased hepatic glucose output (leading to fasting hyperglycemia) and reduced suppression of hepatic glucose output after meals, leading to postprandial hyperglycemia as well. If the patient has an underlying genetic predisposition to diabetes mellitus, the superimposition of the mechanisms outlined previously will lead to an earlier and more significant breakdown in glucose tolerance in these specific patients.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

Hepatic Fibrosis. Extensive and progressive fibrosis of the hepatic parenchyma leads to cirrhosis of the liver, a process that has many causes. The development of fibrosis requires the activities of hepatic stellate cells, cytokines, proteases, and protease inhibitors.

A major change that occurs when fibrosis is initiated is that the normally "sparse" or "leaky" basement membrane between the endothelial cell and the hepatocyte is replaced with a high-density membrane containing fibrillar collagen. This occurs because of both increased synthesis of a different type of collagen than is normally produced and a reduction in the turnover rate of existing extracellular matrix components.

The supportive tissues of the normal liver contain an extracellular matrix that, among other proteins, includes type IV collagen (which does not form fibers), glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. After a sustained insult to the liver, a threefold to eightfold increase occurs in extracellular matrix components, some of which contain fibril-producing collagen (types I and III), glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. The accumulation of these fibril-producing compounds leads to a loss of endothelial

cell fenestrations and, therefore, a loss of the normal sievelike function of the basement membranes. These changes interfere with normal transmembrane metabolic exchanges between the blood and hepatocytes.

The hepatic stellate cell is the source of the increased and abnormal collagen production. These cells are activated by growth factors whose secretion is induced by injury to the hepatocytes or endothelial cells. Growth factors involved in cellular activation include transforming growth factor $\beta_{1}$ (which is derived from the endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and platelets) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) from platelets. The release of PDGF stimulates stellate cell proliferation and, in the process, increases their synthesis and release of extracellular matrix materials and remodeling enzymes. These enzymes include matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs as well as converting (activating) enzymes. This cascade leads to the degradation of the normal extracellular matrix and replacement with a much denser and more rigid type of matrix material. These changes are in part the result of an increase in the activity of tissue inhibitors of MMPs for the new collagen relative to the original collagen in the extracellular matrix.

One consequence of the increasing stiffness of the hepatic vascular channels through which hepatic blood must flow is a greater resistance to the free flow of blood through the liver as a whole. Resistance to intrahepatic blood flow is also increased by a loss of vascular endothelial cell fenestrations, loss of free space between the endothelial cells and the hepatocytes (space of Disse), and even loss of vascular channels per se. This increased vascular resistance leads to an elevation of intrasinusoidal fluid pressure. When this intrahepatic (portal) hypertension reaches a critical threshold, the shunting of portal blood away from the liver (portosystemic shunting) contributes further to hepatic dysfunction. If the portal hypertension cannot be reduced, portal blood will continue to bypass the liver and return to the heart through the normally low-pressure esophageal veins. When this increasing intraesophageal venous pressure becomes severe enough, the walls of these veins thin dramatically and expand to form varices, which may burst suddenly, causing life-threatening esophageal variceal hemorrhage. This is a potentially fatal complication of cirrhosis of the liver.

The liver consists of a variety of cell types, each with a different function. Hepatocytes carry out the bulk of the metabolic pathways of the liver. Endothelial cells line the sinusoids and release growth factors. Kupffer cells are tissue macrophages that protect the liver from gut-derived particulate materials and bacterial products.
Stellate cells store vitamin A and regulate the contractility of the sinusoids. Pit cells are liver-associated lymphocytes, which act as a defense mechanism against potentially toxic agents.
The liver is the body's central receiving and recycling center:
Inactivation and detoxification of xenobiotic compounds and metabolites via cytochrome P450 systems
Regulation of blood glucose levels
Synthesis and export of cholesterol and triglyceride via VLDL
Synthesis and excretion of urea
Formation of ketone bodies from fatty acid oxidation
Nucleotide biosynthesis
Synthesis of blood proteins
The liver highly coordinates its use of fuels versus that of the body. This is, in part, controlled by modulation of the activity of PPAR $\alpha$.
Liver disease affects amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, leading to abnormalities in virtually all aspects of metabolism.
Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 44.5.

1. The answer is C. Grapefruit juice contains a component that blocks CYP3A4 activity, which is the cytochrome P450 isozyme that converts statins to an inactive form. If the degradative enzyme is inhibited, statin levels rise above normal, accelerating their damage of muscle cells. Grapefruit juice does not affect hepatic uptake of the drug (thus, A is incorrect), nor does it accelerate statin metabolism (thus, B is also incorrect). Although HMGCoA reductase is the target of the statins, grapefruit juice neither up- or downregulates the amount of enzyme present in the cell (thus, D and E are incorrect).
2. The answer is D. Cytochrome P450 enzymes oxidize their substrates, transferring the electrons to molecular oxygen to form water and a hydroxylated product. The enzymes require NADPH (thus, B is incorrect) and are located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (thus, A is incorrect). Oxygen does not induce all cytochrome P450 members (although it is a substrate for all of these isozymes; thus, C is incorrect), and although these enzymes proceed through a free-radical mechanism, the final products are not radicals (thus, E is incorrect).
3. The answer is D. Hepatocellular disease reduces protein synthesis in the liver, which leads to reduced levels of both LCAT and HTGL being produced (thus, A and C are incorrect). Because LCAT activity is reduced, cholesterol ester formation in circulating particles is reduced (thus, B is incorrect). Because a diseased liver has trouble synthesizing glucose, fatty acid release from
4. A person with chronic alcoholism has developed cirrhosis of the liver. The liver is filled with a type of collagen that interferes with appropriate liver function. Under these conditions, which liver cell type has been stimulated to produce fibril-producing collagen?
A. Kupffer cells
B. Stellate cells
C. Endothelial cells
D. Hepatocytes
E. Pit cells
adipocytes is increased to provide energy (thus, E is incorrect). Serum triacylglycerol levels are increased as a result of the reduced HTGL activity; LPL activity is also reduced in liver disease.
5. The answer is D. Ethanol induces the CYP2E1 system, which converts acetaminophen to NAPQI, a toxic intermediate. Under normal conditions (noninduced levels of CYP2E1), the conversion of acetaminophen to NAPQI results in low levels of NAPQI being produced, which can easily be detoxified. However, when CYP2E1 is induced, the excessive levels of NAPQI being produced when acetaminophen is taken in greater than recommended amounts cannot be readily detoxified, and NAPQI binds to proteins and inactivates them, leading to hepatocyte death. The toxicity is not related to blood glucose levels (thus, A and C are incorrect) or to secretion of VLDL (thus, E is incorrect). Ethanol does not inhibit the detoxification of acetaminophen per se but rather accelerates one of its potential metabolic fates (thus, B is also incorrect).
6. The answer is C. The glucokinase regulatory protein regulates glucokinase expression at a posttranscriptional level. A lack of appropriate regulation of the regulatory protein activity results in less glucokinase being present in the cell and a reduced overall rate of glucose phosphorylation by the liver. This results in less circulating glucose being removed by the liver and a longer clearance time for glucose levels to return to fasting levels.

A decrease in the glucokinase $K_{\mathrm{m}}$, or an increase in the $V_{\text {max }}$ for glucokinase, would lead to the opposite effect, enhanced glucose phosphorylation by the liver and an accelerated clearance from the circulation (thus, A and B are incorrect). The liver does not express hexokinase, so D and E are also incorrect.
6. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. The large increase in circulating amino acid levels in an individual with cirrhosis is the result of two things: reduced uptake of amino acids by the liver and enhanced muscle protein turnover owing to the catabolic state of the patient. Liver contains much less protein than muscle, and the entire liver would have to have its protein content degraded in order to provide the high levels of amino acids seen in the circulation under these conditions. In addition, red blood cells, enterocytes, and circulating proteins in the blood do not provide for sufficient protein turnover for the large increase in free amino acids seen when the liver is not functioning.
7. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The cofactor required for the phase I reactions is NADPH, which is derived from either malic enzyme (a minor pathway) or the oxidative reactions of the HMP shunt pathway (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase). For each glucose 6-phosphate entering these oxidative reactions, two molecules of NADPH are produced, along with carbon dioxide and ribulose 5-phosphate. Neither glycolysis nor the TCA cycle produce NADPH (both will produce NADH). Fatty acid biosynthesis requires NADPH for the two reduction reactions along the pathway, whereas fatty acid oxidation generates NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ but not NADPH.
8. The answer is $\mathbf{B}$. The patient is exhibiting signs of liver failure (release of prealbumin, AST, and ALT) as
the result of many years of drinking. The yellow sclera are signs of jaundice, owing to bilirubin precipitation. Normally, bilirubin would be glucuronylated (using UDP-glucuronic acid) to increase its solubility, via a reaction carried out in the liver. With the failing liver, however, this reaction efficiency is reduced, and more unconjugated bilirubin (which is less soluble than the conjugated form) is found in circulation. The increased levels of free bilirubin are not caused by alterations in either fatty acid or amino acid metabolism within the liver. It is also not related to VLDL production or urea biosynthesis.
9. The answer is $\mathbf{F}$. ALT and AST, along with transaminases, are released by damaged hepatocytes. Elevated bilirubin causes jaundice, and a damaged liver cannot process bilirubin appropriately. The damaged liver has trouble synthesizing proteins, including serum albumin. Decreased blood albumin levels lead to low intravascular osmotic pressure and leakage of fluid into interstitial spaces, causing edema. The liver is the site of urea synthesis, and reduced urea synthesis leads to elevated blood ammonia levels. The liver also produces the blood clotting factors, so a damaged liver produces a reduced amount of clotting factors, leading to increased clotting time and bleeding.
10. The answer is $\mathbf{B}$. In cirrhosis, stellate cells increase their synthesis of extracellular matrix components including fibril-producing collagen types I and III instead of type IV collagen, which does not form fibrils. The synthesis of the fibril-forming collagen leads to a loss of endothelial cell fenestrations and continuing fibrosis, eventually leading to cirrhosis. The other cells listed do not produce hepatic connective tissue and extracellular matrix material.

# Metabolism of Muscle at Rest and during Exercise 

There are three types of muscle cells: smooth, skeletal, and cardiac. In all types of muscle, contraction occurs via an actin/myosin sliding filament system, which is regulated by oscillations in intracellular calcium levels.

Muscle cells use stored glycogen and circulating glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids as energy sources. Muscle glycolysis is regulated differently from the liver, with the key difference being the regulation of phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK-2). Muscle PFK-2 is not inhibited by phosphorylation; cardiac PFK-2 is actually activated by phosphorylation by several protein kinases. Thus, under conditions in which liver PFK-2 is inactive, and glycolysis is running slowly, muscle glycolysis is either unaffected, or even stimulated, depending on the isoform of PFK-2 being expressed.

Although muscle cells do not synthesize fatty acids, they do contain an isozyme of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC-2) to regulate the rate of fatty acid oxidation. ACC-2 produces malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA), which inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI), thereby blocking fatty acid entry into the mitochondria. Muscle also contains malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of malonyl-CoA to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and carbon dioxide. Thus, both the synthesis and degradation of malonyl-CoA is carefully regulated in muscle cells to balance glucose and fatty acid oxidation. Both allosteric and covalent means of regulation are used. Citrate activates ACC-2, and phosphorylation of ACC-2 by the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase inhibits ACC-2 activity. Phosphorylation of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activates the enzyme, further enhancing fatty acid oxidation when energy levels are low.

Muscles use creatine phosphate to store high-energy bonds. Creatine is derived from arginine and glycine in the kidney, and the guanidinoacetate formed is methylated (using S-adenosylmethionine) in the liver to form creatine. The enzyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK) then catalyzes the reversible transfer of a highenergy phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to creatine, forming creatine phosphate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Creatine phosphate is unstable and spontaneously cyclizes to form creatinine, which is excreted in the urine. The spontaneous production of creatinine occurs at a constant rate and is proportional to body muscle mass. Thus, the amount of creatinine excreted each day (the creatinine clearance rate) is constant and can be used as an indicator of the normalcy of the excretory function of the kidneys.

Skeletal muscle cells can be subdivided into type I and type II fibers. Type I fibers are slow-twitch fibers that use primarily oxidative metabolism for energy, whereas the type II fibers (fast-twitch) use glycolysis as their primary energygenerating pathway.

Glucose transport into muscle cells can be stimulated during exercise because of the activity of the AMPK. Fatty acid uptake into exercising muscle is dependent on the levels of circulating fatty acids, which are increased by epinephrine release.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Renee F., a 9-year-old girl, complained of a severe pain in her throat and difficulty in swallowing. She had chills, sweats, headache, and a fever of $102.4^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. When her symptoms persisted for several days, her mother took her to her pediatrician, who found diffuse erythema (redness) in her posterior pharynx (throat), with yellow exudates (patches) on her tonsils. Large, tender lymph nodes were present under her jaw on both sides of her neck. A throat culture was taken, and therapy with penicillin was begun.

Although the sore throat and fever improved, 10 days after the onset of the original infection, Renee's eyes and legs became swollen and her urine suddenly turned the color of cola. Her blood pressure was elevated. Protein and red blood cells were found in her urine. Her serum creatinine level (see Chapter 3 for how creatinine is measured) was elevated at $1.8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range, 0.3 to 0.7 for a child). Because the throat culture grew group A $\beta$-hemolytic streptococci, the doctor ordered an antistreptolysin O titer, which was positive. As a result, a diagnosis of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) was made. Supportive therapy, including bed rest and treatment for hypertension, was initiated.

## I. Muscle Cell Types

Muscle consists of three different types: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac (Fig. 45.1). The metabolism of each is similar, but the functions of the muscles are quite different.

## A. Skeletal Muscle

Skeletal muscles are those muscles that are attached to bone and facilitate the movement of the skeleton. Skeletal muscles are found in pairs, which are responsible for opposing, coordinated directions of motion on the skeleton. The muscles appear striated under the microscope and are controlled voluntarily (you think about moving a specific muscle group, and then it happens).

Skeletal muscle cells are long, cylindrical fibers that run the length of the muscle. The fibers are multinucleated because of cell fusion during embryogenesis. The cell membrane surrounding the fibers is called the sarcolemma, and the sarcoplasm is the intracellular milieu, which contains the proteins, organelles, and contractile apparatus of the cell. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is analogous to the endoplasmic reticulum in other cell types and is an internal membrane system that runs throughout the length of the muscle fiber. Another membrane structure, the transverse tubules (T-tubules), are thousands of invaginations of the sarcolemma that tunnel from the surface toward the center of the muscle fiber to make contact with the terminal cisterns of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Because the T-tubules are open to the outside of the muscle fiber and are filled with extracellular fluid, the muscle action potential that propagates along the surface of the muscle fiber's sarcolemma travels into the T-tubules and to the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

The striations in skeletal muscle are attributable to the presence and organization of myofibrils in the cells. Myofibrils are threadlike structures consisting of thin and thick filaments. The contractile proteins actin and myosin are contained within the filaments-myosin in the thick filaments and actin in the thin filaments. The sliding of these filaments relative to each other, using myosin-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis as an energy source, allows for the contraction and relaxation of the muscle (see Fig. 20.4).

Muscle fibers can be classified as either fast-twitch or slow-twitch. The slow-twitch fibers, or type I fibers (also called slow-oxidative fibers), contain large amounts of mitochondria and myoglobin (giving them a red color), use respiration and oxidative phosphorylation for energy, and are relatively resistant

$\square$Damaged muscle cells release myoglobin, which can be observed clinically as a reddish tint to the urine. The primary measurement for myoglobin is via a sandwich technique immunoassay. The primary antibody is linked to an insoluble support, whereas the second antibody is linked to alkaline phosphatase. Using a fluorescent substrate for the phosphatase allows low levels of myoglobin to be detected. If high in the urine, muscle damage and potential renal failure could be the culprits.

$\square$Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by the absence of the protein dystrophin, which is a structural protein located in the sarcolemma. Dystrophin is required to maintain the integrity of the sarcolemma, and when it is absent, there is a loss of muscle function, which is caused by breakdown of the sarcolemma. The gene is X-linked, and mutations that lead to Duchenne muscular dystrophy generally result from large deletions of the gene, such that dystrophin is absent from the membrane. Becker muscular dystrophy, a milder form of disease, is caused by point mutations in the dystrophin gene. In Becker muscular dystrophy, dystrophin is present in the sarcolemma but in a mutated form.

| TYPE I FIBERS | TYPE IIA | TYPE IIB |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Slow-twitch (slow speed of contraction) | Intermediate-twitch (fast speed of contraction) | Fast-twitch (fast speed of contraction) |

to fatigue. Compared with fast-twitch fibers, their glycogen content is low. The slow-twitch fibers develop force slowly but maintain contractions longer than fast-twitch muscles.

The fast-twitch fibers, or type II, can be subdivided as type IIa or type IIb. Type IIb fibers (also called fast-glycolytic fibers) have few mitochondria and low levels of myoglobin (hence, they appear white). They are rich in glycogen and use glycogenolysis and glycolysis as their primary energy source. These muscles are prone to fatigue because continued reliance on glycolysis to produce ATP leads to an increase in lactic acid levels, resulting in a drop in the intracellular pH . As the pH drops, the ability of the muscle to produce ATP also diminishes. However, fasttwitch muscle can develop greater force than slow-twitch muscle, so contractions occur more rapidly. Type IIa fibers (also called fast-oxidative glycolytic fibers) have properties of both type I and IIb fibers and thus display functional characteristics of both fiber types. The properties of types I, IIa, and IIb fibers are summarized in Table 45.1.

Muscles are a mixture of the different fiber types, but depending on the function, a muscle may have a preponderance of one fiber type over another. Type I fibers are found in postural muscles such as the psoas in the back musculature or the soleus in the leg. The ratio of type I to type II varies with the muscle. The triceps, which functions phasically, has $32.6 \%$ type I, whereas the soleus, which functions tonically, has $87.7 \%$ type I. Type II fibers are more prevalent in the large muscles of the limbs that are responsible for sudden, powerful movements. Extraocular muscles would also have more of these fibers than type I.

## B. Smooth Muscle Cells

Smooth muscle cells are found in the digestive system, blood vessels, bladder, airways, and uterus. The cells have a spindle shape with a central nucleus (see Fig. 45.1B). The designation smooth refers to the fact that these cells, which contain a single nucleus, display no striations under the microscope. The contraction of

smooth muscle is controlled involuntarily (the cells contract and relax without any conscious attempt to have them do so; examples of smooth muscle activity include moving food along the digestive tract, altering the diameter of the blood vessels, and expelling urine from the bladder). In contrast to skeletal muscle, these cells have the ability to maintain tension for extended periods, and do so efficiently, with a low use of energy.

## C. Cardiac Muscle Cells

The cardiac cells are similar to skeletal muscle in that they are striated (contain fibers), but like smooth muscle cells, they are regulated involuntarily (we do not have to think about making our heart beat). The cells are quadrangular in shape (see Fig. 45.1C) and form a network with multiple other cells through tight membrane junctions and gap junctions. The multicellular contacts allow the cells to act as a common unit and to contract and relax synchronously. Cardiac muscle cells are designed for endurance and consistency. They depend on aerobic metabolism for their energy needs because they contain many mitochondria and very little glycogen. These cells thus generate only a small amount of their energy from glycolysis using glucose derived from glycogen. A reduced flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle may lead to a myocardial infarction (heart attack). The amount of ATP that can be generated by glycolysis alone is not sufficient to meet the energy requirements of the contracting heart.

## II. Neuronal Signals to Muscle

For an extensive review of how muscle contracts or a detailed view of the signaling to allow muscle contraction, consult a medical physiology book. Only a brief overview is presented here.

The nerve-muscle cell junction is called the neuromuscular junction (Fig. 45.2). When appropriately stimulated, the nerve cell releases acetylcholine at the junction, which binds to acetylcholine receptors on the muscle membrane. This binding stimulates the opening of sodium channels on the sarcolemma. The massive influx of sodium ions results in the generation of an action potential in the sarcolemma at the edges of the motor end plate of the neuromuscular junction. The action potential sweeps across the surface of the muscle fiber and down the transverse tubules to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, where it initiates the release
![ma49039756a7](ma49039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 45.2 The neuromuscular junction. When they are stimulated appropriately, the synaptic vesicles, containing acetylcholine, fuse with the axonal membrane and release acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. The acetylcholine binds to its receptors on the muscle cells, which initiate signaling for muscle contraction.

The ryanodine receptors are calcium release channels found in the endoplasmic reticulum and sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells. One type of receptor can be activated by a depolarization signal (depolarization-induced calcium release). Another receptor type is activated by calcium ions (calcium-induced calcium release). The proteins received their name because they bind ryanodine, a toxin obtained from the stem and roots of the plant Ryania speciosa. Ryanodine inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and acts as a paralytic agent. It was first used commercially in insecticides.

![ma50039756a7](ma50039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 45.3 Events leading to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release in skeletal muscle. (I) Acetylcholine, released at the synaptic cleft, binds to acetylcholine receptors on the sarcolemma, leading to a change of conformation of the receptors so that they now act as an ion pore. This allows sodium to enter the cell and potassium to leave. (2) The membrane depolarization that results from these ion movements is transmitted throughout the muscle fiber by the T-tubule system. (3) A receptor in the T-tubules (the dihydropyridine receptor [DHPR]) is activated by membrane depolarization (a voltagegated activation) so that activated DHPR binds physically to and activates the ryanodine receptor in the SR (depolarization-induced calcium release). (4) The activation of the ryanodine receptor, which is a calcium channel, leads to calcium release from the SR into the sarcoplasm. In cardiac muscle, activation of DHPR leads to calcium release from the T-tubules, and this small calcium release is responsible for the activation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (calcium-induced calcium release) to release large amounts of calcium into the sarcoplasm.

Acetylcholine levels in the neuromuscular junction are rapidly reduced by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Several nerve-gas poisons act to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (such as sarin and $V X$ ), so that muscles are continuously stimulated to contract. This leads to blurred vision, bronchoconstriction, seizures, respiratory arrest, and death. The poisons are covalent modifiers of acetylcholinesterase; therefore, recovery from exposure to such poisons requires the synthesis of new enzyme. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which act reversibly (i.e., they do not form covalent bonds with the enzyme), are used to treat dementia.
of calcium from its lumen, via the ryanodine receptor (Fig. 45.3). The calcium ion binds to troponin, resulting in a conformational change in the troponintropomyosin complexes so that they move away from the myosin-binding sites on the actin. When the binding site becomes available, the myosin head attaches to the myosin-binding site on the actin. The binding is followed by a conformational change (pivoting) in the myosin head, which shortens the sarcomere. After the pivoting, ATP binds the myosin head, which detaches from the actin and is available to bind another myosin-binding site on the actin. As long as calcium ion and ATP remain available, the myosin heads will repeat this cycle of attachment, pivoting, and detachment (Fig. 45.4). This movement requires ATP, and when ATP levels are low (such as occurs during ischemia), the ability of the muscle to relax or contract is compromised. As the calcium release channel closes, the calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum against its concentration gradient using the energy-requiring protein sarcoplasmic reticulum $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ATPase (SERCA), and contraction stops. This basic process occurs in all muscle cell types, with some slight variations between cell types.

FIGURE 45.4 An overview of muscle contraction. A. Muscle contraction. During muscle contraction, the myosin head binds to the actin thin filament. Pivoting of the myosin head toward the center of the sarcomere pulls the Z-lines closer together, with subsequent shortening of the sarcomere. B. A closer look at myosin-actin interactions. (1) A resting sarcomere. The troponin-tropomyosin complex is blocking the myosin-binding sites on the actin. The myosin head is already energized to power a contraction. (2) Exposure of the active site. After calcium binding to troponin, a conformational change in the troponin molecule pulls the troponin away from the binding site. (3) Cross-bridge attachment. Once the binding sites on the actin are exposed, the myosin head binds to it. (4) Myosin head pivoting. After cross-bridge attachment, the energy stored in the myosin head is released, and the myosin head pivots toward the center of the sarcomere (power stroke). Now the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate bound to the myosin head are released. (5) Detachment of the cross-bridge. Now a molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binds to the myosin head with simultaneous detachment of the myosin head from the binding site on the actin molecule. (6) Reactivation of the myosin head. The ATPase activity of the myosin head hydrolyzes the ATP into ADP and phosphate. The energy released from the hydrolysis of this high-energy bond is used to reenergize the myosin head, and the entire cycle can be repeated as long as calcium is present and there are sufficient ATP reserves. $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.

# III. Glycolysis and Fatty Acid Metabolism in Muscle Cells 

The pathways of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation in muscle are the same, as has been described previously (see Chapters 22 and 30). The difference between muscles and other tissues is how these pathways are regulated.

PFK-2 is negatively regulated by phosphorylation in the liver (the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation is the cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP]-dependent protein kinase). However, in skeletal muscle, PFK-2 is not regulated by phosphorylation. This is because the skeletal muscle isozyme of PFK-2 lacks the regulatory serine residue, which is phosphorylated in the liver. However, the cardiac isozyme of PFK-2 is phosphorylated and activated by a kinase cascade initiated by insulin. This allows the heart to activate glycolysis and to use blood glucose when blood glucose levels are elevated. The AMPK also activates cardiac PFK-2 (kinase activity) as a signal that energy is low.

Fatty acid uptake by muscle requires the participation of fatty acid-binding proteins and the usual enzymes of fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acyl coenzyme A (fatty acyl-CoA) uptake into the mitochondria is controlled by malonyl-CoA, which is produced by an isozyme of ACC-2 (the ACC-1 isozyme is found in liver and adipose tissue cytosol and is used for fatty acid biosynthesis). ACC-2 (a mitochondrial protein, linked to CPTI in the outer mitochondrial membrane) is inhibited by phosphorylation by the AMPK so that when energy levels are low, the levels of malonyl-CoA drop, allowing fatty acid oxidation by the mitochondria. In addition, muscle cells also contain the enzyme malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, which is activated by phosphorylation by the AMPK. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase converts malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA, thereby relieving the inhibition of CPTI and stimulating fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 45.5). Muscle cells do not synthesize fatty acids; the presence of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in muscle is exclusively for regulatory purposes. Mice that have been bred to lack ACC-2 have a $50 \%$ reduction of fat stores compared with control mice. This was shown to be attributable to a $30 \%$ increase in skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation resulting from dysregulation of CPTI, brought about by the lack of malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPTI.
![ma52039756a7](ma52039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 45.5 Regulation of fatty acyl coenzyme A (fatty acyl-CoA) entry into muscle mitochondria. (I) Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase-2 (ACC-2) converts acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) to malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA), which inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI), thereby blocking fatty acyl-CoA entry into the mitochondria. (2) However, as energy levels drop, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels rise because of the activity of the adenylate kinase reaction. (3) The increase in AMP levels activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates and inactivates ACC-2 and also phosphorylates and activates malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCoADC). The decarboxylase converts malonylCoA to acetyl-CoA, thereby relieving the inhibition of CPTI and allowing fatty acyl-CoA entry into the mitochondria. This allows the muscle to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via the oxidation of fatty acids.

## IV. Fuel Use in Cardiac Muscle

## A. Normal Conditions

The heart uses primarily fatty acids ( $60 \%$ to $80 \%$ ), lactate, and glucose ( $20 \%$ to $40 \%$ ) as its energy sources. Ninety-eight percent of cardiac ATP is generated by oxidative means; $2 \%$ is derived from glycolysis. The lactate used by the heart is taken up by a monocarboxylate transporter in the cell membrane that is also used for the transport of ketone bodies. However, ketone bodies are not a preferred fuel for the heart; the heart prefers to use fatty acids.

Lactate is generated by red blood cells and working skeletal muscle. When the lactate is used by the heart, it is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, following the pathway lactate to pyruvate, pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA oxidation in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. An alternative fate for lactate is its use in the reactions of the Cori cycle in the liver.

Glucose transport into the cardiocyte occurs via both GLUT 1 and GLUT 4 transporters, although approximately $90 \%$ of the transporters are GLUT 4. Insulin stimulates an increase in the number of GLUT 4 transporters in the cardiac cell membrane, as does myocardial ischemia. This ischemia-induced increase in GLUT 4 transporter number is additive to the effect of insulin on the translocation of GLUT 4 transporters to the plasma membrane.

Fatty acid uptake into cardiac muscle is similar to that for other muscle cell types and requires fatty acid-binding proteins and CPTI for transfer into the mitochondria. Fatty acid oxidation in cardiac muscle cells is regulated by altering the activities of ACC-2 and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Under conditions in which ketone bodies are produced, fatty acid levels in the plasma are also elevated. Because the heart preferentially burns fatty acids as a fuel rather than the ketone bodies produced by the liver, the ketone bodies are spared for use by the nervous system.

## B. Ischemic Conditions

When blood flow to the heart is interrupted, the heart switches to anaerobic metabolism. The rate of glycolysis increases, but the accumulation of protons (via lactate formation) is detrimental to the heart. Ischemia also increases the levels of free fatty acids in the blood and, surprisingly, when oxygen is reintroduced to the heart, the high rate of fatty acid oxidation in the heart is detrimental to the recovery of the damaged heart cells. Fatty acid oxidation occurs so rapidly that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) accumulates in the mitochondria, leading to a reduced rate of NADH shuttle activity, an increased cytoplasmic NADH level, and lactate formation, which generates more protons. In addition, fatty acid oxidation increases the levels of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, which inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase, leading to cytoplasmic pyruvate accumulation and lactate production. As lactate production increases and the intracellular pH of the heart drops, it is more difficult to maintain ion gradients across the sarcolemma. ATP hydrolysis is required to repair these gradients, which are essential for heart function. However, the use of ATP for gradient repair reduces the amount of ATP available for the heart to use in contraction, which, in turn, compromises the ability of the heart to recover from the ischemic event.

## V. Fuel Use in Skeletal Muscle

Skeletal muscles use many fuels to generate ATP. The most abundant immediate source of ATP is creatine phosphate. ATP also can be generated from glycogen stores, either anaerobically (generating lactate) or aerobically, in which case pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA for oxidation via the TCA cycle. All human skeletal muscles have some mitochondria and thus are capable of fatty acid and ketone body

0A class of drugs known as partial fatty acid oxidation ( $p F O X$ ) inhibitors has been developed to reduce the extensive fatty acid oxidation in heart after an ischemic episode. The reduction in fatty acid oxidation induced by the drug will allow glucose oxidation to occur and reduce lactate buildup in the damaged heart muscle. An example of a pFOX is trimetazidine (TMZ), which partially inhibits mitochondrial long-chain $\beta$-ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase (the enzyme that catalyzes the release of acetyl-CoA from the oxidized fatty acid chain). It can be used to decrease symptoms of angina with chronic coronary artery disease. Other possible targets of such drugs, which have yet to be developed, include ACC-2, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, and CPTI.

oxidation. Skeletal muscles are also capable of completely oxidizing the carbon skeletons of alanine, aspartate, glutamate, valine, leucine, and isoleucine, but not other amino acids. Each of these fuel oxidation pathways plays a particular role in skeletal muscle metabolism.

# A. ATP and Creatine Phosphate 

ATP is not a good choice as a molecule to store in quantity for energy reserves. Many reactions are allosterically activated or inhibited by ATP levels, especially those that generate energy. Muscle cells solve this problem by storing high-energy phosphate bonds in the form of creatine phosphate. When energy is required, creatine phosphate donates a phosphate to ADP, to regenerate ATP for muscle contraction (Fig. 45.6).
![ma53039756a7](ma53039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 45.6 The synthesis of creatine and the generation of creatinine. The creatine phosphokinase reaction transfers a high-energy bond from ATP to creatine, conserving the high-energy bond. The high-energy bond is the unusual nitrogen-phosphate bond, as indicated by the red squiggle. Creatine is synthesized from arginine, glycine, and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The synthesis originates in the kidney and is completed in the liver. Creatine phosphate (and creatine) spontaneously cyclize, forming creatinine, which is excreted in the urine. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $P_{\mathrm{o}}$, inorganic phosphate.

Creatine synthesis begins in the kidney and is completed in the liver. In the kidney, glycine combines with arginine to form guanidinoacetate. In this reaction, the guanidinium group of arginine (the group that also forms urea) is transferred to glycine, and the remainder of the arginine molecule is released as ornithine. Guanidinoacetate then travels to the liver, where it is methylated by $S$-adenosylmethionine to form creatine (see Fig. 45.6).

The creatine formed is released from the liver and travels through the bloodstream to other tissues, particularly brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, where it reacts with ATP to form the high-energy compound creatine phosphate (see Fig. 45.6). This reaction, catalyzed by creatine phosphokinase (CK, also abbreviated as CPK), is reversible. Therefore, cells can use creatine phosphate to regenerate ATP.

Creatine phosphate serves as a small reservoir of high-energy phosphate that can readily regenerate ATP from ADP. As a result, it plays a particularly important role in muscle during exercise. It also carries high-energy phosphate from mitochondria, where ATP is synthesized, to myosin filaments, where ATP is used for muscle contraction.

Creatine phosphate is an unstable compound. It spontaneously cyclizes, forming creatinine (see Fig. 45.6). Creatinine cannot be further metabolized and is excreted in the urine. The amount of creatinine excreted each day is constant and depends on body muscle mass. Therefore, it can be used as a gauge for determining the amounts of other compounds excreted in the urine and as an indicator of renal excretory function. The daily volume of urine is determined by such factors as the volume of blood reaching the renal glomeruli and the amount of renal tubular fluid reabsorbed from the tubular urine back into the interstitial space of the kidneys over time. At any given moment, the concentration of a compound in a single urine specimen does not give a good indication of the total amount that is being excreted on a daily basis. However, if the concentration of the compound is divided by the concentration of creatinine, the result provides a better indication of the true excretion rate.

## B. Fuel Use at Rest

Muscle fuel use at rest is dependent on the serum levels of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. If blood glucose and amino acids are elevated, glucose will be converted to glycogen, and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism will be high. Fatty acids will be used for acetyl-CoA production and will satisfy the energy needs of the muscle under these conditions.

There is a balance between glucose oxidation and fatty acid oxidation, which is regulated by citrate. When the muscle cell has adequate energy, citrate leaves the mitochondria and activates ACC-2, which produces malonyl-CoA. The malonyl-CoA inhibits CPTI, thereby reducing fatty acid oxidation by the muscle. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase is also inactive because the AMPK is not active in the resting state. Thus, the muscle regulates its oxidation of glucose and fatty acids in part through monitoring of cytoplasmic citrate levels.

## C. Fuel Use during Starvation

As blood glucose levels drop, insulin levels drop. This reduces the levels of GLUT 4 transporters in the muscle membrane, and glucose use by muscle drops significantly. This conserves glucose for use by the nervous system and red blood cells. In cardiac muscle, PFK-2 is phosphorylated and activated by insulin. The lack of insulin results in a reduced use of glucose by these cells as well. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is inhibited by the high levels of acetyl-CoA and NADH being produced by fatty acid oxidation.

Fatty acids become the muscle's preferred fuel under starvation conditions. The AMPK is active because of lower-than-normal ATP levels, ACC-2 is inhibited, and mal-onyl-CoA decarboxylase is activated, thereby retaining full activity of CPTI. The lack of glucose reduces the glycolytic rate, and glycogen synthesis does not occur because of the inactivation of glycogen synthase by epinephrine-stimulated phosphorylation.

(1)Each kidney normally contains approximately 1 million glomerular units. Each unit is supplied by arterial blood via the renal arteries and acts as a "filter." Metabolites such as creatinine leave the blood by passing through pores or channels in the glomerular capillaries and enter the fluid within the proximal kidney tubule for eventual excretion in the urine. When they are functionally intact, these glomerular tissues are impermeable to all but the smallest of proteins. When they are acutely inflamed; however, this barrier function is lost to varying degrees, and albumin and other proteins may appear in the urine.

The marked inflammatory changes in the glomerular capillaries that accompany PSGN significantly reduce the flow of blood to the filtering surfaces of these vessels. As a result, creatinine, urea, and other circulating metabolites that are filtered into the urine at a normal rate (the glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) in the absence of kidney disease now fail to reach the filters, and, therefore, they accumulate in the plasma. These changes explain Renee F.'s laboratory profile during her acute inflammatory glomerular disease (glomerulonephritis). In most patients, prognosis is excellent, although in some patients, recovery may not occur. Such patients may progress to chronic renal insufficiency and even renal failure.

Recall that in prolonged starvation, muscle proteolysis is induced (in part by cortisol release) for gluconeogenesis by the liver. This does not, however, alter the use of fatty acids by the muscle for its own energy needs under these conditions.

# D. Fuel Use during Exercise 

The rate of ATP use in skeletal muscle during exercise can be as much as 100 times greater than that in resting skeletal muscles; thus, the pathways of fuel oxidation must be rapidly activated during exercise to respond to the much greater demand for ATP. ATP and creatine phosphate would be rapidly used up if they were not continuously regenerated. The synthesis of ATP occurs from glycolysis (either aerobic or anaerobic) and oxidative phosphorylation (which requires a constant supply of oxygen).

Anaerobic glycolysis is especially important as a source of ATP in three conditions. The first is during the initial period of exercise, before exercise-stimulated increase in blood flow and substrate and oxygen delivery begin, allowing aerobic processes to occur. The second condition in which anaerobic glycolysis is important is exercise by muscle containing predominately fast-twitch glycolytic muscle fibers because these fibers have low oxidative capacity and generate most of their ATP through glycolysis. The third condition is during strenuous activity, when the ATP demand exceeds the oxidative capacity of the tissue, and the increased ATP demand is met by anaerobic glycolysis.

## I. Anaerobic Glycolysis at the Onset of Exercise

During rest, most of the ATP required in all types of muscle fibers is obtained from aerobic metabolism. However, as soon as exercise begins, the demand for ATP increases. The amount of ATP present in skeletal muscle could sustain exercise for only 1.2 seconds if it were not regenerated, and the amount of phosphocreatine could sustain exercise for only 9 seconds if it were not regenerated. It takes longer than 1 minute for the blood supply to exercising muscle to increase significantly as a result of vasodilation and, therefore, oxidative metabolism of bloodborne glucose and fatty acids cannot increase rapidly at the onset of exercise. Thus, for the first few minutes of exercise, the conversion of glycogen to lactate provides a considerable portion of the ATP requirement.

## 2. Anaerobic Glycolysis in Type IIb Fast-Twitch Glycolytic Fibers

Although humans have no muscles that consist entirely of fast-twitch fibers, many other animals do. Examples are white abdominal muscles of fish and the pectoral muscles of game birds (turkey white meat). These muscles contract rapidly and vigorously (fast twitch refers to the time to peak tension), but only for short periods. Thus, they are used for activities such as flight by birds and for sprinting and weightlifting by humans.

In such muscles, the glycolytic capacity is high because the enzymes of glycolysis are present in large amounts (thus, the overall $V_{\max }$ [maximum velocity] is large). The levels of hexokinase, however, are low, so very little circulating glucose is used. The low levels of hexokinase in fast-twitch glycolytic fibers prevent the muscle from drawing on blood glucose to meet this high demand for ATP, thus avoiding hypoglycemia. Glucose 6-phosphate, formed from glycogenolysis, further inhibits hexokinase. The tissues rely on endogenous fuel stores (glycogen and creatine phosphate) to generate ATP, following the pathway of glycogen breakdown to glucose 1-phosphate, the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate, and the metabolism of glucose 6-phosphate to lactate. Thus, anaerobic glycolysis is the main source of ATP during exercise of these muscle fibers.

## 3. Anaerobic Glycolysis from Glycogen

Glycogenolysis and glycolysis during exercise are activated together because both PFK-1 (the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis) and glycogen phosphorylase b (the inhibited form of glycogen phosphorylase) are allosterically activated by AMP.

![ma54039756a7](ma54039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 45.7 Activation of muscle glycogenolysis and glycolysis by adenosine monophosphate (AMP). As muscle contracts, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is converted to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ). In the adenylate kinase reaction, two ADP molecules react to form ATP and AMP. The ATP is used for contraction. As AMP accumulates, it activates glycogenolysis and glycolysis. PFK-1, phosphofructokinase.

AMP is an ideal activator because its concentration is normally kept low by the adenylate kinase (also called myokinase in muscle) equilibrium (2ADP $\leftrightarrow$ AMP + ATP). Thus, whenever ATP levels decrease slightly, the AMP concentration increases manyfold (Fig. 45.7).

Starting from a molecule of glucose 1-phosphate derived from glycogenolysis, three ATP molecules are produced in anaerobic glycolysis, as compared with 31 to 33 molecules of ATP in aerobic glycolysis. To compensate for the low ATP yield of anaerobic glycolysis, fast-twitch glycolytic fibers have a much higher content of glycolytic enzymes, and the rate of glucose 6-phosphate use is more than 12 times as fast as in slow-twitch fibers.

Muscle fatigue during exercise generally results from a lowering of the pH of the tissue to approximately 6.4. Both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism lowers the pH . Both the lowering of pH and lactate production can cause pain.

Metabolic fatigue also can occur once muscle glycogen is depleted. Muscle glycogen stores are used up in $<2$ minutes of anaerobic exercise. If you do pushups, you can prove this to yourself. The muscle used in pushups, a high-strength exercise, is principally fast-twitch glycolytic fibers. Time yourself from the start of your pushups. No matter how well you have trained, you probably cannot do pushups for as long as 2 minutes. Furthermore, you will feel the pain as the muscle pH drops as lactate production continues.

The regulation of muscle glycogen metabolism is complex. Recall that glycogen degradation in muscle is not sensitive to glucagon (muscles lack glucagon receptors), so there is little change in muscle glycogen stores during overnight fasting or long-term fasting, if the individual remains at rest. Glycogen synthase is inhibited during exercise but can be activated in resting muscle by the release of insulin after a high-carbohydrate meal. Unlike the liver form of glycogen phosphorylase, the muscle isozyme contains an allosteric site for AMP binding. When AMP binds to muscle glycogen phosphorylase $b$, the enzyme is activated even though it is not phosphorylated. Thus, as muscle begins to work and the myosin-ATPase hydrolyzes existing ATP stores to ADP, AMP begins to accumulate (because of the adenylate kinase reaction), and glycogen degradation is enhanced. The activation of muscle glycogen phosphorylase $b$ is further enhanced by the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which occurs when muscles are stimulated to contract. The increase in sarcoplasmic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ also leads to the allosteric activation of glycogen phosphorylase kinase (through binding to the calmodulin subunit of the enzyme), which phosphorylates muscle glycogen phosphorylase b, fully activating it. And, finally, during intense exercise, epinephrine release stimulates the activation of adenylate cyclase in muscle cells, thereby activating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (see Fig. 26.9). Protein kinase A phosphorylates and fully activates glycogen phosphorylase kinase so that continued activation of muscle glycogen phosphorylase can occur. The hormonal signal is slower than the initial activation events triggered by AMP and calcium (Fig. 45.8).

![ma55039756a7](ma55039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 45.8 Stimulation of glycogenolysis in muscle by epinephrine. (1) Epinephrine binding to its receptor leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase, which increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. (2) cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA), thereby activating the catalytic subunits. (3) Active PKA phosphorylates and activates phosphorylase kinase. Phosphorylase kinase also can be activated partially by the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin complex as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ levels increase as muscles contract. (4) PKA phosphorylates and inactivates glycogen synthase. (5) Active phosphorylase kinase converts glycogen phosphorylase b to glycogen phosphorylase a. (6) Glycogen degradation forms glucose 1-phosphate, which is converted to glucose 6-phosphate, which enters the glycolytic pathway for energy production. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

# 4. Anaerobic Glycolysis during High-Intensity Exercise 

Once exercise begins, the electron-transport chain, the TCA cycle, and fatty acid oxidation are activated by the increase of ADP and the decrease of ATP. Pyruvate dehydrogenase remains in the active, nonphosphorylated state as long as NADH can be reoxidized in the electron-transport chain and acetyl-CoA can enter the TCA cycle. However, even though mitochondrial metabolism is working at its maximum capacity, additional ATP may be needed for very strenuous, highintensity exercise. When this occurs, ATP is not being produced rapidly enough to meet the muscle's needs, and AMP begins to accumulate. Increased AMP levels activate PFK-1 and glycogenolysis, thereby providing additional ATP from anaerobic glycolysis (the additional pyruvate produced does not enter the mitochondria but rather is converted to lactate so that glycolysis can continue). Thus, under these conditions, most of the pyruvate formed by glycolysis enters the TCA cycle, whereas the remainder is reduced to lactate to regenerate $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$for continued use in glycolysis.

## 5. Fate of Lactate Released during Exercise

The lactate that is released from skeletal muscles during exercise can be used by resting skeletal muscles or by the heart, a muscle with a large amount of mitochondria and very high oxidative capacity. In such muscles, the NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio is lower than in exercising skeletal muscle, and the lactate dehydrogenase reaction proceeds in the direction of pyruvate formation. The pyruvate that is generated is then converted to acetyl-CoA and oxidized in the TCA cycle, producing energy by oxidative phosphorylation.

The second potential fate of lactate is that it will return to the liver through the Cori cycle, where it is converted to glucose (see Fig. 22.12).

## VI. Mild- and Moderate-Intensity Long-Term Exercise

## A. Lactate Release Decreases with Duration of Exercise

Mild- to moderate-intensity exercise can be performed for longer periods than can high-intensity exercise. This is because of the aerobic oxidation of glucose and fatty acids, which generates more energy per fuel molecule than anaerobic metabolism, and which also produces lactic acid at a slower rate than anaerobic metabolism. Thus, during mild- and moderate-intensity exercise, the release of lactate diminishes as the aerobic metabolism of glucose and fatty acids becomes predominant.

## B. Blood Glucose as a Fuel

At any given time during fasting, the blood contains only approximately 5 g of glucose, enough to support a person running at a moderate pace for a few minutes. Therefore, the blood glucose supply must be constantly replenished. The liver performs this function by processes similar to those used during fasting. The liver produces glucose by breaking down its own glycogen stores and by gluconeogenesis. The major source of carbon for gluconeogenesis during exercise is, of course, lactate, produced by the exercising muscle, but amino acids and glycerol are also used (Fig. 45.9). Epinephrine released during exercise stimulates liver glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis by causing cAMP levels to increase.

During long periods of exercise, blood glucose levels are maintained by the liver through hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The amount of glucose that the liver must export is greatest at higher workloads, in which case the muscle is using a greater proportion of the glucose for anaerobic metabolism. With increasing duration of exercise, an increasing proportion of blood glucose is supplied by gluconeogenesis. For up to 40 minutes of mild exercise, glycogenolysis is mainly responsible for the glucose output of the liver. However, after 40 to 240 minutes of exercise, the total glucose output of the liver decreases. This is caused by the increased use of fatty acids, which are being released from adipose tissue triacylglycerols (stimulated by epinephrine release). Glucose uptake by the muscle is stimulated by the increase in AMP levels and the activation of the AMPK, which stimulates the translocation of GLUT 4 transporters to the muscle membrane.

The hormonal changes that direct the increased hepatic glycogenolysis, hepatic gluconeogenesis, and adipose tissue lipolysis include a decrease in insulin and an increase in glucagon, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Plasma levels of growth hormone, cortisol, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) also increase and may contribute to fuel mobilization as well (see Chapter 41). The activation of hepatic glycogenolysis occurs through glucagon and epinephrine release. Hepatic gluconeogenesis is activated by the increased supply of precursors (lactate, glycerol, amino acids, and pyruvate), the induction of gluconeogenic enzymes by glucagon and cortisol (this occurs only during prolonged exercise), and the increased supply of fatty acids to provide the ATP and NADH needed for gluconeogenesis and the regulation of gluconeogenic enzymes.

Remember from Chapter I that a food calorie (cal) is equivalent to I kilocalorie (kcal) of energy. One gram of glucose can give rise to 4 kcal of energy, so at a rate of consumption of $500 \mathrm{cal} / \mathrm{hour}$, we have
$(500 \mathrm{cal} / \mathrm{h}) \times$ ( 1 g of glucose/4 cal of energy) $\times$ (I hi60 min) $=2 \mathrm{~g}$ of glucose/min

Thus, Otto must use 2 g of glucose per minute to run at his current pace. In the fasting state, blood glucose levels are approximately $90 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, or $900 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. Because blood volume is estimated at 5 L , Otto has 4.5 g of glucose available. If it is not replenished, that amount of glucose will support only 2.25 minutes of running at 2 g of glucose per minute.

In: Howald H, Poortmans JR, eds. Metabolic Adaptation to Prolonged Physical Exercise. Cambridge, MA: Birkhauser; 1973:148.)

# C. Free Fatty Acids as a Source of ATP 

The longer the duration of the exercise, the greater the reliance of the muscle on free fatty acids for the generation of ATP (Fig. 45.10). Because ATP generation from free fatty acids depends on mitochondria and oxidative phosphorylation, long-distance running uses muscles that are principally slow-twitch oxidative fibers, such as the gastrocnemius. It is also important to realize that resting skeletal muscle uses free fatty acids as a principal fuel. At almost any time except the postprandial state (right after eating), free fatty acids are the preferred fuel for skeletal muscle.
![ma57039756a7](ma57039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 45.10 Fuels used during exercise. The pattern of fuel use changes with the duration of the exercise. (From: Felig P, Baxter JD, Broadus AE, Frohman LA. Endocrinology \& Metabolism. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 1981:796.)

The preferential use of fatty acids over glucose as a fuel in skeletal muscle depends on the following factors:

1. The availability of free fatty acids in the blood, which depends on their release from adipose tissue triacylglycerols by lipases. During prolonged exercise, the small decrease of insulin, and increases of glucagon, epinephrine and norepinephrine, cortisol, and possibly growth hormone all activate adipocyte tissue lipolysis.
2. Inhibition of glycolysis by products of fatty acid oxidation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is inhibited by acetyl-CoA, NADH, and ATP, all of which are elevated as fatty acid oxidation proceeds. As AMP levels drop, and ATP levels rise, PFK-1 activity is decreased (see Chapter 22).
3. Glucose transport may be reduced during long-term exercise. Glucose transport into skeletal muscles via the GLUT 4 transporter is greatly activated by either insulin or exercise. During long-term exercise, the effect of falling insulin levels or increased fatty acid levels may counteract the stimulation of glucose transport by the exercise itself.
4. Oxidation of ketone bodies also increases during exercise. Their use as a fuel is dependent on their rate of production by the liver. Ketone bodies are never, however, a major fuel for skeletal muscle (muscles prefer free fatty acids).
5. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (isozyme ACC-2) must be inactivated for the muscle to use fatty acids. This occurs as the AMPK is activated and phosphorylates ACC-2, rendering it inactive, and activates malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, to reduce malonyl-CoA levels and allow full activity of CPTI.

# D. Branched-Chain Amino Acids 

BCAA oxidation has been estimated to supply a maximum of $20 \%$ of the ATP supply of resting muscle. Oxidation of BCAAs in muscle serves two functions. The first is the generation of ATP, and the second is the synthesis of glutamine, which effluxes from the muscle. The highest rates of BCAA oxidation occur under conditions of acidosis, in which there is a higher demand for glutamine to transfer ammonia to the kidney and to buffer the urine as ammonium ion during proton excretion. Recall that glutamine synthesis occurs from the carbon skeletons of BCAA oxidation (valine and isoleucine) after the initial five steps of the oxidative pathway.

## E. The Purine Nucleotide Cycle

Exercise increases the activity of the purine nucleotide cycle, which converts aspartate to fumarate plus ammonia (see Fig. 39.12). The ammonia is used to buffer the proton production and lactate production from glycolysis, and the fumarate is recycled and can form glutamine.

## F. Acetate

Acetate is an excellent fuel for skeletal muscle. It is treated by the muscle as a very-short-chain fatty acid. It is activated to acetyl-CoA in the cytosol and then transferred into the mitochondria via acetylcarnitine transferase, an isozyme of carnitine palmitoyltransferase. Sources of acetate include the diet (vinegar is acetic acid) and acetate produced in the liver from alcohol metabolism. Certain commercial power bars for athletes contain acetate.

## VII. Metabolic Effects of Training on Muscle Metabolism

The effect of training depends, to some extent, on the type of training. In general, training increases the muscle glycogen stores and increases the number and size of mitochondria. The fibers thus increase their capacity for generation of ATP from

oxidative metabolism and their ability to use fatty acids as a fuel. The winners in marathon races seem to use muscle glycogen more efficiently than others.

Training to improve strength, power, and endurance of muscle performance is called resistance training. Its goal is to increase the size of the muscle fibers (hypertrophy of the muscle). Muscle fibers can develop a maximal force of 3 to $4 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ of muscle area. Thus, if we could increase our muscle size from 80 to $120 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, the maximum resistance that could be lifted would increase from 240 to 360 kg . Hypertrophy occurs by increased protein synthesis in the muscle and a reduction in existing protein turnover.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

Renee F. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) may follow pharyngeal or cutaneous infection with one of a limited number of "nephritogenic" strains of group A $\beta$-hemolytic streptococci. The pathogenesis of PSGN involves a host immune (antibody) response to one or more of the enzymes secreted by the bacterial cells. The antigen-antibody complexes are deposited on the tissues of glomerular units, causing a local acute inflammatory response. Hypertension may occur as a consequence of sodium and water retention caused by an inability of the inflamed glomerular units to filter sodium and water into the urine. Proteinuria is usually mild if the immune response is self-limited.

Overall, one of the most useful clinical indicators of GFR in both health and disease is the serum creatinine concentration. The endogenous production of creatinine, which averages approximately $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight per day, is correlated with muscle mass and, therefore, tends to be constant for a given individual if renal function is normal. Any rise in serum creatinine in a patient such as Renee F., therefore, can be assumed to result from decreased excretion of this metabolite into the urine. The extent of the rise in the blood is related directly to the severity of the pathologic process involving the glomerular units in the kidneys.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

The SERCA Pump. The SERCA pump is a transmembrane protein of 110 kDa that is present in several different isoforms throughout the body. Three genes encode SERCA proteins, designated SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3. The SERCA1 gene produces two alternatively spliced transcripts, SERCA1a and SERCA1b. SERCA1b is expressed in the fetal and neonatal fasttwitch skeletal muscles and is replaced by SERCA1a in adult fast-twitch muscles. The SERCA2 gene also undergoes alternative splicing, producing the SERCA2a and SERCA2b isoforms. The SERCA2b isoform is expressed in all cell types and is associated with inositol trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$-regulated calcium stores. SERCA2a is the primary isoform expressed in cardiac tissue. SERCA3 produces at least five different alternatively spliced isoforms, which are specifically expressed in different tissues.

SERCA2a plays an important role in cardiac contraction and relaxation. Contraction is initiated by the release of calcium from intracellular stores, whereas relaxation occurs as the calcium is resequestered in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, in part mediated by the SERCA2a protein. The SERCA2a pump is regulated, in part, by its association with the protein phospholamban (PLN). PLN is a pentameric molecule consisting of five identical subunits of molecular weight $22,000 \mathrm{Da}$. PLN associates with SERCA2a in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and reduces its pumping activity. Because new contractions cannot occur until cytosolic calcium has been resequestered into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a reduction in SERCA2a activity increases the relaxation time. However, when called on, the heart can increase its rate of contractions by inhibiting the activity of PLN. This is accomplished by phosphorylation of PLN by protein

kinase A (PKA). Epinephrine release stimulates the heart to beat faster. This occurs through epinephrine binding to its receptor, activating a G-protein, which leads to adenylate cyclase activation, elevation of cAMP levels, and activation of PKA. PKA phosphorylates PLN, thereby reducing its association with SERCA2a and relieving the inhibition of pumping activity. This results in reduced relaxation times and more frequent contractions.

Mutations in PLN lead to cardiomyopathies, primarily an autosomal-dominant form of dilated cardiomyopathy. This particular mutation substitutes an arginine in place of cysteine at position 9 in PLN, which forms an inactive complex with PKA and blocks PKA phosphorylation of PLN. Individuals with this form of PLN develop cardiomyopathy in their teens. In this condition, the cardiac muscle does not pump well (because of the constant inhibition of SERCA2a) and becomes enlarged (dilated). Because of the poor pumping action of the heart, fluid can build up in the lungs (left heart failure). The pulmonary congestion results in a sense of breathlessness (dyspnea). Eventually, progressive left heart failure leads to right heart failure and fluid accumulation in other tissues and organs of the body, such as the legs and ankles (edema).

Muscle comprises three different types: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac.
Skeletal muscle facilitates movement of the skeleton.
Slow-twitch fibers contain large amounts of mitochondria and myoglobin, and generate energy primarily via oxidative means.
Fast-twitch fibers have few mitochondria, low levels of myoglobin, and are rich in glycogen. These fibers generate energy primarily via glycolysis.
Smooth muscle cells display no striations and aid in maintaining the shape and movement of the blood vessels, airways, uterus, and digestive systems.
Cardiac muscle cells contain striations but are regulated involuntarily. They use aerobic metabolism, oxidizing fatty acids, glucose, and lactate, and they contain many mitochondria, with very little glycogen.
Acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction leads to muscle contraction. Fatty acid oxidation in muscle is controlled by the levels of malonyl-CoA produced by a muscle-specific isozyme of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC-2). Skeletal muscle uses many fuels to generate ATP, storing excess high-energy phosphate bonds as creatine phosphate.
Muscle fuel use is regulated carefully.
At rest, the muscle uses what is available in the blood (glucose, amino acids, fatty acids).
During starvation, fatty acids are the preferred energy source (even over ketone bodies).
During exercise, stored glycogen, blood glucose, and blood fatty acids are the primary sources of energy for the skeletal muscles.

1. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Stretching aids in stimulating blood flow to the muscles, which enhances oxidative muscle metabolism (by allowing for better oxygen delivery). Stretching, per se, does not stimulate epinephrine release (thus, A is incorrect), nor does it activate glycolysis in either the liver or muscle.
2. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. Triacylglycerol is the largest energy store in the body and is the predominant fuel in longterm aerobic exercise. During exercise, muscle glycogen is used for bursts of speed but not for long-term energy requirements. Liver glycogen is used to maintain blood glucose levels for use by the nervous system and as a supplement for use by muscle when rapid speed is required; however, it is not designed to be a long-term energy source. The brain does not contain significant levels of glycogen, and lactic acid produced by the red blood cells is used as a gluconeogenic precursor by liver but not as a fuel for muscle.
3. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. Creatine is synthesized from glycine, arginine, and $S$-adenosylmethionine (thus, intake of dietary creatine is not relevant). In muscle, creatine is converted to creatine phosphate, which is nonenzymatically cyclized to form creatinine (thus, C is incorrect). The amount of creatinine excreted by the kidneys each day depends on body muscle mass but is constant for each individual (therefore, if there is an increase in body muscle mass, there would be an increase in creatinine excretion). In kidney failure, the excretion of creatinine into the urine is low, and an elevation of serum creatinine would be observed.
4. The answer is $\mathbf{E}$. Glycine is required for the synthesis of heme (combining with succinyl-CoA in the initial step), for the synthesis of purine rings (the entire glycine molecule is incorporated into adenine and guanine) and for creatine, where glycine reacts with arginine in the first step.
5. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. A decrease in the concentration of ATP (which occurs as muscle contracts) stimulates processes that generate ATP. The proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane decreases as protons enter the matrix via the ATPase in order to synthesize ATP; NADH oxidation by the electron-transport chain increases to reestablish the proton gradient; fuel use also increases in order to generate more ATP. Glycogen synthesis is inhibited because of phosphorylation of glycogen synthase as induced by epinephrine. Palmitate is oxidized and glycolysis increases because of the activation of PFK-1 by AMP. As ATP decreases, AMP rises as a result of the myokinase reaction (2ADP $\rightarrow$ ATP + AMP).
6. The answer is A. ACC-2 produces malonyl-CoA in the muscle for the purpose of regulating fatty acid
oxidation via inhibition of CPTI. When malonyl-CoA cannot be synthesized through inhibition of ACC-2, fatty acid oxidation in the muscle is rapid and not regulated. Skeletal muscle then oxidizes fatty acids instead of glucose, leading to a drop in stored fatty acids in the adipocyte. After a myocardial infarction, fatty acid oxidation must be regulated such that glucose oxidation can also occur; otherwise, lactic acid is produced (via anaerobic glycolysis), which further damages the heart. High-intensity exercise requires very rapid ATP synthesis, which can only occur by anaerobic glycolysis; as a result, increasing the rate of fatty acid oxidation by drug use will not aid in high-intensity exercise. Muscle cells do not produce either ketone bodies or fatty acids; thus, inhibition of ACC-2 would not lead to those effects.
7. The answer is $\mathbf{E}$. Insulin release leads to the activation of protein kinase B (Akt), which, in the heart, will phosphorylate PFK-2. The phosphorylation of the heart isozyme of PFK-2 leads to activation of its kinase activity, thereby producing increased amounts of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, a potent activator of PFK-1 activity. Simultaneously, the phosphatase activity of cardiac PFK-2 is inhibited, thereby allowing the increased levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate to stay elevated. The activation of PFK-1 leads to an increased glycolytic rate within the heart, taking advantage of the high glucose levels in the blood. High levels of ATP will inhibit glycolysis as an allosteric inhibitor, and high levels of lactate reduce glycolysis, owing to a reduction in intracellular pH . Low levels of ATP do not stimulate glycolysis (AMP will activate PFK-1), nor will low levels of lactate.
8. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. The heart uses primarily fatty acids ( $60 \%$ to $80 \%$ of energy needs) for its energy needs but can use lactate and glucose. Only $2 \%$ of its energy requirement is derived from glycolysis. Muscles do not synthesize fatty acids. Exercising skeletal muscles use glucose and fatty acids preferentially for their energy needs (glucose during sprints, and a mixture of fatty acids and glucose during longer distances). Ketone bodies are not produced when adults exercise. The lactate generated by the muscle during exercise can also be used by the heart as an energy source. The muscle, when generating lactate, does not use the lactate as a fuel.
9. The answer is B. During ischemia, glycolysis increases, creating lactate. However, after ischemia is relieved, the high rate of fatty acid oxidation is damaging to alreadydamaged heart cells by rapidly increasing NADH levels in the mitochondria. This leads to even more lactate production in the cytoplasm as the high intramitochondrial NADH levels inhibit the shuttle systems that transfer

electrons from cytoplasmic NADH to mitochondrial $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. The increased cytoplasmic NADH levels lead to increased lactate production, reducing the pH of the cardiac cells. The high acetyl-CoA levels in the mitochondria (owing to fatty acid oxidation) inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase, which leads to increased pyruvate in the cytoplasm and increased lactate production. NADPH is not involved in the increase in cardiac damage after ischemia.
10. The answer is E. Creatine synthesis begins in the kidney and is completed in the liver. It is then released into the blood and travels particularly to brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, where it is used to react with ATP to form creatine phosphate (catalyzed by CPK). Creatine phosphate is unstable and spontaneously cyclizes to creatinine, which is excreted in the urine. The amount of creatinine excreted each day is constant and proportional to muscle mass.

# Metabolism of the Nervous System 

The nervous system consists of various cell types. The most abundant cell in the nervous system is the glial cell, which consists of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). These cells provide support for the neurons and synthesize the protective myelin sheath that surrounds the axons emanating from the neurons. Microglial cells in the nervous system act as immune cells, destroying and ingesting foreign organisms that enter the nervous system. The interface between the brain parenchyma and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment is formed by the ependymal cells, which line the cavities of the brain and spinal cord. These cells use their cilia to allow for the circulation of the CSF, which bathes the cells of the CNS.

The cells of the brain are separated from free contact with the rest of the body by the blood-brain barrier. The capillaries of the brain exhibit features, such as tight endothelial cell junctions, that restrict their permeability to metabolites in the blood. This protects the brain from compounds that might be toxic or otherwise interfere with nerve impulse transmission. It also affects the entry of precursors for brain metabolic pathways such as fuel metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis.

Neurotransmitters can be divided structurally into two categories: small nitrogencontaining neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. The small nitrogen-containing neurotransmitters are generally synthesized in the presynaptic terminal from amino acids and intermediates of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. They are retained in storage vesicles until the neuron is depolarized. The catecholamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) are derived from tyrosine. Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan. Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline, which can be supplied from the diet or is synthesized and stored as part of phosphatidylcholine. Glutamate and its neurotransmitter derivative, $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are derived from $\alpha$-ketoglutarate in the TCA cycle. Glycine is synthesized in the brain from serine. The synthesis of the neurotransmitters is regulated to correspond to the rate of depolarization of the individual neurons. A large number of cofactors are required for the synthesis of neurotransmitters, and deficiencies of pyridoxal phosphate, thiamin pyrophosphate, and vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{12}$ result in a variety of neurologic dysfunctions.

Brain metabolism has a high requirement for glucose and oxygen. Deficiencies of either (hypoglycemia or hypoxia) affect brain function because they influence adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and the supply of precursors for neurotransmitter synthesis. Ischemia elicits a condition in which increased calcium levels, swelling, glutamate excitotoxicity, and nitric oxide generation affect brain function and can lead to a stroke. The generation of free radicals and abnormalities in nitric oxide production are important players in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.

Because of the restrictions posed by the blood-brain barrier to the entry of a variety of substances into the CNS, the brain generally synthesizes and degrades its own lipids. Essential fatty acids can enter the brain, but the more common fatty acids do not. The turnover of lipids at the synaptic membrane is very rapid, and the neuron must replace those lipids lost during exocytosis. The glial cells produce the myelin

sheath, which is composed primarily of lipids. These lipids are of a different composition than those of the neuronal cells. Because there is considerable lipid synthesis and turnover in the brain, this organ is sensitive to disorders of peroxisomal function (Refsum disease; interference in very-long-chain fatty acid oxidation and $\alpha$-oxidation) and lysosomal diseases (mucopolysaccharidoses; inability to degrade complex lipids and glycolipids).

# THE WAITING ROOM 

$\square$Katie C., a 34-year-old dress designer, developed alarming palpitations of her heart while bending forward to pick up her cat. She also developed a pounding headache and sweated profusely. After 5 to 10 minutes, these symptoms subsided. One week later, her aerobic exercise instructor, a registered nurse, noted that Katie grew very pale and was tremulous during exercise. The instructor took Katie's blood pressure, which was 220 mm Hg systolic (normal, up to 120 at rest) and 132 mm Hg diastolic (normal, up to 80 at rest). Within 15 minutes, Katie recovered, and her blood pressure returned to normal. The instructor told Katie to see her physician the next day.

The doctor told Katie that her symptom complex coupled with severe hypertension strongly suggested the presence of a tumor in the medulla of one of her adrenal glands (a pheochromocytoma) that was episodically secreting large amounts of catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline). Her blood pressure was normal until moderate pressure to the left of her umbilicus caused Katie to suddenly develop a typical attack, and her blood pressure rose rapidly. In addition to ordering several biochemical tests, Katie also was scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of her abdomen and pelvis. The MRI showed a $3.5 \times 2.8 \times 2.6 \mathrm{~cm}$ mass in the left adrenal gland, with imaging characteristics typical of a pheochromocytoma.

$\square$Ivan A.'s brother, Evan A., was 6 ft tall and weighed 425 lb (body mass index $[\mathrm{BMI}]=57.6 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ). He had only been successful in losing weight once in his life, in 1977, when he had lost 30 pounds through a combination of diet and exercise with the support of a registered dietitian. However, he quickly regained this weight over the next year. Evan's weight was not usually a concern for him, but in 1997, he became worried when it became difficult because of joint pain in his knees, for him to take walks or go fishing. He was also suffering from symptoms suggestive of a peripheral neuropathy, manifesting primarily as tingling in his legs. In 1997, Evan approached his physician, desperate for help to lose weight. The physician placed Evan on a new drug, Redux, which had just been approved for use as a weight-loss agent, and a low-fat, low-calorie diet along with physical therapy to help increase his activity level. In 4 months, Evan's weight dropped from 425 to 375 lb , his total cholesterol dropped from 250 to 185 , and his serum triglycerides dropped from 375 to 130. However, Redux was withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer late in 1997 because of its toxicity. Evan was then placed on Prozac, a drug used primarily as an antidepressant but which may cause mild weight loss.

## I. Cell Types of the Nervous System

The nervous system consists of neurons, the cells that transmit signals, and supporting cells, the neuroglia. The neuroglia consist of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (known collectively as glial cells), microglial cells, ependymal cells, and Schwann cells. The neuroglia are designed to support and sustain the neurons and do so by surrounding neurons and holding them in place, supplying nutrients and oxygen to the neurons, insulating neurons so their electrical signals are more rapidly propagated, and cleaning up any debris that enters the nervous system. The CNS consists

of the brain and spinal cord. This system integrates all signals emanating from the PNS. The PNS is composed of all neurons that lie outside the CNS.

# A. Neurons 

Neurons consist of a cell body (soma) from which long (axons) and short (dendrites) extensions protrude. Dendrites receive information from the axons of other neurons, whereas the axons transmit information to other neurons. The axon-dendrite connection is known as a synapse (Fig. 46.1). Most neurons contain multiple dendrites, each of which can receive signals from multiple axons. This configuration allows a single neuron to integrate information from multiple sources. Although neurons also contain just one axon, most axons branch extensively and distribute information to multiple targets (divergence). The neurons transmit signals by changes in the electrical potential across their membrane. Signaling across a synapse requires the release of neurotransmitters that, when bound to their specific receptors, initiate an electrical signal in the receiving or target cell. Neurons are terminally differentiated cells and, as such, have little capability for division. As a result, injured neurons have a limited capacity to repair themselves and frequently undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) when damaged.

## B. Neuroglial Cells

## I. Astrocytes

The astrocytes are found in the CNS and are star-shaped cells that provide physical and nutritional support for neurons. During development of the CNS, the astrocytes guide neuronal migration to their final adult position and form a matrix that keeps neurons in place. These cells serve several functions, including phagocytosing debris left behind by cells, providing lactate (from glucose metabolism) as a carbon source for the neurons, and controlling the brain extracellular ionic environment. Astrocytes help to regulate the content of the extracellular fluid (ECF) by taking up, processing, and metabolizing nutrients and waste products.

## 2. Oligodendrocytes

Oligodendrocytes provide the myelin sheath that surrounds the axon, acting as "insulation" for many of the neurons in the CNS. The myelin sheath is the lipid-protein covering of the axons (see Section V.B for a description of the composition and

synthesis of the myelin sheath). Oligodendrocytes can form myelin sheaths around multiple neurons in the CNS by sending out processes that bind to the axons on target neurons. The speed with which a neuron conducts its electric signal (action potential) is directly proportional to the degree of myelination. Oligodendrocytes, along with the astrocytes, form a supporting matrix for the neurons. Oligodendrocytes have a limited capacity for mitosis and, if damaged, do not replicate. If this occurs, demyelination of the axons may occur, resulting in abnormalities in signal conduction along that axon (see "Biochemical Comments").

## 3. Schwann Cells

Schwann cells are the supporting cells of the PNS. Like oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells form myelin sheaths around the axons, but unlike the oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells myelinate only one axon; they also clean up cellular debris in the PNS. In addition, Schwann cells provide a means for peripheral axons to regenerate if damaged. There is a synergistic interaction among the Schwann cells, secreted growth factors, and the axon that allows damaged axons to reconnect to the appropriate target axon.

## 4. Microglial Cells

The microglial cells are the smallest glial cells in the nervous system. They serve as immunologically responsive cells that function similarly to the action of macrophages in the circulation. Microglial cells destroy invading microorganisms and phagocytose cellular debris.

## 5. Ependymal Cells

The ependymal cells are ciliated cells that line the cavities (ventricles) of the CNS and the spinal cord. In some areas of the brain, the ependymal cells are functionally specialized to elaborate and secrete CSF into the ventricular system. The beating of the ependymal cilia allows for efficient circulation of the CSF throughout the CNS. The CSF acts as both a shock absorber protecting the CNS from mechanical trauma and as a system for the removal of metabolic wastes. The CSF can be aspirated from the spinal canal and analyzed to determine whether disorders of CNS function, with their characteristic CSF changes, are present.

For many years, it had been believed that damaged neurons in the CNS could not regenerate because it was thought that there are no pluripotent stem cells (cells that can differentiate into various cell types found in the CNS) in the CNS. However, recent data suggest that cells found within the ependymal layer can act as neural stem cells, which under appropriate stimulation can regenerate cells within the nervous system. Such a finding opens up a large number of potential treatments for diseases that alter neuronal cell function.

## II. The Blood-Brain Barrier

## A. Capillary Structure

In the capillary beds of most organs, rapid passage of molecules occurs from the blood through the endothelial wall of the capillaries into the interstitial fluid. Thus, the composition of interstitial fluid resembles that of blood, and specific receptors or transporters in the plasma membrane of the cells being bathed by the interstitial fluid may interact directly with amino acids, hormones, or other compounds from the blood. In the brain, transcapillary movement of substrates in the peripheral circulation into the brain is highly restricted by the blood-brain barrier. This barrier limits the accessibility of bloodborne toxins and other potentially harmful compounds to the neurons of the CNS.

The blood-brain barrier begins with the endothelial cells that form the inner lining of the vessels supplying blood to the CNS (Fig. 46.2). Unlike the endothelial cells of other organs, these cells are joined by tight junctions that do not permit the

movement of polar molecules from the blood into the interstitial fluid bathing the neurons. They also lack mechanisms for transendothelial transport that are present in other capillaries of the body. These mechanisms include fenestrations ("windows" or pores that span the endothelial lining and permit the rapid movement of molecules across membranes) or transpinocytosis (vesicular transport from one side of the endothelial cell to another).

The endothelial cells serve actively, as well as passively, to protect the brain. Because they contain a variety of drug-metabolizing enzyme systems similar to the drug-metabolizing enzymes found in the liver, the endothelial cells can metabolize neurotransmitters and toxic chemicals and, therefore, form an enzymatic barrier to entry of these potentially harmful substances into the brain. They actively pump hydrophobic molecules that diffuse into endothelial cells back into the blood (especially xenobiotics) with P-glycoproteins, which act as transmembranous, ATPdependent efflux pumps. Although lipophilic substances, water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide can readily cross the blood-brain barrier by passive diffusion, other molecules depend on specific transport systems. Differential transporters on the luminal and abluminal endothelial membranes can transport compounds into, as well as out of, the brain.

Further protection against the free entry of bloodborne compounds into the CNS is provided by a continuous collagen-containing basement membrane that completely surrounds the capillaries. The basement membrane appears to be surrounded by the foot processes of astrocytes. Thus, compounds must pass through endothelial cell membranes, the enzymatic barrier in the endothelial cells, the basement membrane, and possibly additional cellular barriers formed by the astrocytes to reach the neurons in the brain.

## B. Transport through the Blood-Brain Barrier

Many nonpolar substances, such as drugs and inert gases, probably diffuse through the endothelial cell membranes. A large number of other compounds are transported through the endothelial capillaries by facilitative transport, whereas others, such as nonessential fatty acids, cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Essential fatty acids, however, are transported across the barrier.

## I. Fuels

Glucose, which is the principal fuel of the brain, is transported through both endothelial membranes by facilitated diffusion via the GLUT 1 transporter (see Fig. 21.9). GLUT 3 transporters present on the neurons then allow the neurons to transport the glucose from the ECF. Glial cells express GLUT 1 transporters. Although the rate of glucose transport into the ECF normally exceeds the rate required for energy metabolism by the brain, glucose transport may become ratelimiting as blood glucose levels fall below the normal range. Thus, individuals begin to experience hypoglycemic symptoms at glucose levels of approximately $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, as the glucose levels are reduced to the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$, or below the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ values of the GLUT 1 transporters in the endothelial cells of the barrier.

Monocarboxylic acids, including L-lactate, acetate, pyruvate, and the ketone bodies acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, are transported by a separate stereospecific system that is slower than the transport system for glucose. During starvation, when the level of ketone bodies in the blood is elevated, this transporter is upregulated. Ketone bodies are important fuels for the brain of both adults and neonates during prolonged starvation ( $>46$ hours).

## 2. Amino Acids and Vitamins

Large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) (such as phenylalanine, leucine, tyrosine, isoleucine, valine, tryptophan, methionine, and histidine) enter the CSF rapidly via a single amino acid transporter (L [leucine preferring] system amino acid transporter). Many of these compounds are essential in the diet and must be imported for protein

Several disorders of glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier are known. The most common of these is facilitated glucose transporter protein type I (GLUT I) deficiency syndrome. In this disorder, GLUT I transporters are impaired, which results in a low glucose concentration in the CSF (a condition known as hypoglycorrhachia). A diagnostic indication of this disorder is that in the presence of normal blood glucose levels the ratio of CSF glucose to blood glucose levels is $<0.4$. Clinical features are variable but include seizures, developmental delay, and a complex motor disorder. These symptoms are the result of inadequate glucose levels in the brain. The disorder can be treated by prescribing a ketogenic diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate). This will force the patient to produce ketone bodies, which are easily transported into the CNS and can partially spare the brain's requirement for glucose as an energy source.

The finding that the LNAAs have a common carrier system across the blood-brain barrier suggests that if one amino acid is in excess, it can, by competitive inhibition, result in lower transport of the other amino acids. This suggests that the mental retardation that results from untreated phenylketonuria (PKU) and maple syrup urine disease (see Chapter 37) may be attributable to the high levels of either phenylalanine or branched-chain amino acids in the blood. These high levels overwhelm the LNAA carrier so that excessive levels of the damaging amino acid enter the CNS. In support of this theory is the finding that treatment of patients with PKU with large doses of LNAAs that lack phenylalanine resulted in a decrease of phenylalanine levels in the CSF and brain, with an improvement in the patients' cognitive functions as well.
synthesis or as precursors of neurotransmitters. Because a single transporter is involved, these amino acids compete with each other for transport into the brain.

The entry of small neutral amino acids, such as alanine, glycine, proline, and GABA, is markedly restricted because their influx could dramatically change the content of neurotransmitters (see Section III). They are synthesized in the brain, and some are transported out of the CNS and into the blood via the A (alanine-preferring) system carrier. Vitamins have specific transporters through the blood-brain barrier, just as they do in most tissues.

## 3. Receptor-Mediated Transcytosis

Certain proteins, such as insulin, transferrin, and insulin-like growth factors, cross the blood-brain barrier by receptor-mediated transcytosis. Once the protein binds to its membrane receptor, the membrane containing the receptor-protein complex is endocytosed into the endothelial cell to form a vesicle. It is released on the other side of the endothelial cell. Absorption-mediated transcytosis also can occur. This differs from receptor-mediated transcytosis in that the protein binds nonspecifically to the membrane and not to a distinct receptor.

## III. Synthesis of Small Nitrogen-Containing Neurotransmitters

Molecules that serve as neurotransmitters fall into two basic structural categories: (1) small nitrogen-containing molecules and (2) neuropeptides. The major small nitrogen-containing molecule neurotransmitters include glutamate, GABA, glycine, acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine. Additional neurotransmitters that fall into this category include epinephrine, aspartate, and nitric oxide. In general, each neuron synthesizes only those neurotransmitters that it uses for transmission through a synapse or to another cell. The neuronal tracts are often identified by their neurotransmitter; for example, a dopaminergic tract synthesizes and releases the neurotransmitter dopamine.

Neuropeptides are usually small peptides that are synthesized and processed in the CNS. Some of these peptides have targets within the CNS (such as endorphins, which bind to opioid receptors and block pain signals), whereas others are released into the circulation to bind to receptors on other organs (such as growth hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone). Many neuropeptides are synthesized as a larger precursor, which is then cleaved to produce the active peptides. Until recently, the assumption was that a neuron synthesized and released only a single neurotransmitter. More recent evidence suggests that a neuron may contain (1) more than one small-molecule neurotransmitter, (2) more than one neuropeptide neurotransmitter, or (3) both types of neurotransmitters. The differential release of the various neurotransmitters is the result of the neuron altering its frequency and pattern of firing.

## A. General Features of Neurotransmitter Synthesis

Several features are common to the synthesis, secretion, and metabolism of most small nitrogen-containing neurotransmitters (Table 46.1). Most of these neurotransmitters are synthesized from amino acids, intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA cycle, and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the cytoplasm of the presynaptic terminal. The rate of synthesis is generally regulated to correspond to the rate of firing of the neuron. Once they are synthesized, the neurotransmitters are transported into storage vesicles by an ATP-requiring pump linked with the proton gradient. Release from the storage vesicle is triggered by the nerve impulse that depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane and causes an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions through voltage-gated calcium channels. The influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ promotes fusion of the vesicle with the synaptic membrane and release of the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. The transmission across the synapse is completed by binding of the neurotransmitter to a receptor on the postsynaptic membrane (Fig. 46.3).

## TABLE 46.1 Features Common to Neurotransmitters ${ }^{a}$

- Synthesis from amino acid and common metabolic precursors usually occurs in the cytoplasm of the presynaptic nerve terminal. The synthetic enzymes are transported by fast axonal transport from the cell body, where they are synthesized, to the presynaptic terminal.
- The synthesis of the neurotransmitter is regulated to correspond to the rate of firing of the neuron, both acutely and through long-term enhancement of synaptic transmission.
- The neurotransmitter is actively taken up into storage vesicles in the presynaptic terminal.
- The neurotransmitter acts at a receptor on the postsynaptic membrane.
- The action of the neurotransmitter is terminated through reuptake into the presynaptic terminal, diffusion away from the synapse, or enzymatic inactivation. The enzymatic inactivation may occur in the postsynaptic terminal, the presynaptic terminal, or an adjacent astrocyte or microglial cell.
- The blood-brain barrier affects the supply of precursors for neurotransmitter synthesis.
${ }^{a}$ Not all neurotransmitters exhibit all of these features. Nitric oxide is an exception to most of these generalities. Some neurotransmitters (epinephrine, serotonin, and histamine) are also secreted by cells other than neurons. Their synthesis and secretion by nonneuronal cells follows other principles.

The action of the neurotransmitter is terminated through reuptake into the presynaptic terminal, uptake into glial cells, diffusion away from the synapse, or enzymatic inactivation. The enzymatic inactivation may occur in the postsynaptic terminal, the presynaptic terminal or an adjacent astrocyte microglia cell, or in endothelial cells in the brain capillaries.

Not all neurotransmitters exhibit all of these features. Nitric oxide, because it is a gas, is an exception to most of these generalities. Some neurotransmitters are synthesized and secreted by both neurons and other cells (e.g., epinephrine, serotonin, histamine).

## B. Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and Epinephrine

## I. Synthesis of the Catecholamine Neurotransmitters

The three neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are synthesized in a common pathway from the amino acid L -tyrosine. Tyrosine is supplied in the diet or is synthesized in the liver from the essential amino acid phenylalanine by phenylalanine hydroxylase (see Chapter 37). The pathway of catecholamine biosynthesis is shown in Figure 46.4.
![ma60039756a7](ma60039756a7.jpg)

Drugs have been developed that block neurotransmitter uptake into storage vesicles. Reserpine, which blocks catecholamine uptake into vesicles, had been used as an antihypertensive and antiepileptic drug for many years, but it was noted that a small percentage of patients on the drug became depressed and even suicidal. Animals treated with reserpine showed signs of lethargy and poor appetite, similar to depression in humans. Thus, a link was forged between monoamine release and depression in humans.

![ma61039756a7](ma61039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 46.4 The pathways of catecholamine and melanin biosynthesis. The dark boxes indicate the enzymes, which, when defective, lead to albinism. $B H_{2}$, dihydrobiopterin; $B H_{4}$, tetrahydrobiopterin; Dopa, dihydroxyphenylalanine; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate.

The first and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of these neurotransmitters from tyrosine is the hydroxylation of the tyrosine ring by tyrosine hydroxylase, a tetrahydrobiopterin $\left(\mathrm{BH}_{4}\right)$-requiring enzyme. The product formed is dihydroxyphenylalanine ( L-DOPA). The phenyl ring with two adjacent -OH groups is a catechol; hence, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are called catecholamines.

The second step in catecholamine synthesis is the decarboxylation of L-DOPA to form dopamine. This reaction, like many decarboxylation reactions of amino acids, requires pyridoxal phosphate. Dopaminergic neurons (neurons that use dopamine as a neurotransmitter) stop the synthesis at this point because these neurons do not synthesize the enzymes required for the subsequent steps.

Neurons that secrete norepinephrine synthesize it from dopamine in a hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by dopamine $\beta$-hydroxylase (DBH). This enzyme is present only within the storage vesicles of these cells. Like tyrosine hydroxylase, it is a mixed-function oxidase that requires an electron donor. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) serves as the electron donor and is oxidized in the reaction. Copper $\left(\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}\right)$ is a bound cofactor that is required for the electron transfer.

Although the adrenal medulla is the major site of epinephrine synthesis, epinephrine is also synthesized in a few neurons that use it as a neurotransmitter. These neurons contain the above pathway for norepinephrine synthesis and in addition contain the enzyme that transfers a methyl group from $S$-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to norepinephrine to form epinephrine. Thus, epinephrine synthesis is dependent on the presence of adequate levels of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate in order to produce the SAM (see Chapter 38).

## 2. Storage and Release of Catecholamines

Ordinarily, only low concentrations of catecholamines are free in the cytosol, whereas high concentrations are found within the storage vesicles. Conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA and that of L-DOPA to dopamine occurs in the cytosol. Dopamine is then taken up into the storage vesicles. In norepinephrine-containing neurons, the final $\beta$-hydroxylation reaction occurs in the vesicles.

The catecholamines are transported into vesicles by the protein VMAT2 (vesicle monoamine transporter 2) (Fig. 46.5). The vesicle transporters contain 12 transmembrane domains and are homologous to a family of bacterial drug-resistance transporters, including P-glycoprotein. The mechanism that concentrates the catecholamines in the storage vesicles is an ATP-dependent process linked to a proton pump (secondary active transport). Protons are pumped into the vesicles by a vesicular ATPase (V-ATPase). The protons then exchange for the positively charged catecholamine via the transporter VMAT2. The influx of the catecholamine is thus driven by the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient across the vesicular membrane. The intravesicular concentration of catecholamines is approximately 0.5 M , roughly 100 times the cytosolic concentration. In the vesicles, the catecholamines exist in a complex with ATP and acidic proteins known as chromogranins.

The vesicles play a dual role: They maintain a ready supply of catecholamines at the nerve terminal that is available for immediate release, and they mediate the process of release. When an action potential reaches the nerve terminal, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels open, allowing an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, which promotes the fusion of vesicles with the neuronal membrane. The vesicles then discharge their soluble contents, including the neurotransmitters, ATP, chromogranins, and DBH, into the extraneuronal space by the process of exocytosis. In some cases, the catecholamines affect other neurons. In other cases, they circulate in the blood and initiate responses in peripheral tissues.

## 3. Inactivation and Degradation of Catecholamine Neurotransmitters

The action of catecholamines is terminated through reuptake into the presynaptic terminal and diffusion away from the synapse. Degradative enzymes are present in the presynaptic terminal and in adjacent cells, including glial cells and endothelial cells.
![ma62039756a7](ma62039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 46.5 Transport of catecholamines into storage vesicles. This is a secondary active transport based on the generation of a proton gradient across the vesicular membrane. $A D P$, adenosine diphosphate; $A T P$, adenosine triphosphate; DBH, dopamine $\beta$-hydroxylase; $N T^{+}$, positively charged neurotransmitter (catecholamine); V-ATPase, vesicular ATPase; VMAT2, vesicle monoamine transporter 2.

Chromogranins are required for the biogenesis of the secretory vesicles. When chromogranins are released from the vesicles, they can be proteolytically clipped to form bioactive peptides. Elevated levels of chromogranins in the circulation may be found in patients who have neuroendocrine tumors, such as pheochromocytomas.

In albinism, either the copper-dependent tyrosine hydroxylase of melanocytes (which is distinct from the tyrosine hydroxylase found in the adrenal medulla) or other enzymes that convert tyrosine to melanins may be defective. Individuals with albinism suffer from a lack of pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes; have vision problems; and are sensitive to sunlight.

Tyramine is a degradation product of tyrosine that can lead to headaches, palpitations, nausea and vomiting, and elevated blood pressure if it is present in large quantities. Tyramine stimulates norepinephrine release, which binds to norepinephrine receptors, stimulating them. Tyramine is inactivated by MAO-A, but if a person is taking an MAO inhibitor, foods containing tyramine should be avoided.

Two of the major reactions in the process of inactivation and degradation of catecholamines are catalyzed by monamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol $O$ methyltransferase (COMT). MAO is present on the outer mitochondrial membrane of many cells and oxidizes the carbon containing the amino group to an aldehyde, thereby releasing ammonium ion (Fig. 46.6). In the presynaptic terminal, MAO inactivates catecholamines that are not protected in storage vesicles. (Thus, drugs that deplete storage vesicles indirectly increase catecholamine degradation.) There are two isoforms of MAO with different specificities of action: MAO-A preferentially deaminates norepinephrine and serotonin, whereas MAO-B acts on a wide spectrum of phenylethylamines (phenylethyl refers to a $-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-$ group linked to a phenyl ring). MAO in the liver and other sites protects against the ingestion of dietary biogenic amines such as the tyramine found in many cheeses.

COMT is also found in many cells, including erythrocytes. It works on a broad spectrum of extraneuronal catechols and those that have diffused away from the synapse. COMT transfers a methyl group from SAM to a hydroxyl group on the catecholamine or its degradation product (see Fig. 46.6). Because the inactivation reaction requires SAM, it is indirectly dependent on vitamin $B_{12}$ and folate. The action of MAO and COMT can occur in almost any order, resulting in a large number of degradation products and intermediates, many of which appear in the urine. Cerebrospinal homovanillylmandelic acid (HVA) is an indicator of dopamine degradation. Its concentration is decreased in the brains of patients with Parkinson disease.

## 4. Regulation of Tyrosine Hydroxylase

Efficient regulatory mechanisms coordinate the synthesis of catecholamine neurotransmitters with the rate of firing. Tyrosine hydroxylase, the first committed step and rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway, is regulated by feedback inhibition that is coordinated with depolarization of the nerve terminal. Tyrosine hydroxylase is inhibited by free cytosolic catecholamines that compete at the binding site on the enzyme for the pterin cofactor ( $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$; see Chapter 37).

Depolarization of the nerve terminal activates tyrosine hydroxylase. Depolarization also activates several protein kinases (including protein kinase C, protein kinase A [the cAMP-dependent protein kinase], and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin-dependent [CAM] kinases) that phosphorylate tyrosine hydroxylase. These activation steps result in an enzyme that binds $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ more tightly, making it less sensitive to endproduct inhibition.

In addition to these short-term regulatory processes, a long-term process involves alterations in the amounts of tyrosine hydroxylase and DBH present in nerve terminals. When sympathetic neuronal activity is increased for a prolonged period, the amounts of messenger RNA that code for tyrosine hydroxylase and DBH are increased in the neuronal perikarya (the cell body of the neuron). The increased gene transcription may be the result of phosphorylation of $c$ AMP response elementbinding protein [CREB]; see Chapter 19) by protein kinase A or by other protein kinases. CREB then binds to the $c$ AMP response element [CRE]) in the promoter region of the gene (similar to the mechanism for the induction of gluconeogenic enzymes in the liver). The newly synthesized enzyme molecules are then transported down the axon to the nerve terminals. The concentration of dopamine decarboxylase in the terminal does not appear to change in response to neuronal activity.

## C. Metabolism of Serotonin

The pathway for the synthesis of serotonin from tryptophan is very similar to the pathway for the synthesis of norepinephrine from tyrosine (Fig. 46.7). The first enzyme of the pathway, tryptophan hydroxylase, uses an enzymatic mechanism similar to that of tyrosine and phenylalanine hydroxylase and requires $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ to hydroxylate the ring structure of tryptophan. The second step of the pathway is a decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by the same enzyme that decarboxylates DOPA. Serotonin, like the catecholamine neurotransmitters, can be inactivated by MAO.

The neurotransmitter melatonin is also synthesized from tryptophan (see Fig. 46.7). Melatonin is produced in the pineal gland in response to the light-dark cycle, its level in the blood rising in a dark environment. It is probably through melatonin that the pineal gland conveys information about light-dark cycles to the body, organizing seasonal and circadian rhythms. Melatonin also may be involved in regulating reproductive functions.

In addition to the catecholamines, serotonin is also inactivated by MAO. The activity of several antipsychotic drugs is based on inhibiting MAO. The first generation of drugs (exemplified by iproniazid, which was originally developed as an antituberculosis drug and was found to induce mood swings in patients) were irreversible inhibitors of both the A and B forms of MAO. Although they did reduce the severity of depression (by maintaining higher levels of serotonin), these drugs suffered from the "cheese" effect. Cheese and other foods that are processed over long periods (such as red wine) contain tyramine, a degradation product of tyrosine. Usually, tyramine is inactivated by MAO-A, but if an individual is taking an MAO inhibitor, tyramine levels increase. Tyramine induces the release of norepinephrine from storage vesicles, which leads to potentially life-threatening hypertensive episodes. When it was realized that MAO existed in two forms, selective irreversible inhibitors were developed; examples include clorgyline for MAO-A, and deprenyl for MAO-B. Deprenyl has been used to treat Parkinson disease (which is caused by a lack of dopamine, which is also inactivated by MAO). Deprenyl, however, is not an antidepressant. Clorgyline is an antidepressant but suffers from the "cheese" effect. This led to the development of the third generation of MAO inhibitors, which are reversible inhibitors of the enzyme, as typified by moclobemide. Moclobemide is a specific, reversible inhibitor of MAO-A and is effective as an antidepressant. More important, because of the reversible nature of the drug, the "cheese" effect is not observed, because as tyramine levels increase, they displace the drug from MAO and the
tyramine is safely inactivated. However, it has not been approved for use in the United States.

Katie C.'s doctor ordered plasma fractionated metanephrine (methylated epinephrine) levels and also had Katie collect a 24-hour urine specimen for the determination of catecholamines and their degradation products (in particular, metanephrine). All of these tests showed unequivocal elevations of these compounds in Katie's blood and urine. Katie was placed on phenoxybenzamine, an $\alpha_{1}$ - and $\alpha_{2}$-adrenergic receptor antagonist that blocks the pharmacologic effect of the elevated catecholamines on these receptors. Once stable on the $\alpha$-blockers, Katie was started on an agent that blocked $\beta$-adrenergic receptors (propranolol). After ruling out evidence to suggest metastatic disease to the liver or other organs (in case Katie's tumor was malignant), the doctor referred Katie to a surgeon with extensive experience in adrenal surgery. Katie's doctor also ordered diagnostic studies to rule out multiple endocrine neoplasm syndrome (MEN). The tests for the presence of MEN were negative.

A potential complication of using heparin as an anticoagulant is the generation of antiheparin antibodies in the patients. The production of such antibodies leads to the patient developing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The antiheparin antibodies bind to the heparin platelet factor 4 complex and also to the platelet surface. The antibody-induced binding leads to platelet activation, serotonin release, and thrombin activation. The platelet number drops (the thrombocytopenia), but thrombus formation (owing to thrombin activation) increases.To determine whether a patient has developed HIT, the serotoninrelease assay has emerged as the gold standard. Platelets store serotonin in granules and release the serotonin upon activation. Antiheparin antbodysensitive platelets are obtained from donors and incubated with radioactively labeled serotonin, in order for the platelets to incorporate the serotonin. The treated platelets are then incubated with two samples of the patient's sera: one with a high level of exogenous heparin and the second with a low level of heparin. Serotonin release is then measured by determining the percentage of total radioactivity released by the platelets into the assay buffer: A positive result is obtained if, when using a low concentration of heparin, $>20 \%$ of the radioactivity incorporated into the platelets is released and, when using the high concentration of heparin, $<20 \%$ of the incorporated radioactivity is released. The rationale behind the use of high heparin levels is to titrate out the antibody in the sera such that it cannot bind to the platelet cell surface and to demonstrate that the release is caused by antibody binding to platelets.

0The catecholamines exert their physiologic and pharmacologic effects by circulating in the bloodstream to target cells whose plasma membranes contain catecholamine receptors. This interaction initiates a biochemical cascade leading to responses that are specific for different types of cells. Patients such as Katie C. experience palpitations, excessive sweating, hypertensive headaches, and a host of other symptoms when a catecholamine-producing tumor of the adrenal medulla suddenly secretes supraphysiologic amounts of epinephrine and/or norepinephrine into the venous blood draining from the neoplasm.

## D. Metabolism of Histamine

Within the brain, histamine is produced both by mast cells and by certain neuronal fibers. Mast cells are a family of bone marrow-derived secretory cells that store and release high concentrations of histamine. They are prevalent in the thalamus, hypothalamus, dura mater, leptomeninges, and choroid plexus. Histaminergic neuronal cell bodies in the human are found in the tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior basal hypothalamus. The fibers project into nearly all areas of the CNS, including the cerebral cortex, the brainstem, and the spinal cord.

Histamine is synthesized from histidine in a single enzymatic step. The enzyme histidine decarboxylase requires pyridoxal phosphate, and its mechanism is very similar to that of DOPA decarboxylase (Fig. 46.8).

Like other neurotransmitters, newly synthesized neuronal histamine is stored in the nerve terminal vesicles. Depolarization of nerve terminals activates the

exocytotic release of histamine by a voltage-dependent as well as a calciumdependent mechanism.

Once it is released from neurons, histamine is thought to activate both postsynaptic and presynaptic receptors. Unlike other neurotransmitters, histamine does not appear to be recycled into the presynaptic terminal to any great extent. However, astrocytes have a specific high-affinity uptake system for histamine and may be the major sites of the inactivation and degradation of this monoamine.

The first step in the inactivation of histamine in the brain is methylation (see Fig. 46.8). The enzyme histamine methyltransferase transfers a methyl group from SAM to a ring nitrogen of histamine to form methylhistamine. The second step is oxidation by MAO-B, followed by an additional oxidation step. In peripheral tissues, histamine undergoes deamination by diamine oxidase, followed by oxidation to a carboxylic acid (see Fig. 46.8).

## E. Acetylcholine

## I. Synthesis

The synthesis of acetylcholine from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and choline is catalyzed by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (Fig. 46.9). This synthetic step occurs in the presynaptic terminal. The compound is stored in vesicles and later released through calcium-mediated exocytosis. Choline is taken up by the presynaptic terminal from the blood via a low-affinity transport system (high $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ ) and from the synaptic cleft via a high-affinity transport mechanism (low $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ ). It is also derived from the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (and possibly sphingomyelin) in membrane lipids. Thus, membrane lipids may form a storage site for choline, and their hydrolysis, with the subsequent release of choline, is highly regulated.

Evan A. was placed on Redux (dexfenfluramine hydrochloride), which increased the secretion of serotonin. Serotonin has been implicated in many processes, including mood control and appetite regulation. Serotonin agonists are thought to exert their hypophagic actions via stimulation of receptors located on proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-containing neurons within the aruate (ARC) nucleus of the hypothalamus. When serotonin levels are high, satiety results; when serotonin levels are low, increased appetite, or depression, or both, can occur. Thus, drugs that can increase serotonin levels may be able to control appetite and depression. Redux was a secondgeneration drug developed from fenfluramine, a known appetite suppressant. When it was first used, fenfluramine could not be resolved between two distinct optical isomers ( 0 versus 1 ). The 1 -isomer induced sleepiness, so to counteract this effect, fenfluramine was often given with phentermine, which elevated norepinephrine levels to counteract the drowsiness (the combination of drugs was known as fen/phen). Once the two isomers of fenfluramine could be resolved, Redux-dexfenfluramine-was developed. Because levels of serotonin have been linked to mood, many antidepressant drugs were developed that affect serotonin levels. The first of these is the MAO inhibitors, a second class is the tricyclics, and the third class is known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The SSRIs block reuptake of serotonin from the synapse, leading to an elevated response to serotonin. Redux not only acted as an SSRI but also increased the secretion of serotonin, leading to elevated levels of this compound in the synapse. None of the other drugs that affect serotonin levels has this effect.

Histamine elicits several effects on different tissues. Histamine is the major mediator of the allergic response, and when it is released from mast cells (a type of white blood cell found in tissues), it leads to vasodilation and an increase in the permeability of blood vessel walls. This leads to the allergic symptoms of a runny nose and watering eyes. When histamine is released in the lungs, the airways constrict in an attempt to reduce the intake of the allergic material. The ultimate result of this, however, is bronchospasm, which can lead to difficulty in breathing. In the brain, histamine is an excitatory neurotransmitter. Antihistamines block histamine from binding to its receptor. In the tissues, this counteracts histamine's effect on vasodilation and blood vessel wall permeability, but in the brain, the effect is to cause drowsiness. The new generation of "nondrowsy" antihistamines have been modified so that they cannot pass through the bloodbrain barrier. Thus, the effects on the peripheral tissues are retained, with no effect on CNS histamine response.

It is believed that the vitamin $B_{12}$ requirement for choline synthesis contributes to the neurologic symptoms of vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency. The methyl groups for choline synthesis are donated by SAM, which is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine in the reaction. Recall that formation of SAM through recycling of homocysteine requires both $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ and vitamin $B_{12}$ (unless extraordinary amounts of methionine are available to bypass the vitamin $B_{12}$-dependent methionine synthase step).

The supply of choline in the brain can become rate-limiting for acetylcholine synthesis, and supplementation of the diet with lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) has been used (although without clear effects) to increase brain acetylcholine in patients suffering from tordive dyskinesia (often persistent involuntary movements of the facial muscles and tongue). The neonate has a very high demand for choline, for both brain lipid synthesis (phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) and acetylcholine biosynthesis. High levels of phosphatidylcholine in maternal milk and a high activity of a high-affinity transport system through the blood-brain barrier for choline in the neonate help to maintain brain choline concentrations. The fetus also has a high demand for choline, and there is a high-affinity transport system for choline across the placenta. The choline is derived from maternal stores, maternal diet, and synthesis primarily in the maternal liver. Because choline synthesis is dependent on folate and vitamin $B_{12}$, the high fetal demand may contribute to the increased maternal requirement for both vitamins during pregnancy.

An inherited pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, a thiamin deficiency, or hypoxia deprives the brain of a source of acetyl-CoA for acetylcholine synthesis, as well as a source of acetyl-CoA for ATP generation from the TCA cycle.
![ma66039756a7](ma66039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 46.9 Acetylcholine synthesis and degradation. CoA, coenzyme A.

Choline is a common component of the diet but also can be synthesized in humans as part of the pathway for the synthesis of phospholipids (see Chapter 31). The only route for choline synthesis is via the sequential addition of three methyl groups from SAM to the ethanolamine portion of phosphatidylethanolamine to form phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylcholine is subsequently hydrolyzed to release choline or phosphocholine. Conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine occurs in many tissues, including liver and brain. This conversion is folate- and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-dependent.

The acetyl group used for acetylcholine synthesis is derived principally from glucose oxidation to pyruvate and decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA via the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. This is because neuronal tissues have only a limited capacity to oxidize fatty acids to acetyl-CoA, so glucose oxidation is the major source of acetyl groups. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is found only in mitochondria. The acetyl group is probably transported to the cytoplasm as part of citrate, which is then cleaved in the cytosol to form acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate.

## 2. Inactivation of Acetylcholine

Acetylcholine is inactivated by acetylcholinesterase, which is a serine esterase that forms a covalent bond with the acetyl group. The enzyme is inhibited by a wide range of compounds (pharmacologic agents and neurotoxins) that form a covalent bond with this reactive serine group. Neurotoxins such as sarin (the gas used in Japanese subways by a terrorist group) and the nerve gas in the movie The Rock work through this mechanism. Acetylcholine is the major neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junctions; inability to inactivate this molecule leads to constant activation of the nerve-muscle synapses, a condition that leads to varying degrees of paralysis.

## F. Glutamate and $\gamma$-Aminobutyric Acid

## I. Synthesis of Glutamate

Glutamate functions as an excitatory neurotransmitter within the CNS, leading to the depolarization of neurons. Within nerve terminals, glutamate is generally synthesized de novo from glucose rather than taken up from the blood because its plasma concentration is low and it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.

Glutamate is synthesized primarily from the TCA cycle intermediate $\alpha$ ketoglutarate (Fig. 46.10). This process can occur via either of two routes. The first is via the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, which reduces $\alpha$-ketoglutarate to glutamate, thereby incorporating free ammonia into the carbon backbone. The ammonia pool is provided by amino acid/neurotransmitter degradation or by diffusion of ammonia across the blood-brain barrier. The second route is through transamination reactions in which an amino group is transferred from other amino acids to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate to form

![ma67039756a7](ma67039756a7.jpg)

glutamate. Glutamate also can be synthesized from glutamine, using glutaminase. The glutamine is derived from glial cells, as described in Section III.F.2.

Like other neurotransmitters, glutamate is stored in vesicles, and its release is $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent. It is removed from the synaptic cleft by high-affinity uptake systems in nerve terminals and glial cells.

## 2. $\gamma$-Aminobutyric Acid

GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS. Its functional significance is far-reaching, and altered GABAergic function plays a role in many neurologic and psychiatric disorders.

GABA is synthesized by the decarboxylation of glutamate (see Fig. 46.10) in a single step catalyzed by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). GABA is recycled in the CNS by a series of reactions called the GABA shunt, which conserves glutamate and GABA (see Fig. 46.10).

Much of the uptake of GABA occurs in glial cells. The GABA shunt in glial cells produces glutamate, which is converted to glutamine and transported out of the glial cells to neurons, where it is converted back to glutamate. Glutamine thus serves as a transporter of glutamate between cells in the CNS (see Chapter 40). Glial cells lack GAD and cannot synthesize GABA.

0Tiagabine is a drug that inhibits the reuptake of GABA from the synapse, and it has been used to treat epilepsy as well as other convulsant disorders. Because GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, its prolonged presence can block neurotransmission by other agents, thereby reducing the frequency of convulsions.

FIGURE 46.II Action of nitric oxide (NO) in vasodilation. The synthesis of NO occurs in response to a stimulator binding to a receptor on some cells or to a nerve impulse in neurons. NO enters smooth muscle cells, stimulating guanylate cyclase to produce cGMP, which causes smooth muscle cell relaxation. When the smooth muscle cells relax, blood vessels dilate.

NO can also diffuse to cell $B$, and stimulate cell $B$ to produce a different neurotransmitter to elicit a response from cell $D . N T$, neurotransmitter.

## G. Other Amino Acid Neurotransmitters

## I. Aspartate

Aspartate, like glutamate, is an excitatory neurotransmitter, but it functions in far fewer pathways. It is synthesized from the TCA cycle intermediate oxaloacetate via transamination reactions. Like glutamate synthesis, aspartate synthesis uses oxaloacetate that must be replaced through anaplerotic reactions. Aspartate cannot pass through the blood-brain barrier.

## 2. Glycine

Glycine is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord. Most of the glycine in neurons is synthesized de novo within the nerve terminal from serine by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which requires folic acid. Serine, in turn, is synthesized from the intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate in the glycolytic pathway. The action of glycine is probably terminated via uptake by a high-affinity transporter.

## 3. Conversion of Arginine to Nitric Oxide

Nitric oxide (NO) is a biologic messenger in a variety of physiologic responses, including vasodilation, neurotransmission, and the ability of the immune system to kill tumor cells and parasites. NO is synthesized from arginine in a reaction catalyzed by NO synthase (see Fig. 25.10).

NO synthase exists as tissue-specific forms of two families of enzymes. The form present in macrophages is responsible for overproduction of NO, leading to its cytotoxic actions on parasites and tumor cells. The enzyme present in nervous tissue, vascular endothelium, platelets, and other tissues is responsible for the physiologic responses to NO such as vasodilation and neural transmission. In target cells, NO activates a soluble guanylate cyclase, which results in increased cellular levels of $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (Fig. 46.11). In smooth muscle cells, cGMP, like cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), activates one or more protein kinases, which are responsible for the relaxation of smooth muscle and the subsequent dilation of vessels. NO stimulates penile erection by acting as a neurotransmitter, stimulating smooth muscle relaxation that permits the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood. Nitric oxide can readily cross cell membranes because it is a gas. As a result, its effect may not necessarily be limited to the neuron that synthesizes it (Fig. 46.12). There is ample evidence that NO may function as a retrograde messenger that can influence neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal after diffusing from the postsynaptic neuron (where it is synthesized). There is also evidence supporting retrograde messenger roles for both arachidonic acid and carbon monoxide in the CNS.

## IV. Metabolic Encephalopathies and Neuropathies

The brain has an absolute dependence on the blood for its supply of glucose and oxygen. It uses approximately $20 \%$ of the oxygen supply of the body. During the developmental period and during prolonged fasting, ketone bodies can be used as a fuel, but they cannot totally substitute for glucose. Glucose is converted to pyruvate in glycolysis, and the pyruvate is oxidized in the TCA cycle. Anaerobic glycolysis, with a yield of two molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose, cannot sustain the ATP requirement of the brain, which can be provided only by the complete oxidation of glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which yields approximately 32 ATP/glucose. However, during periods of mild hypoglycemia or mild hypoxia, decreased neurotransmitter synthesis contributes as much, if not more, to the development of symptoms, as does an absolute deficiency of ATP for energy needs.

## A. Hypoglycemic Encephalopathy

Hypoglycemia is sometimes encountered in medical conditions such as malignancies that produce insulin or insulinlike growth factors, or chronic alcoholism. Early clinical signs in hypoglycemia reflect the appearance of physiologic protective mechanisms initiated by hypothalamic sensory nuclei, such as sweating, palpitations, anxiety, and hunger. If these symptoms are ignored, they proceed to a more serious CNS disorder, progressing through confusion and lethargy to seizures and, eventually, coma. Prolonged hypoglycemia can lead to irreversible brain damage.

During the progression of hypoglycemic encephalopathy, as blood glucose falls to $<2.5 \mathrm{mM}(45 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$, the brain attempts to use internal substrates such as glutamate and TCA cycle intermediates as fuels. Because the pool size of these substrates is quite small, they are quickly depleted. If blood glucose levels continue to fall to $<1 \mathrm{mM}(18 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$, ATP levels become depleted.

As the blood glucose level drops from 2.5 to 2.0 mM ( 45 to $36 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, before electroencephalographic [EEG] changes are observed), the symptoms appear to arise from decreased synthesis of neurotransmitters in particular regions of the brain rather than a global energy deficit. The oxidation of glucose in glycolysis provides 3-phosphoglycerate, a precursor for the neurotransmitter glycine. Pyruvate entry into the mitochondria and conversion to acetyl-CoA can generate $\alpha$-ketoglutarate (for glutamate and GABA synthesis) and oxaloacetate, for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter aspartate. A lack of glucose could disrupt the synthesis of these neurotransmitters.

As hypoglycemia progresses below $1 \mathrm{mM}(18 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$ and high-energy phosphate levels are depleted, the EEG becomes isoelectric, and neuronal cell death ensues. As is the case in some other metabolic encephalopathies, cell death is not global in distribution; rather, certain brain structures-in particular, hippocampal and cortical structures-are selectively vulnerable to hypoglycemic insult. Pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for neuronal cell death in hypoglycemia include the involvement of glutamate excitotoxicity. Glutamate excitotoxicity occurs when the cellular energy reserves are depleted. The failure of the energy-dependent reuptake pumps results in a buildup of glutamate in the synaptic cleft and overstimulation of the postsynaptic glutamate receptors. The prolonged glutamate receptor activation leads to prolonged opening of the receptor ion channel and the influx of lethal amounts of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion, which can activate cytotoxic intracellular pathways in the postsynaptic neuron.

## B. Hypoxic Encephalopathy

Experimental studies with human volunteers show that cerebral energy metabolism remains normal when mild to moderate hypoxia (partial pressure of oxygen $\left[\mathrm{PaO}_{2}\right]$ $=25$ to 40 mm Hg ) results in severe cognitive dysfunction. The diminished cognitive function is believed to result from impaired neurotransmitter synthesis. In mild hypoxia, cerebral blood flow increases to maintain oxygen delivery to the brain. In addition, anaerobic glycolysis is accelerated, resulting in maintenance of ATP levels. This occurs, however, at the expense of an increase of lactate production and a fall of pH . Acute hypoxia $\left(\mathrm{PaO}_{2} \leq 20 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\right)$ generally results in a coma.

Hypoxia can result from insufficient oxygen reaching the blood (e.g., at high altitudes), severe anemia (e.g., iron deficiency), or a direct insult to the oxygenusing capacity of the brain (e.g., cyanide poisoning). All forms of hypoxia result in diminished neurotransmitter synthesis. Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase diminishes acetylcholine synthesis, which is acutely sensitive to hypoxia. Glutamate and GABA synthesis, which depend on a functioning TCA cycle, are decreased as a result of elevated reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) levels, which inhibit TCA-cycle enzymes. NADH levels are increased when oxygen is unavailable to accept electrons from the electron-transport chain and NADH cannot be readily converted back into $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. Even the synthesis of catecholamine neurotransmitters may be decreased because the hydroxylase reactions require $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

# C. Relationship between Glutamate Synthesis and the Anaplerotic Pathways of Pyruvate Carboxylase and Methylmalonyl Coenzyme A Mutase 

Synthesis of glutamate removes $\alpha$-ketoglutarate from the TCA cycle, thereby decreasing the regeneration of oxaloacetate in the TCA cycle. Because oxaloacetate is necessary for the oxidation of acetyl-CoA, oxaloacetate must be replaced by anaplerotic reactions. There are two major types of anaplerotic reactions: (1) pyruvate carboxylase and (2) the degradative pathway of the branched-chain amino acids valine and isoleucine, which contribute succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) to the TCA cycle. This pathway uses vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ (but not folate) in the reaction catalyzed by methylmalonyl coenzyme A (methylmalonyl-CoA) mutase.

## V. Lipid Synthesis in the Brain and Peripheral Nervous System

Several features of lipid synthesis and degradation in the nervous system distinguish it from most other tissues. The first is that the portion of the neuronal cell membrane involved in synaptic transmission has a unique role and a unique composition. At the presynaptic terminal, the lipid composition changes rapidly as storage vesicles containing the neurotransmitter fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents. Portions of the membrane are also lost as endocytotic vesicles. On the postsynaptic terminal, the membrane contains the receptors for the neurotransmitter as well as a high concentration of membrane signaling components, such as phosphatidylinositol. A second important feature of brain lipid metabolism is that the blood-brain barrier restricts the entry of nonessential fatty acids, such as palmitate, that are released from adipose tissue or present in the diet. Conversely, essential fatty acids are taken up by the brain. Because of these considerations, the brain is constantly synthesizing those lipids (cholesterol, fatty acids, glycosphingolipids, and phospholipids), which it needs for various neurologic functions. Neuronal signaling also requires that nonneuronal glial cells synthesize myelin, a multilayered membrane that surrounds the axons of many neurons. Myelin is lipid-rich and has a different lipid composition than the neuronal membranes. The white matter in the brain contains significantly more myelin than the gray matter; it is the presence of myelin sheaths that is responsible for the characteristic color differences that exist between the two types of brain tissue.

## A. Brain Lipid Synthesis and Oxidation

Because the blood-brain barrier significantly inhibits the entry of certain fatty acids and lipids into the CNS, virtually all lipids found there must be synthesized within the CNS. The exceptions are the essential fatty acids (linoleic and linolenic acid), which do enter the brain, where they are elongated or further desaturated. The uptake of fatty acids into the CNS is insufficient to meet the energy demands of the CNShence, the requirement for aerobic glucose metabolism. Thus, cholesterol, glycerol, sphingolipids, glycosphingolipids, and cerebrosides are all synthesized using pathways discussed previously in this text. Of particular note is that very-long-chain fatty acids are synthesized in the brain, where they play a major role in myelin formation.

Oxidation and turnover of brain lipids occurs as described previously (see Chapter 30). Peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation is important in the brain because the brain contains very-long-chain fatty acids and phytanic acid (from the diet), both of which are oxidized in the peroxisomes by $\alpha$-oxidation. Thus, disorders that affect peroxisome biogenesis (such as Refsum disease) severely affect brain cells because of the inability to metabolize both branched-chain and very-long-chain fatty acids. If there is a disorder in which the degradation of glycosphingolipids or mucopolysaccharides is impaired, lysosomes in brain cells become engorged with partially digested glycolipids, leading to varying degrees of neurologic dysfunction.

# B. Myelin Synthesis 

A rapid rate of nerve conduction in the peripheral and central motor nerves depends on the formation of myelin, a multilayered lipid and protein structure that is formed from the plasma membrane of glial cells. In the PNS, the Schwann cell is responsible for myelinating one portion of an axon of one nerve cell. The Schwann cell does this by wrapping itself around the axon multiple times so that a multilayered sheath of membrane surrounds the axon. In the CNS, the oligodendrocyte is responsible for myelination. Unlike the Schwann cell, oligodendrocytes can myelinate portions of numerous axons (up to 40), and do so by extending a thin process that wraps around the axon multiple times. Thus, CNS axons are surrounded only by the membranes of oligodendrocytes, whereas axons in the PNS are surrounded by the entire Schwann cell. A generalized view of myelination is depicted in Figure 46.13. To maintain the myelin structure, the oligodendrocyte synthesizes four times its own weight in lipids per day.

## I. Myelin Lipids

As the plasma membrane of the glial cell is converted into myelin, the lipid composition of the brain changes (Table 46.2). The lipid-to-protein ratio is greatly increased, as is the content of sphingolipids. The myelin is a tightly packed structure, and there are significant hydrophobic interactions between the lipids and proteins to allow this to occur. Cerebrosides constitute approximately $16 \%$ of total myelin lipid and are almost completely absent from other cell-type membrane lipids. The predominant cerebroside, galactosylcerebroside, has a single sugar attached to the hydroxyl group of the sphingosine. In contrast, sphingomyelin, which one might guess is the predominant lipid of myelin, is present in roughly the same low concentration

FIGURE 46.13 A composite diagram indicating a Schwann cell that has wrapped around a portion of an axon, forming the myelin sheath. The expansion represents a portion of the myelin sheath. Central nervous system myelin is shown, although it is similar to peripheral nervous system myelin except that P0 replaces proteolipid protein. Recall that there are multiple layers of membrane surrounding the axon; proteolipid protein protrudes into the extracellular space and aids in compaction of the membranes through hydrophobic interactions. Myelin basic proteins help to stabilize the structure from within the membrane.

in all membranes. Galactocerebrosides pack more tightly together than phosphatidylcholine; the sugar, although polar, carries no positively charged amino group or negatively charged phosphate. The brain synthesizes very-long-chain fatty acids ( $>20$ carbons long); these long uncharged side chains develop strong hydrophobic associations, allowing close packing of the myelin sheath. The high cholesterol content of the membrane also contributes to the tight packing, although the myelin proteins are also required to complete the tightness of the packing process.

# 2. Myelin Structural Proteins 

The layers of myelin are held together by protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions, and any disruption can lead to demyelination of the membrane (see "Biochemical Comments"). Although numerous proteins are found in both the CNS and PNS, only the major proteins are discussed here. The major proteins in the CNS and PNS are different. In the CNS, two proteins constitute between $60 \%$ and $80 \%$ of the total proteins-proteolipid protein and myelin basic proteins (MBPs). The proteolipid protein is a very hydrophobic protein that forms large aggregates in aqueous solution and is relatively resistant to proteolysis. Its molecular weight, based on sequence analysis, is $30,000 \mathrm{Da}$. Proteolipid protein is highly conserved in sequence among species. Its role is thought to be one of promoting the formation and stabilization of the multilayered myelin structure.

The MBPs are a family of proteins. Unlike proteolipid protein, MBPs are easily extracted from the membrane and are soluble in aqueous solution. The major MBP has no tertiary structure and has a molecular weight of $15,000 \mathrm{Da}$. MBP is located on the cytoplasmic face of myelin membranes. Antibodies directed against MBPs elicit experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), which has become a model system for understanding multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disease. A model of how proteolipid protein and MBPs aid in stabilizing myelin is shown in Figure 46.13.

In the PNS, the major myelin protein is P0, a glycoprotein that accounts for $>50 \%$ of the PNS myelin protein content. The molecular weight of P0 is $30,000 \mathrm{Da}$, the same as proteolipid protein. P0 is thought to play a similar structural role in maintaining myelin structure as proteolipid protein does in the CNS. MBPs are also found in the PNS, with some similarities and differences to the MBPs found in the CNS. The major PNS-specific MBP has been designated P2.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

Katie C. Catecholamines affect nearly every tissue and organ in the body. Their integrated release from nerve endings of the sympathetic (adrenergic) nervous system plays a critical role in the reflex responses we make to sudden changes in our internal and external environment. For example, under stress, catecholamines appropriately increase heart rate, blood pressure, myocardial (heart muscle) contractility, and conduction velocity of the heart.

Episodic, inappropriate secretion of catecholamines in supraphysiologic amounts, such as occurs in patients with pheochromocytomas, like Katie C., causes an often acute and alarming array of symptoms and signs of a hyperadrenergic state.

Most of the signs and symptoms related to catecholamine excess can be masked by phenoxybenzamine, a long-acting $\alpha_{1}$ - and $\alpha_{2}$-adrenergic receptor antagonist, combined with a $\beta_{1}$ - and $\beta_{2}$-adrenergic receptor blocker such as propranolol. Pharmacologic therapy alone is reserved for patients with inoperable pheochromocytomas (e.g., patients with malignant tumors with metastases and patients with severe heart disease). Because of the sudden, unpredictable, and sometimes life-threatening discharges of large amounts of catecholamines from these tumors, definitive therapy involves surgical resection of the neoplasms after appropriate preoperative preparation of the patient with the agents mentioned above. Katie's tumor was resected without intraoperative or postoperative complications. After surgery, she remained free of symptoms and her blood pressure decreased to normal levels.

Evan A. Evan A., after stopping Redux, was placed on Prozac, an antidepressant that acts as an SSRI but does not lead to increased synthesis or secretion of serotonin, as did the dexfenfluramine in Redux. Thus, the mechanism of action of these two drugs is different, even if the end result (elevated levels of serotonin) is the same. Unfortunately, Prozac did not work as well for Mr. A. as did Redux, and he regained his 50 lb within 1 year after switching medications. Redux was withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer because of reports of heart valve abnormalities in a small percentage of patients who had taken either fenfluramine and phentermine (phen/fen) or Redux. Since then, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of Redux for weight loss because of the undesirable side effects. Mr. A. now has several other options. Other medical treatments include orlistat, a partial inhibitor of dietary fatty acid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract; phentermine alone (described previously); and several medications used to treat other conditions, including diabetes, seizures, and depression, that also lead to weight loss. These latter agents are not FDA-approved for weight loss, and thus, Evan's physician did not want to try any more medications with him. Instead, the physician referred Evan for bariatric surgery.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

$\stackrel{\infty}{\infty}$
Demyelinating Diseases of the Central Nervous System. The importance of myelin in nerve transmission is underscored by the wide variety of demyelinating diseases, all of which lead to neurologic symptoms. The bestknown disease in this class is multiple sclerosis (MS). MS can be a progressive disease of the CNS in which demyelination of CNS neurons is the key anatomic and pathologic finding. The cause of MS has yet to be determined, although it is believed that an event occurs that triggers the formation of autoimmune antibodies directed against components of the nervous system. This event could be a bacterial or viral infection that stimulates the immune system to fight off the invaders. Unfortunately, this stimulus may also trigger the autoimmune response that leads to the antibodymediated demyelinating process. The unusual geographic distribution of MS is of interest. Patients are concentrated in northern and southern latitudes, yet its incidence is almost nil at the Equator. Clinical presentation of MS varies widely. It can

be a mild disease that has few or no obvious clinical manifestations. At the other end of the spectrum, is a rapidly progressive and fatal disease. The most well-known presentation is the relapsing-remitting type. In this type, early in the course of the disease, the natural history is one of exacerbations followed by remission. Eventually, the CNS cannot repair the damage that has accumulated through the years, and remissions occur less and less frequently. Available treatments for MS target the relapsing-remitting type of disease.

The primary injury to the CNS in MS is the loss of myelin in the white matter, which interferes with nerve conduction along the demyelinated area (the insulator is lost). The CNS compensates by stimulating the oligodendrocyte to remyelinate the damaged axon, and when this occurs, remission is achieved. Often remyelination leads to a slowing in conduction velocity because of a reduced myelin thickness (speed is proportional to myelin thickness) or a shortening of the internodal distances (the action potential has to be propagated more times). Eventually, when it becomes too difficult to remyelinate large areas of the CNS, the neuron adapts by upregulating and redistributing along its membrane ion pumps to allow nerve conductance along demyelinated axons. Eventually, this adaptation also fails and the disease progresses.

Treatment of MS is now based on blocking the action of the immune system. Because antibodies directed against cellular components appear to be responsible for the progression of the disease (regardless of how the autoantibodies were first generated), agents that interfere with immune responses have had various levels of success in keeping patients in remission for extended periods.

Other demyelinating diseases also exist, and their cause is much more straightforward. These are relatively rare disorders. In all of these diseases, there is no fully effective treatment for the patient. Inherited mutations in P0 (the major PNS myelin protein) leads to a version of Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy syndrome. The inheritance pattern for this disease is autosomal-dominant, indicating that the expression of one mutated allele leads to expression of the disease. Mutations in proteolipid protein (the major myelin protein in the CNS) lead to PelizaeusMerzbacher disease and X-linked spastic paraplegia type 2 disease. These diseases display a wide range of phenotypes, from a lack of motor development and early death (most severe) to mild gait disturbances. The phenotype displayed depends on the precise location of the mutation within the protein. An altered function of either P0 or proteolipid protein leads to demyelination and its subsequent clinical manifestations.

The nervous system consists of a variety of cell types with different functions. Neurons transmit and receive signals from other neurons at synaptic junctions. Astrocytes, found in the CNS, provide physical and nutritional support for the neurons.
Oligodendrocytes provide the myelin sheath that coats the axon, providing insulation for the electric signal that is propagated along the axon.

Myelin has a lipid composition that is distinct from that of cellular membranes.
A lack of myelin leads to demyelinating diseases as a result of impaired signal transmission across the axon.
Schwann cells are the supporting cells (and myelin-producing cells) of the PNS.
Microglial cells destroy invading microorganisms and phagocytose cellular debris.
Ependymal cells line the cavities of the CNS and spinal cord.

The brain is protected against bloodborne toxic agents by the blood-brain barrier.

Glucose, amino acids, vitamins, ketone bodies, and essential fatty acids (but not other fatty acids) can all be transported across the blood-brain barrier.
Proteins, such as insulin, can cross the blood-brain barrier by receptormediated transcytosis.
Neurotransmitters are synthesized primarily from amino acids in the nervous system; others are derived from intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA cycle.

Neurotransmitters are synthesized in the cytoplasm of the presynaptic terminal and then transported into storage vesicles for release upon receiving the appropriate signal.
Neurotransmitter action is terminated by reuptake into the presynaptic terminal, by diffusion away from the synapse, or by enzymatic inactivation.
MAO is a key enzyme for the inactivation of the catecholamines and serotonin.
An encephalopathy will develop if the nervous system cannot generate sufficient ATP:

Hypoglycemic encephalopathy (lack of glucose to the brain)
Hypoxic encephalopathy (lack of oxygen to the brain)
Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 46.3.

A. A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet to produce ketone bodies as a fuel for the brain
B. A high-carbohydrate diet to increase glucose transport into the brain
C. A high-protein diet to enhance gluconeogenesis and increase blood glucose levels
D. Insulin therapy to increase the number of glucose transporters in the endothelial cells lining the bloodbrain barrier
E. A high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet to increase free fatty acid levels in the blood for use by the nervous system

1. The answer is $\mathbf{B}$. The symptoms exhibited by the patient are caused by excessive release of epinephrine or norepinephrine. Vanillylmandelic acid is also the degradation product of norepinephrine; thus, these hormones are being overproduced. Acetylcholine degradation leads to the formation of acetic acid and choline, which are not observed (thus, A is incorrect). Although DOPA degradation could lead to vanillylmandelic acid production, serotonin degradation does not (it leads to 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid), and the symptoms exhibited by the patient are not consistent with DOPA or serotonin overproduction (thus, C is incorrect). Histamine and melatonin also do not produce the symptoms exhibited by the patient (thus, D and E are incorrect).
2. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. Myelin contains very high levels of cholesterol and cerebrosides, particularly galactosylcerebrosides.
3. The answer is $\mathbf{E}$. MBP is a basic protein, indicating that it must contain a significant number of lysine and arginine residues. MBP is found on the intracellular side of the myelin membrane, and its role is to compact the membrane by binding to negative charges on both sides of it, thereby reducing the "width" of the membrane. Both Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes synthesize myelin (thus, A is incorrect). MBP is not a transmembrane protein (proteolipid protein in the CNS and P0 in the PNS are, so B is incorrect), and because MBP is found intracellularly, answers C and D cannot be correct.
4. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The accumulation of both phytanic acid and very-long-chain fatty acids indicates a problem in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, which is where $\alpha$-oxidation occurs. Lysosomal transport is, therefore, not required to metabolize these fatty acids (thus, C is incorrect). The finding that palmitate levels are low indicates that $\beta$-oxidation is occurring; therefore, answer B is incorrect. The compounds that accumulate are not mucopolysaccharides, nor is fatty acid elongation required in the metabolism of these compounds (thus, D and E are incorrect).
5. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ participates in transamination and decarboxylation reactions (and indirectly in deamination reactions). The one common feature in the synthesis of serotonin, GABA, norepinephrine, and histamine is decarboxylation of an amino acid, which requires vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$. The other reactions are not required in the biosynthesis of these neurotransmitters.
6. The answer is D. Normally, only essential fatty acids can be transported across the blood-brain barrier, whereas nonessential fatty acids do not cross the barrier to any appreciable extent. Ammonia, in its uncharged form, can freely diffuse across the blood-brain barrier. Pyruvate can cross the barrier through the monocarboxylic acid transport protein. LNAAs are transported through the L system of amino acid transport. Ketone bodies can also
cross the blood-brain barrier when their concentration is increased in the blood, as under fasting conditions.
7. The answer is E. In order to form epinephrine, a methyl group from SAM is transferred to norepinephrine. SAM production is dependent on adequate levels of both vita$\min \mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate. Without $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate (and therefore SAM), epinephrine synthesis is blocked. Inactivation of catecholamines (and serotonin) is also dependent on SAM, so a lack of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate (and therefore, SAM) would result in a higher level of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. GABA synthesis is not affected by a $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folate deficiency.
8. The answer is B. A vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency leads to tetrahydrofolate $\left(\mathrm{FH}_{4}\right)$ being trapped as $N^{5}$-methyl$\mathrm{FH}_{4}$, thereby producing a functional folate deficiency. Folate is required for the synthesis of glycine from serine. Glycine in the circulation cannot pass through the blood-brain barrier, so it must be synthesized from serine within the brain. In the absence of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, this reaction will not occur. In addition, owing to the lack of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and the functional folate deficiency, levels of SAM will drop. Thus, although norepinephrine synthesis is normal, epinephrine synthesis would be reduced. There is no effect on serotonin synthesis (from tryptophan), nor for GABA and NO synthesis, because none of their biosynthetic steps requires either vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or a folate derivative.
9. The answer is D. Aged cheese contains a degradation product of tyrosine, tyramine, which stimulates catecholamine release if not degraded. MAO-B inactivates the tyramine, but if the patient is taking an MAO inhibitor for another reason, the tyramine would not be degraded and symptoms of catecholamine excess will be exhibited. None of the other enzymes listed as answers inactivates or metabolizes tyramine.
10. The answer is A. The patient exhibits hypoglycorrhachia, a deficiency of the GLUT 1 transporters in the endothelial cells lining the blood-brain barrier. This results in insufficient glucose in the CSF and a lack of energy for the brain to function properly. Ingesting a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet will force ketone body production (a ketogenic diet), a fuel source that the brain can use in place of glucose. Such a diet will aid in alleviating the symptoms brought about by the lack of the glucose transporter. Any diet that increases glucose levels (high carbohydrate, or high protein) will not increase the amount of glucose entering the CSF because the transporter is defective. Insulin will increase the number of GLUT 4 transporters, but those transporters are not expressed in the nervous system. The brain also cannot transport most fatty acids across the blood-brain barrier, so increasing fat content in the diet to increase fatty acid levels will not increase the levels of fatty acids in the brain.

# The Extracellular Matrix and Connective Tissue 

![ma70039756a7](ma70039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 47.I An overview of connective tissue extracellular matrix. Supporting the epithelial cell layer is a basal lamina, beneath which are collagen, elastic fibers, and proteoglycans. The cell types present in connective tissue, such as fibroblasts and macrophages, have been removed from the diagram for clarity.

Many of the cells in tissues are embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM) that fills the spaces between cells and binds cells and tissue together. In so doing, the ECM aids in determining the shape of tissues as well as the nature of the partitioning between tissue types. In the skin, loose connective tissue beneath epithelial cell layers consists of an ECM in which fibroblasts, blood vessels, and other components are distributed (Fig. 47.I). Other types of connective tissue, such as tendon and cartilage, consist largely of ECM, which is principally responsible for their structure and function. This matrix also forms the sheetlike basal laminae, or basement membranes, on which layers of epithelial cells rest and which act as supportive tissue for muscle cells, adipose cells, and peripheral nerves.

Basic components of the ECM include fibrous structural proteins, such as collagens, proteoglycans containing long glycosaminoglycan chains attached to a protein backbone, and adhesion proteins linking components of the matrix to each other and to cells.

These fibrous structural proteins are composed of repeating elements that form a linear structure. Collagens, elastin, and laminin are the principal structural proteins of connective tissue.

Proteoglycans consist of a core protein covalently attached to many long, linear chains of glycosaminoglycans, which contain repeating disaccharide units. The repeating disaccharides usually contain a hexosamine and a uronic acid, and these sugars are frequently sulfated. Synthesis of the proteoglycans starts with the attachment of a sugar to a serine, threonine, or asparagine residue of the protein. Additional sugars, donated by UDP-sugar precursors, add sequentially to the nonreducing end of the molecule.

Proteoglycans, such as glycoproteins and glycolipids, are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex. The glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans are degraded by lysosomal enzymes that cleave one sugar at a time from the nonreducing end of the chain. An inability to degrade proteoglycans leads to a set of diseases known as the mucopolysaccharidoses.

Adhesion proteins, such as fibronectin and laminin, are extracellular glycoproteins that contain separate distinct binding domains for proteoglycans, collagen, and fibrin. These domains allow these adhesion proteins to bind the various components of the ECM. They also contain specific binding domains for cell surface receptors known as integrins. These integrins bind to fibronectin on the external surface, span the plasma membrane of cells, and adhere to proteins, which, in turn, bind to the intracellular actin filaments of the cytoskeleton. Integrins also provide a mechanism for signaling between cells via both internal signals and through signals generated via the ECM.

Cell movement within the ECM requires remodeling of the various components of the matrix. This is accomplished by a variety of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and regulators of the MMPs, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Dysregulation of this delicate balance of the regulators of cell movement allows cancer cells to travel to other parts of the body (metastasize) as well as to spread locally to contiguous tissues.

# THE WAITING ROOM 

Sarah L. (first introduced in Chapter 14) noted a moderate reduction in pain and swelling in the joints of her fingers while she was taking her immunosuppressant medication. At her next checkup, her rheumatologist described to Sarah the underlying inflammatory tissue changes that her systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was causing in the joint tissues.

Deborah S. complained of a declining appetite for food as well as severe weakness and fatigue. The reduction in her kidneys' ability to maintain normal daily total urinary net acid excretion contributed to her worsening metabolic acidosis. This, plus her declining ability to excrete nitrogenous waste products, such as creatinine and urea, into her urine ("azotemia"), was responsible for many of her symptoms. Her serum creatinine level was rising steadily. As it approached a level of $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, she developed a litany of complaints caused by the multisystem dysfunction associated with her worsening metabolic acidosis and retention of nitrogenous waste products ("uremia"). Her physicians discussed with Deborah the need to consider peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.

## I. Composition of the Extracellular Matrix

## A. Fibrous Proteins

## I. Collagen

Collagen, a family of fibrous proteins, is produced by a variety of cell types but principally by fibroblasts (cells found in interstitial connective tissue), muscle cells, and epithelial cells. Type I collagen, collagen(I), the most abundant protein in mammals, is a fibrous protein that is the major component of connective tissue. It is found in the ECM of loose connective tissue, bone, tendons, skin, blood vessels, and the cornea of the eye. Collagen(I) contains approximately $33 \%$ glycine and $21 \%$ proline and hydroxyproline. Hydroxyproline is an amino acid produced by posttranslational modification of peptidyl proline residues.

Procollagen(I), the precursor of collagen(I), is a triple helix composed of three polypeptide (pro- $\alpha$ ) chains that are twisted around each other, forming a ropelike structure. Polymerization of collagen(I) molecules forms collagen fibrils, which provide great tensile strength to connective tissues (see Fig. 7.22). The individual polypeptide chains each contain approximately 1,000 amino acid residues. The three polypeptide chains of the triple helix are linked by interchain hydrogen bonds. Each turn of the triple helix contains three amino acid residues, such that every third amino acid is in close contact with the other two strands in the center of the structure. Only glycine, which lacks a side chain, can fit in this position, and indeed, every third amino acid residue of collagen is glycine. Thus, collagen is a polymer of (Gly-X-Y) repeats, where Y is frequently proline or hydroxyproline and X is any other amino acid found in collagen.

Procollagen(I) is an example of a protein that undergoes extensive posttranslational modifications. Hydroxylation reactions produce hydroxyproline residues from proline residues and hydroxylysine from lysine residues. These reactions occur after the protein has been synthesized (Fig. 47.2) and require vitamin C (ascorbic acid) as a cofactor of the enzymes prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. Hydroxyproline residues are involved in hydrogen bond formation that helps to stabilize the triple helix, whereas hydroxylysine residues are the sites of attachment of disaccharide moieties (galactose-glucose). The role of carbohydrates in collagen structure is still controversial. In the absence of vitamin C (scurvy), the melting temperature of collagen drops from $42^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $24^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ because of the loss of interstrand hydrogen bond formation, which is in turn caused by the lack of hydroxyproline residues.

FIGURE 47.2 Hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen. Proline and lysine residues within the collagen chains are hydroxylated by reactions that require vitamin C .

Endostatins block angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation) by inhibiting endothelial cell migration. Because endothelial cell migration and proliferation are required to form new blood vessels, inhibiting this action blocks angiogenesis. Tumor growth is dependent on a blood supply; inhibiting angiogenesis can reduce tumor-cell proliferation.

The side chains of lysine residues also may be oxidized to form the aldehyde allysine. These aldehyde residues produce covalent cross-links between collagen molecules (Fig. 47.3). An allysine residue on one collagen molecule reacts with the amino group of a lysine residue on another molecule, forming a covalent Schiff base that is converted to more stable covalent cross-links. Aldol condensation also may occur between two allysine residues, which forms the structure lysinonorleucine.

## a. Types of Collagen

At least 28 different types of collagen have been characterized (Table 47.1). Although each type of collagen is found only in particular locations in the body, more than one type may be present in the ECM at a given location. The various types of collagen can be classified as fibril-forming (types I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV, and XXVII), network-forming (types IV, VIII, and X), those that associate with fibril surfaces (types IX, XII, XIV, XXI, and XXII), those that are transmembrane proteins (types XIII, XVII, XXIII. and XXV), endostatin-forming (types XV and XVIII), and those that form periodic beaded filaments (type VI).

All collagens contain three polypeptide chains with at least one stretch of triple helix. The non-triple-helical domains can be short (as in the fibril-forming collagens), or they can be rather large, such that the triple helix is actually a minor component of the overall structure (examples are collagen types XII and XIV). The fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACITs; collagen types IX, XII, and XIV) collagen types associate with fibrillar collagens, without themselves forming fibers. The endostatin-forming collagens are cleaved at their C terminus to form endostatin, an inhibitor of angiogenesis. The network-forming collagens (type IV) form a meshlike structure because of large ( $\sim 230$ amino acids) noncollagenous domains at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 47.4). And finally, several collagen types are actually transmembrane proteins (XIII, XVII, XXIII, and XXV) found on epithelial or epidermal cell surfaces, which play a role in several cellular processes, including adhesion of components of the ECM to cells embedded within it. Type XXV collagen has been associated with the neuronal plaques that develop during Alzheimer disease.

FIGURE 47.4 Type IV collagen contains a globular carboxyl-terminal domain (A), which forms tropocollagen dimers (hexamers of collagen, B). Four dimers associate at the aminoterminal domains to form a 7 S domain (C), and the tetramers form a lattice (D), which provides structural support to the basal lamina.

Types I, II, and III collagens form fibrils that assemble into large insoluble fibers. The fibrils (see below) are strengthened through covalent cross-links between lysine residues on adjacent fibrils. The arrangement of the fibrils gives individual tissues their distinct characteristics. Tendons, which attach muscles to bones, contain collagen fibrils aligned parallel to the long axis of the tendon, thus giving the tendon tremendous tensile strength.

The types of collagen that do not form fibrils perform a series of distinct roles. Fibril-associated collagens bind to the surface of collagen fibrils and link them to other matrix-forming components. The transmembrane collagens form anchoring fibrils that link components of the ECM to underlying connective tissue. The network-forming collagens (type IV) form a flexible collagen that is part of the basement membrane and basal lamina that surround many cells.

## b. Synthesis and Secretion of Collagen

Collagen is synthesized within the ER as a precursor known as preprocollagen. The presequence acts as the signal sequence for the protein and is cleaved, forming procollagen within the ER. From there, it is transported to the Golgi apparatus (Table 47.2). Three procollagen molecules associate through formation of inter- and

| TABLE 47.3 | Steps in Collagen Biosynthesis |
| :--: | :--: |
| LOCATION | PROCESS |
| Rough endoplasmic reticulum | Synthesis of preprocollagen; insertion of the procollagen molecule into the lumen of the ER |
| Lumen of ER | Hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues; glycosylation of selected hydroxylysine residues |
| Lumen of ER and Golgi apparatus | Self-assembly of the tropocollagen molecule, initiated by disulfide bond formation in the carboxyl-terminal extensions; triple-helix formation |

ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
intrastrand disulfide bonds at the carboxyl terminus; once these disulfides are formed, the three molecules can align properly to initiate formation of the triple helix. The triple helix forms from the carboxyl end toward the amino end, forming tropocollagen. The tropocollagen contains a triple-helical segment between two globular ends, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions. The tropocollagen is secreted from the cell, the extensions are removed using extracellular proteases, and the mature collagen takes its place within the ECM. The individual fibrils of collagen line up in a highly ordered fashion to form the collagen fiber.

## 2. Elastin

Elastin is the major protein found in elastic fibers, which are located in the ECM of connective tissue of smooth muscle cells, endothelial and microvascular cells, chondrocytes, and fibroblasts. Elastic fibers allow tissues to expand and contract; this is of particular importance to blood vessels, which must deform and reform repeatedly in response to the changes in intravascular pressure that occur with the contraction of the left ventricle of the heart. It is also important for the lungs, which stretch each time a breath is inhaled and return to their original shape with each exhalation. In addition to elastin, the elastic fibers contain microfibrils, which are composed of several acidic glycoproteins, the major ones being fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2.

## a. Tropoelastin

Elastin has a highly cross-linked, insoluble, amorphous structure. Its precursor, tropoelastin, is a molecule of high solubility, which is synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) for eventual secretion. Tropoelastin contains two types of alternating domains. The first domain consists of a hydrophilic sequence that is rich in lysine and alanine residues. The second domain consists of a hydrophobic sequence that is rich in valine, proline, and glycine, which frequently occur in repeats of VPGVG or VGGVG. The protein contains approximately 16 regions of each domain, alternating throughout the protein (Fig. 47.5).

Upon secretion from the cell, the tropoelastin is aligned with the microfibrils, and lysyl oxidase initiates the reactions that cross-link elastin molecules, using lysine residues within the hydrophilic alternating domains in the proteins. This crosslinking reaction is the same as that which occurs in collagen. In this reaction, two, three, or four lysine residues are cross-linked to form a stable structure. The net result of the cross-linking is the generation of a fibrous mesh that encircles the cells.

## b. Elastic Properties of Elastin

Elastic fibers have the ability to stretch and then to reform without requiring an obvious energy source with which to do so. The mechanism by which this stretching and relaxing actively occurs is still controversial but does relate to the basic principles of protein folding described in Chapter 7. When the elastic fibers are stretched (such as when a breath is taken in and the lung fills up with air), the amorphous elastin structure

Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) results from an insufficiency of elastin in the vessel wall, leading to a narrowing of the large elastic arteries. Current theory suggests that the levels of elastin in the vessel walls may regulate the number of smooth muscle cell rings that encircle the vessel. If the levels of elastin are low, smooth muscle hypertrophy results, leading to a narrowing and stenosis of the artery.

FIGURE 47.6 The structure of laminin.

Defects in the structures of laminin 5 or laminin 6 (proteins that contribute to the cohesion of the dermis and epidermis) lead to the disorder referred to as junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB). In this disorder, there can be severe spontaneous blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. A severe form of the disease, JEB gravis, is often fatal early in life. Death occurs as a result of epithelial blistering of the respiratory, digestive, and genitourinary systems.

Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) results from a defect in laminin 2, which is a component of the bridge that links the muscle cell cytoskeleton to the ECM. Lack of this bridge triggers muscle cell apoptosis, which results in weakened muscles.
is stretched. This stretching exposes the repeating hydrophobic regions of the molecule to the aqueous environment. This, in turn, leads to a decrease in the entropy of water, because the water molecules need to rearrange to form cages about each hydrophobic domain. When this stretching force within the lung is removed (e.g., when the subject exhales), the elastin takes on its original structure because of the increase in entropy that occurs because the water no longer needs to form cages about hydrophobic domains. Thus, the hydrophobic effect is the primary force that allows this stretched structure to reform. Elastin is inherently stable, with a half-life of up to 70 years.

## 3. Laminin

After type IV collagen, laminin is the most abundant protein in basal laminae. Laminin provides additional structural support for the tissues through its ability to bind to type IV collagen, to other molecules present in the ECM, and also to cell surface-associated proteins (the integrins; see Section II).

## a. Laminin Structure

Laminin is a heterotrimeric protein that is shaped, for the most part, like a cross (Fig. 47.6). The trimer is composed of $\alpha-, \beta$, and $\gamma$-subunits. There are five possible $\alpha$-proteins (designated $\alpha_{1}$ through $\alpha_{5}$ ), three different versions of the $\beta$-subunit ( $\beta_{1}$ through $\beta_{5}$ ), and three different $\gamma$-forms ( $\gamma_{1}$ through $\gamma_{5}$ ). Thus, there is a potential for the formation of as many as 45 different combinations of these three subunits. However, only 18 have been discovered. Laminin 111, composed of $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1} \gamma_{1}$, is typical of this class of proteins. The major feature of the laminin structure is a coiled $\alpha$-helix, which joins the three subunits together and forms a rigid rod. All three chains have extensions at the amino-terminal end. Only the $\alpha$-chain has a significant carboxyl-terminal extension past the rodlike structure. It is the laminin extensions that allow laminin to bind to other components within the ECM and to provide stability for the structure. Components of the ECM that are bound by laminin include collagen, sulfated lipids, and proteoglycans.

## b. Laminin Biosynthesis

Like other secreted proteins, laminin is synthesized with a leader sequence that targets the three chains to the ER. Chain association occurs within the Golgi apparatus before secretion from the cell. After laminin is secreted by the cell, the aminoterminal extensions promote self-association as well as the binding to other ECM components. Disulfide linkages are formed to stabilize the trimer, but there is much less posttranslational processing of laminin than there is of collagen and elastin.

## B. Proteoglycans

The fibrous structural proteins of the ECM are embedded in gels formed from proteoglycans. Proteoglycans consist of polysaccharides called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked to a core protein. The GAGs are composed of repeating units of disaccharides (Fig. 47.7). One sugar of the disaccharide is either N -acetylglucosamine

![ma79039756a7](ma79039756a7.jpg)

FIGURE 47.7 Repeating disaccharides of some glycosaminoglycans. These repeating disaccharides usually contain an N -acetylated sugar and a uronic acid, which usually is glucuronic acid or iduronic acid. Sulfate groups are often present and are included in the sugar names in this figure. Iduronic acid and glucuronic acid are epimers at position 5 of the sugar.

The ECM is not simply a glue that holds cells together; it also serves to keep cells from moving to other locations and to prevent large molecules and other particles, such as microorganisms, from reaching contiguous and distant cells. This confining property of the matrix is medically important. For example, infections spread, in part, because the infectious agent alters the "containing" capacity of the ECM. Cancer cells that metastasize (migrate to other tissues) can do so only by altering the integrity of the matrix. Diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (an autoimmune destruction of articular and periarticular tissues) and osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease often associated with aging) involve damage to the functional capacity of the matrix. Alterations in the structural characteristics of the matrix of the renal glomerulus may allow proteins to be excreted into the urine, an indication of inexorable decline in renal function. Genetic defects may cause components of the matrix to be structurally and functionally abnormal, resulting in connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (caused by several mutations that affect specific collagen genes) and Marfan syndrome (a defect in the protein, fibrillin, in which $>330$ different mutations, many of which give rise to different phenotypes, have been identified). Deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes involved in normal degradation of molecules of the matrix result in diseases such as the mucopolysaccharidoses.
or $N$-acetylgalactosamine, and the second is usually acidic (either glucuronic acid or iduronic acid). These sugars are modified by the addition of sulfate groups to the parent sugar. A proteoglycan may contain greater than 100 GAG chains and consist of up to $95 \%$ carbohydrate by weight.

The negatively charged carboxylate and sulfate groups on the proteoglycan bind positively charged ions and form hydrogen bonds with trapped water molecules, thereby creating a hydrated gel. The gel provides a flexible mechanical support for the ECM. The gel also acts as a filter that allows the diffusion of ions (e.g., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ), $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, and other small molecules, but slows diffusion of proteins and movement of cells. The gel also acts as a lubricant. Hyaluronan is the only GAG that occurs as a single long polysaccharide chain and is the only GAG that is not sulfated.

## I. Structure and Function of the Proteoglycans

Proteoglycans are found in interstitial connective tissues-for example, the synovial fluid of joints, the vitreous humor of the eye, arterial walls, bone, cartilage, and cornea. They are major components of the ECM in these tissues. The proteoglycans interact with a variety of proteins in the matrix, such as collagen and elastin, fibronectin (which is involved in cell adhesion and migration), and laminin.

Proteoglycans are proteins that contain many chains of GAGs (formerly called mucopolysaccharides). After synthesis, proteoglycans are secreted from cells; thus, they function extracellularly. Because the long, negatively charged GAG chains repel each other, the proteoglycans occupy a very large space and act as "molecular sieves," determining which substances enter or leave cells (Table 47.3). Their properties also give resilience and a degree of flexibility to substances such as cartilage, permitting compression and reexpansion of the molecule to occur.

At least seven types of GAGs exist, which differ in the monosaccharides present in their repeating disaccharide units: chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparin, heparan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and keratan sulfates I and II. Except for hyaluronic acid, the GAGs are linked to proteins, usually attached covalently to serine or threonine residues. Keratan sulfate I is attached to asparagine.

## 2. Synthesis of the Proteoglycans

The protein component of the proteoglycans is synthesized on the ER. It enters the lumen of this organelle, where the initial glycosylations occur. Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugars serve as the precursors that add sugar units, one at a time, first to the protein and then to the nonreducing end of the growing carbohydrate chain (Fig. 47.8). Glycosylation occurs initially in the lumen of the ER and subsequently in the Golgi complex. Glycosyltransferases, the enzymes that add sugars to the chain,

FIGURE 47.8 Synthesis of chondroitin sulfate. Sugars are added to the protein one at a time, with uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugars serving as the precursors. Initially a xylose residue is added to a serine in the protein. Then, two galactose residues are added, followed by a glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and an N -acetylglucosamine (GalNAc). Subsequent additions occur by the alternating action of two enzymes that produce the repeating disaccharide units. One enzyme (1) adds GlcUA residues, and the other (2) adds GalNAc. As the chain grows, sulfate groups are added by phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS). (Modified from Roden L. In: Fishman WH, ed. Metabolic Conjugation and Metabolic Hydrolysis. Vol. II. Orlando, FL:Academic Press; 1970:401.)
are specific for the sugar being added, the type of linkage that is formed, and the sugars already present in the chain. Once the initial sugars are attached to the protein, the alternating action of two glycosyltransferases adds the sugars of the repeating disaccharide to the growing GAG chain. Sulfation occurs after addition of the sugar. 3'-Phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), also called active sulfate, provides the sulfate groups (see Fig. 31.34). An epimerase converts glucuronic acid residues to iduronic acid residues.

After synthesis, the proteoglycan is secreted from the cell. Its structure resembles a bottle brush, with many GAG chains extending from the core protein (Fig. 47.9). The proteoglycans may form large aggregates, noncovalently attached by a "link" protein to hyaluronic acid (Fig. 47.10). The proteoglycans interact with the adhesion protein, fibronectin, which is attached to the cell membrane protein integrin. Cross-linked fibers of collagen also associate with this complex, forming the ECM (Fig. 47.11).

The long polysaccharide side chains of the proteoglycans in cartilage contain many anionic groups. This high concentration of negative charges attracts cations that create a high osmotic pressure within cartilage, drawing water into this specialized connective tissue and placing the collagen network under tension. At equilibrium, the resulting tension balances the swelling pressure caused by the proteoglycans. The complementary roles of this macromolecular organization give cartilage its resilience. Cartilage can thus withstand the compressive load of weight bearing and then reexpand to its previous dimensions when that load is relieved.

(1)The functional properties of a normal joint depend, in part, on the presence of a soft, well-lubricated, deformable, and compressible layer of cartilaginous tissue covering the ends of the long bones that constitute the joint.

# 3. Degradation of Proteoglycans 

Lysosomal enzymes degrade proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, which are brought into the cell by the process of endocytosis. Lysosomes fuse with the endocytic vesicles, and lysosomal proteases digest the protein component. The carbohydrate component is degraded by lysosomal glycosidases.

Lysosomes contain both endoglycosidases and exoglycosidases. The endoglycosidases cleave the chains into shorter oligosaccharides. Then, exoglycosidases, specific for each type of linkage, remove the sugar residues, one at a time, from the nonreducing ends.

Deficiencies of lysosomal glycosidases cause partially degraded carbohydrates from proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids to accumulate within mem-brane-enclosed vesicles inside cells. These "residual bodies" can cause marked enlargement of the organ, with impairment of its function.

In the clinical disorders known as the mucopolysaccharidoses (caused by accumulation of partially degraded GAGs), deformities of the skeleton may occur (Table 47.4). Developmental delay and impaired cognitive abilities of ten accompany these skeletal changes.

FIGURE 47.11 Interactions between the cell membrane and the components of the extracellular matrix.

| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Hunter | Iduronate sulfatase | Heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate |
| Hurler + Scheie | $\alpha$-L-iduronidase | Heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate |

| Sanfilippo B | N-Acetylglucosaminidase | Heparan sulfate |
| Sanfilippo D | N-Acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase | Heparin sulfate |

These disorders share many clinical features, although there are significant variations between disorders, and even within a single disorder based on the amount of residual activity remaining. In most cases, multiple organ systems are affected (with bone and cartilage being a primary target) For some disorders, there is significant neuronal involvement, leading to impaired cognitive abilities.

# II. Integrins 

Integrins are the major cellular receptors for ECM proteins and provide a link between the internal cytoskeleton of cells (primarily the actin microfilament system) and extracellular proteins, such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Integrins consist of an $\alpha$ - and a $\beta$-subunit. There are 18 distinct $\alpha$ - and 10 distinct $\beta$-gene products. Twenty-four unique $\alpha / \beta$-dimers have been discovered. Mice have been genetically engineered to be unable to express many of the integrin genes (one gene at a time), and the phenotypes of these knockout mice vary from embryonic lethality (the $\alpha_{3}$ gene is an example) to virtually no observable defects (as exemplified by the $\alpha_{1}$ gene). In addition to anchoring the cell's cytoskeleton to the ECM, thereby providing a stable environment in which the cell can reside, the integrins are also involved in a wide variety of cell signaling options.

Certain integrins, such as those associated with white blood cells, are normally inactive because the white cell must circulate freely in the bloodstream. However, if an infection occurs, cells located in the area of the infection release cytokines, which activate the integrins on the white blood cells, allowing them to bind to vascular endothelial cells (leukocyte adhesion) at the site of infection. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is a genetic disorder that results from mutations in the $\beta_{2}$-integrin such that leukocytes cannot be recruited to the sites of infection. Conversely, drugs are now being developed to block either the $\beta_{2^{-}}$or $\alpha_{4}$-integrins (on lymphocytes) to treat inflammatory and autoimmune disorders by interfering with the normal white blood cell response to cytokines.

Integrins can be activated by "inside-out" mechanisms, whereby intracellular signaling events activate the molecule, or by "outside-in" mechanisms, in which a binding event with the extracellular portion of the molecule initiates intracellular signaling events. For those integrins that bind cells to ECM components, activation of specific integrins can result in migration of the affected cell through the ECM. This mechanism is operative during growth, during cellular differentiation, and in the process of metastasis of malignant cells to neighboring tissues.

## III. Adhesion Proteins

Adhesion proteins are found in the ECM and link integrins to ECM components. Adhesion proteins, of which fibronectin is a prime example, are large multidomain proteins that allow binding to many different components simultaneously. In addition to integrin-binding sites, fibronectin contains binding sites for collagen and GAGs.

The movement of tumor cells from its tissue of origin (metastasis) through the blood or lymph system, and colonization of a target tissue, requires degradation of the ECM to allow for cell movement. This is accomplished by a family of proteins known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The MMPs degrade specific ECM components (such as collagen or elastin), thereby allowing cells access through this compartment. One assay for determining whether MMPs are present in a biologic sample is the gelatin zymography assay; a newer, more sensitive assay is based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). In the zymography assay, polyacrylamide gels containing the protein gelatin are prepared, and the enzyme samples are run through the gel in the presence of SDS. After the gel has run, enzyme activity is reconstituted by substituting Triton X-100 for the SDS. An assay buffer is then placed over the gel, which is left overnight. During this part of the procedure, if a lane on the gel contained MMP activity, the MMP would be digesting the gelatin in the area of the gel where the MMP resided. After the activity phase is complete, the gel is developed with Coomassie stain, which binds to the proteins in the gel, including the gelatin. A positive result would appear as white bands on a blue background. The white bands are caused by the absence of gelatin in that region of the gel, as the MMPs present at that region have digested the gelatin such that Coomassie stain has nothing to bind to in that area of the gel. The FRET assay uses a peptide substrate that contains both a fluorophore and a quencher in close proximity. When excited, the quencher blocks fluorescence emittance from the fluorophore owing to the close proximity of the two molecules on the peptide. After MMP treatment, however, the peptide is cleaved between the fluorophore and quencher, such that the quencher is no longer in close proximity to the fluorophore. This results in a strong fluorescence emittance. Thus, fluorescence intensity will increase as the peptide is cleaved in the presence of the MMP. This is a very sensitive assay, detecting subnanogram levels of a wide variety of members of the MMP family.

As the integrin molecule is bound to intracellular cytoskeletal proteins, the adhesion proteins provide a bridge between the actin cytoskeleton of the cell and the cells' position within the ECM. Loss of adhesion protein capability can lead to either physiologic or abnormal cell movement. Alternative splicing of fibronectin allows many different forms of this adhesion protein to be expressed, including a soluble form (vs. cell-associated forms), which is found in the plasma. The metabolic significance of these products remains to be determined.

Fibronectin was first discovered as a large external transformation-sensitive (LETS) protein, which was lost when fibroblasts were transformed into tumor cells. Many tumor cells secrete less-than-normal amounts of adhesion protein material, which allows for more movement within the extracellular milieu. This, in turn, increases the potential for the tumor cells to leave their original location and take root at another location within the body (metastasis).

## IV. Matrix Metalloproteinases

The ECM contains a series of proteases known as the matrix metalloproteinases, or MMPs. These are zinc-containing proteases that use the zinc to appropriately position water to participate in the proteolytic reaction. More than 20 different types of human MMPs exist, and they cleave all proteins found in the ECM, including collagen and laminin.

Because MMPs degrade ECM components, their expression is important to allow cell migration and tissue remodeling during growth and differentiation. In addition, many growth factors bind to ECM components and, as bound components, do not exhibit their normal growth-promoting activity. Destruction of the ECM by the MMPs releases these growth factors, allowing them to bind to cell surface receptors to initiate growth of tissues. Thus, coordinated expression of the MMPs is required for appropriate cell movement and growth. Cancer cells that metastasize require extensive ECM remodeling and usually use MMP activity to spread throughout the body.

A propeptide is present in newly synthesized MMPs that contains a critical cysteine residue. The cysteine residue in the propeptide binds to the zinc atom at the active site of the protease and prevents the propeptide from exhibiting proteolytic activity. Removal of the propeptide is required to activate the MMPs. Once they are activated, certain MMPs can activate other forms of MMP.

Regulation of MMP activity is quite complex. These regulatory processes include transcriptional regulation, proteolytic activation, inhibition by the circulating protein $\alpha_{2}$-macroglobulin, and regulation by a class of inhibitors known as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, or TIMPs. It is important that the synthesis of TIMPs and MMPs be coordinately regulated because dissociation of their expression can facilitate various clinical disorders, such as certain forms of cancer and atherosclerosis.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Sarah L. Articular cartilage is a living tissue with a turnover time determined by a balance between the rate of its synthesis and that of its degradation (Fig. 47.12). The chondrocytes that are embedded in the matrix of intraarticular cartilage participate in both its synthesis and its enzymatic degradation. The latter occurs as a result of cleavage of proteoglycan aggregates by enzymes produced and secreted by the chondrocytes.

SLE, the condition that affects Sarah L., involves an autoimmune-induced inflammation. The inflammation can damage the kidneys, skin, and several other parts of the body. Joint pain is very common and results from inflammation around the joint. The inflammatory process excites the local release of cytokines such as

interleukin-1 (IL-1), which can increase the proteolytic activity of the chondrocytes, causing loss of articular proteins such as the proteoglycans. This can result in joint damage and pain.

Deborah S. The microvascular complications of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus involve the small vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), the renal glomerular capillaries (diabetic nephropathy), and the vessels that supply blood to the peripheral nerves (autonomic neuropathy). The lack of adequate control of Deborah S.'s diabetic state over many years caused a progressive loss of the filtering function of the approximately 1.5 million glomerular capillary-mesangial units that are present in her kidneys.

Chronic hyperglycemia is postulated to be a major metabolic initiator or inducer of diabetic microvascular disease, including those renal glomerular changes that often lead to end-stage renal disease ("glucose toxicity").

For a comprehensive review of the four postulated molecular mechanisms by which chronic hyperglycemia causes these vascular derangements, the reader is referred to several excellent reviews suggested in the online references.

Regardless of which of the postulated mechanisms (increased flux through the aldose reductase or polyol pathway [see Chapter 27], the generation of advanced glycosylation end-products [AGEs], the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates [see Chapter 25], or excessive activation of protein kinase C [see Chapter 18]) will eventually be shown to be the predominant causative mechanism, each can lead to the production of critical intracellular and extracellular signaling molecules (e.g., cytokines). These, in turn, can cause pathologic changes within the glomerular filtration apparatus that reduce renal function. These changes include increased

FIGURE 47.13 A cross-section of a normal renal glomerulus showing four capillary tufts delivering blood to the glomerulus for filtration across the fenestrated capillary endothelium, then through the glomerular basement membrane into the Bowman space to form urine. The urine then enters the proximal tubule of the nephron. This filtration removes potentially toxic metabolic end-products from the blood. The mesangium, by contracting and expanding, controls the efficiency of these filtering and excretory functions by regulating the hydraulic filtration pressures in the glomerulus. An intact basement membrane must be present to maintain the integrity of the filtering process.
synthesis of type IV collagen, fibronectin, and some of the proteoglycans, causing the glomerular basement membrane (GBM; Fig. 47.13) to become diffusely thickened throughout the glomerular capillary network. This membrane thickening alters certain specific filtration properties of the GBM, preventing some of the metabolites that normally enter the urine from the glomerular capillary blood (via the fenestrated capillary endothelium) from doing so (a decline in glomerular filtration rate [GFR]). As a result, these potentially toxic substances accumulate in the blood and contribute to the overall clinical presentation of advancing uremia. In spite of the thickening of the GBM, this membrane becomes "leaky" for some macromolecules (e.g., albumin) that normally do not enter the urine from the glomerular capillaries (microalbuminuria). Suggested mechanisms for this increased permeability or leakiness include reduced synthesis of the specific proteoglycan heparan sulfate, as well as increased basement membrane production of vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF), a known angiogenic and permeability factor; and expansion of the ECM in the mesangium. The mesangium consists of specialized tissue containing collagen, proteoglycans, and other macromolecules that surround the glomerular capillaries and that, through its gel-like and sieving properties, determine, in part, the glomerular capillary hydraulic filtration pressure as well as the functional status of the capillary endothelium-mesangial GBM filtration apparatus (see Fig. 47.13). As the mesangial tissue expands, the efficiency of glomerular filtration diminishes proportionately. The cause of these mesangial changes is, in part, the consequence of increased expression of certain growth factors, especially transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ ) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Future therapeutic approaches in patients with early diabetic nephropathy may include the use of antibodies that neutralize TGF- $\beta$.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Osteogenesis Imperfecta. OI is a heterogenous group of genetic diseases that have in common a defect in collagen production. This defect can be either of two types: The first type is associated with a reduction in the

synthesis of normal collagen (resulting from a gene deletion or splice-site mutation). The second type is associated with the synthesis of a mutated form of collagen. Most of the mutations have a dominant-negative effect, leading to an autosomal-dominant mode of transmission.

In the second type of OI, many of the known mutations involve substitutions of another amino acid for glycine. This results in an unstable collagen molecule because glycine is the only amino acid that can fit between the other two chains within the triple helix of collagen. If the mutation is near the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule, the phenotype of the disease is usually more severe than if the mutation is near the amino-terminal end (recall that triple helix formation proceeds from the carboxyl- to the amino-terminal end of the molecule). Of interest are mutations that replace glycine with either serine or cysteine. Such mutations are more stable than expected because of the hydrogen-bonding capabilities of serine and the ability of cysteine to form disulfide bonds. Both would aid in preventing the strands of the triple helix from unwinding.

Children with OI can be treated with a class of compounds known as bisphosphonates, which consist of two phosphates linked by a carbon or nitrogen bridge (thus, they are analogs of pyrophosphate, in which the two phosphates are linked by oxygen). Normal bone remodeling is the result of a coordinated "coupling" between osteoclast activity (cells that resorb bone) and osteoblast activity (cells that form bone). In OI, bone resorption outpaces bone formation because osteoclast activity is enhanced (perhaps because of the reduced levels of normal collagen present to act as nucleating sites for bone formation). This leads to a net loss of bone mass and fragility of the skeleton. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast action with the potential to increase bone mass and its tensile strength.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of fibrous structural proteins, proteoglycans, and adhesion proteins.
The ECM provides support to the tissues and restricts movement of cells.
Collagen is the most abundant fibrous protein, and it consists of a triple helix stabilized by hydrogen bonds and intramolecular cross-links. There are $>25$ different types of collagen.
Elastin is the major protein found in elastic fibers, and it is responsible for the contractility exhibited by these fibers.
Laminin provides structural support to tissues via binding to various components of the ECM.
Proteoglycans consist of polysaccharides (glycosaminoglycans) bound to a core protein.

The polysaccharides are usually a repeating disaccharide unit, containing negative charges.
Because of charge repulsion, the proteoglycans form a hydrated gel that provides flexible mechanical support to the ECM.
Integrins are cellular membrane receptors for ECM proteins, and they link the cellular cytoskeleton to extracellular proteins.
Integrins are also signaling proteins when they are bound to appropriate components.
Adhesion proteins link the integrins to ECM components.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are the only proteases that can degrade ECM components, and they are carefully regulated by the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs).
Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 47.5.

OI can occur owing to mutations in genes other than collagen. Mutations in cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) or prolyl 3-hydroxylase I or PH3-I (LEPRE I) lead to defective collagen fibers being produced. CRTAP forms a complex with PH3-I and cyclophilin to hydroxylate a specific proline residue in types I and II collagen. Failure to hydroxylate this proline residue leads to unstable collagen and moderate to severe forms of OI. The pattern of inheritance for both CRTAP and LEPRE I mutations is autosomal-recessive.

1. The answer is E. Scurvy is caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. Vitamin C is a required cofactor for the hydroxylation of both proline and lysine residues in collagen. The hydroxyproline residues that are formed stabilize the collagen fiber through the formation of hydrogen bonds with other collagen triple helices within the fiber. The loss of this stabilizing force greatly reduces the strength of the collagen fibers. The hydroxylation of lysine allows carbohydrates to be attached to collagen, which appear to be necessary for efficient transport of tropocollagen from the cell to the ECM. Vitamin C is not required for disulfide bond formation, the formation of lysyl cross-links (that enzyme is lysyl oxidase), transcription of the collagen genes, or the formation of collagen fibrils. Thus, all the other choices are incorrect.
2. The answer is C. When elastin expands as a result of outside forces (such as the respiratory muscles causing the lungs to expand with air), hydrophobic regions of elastin are exposed to the aqueous environment, resulting in a decrease in the entropy of water. When the outside force is removed (by relaxation of the respiratory muscles), the driving force for contraction of elastin is an increase in the entropy of water, so that the hydrophobic residues of elastin are again shielded from the environment. The expansion and contraction of elastin
does not involve covalent modifications (thus, A, B, and E are incorrect), nor does it involve extensive changes in salt bridge formation (thus, D is also incorrect).
3. The answer is B. GAG chains contain negative charges, resulting from the presence of acidic sugars and the sulfated sugars in the molecule. Thus, in their characteristic bottleneck structure, the chains repel each other (thus, A is incorrect), yet they also attract positively charged cations and water into the spaces between the chains. The water forms hydrogen bonds with the sugars and a gel-like space is created. This gel acts as a diffusion sieve for materials that leave, or enter, this space. Hydroxylation and cross-linking of chains does not occur (thus, D and E are incorrect), nor does hydrogen bonding between chains (they are too far apart because of the charge repulsion, but they do form hydrogen bonds with water).
4. The answer is E. In order for cells to migrate, they must free themselves from the ECM material, which requires remodeling of the matrix components. Because of the unique structural aspects of these components, only a small subset of proteases, the metalloproteinases, is capable of doing this. The other answers listed are all components of the matrix, which must be remodeled in order for cell migration to occur.

5. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Fibronectin binds to integrins on the cell surface as well as to various ECM components (collagen and GAGs). This binding fixes the position of the cell within the matrix. Loss of these binding components can lead to undesirable cell movement. Fibronectin plays no role in any of the other functions listed as possible answers.
6. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The proteoglycans, containing the GAGs, are highly negatively charged. The sugars often contain a carboxylic acid group (glucuronic and iduronic acids) and are often sulfated. This high level of negative charges attracts cations to the proteoglycans, bringing with the cations water through an osmotic effect. When weight is placed on the joint the water in the space cushions the force generated, and when the weight is removed, water can return to the space. Losing negative charges would reduce the amount of water in the joint and the ability of the joint to prevent bone-bone interactions. The proteoglycans are not positively charged and do not attract anions. Increasing the negative charges exhibited by the proteoglycans would enhance the cushioning effect, as would increasing the concentration of glucuronic acid residues and sulfated sugars (because both of those changes increase the concentration of negative charges in the joint).
7. The answer is B. Glycine is present at every third residue within a collagen monomer because it is the only amino acid side chain that can fit in the triple helix when the three chains wind about each other. Substitution of glycine with any other amino acid can lead to a weakened collagen structure. However, when cysteine is present instead of a glycine, the cysteine has the capability of forming disulfide bonds, which can stabilize the unstable collagen triple helix. A glycine-to-cysteine substitution requires the change of only one nucleotide in the DNA sequence. When the child's collagen is run on an SDS-PAGE gel, the molecular weight is greater than native collagen because of the cross-links in the collagen. Mercaptoethanol will break those links, so after treating with mercaptoethanol the molecular weight of collagen would appear normal in the gel. Conversion of
proline to hydroxyproline is a normal event in collagen biosynthesis and allows for hydrogen bonding to occur, which will stabilize the collagen triple helix. Proline to glycine will not lead to cross-links in collagen, nor will glycine or serine to proline. The latter mutations may disrupt triple-helix formation and lead to a form of osteogenesis imperfecta, but they would not lead to the biochemical findings of cross-linking.
8. The answer is B. Osteoclasts resorb bone, whereas osteoblasts produce bone. Normally, there is a balance between osteoclast and osteoblast activity within bones, allowing the appropriate amount of bone tissue to be generated and then turned over and resynthesized. However, certain conditions can lead to enhanced osteoclast activity, such as reduced levels of collagen being produced or altered collagen molecules being produced. Under these conditions, the osteoclasts resorb more bone than the osteoblasts can synthesize, leading to weak and fragile bones. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity, thereby allowing more bone to be produced, even if the collagen being produced is not normal. Laminin is not involved in bone formation. Inhibition of osteoblast activity would lead to reduced bone formation, which is the opposite of what one wants to occur under these conditions.
9. The answer is D. The three polypeptide chains of the triple helix are linked by interchain hydrogen bonds. Each turn of the helix contains three amino acid residues with every third amino acid in close contact with the other two strands in the center of the structure. Only glycine, which lacks a side chain, can fit in this position. The other amino acids listed are important amino acids in collagen but cannot fit into the central position critical for the triple helix. Elastin is a protein, not an amino acid. The proline is required for each chain to form a polyprolyl helix, but the glycine is essential for allowing triple-helix formation.
10. The answer is F. Maroteaux-Lamy is deficient in N -acetylgalactosamine sulfatase and accumulates dermatan sulfate. All the others listed accumulate heparin sulfate ( $+/-$ dermatan sulfate).
