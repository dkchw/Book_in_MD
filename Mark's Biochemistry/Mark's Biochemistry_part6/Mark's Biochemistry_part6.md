# Lipid Metabolism 

Most of the lipids found in the body fall into the categories of fatty acids and triacylglycerols; glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids; eicosanoids; cholesterol, bile salts, and steroid hormones; and fat-soluble vitamins. These lipids have very diverse chemical structures and functions. However, they are related by a common property: their relative insolubility in water.

Fatty acids are a major fuel in the body. After eating, we store excess fatty acids and carbohydrates that are not oxidized as fat (triacylglycerols) in adipose tissue. Between meals, these fatty acids are released and circulate in blood bound to albumin (Fig. V.1). In muscle, liver, and other tissues, fatty acids are oxidized to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in the pathway of $\beta$-oxidation. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD[2H]) generated from $\beta$-oxidation are reoxidized by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the electron-transport chain, thereby generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Small amounts of certain fatty acids are oxidized through other pathways that convert them to either oxidizable fuels or urinary excretion products (e.g., peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation).

Not all acetyl-CoA generated from $\beta$-oxidation enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In the liver, acetyl-CoA generated from $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids can also be converted to the ketone bodies acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate. Ketone bodies are taken up by muscle and other tissues, which convert them back to acetyl-CoA for oxidation in the TCA cycle. They become a major fuel for the brain during prolonged fasting.

Glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, which contain esterified fatty acids, are found in membranes and in blood lipoproteins at the interfaces between the lipid components of these structures and the surrounding water. These membrane lipids form hydrophobic barriers between subcellular compartments and between cellular constituents and the extracellular milieu. Polyunsaturated fatty acids containing 20 carbons form the eicosanoids, which regulate many cellular processes (Fig. V.2).

Cholesterol adds stability to the phospholipid bilayer of membranes. It serves as the precursor of the bile salts, detergentlike compounds that function in the process of lipid digestion and absorption (Fig. V.3). Cholesterol also serves as the precursor of the steroid hormones, which have many actions, including the regulation of metabolism, growth, and reproduction.

The fat-soluble vitamins are lipids that are involved in such varied functions as vision, growth, and differentiation (vitamin A); blood clotting (vitamin K); prevention of oxidative damage to cells (vitamin E); and calcium metabolism (vitamin D).

Triacylglycerols, the major dietary lipids, are digested in the lumen of the intestine (Fig. V.4). The initial digestive products, free fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol, are reconverted to triacylglycerols in intestinal epithelial cells, packaged in lipoproteins known as chylomicrons (so they can safely enter the circulation), and secreted into the lymph. Ultimately, chylomicrons enter the blood, serving as one of the major blood lipoproteins.

Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is produced in the liver, mainly from dietary carbohydrate. Lipogenesis is an insulin-stimulated process through which glucose is converted to fatty acids, which are subsequently esterified to glycerol to form the triacylglycerols that are packaged in VLDL and secreted from the liver. Thus, chylomicrons primarily transport dietary lipids, and VLDL transports endogenously synthesized lipids.

The triacylglycerols of chylomicrons and VLDL are digested by lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme found attached to capillary endothelial cells (see Fig. V.4).

The fatty acids that are released are taken up by muscle and many other tissues and are oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water to produce energy. After a meal, these fatty acids are taken up by adipose tissue and stored as triacylglycerols.

LPL converts chylomicrons to chylomicron remnants and VLDL to intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL). These products, which have a relatively low triacylglycerol content, are taken up by the liver by the process of endocytosis and degraded by lysosomal action. IDL may also be converted to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by further digestion of triacylglycerol. Endocytosis of LDL occurs in peripheral tissues as well as the liver (Table V.1) and is the major means of cholesterol transport and delivery to peripheral tissues.

The principal function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is to transport excess cholesterol obtained from peripheral tissues to the liver and to exchange proteins and lipids with chylomicrons and VLDL. The protein exchange converts "nascent" particles to "mature" particles.

During fasting, fatty acids and glycerol are released from adipose triacylglycerol stores (Fig. V.5). The glycerol travels to the liver and is used for gluconeogenesis. Only the liver contains glycerol kinase, which is required for glycerol metabolism. The fatty acids form complexes with albumin in the blood and are taken up by muscle, kidney, and other tissues, where ATP is generated by their oxidation to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water. Liver also converts some of the carbon to ketone bodies, which are released into the blood. Ketone bodies are oxidized for energy in muscle, kidney, and other tissues during fasting, and in the brain during prolonged starvation.

## Digestion and Transport of Dietary Lipids

Triacylglycerols are the major fat in the human diet, consisting of three fatty acids esterified to a glycerol backbone. Limited digestion of these lipids occurs in the mouth (lingual lipase) and stomach (gastric lipase) because of the low solubility of the substrate. In the intestine, however, the fats are emulsified by bile salts that are released from the gallbladder. This increases the available surface area of the lipids for pancreatic lipase and colipase to bind and to digest the triglycerides. Degradation products are free fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol. When partially digested food enters the intestine, the hormone cholecystokinin is secreted by the intestine, which signals the gallbladder to contract and release bile acids, and the pancreas to release digestive enzymes.

In addition to triacylglycerols, phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters (cholesterol esterified to fatty acids) are present in the foods we eat. Phospholipids are hydrolyzed in the intestinal lumen by phospholipase A2, and cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase. Both of these enzymes are secreted from the pancreas.

The products of enzymatic digestion (free fatty acids, glycerol, lysophospholipids, cholesterol) form micelles with bile acids in the intestinal lumen. The micelles interact with the enterocyte membrane and allow diffusion of the lipid-soluble components across the enterocyte membrane into the cell. The bile acids, however, do not enter the enterocyte at this time. They remain in the intestinal lumen, travel farther down, and are then reabsorbed and sent back to the liver by the enterohepatic circulation. This allows the bile salts to be used multiple times in fat digestion.

The intestinal epithelial cells resynthesize triacylglycerol from free fatty acids and 2-monacylglycerol and package them with a protein, apolipoprotein B-48, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters into a soluble lipoprotein particle known as a chylomicron. The chylomicrons are secreted into the lymph and eventually end up in the circulation, where they can distribute dietary lipids to all tissues of the body.

Once they are in the circulation, the newly released ("nascent") chylomicrons interact with another lipoprotein particle, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and acquire two apolipoproteins from HDL, apolipoprotein CII (apoCII) and apolipoprotein E (apoE). This converts the nascent chylomicron to a "mature" chylomicron. The apoCII on the mature chylomicron activates the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is located on the inner surface of the capillary endothelial cells of muscle and adipose tissue. The LPL digests the triglyceride in the chylomicron, producing free fatty acids and glycerol. The fatty acids enter the adjacent organs either for energy production (muscle) or fat storage (adipocyte). The glycerol that is released is metabolized in the liver.

As the chylomicron loses triglyceride, its density increases and it becomes a chylomicron remnant, which is taken up by the liver by receptors that recognize apoE. In the liver, the chylomicron remnant is degraded into its component parts for further disposition by the liver.

The lymph system is a network of vessels that surround interstitial cavities in the body. Cells secrete various compounds into the lymph, and the lymph vessels transport these fluids away from the interstitial spaces in the body tissues and into the bloodstream. In the case of the intestinal lymph system, the lymph enters the bloodstream through the thoracic duct. These vessels are designed so that under normal conditions, the contents of the blood cannot enter the lymphatic system. The lymph fluid is similar in composition to that of the blood but lacks the cells found in blood.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Will S. has had several episodes of mild back and lower extremity pain over the last year, probably caused by minor sickle cell crises. He then developed abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. He states that the pain is not like his usual crisis pain. Intractable vomiting began 12 hours after the onset of these new symptoms, and he then went to the emergency department.

On physical examination, his body temperature is slightly elevated and his heart rate is rapid. The whites of his eyes (the sclerae) are slightly jaundiced (or icteric, a yellow discoloration caused by the accumulation of bilirubin pigment). He is exquisitely tender to pressure over his right upper abdomen.

The emergency department physician suspects that Will is not in sickle cell crisis but instead has acute cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation). His hemoglobin level is low, at $7.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range, 12 to $16 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), but is unchanged from his baseline 3 months earlier. His serum total bilirubin level is $2.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range, 0.2 to $1.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), and his direct (conjugated) bilirubin level is $0.9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range, 0 to $0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ).

Intravenous fluids were started, he was not allowed to take anything by mouth, and symptomatic therapy was started for pain and nausea. He was sent for an ultrasonographic (ultrasound) study of his upper abdomen.

$\square$AI M. has continued to abuse alcohol and to eat poorly. After a particularly heavy intake of vodka, a steady severe pain began in his upper midabdomen. This pain spread to the left upper quadrant and eventually radiated to his midback. He began vomiting nonbloody material and was brought to the hospital emergency department with fever, a rapid heartbeat, and a mild reduction in blood pressure. On physical examination, he was dehydrated and tender to pressure over the upper abdomen. His vomitus and stool were both negative for occult blood.

Blood samples were sent to the laboratory for a variety of hematologic and chemical tests, including a measurement of serum lipase, one of the digestive enzymes that is normally secreted from the exocrine pancreas through the pancreatic ducts into the lumen of the small intestine.

## I. Digestion of Triacylglycerols

Triacylglycerols are the major fat in the human diet because they are the major storage lipid in the plants and animals that constitute our food supply. Triacylglycerols contain a glycerol backbone to which three fatty acids are esterified (Fig. 29.1). The main route for digestion of triacylglycerols involves hydrolysis to fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol in the lumen of the intestine. However, the route depends to some extent on the chain length of the fatty acids. Lingual and gastric lipases are produced by cells at the back of the tongue and in the stomach, respectively. These lipases preferentially hydrolyze short- and medium-chain fatty acids (containing 12 or fewer carbon atoms) from dietary triacylglycerols. Therefore, they are most active in infants and young children who drink relatively large quantities of cow's milk, which contains triacylglycerols with a high percentage of short- and medium-chain fatty acids.
![ma064074519f](ma064074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 29.1 Structure of a triacylglycerol. The glycerol moiety is highlighted, and its carbons are numbered.

$\square$Amylase is produced only in the salivary glands and the acinar cells of the pancreas, whereas lipase is produced only in the pancreas. An elevated serum amylase, coupled with an elevated lipase, was used to diagnose pancreatitis in the past, but only serum lipase is used currently. Serum lipase levels increase at the same rate as do serum amylase levels, but they stay elevated longer and are more specific for pancreatitis than are serum amylase levels. For example, salivary gland lesions, such as mumps, can also increase serum amylase levels. The assay for serum lipase is more difficult than that for amylase (and has been more difficult to automate for the clinical laboratory), but currently, several assays can be performed to determine lipase levels. Two such assays will be described here. The first involves incubating the serum sample with a known amount of triglyceride. The serum lipase will generate two free fatty acids and one 2 -monacylglycerol for each triglyceride. Monoacylglycerol lipase is then added (to convert the 2-monoacylglycerol to free glycerol), as is glycerol kinase (to convert glycerol to glycerol 3-phosphate) and glycerol 3-phosphate oxidase (which converts molecular oxygen and glycerol 3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and hydrogen peroxide). The $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ generated can be determined colorimetrically using an appropriate chromogen and horseradish peroxidase. The amount of glycerol produced is dependent on the lipase activity. A second assay for lipase is turbidimetric (based on light-scattering). The triglyceride sample does not easily go into solution; thus, when the assay is started, the solution is cloudy (turbid). As the lipase hydrolyzes the fatty acids from the triacylglycerol, the turbidity decreases, and this can be measured and compared to a standard curve generated with known lipase amounts.

$\square$Currently, $38 \%$ of the calories (kilocalories) in the typical American diet come from fat. The content of fat in the diet increased from the early 1900 s until the 1960 s and then it decreased as we became aware of the unhealthy effects of a high-fat diet. According to current recommendations, fat should provide no more than $30 \%$ of the total calories of a healthy diet.

The mammary gland produces milk, which is the major source of nutrients for the breastfed human infant. The fatty acid composition of human milk varies, depending on the diet of the mother. However, long-chain fatty acids predominate, particularly palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids. Although the amount of fat contained in human milk and cow's milk is similar, cow's milk contains more short- and medium-chain fatty acids and does not contain the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids found in human milk that are important in brain development.

Although the concentrations of pancreatic lipase and bile salts are low in the intestinal lumen of the newborn infant, the fat of human milk is still readily absorbed. This is true because lingual and gastric lipases produced by the infant partially compensate for the lower levels of pancreatic lipase. The human mammary gland also produces lipases that enter the milk. One of these lipases, which requires lower levels of bile salts than pancreatic lipase, is not inactivated by stomach acid and functions in the intestine for several hours.
![ma074074519f](ma074074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 29.2 Structure of a bile salt. The bile salts are derived from cholesterol and retain the cholesterol ring structure. They differ from cholesterol in that the rings in bile salts contain more hydroxyl groups and a polar side chain and lack a C5-C6 double bond.

## A. Action of Bile Salts

Dietary fat leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine, where it is emulsified (suspended in small particles in the aqueous environment) by bile salts (Fig. 29.2). The bile salts are amphipathic compounds (containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic components), synthesized in the liver (see Chapter 32 for the pathway) and secreted via the gallbladder into the intestinal lumen. The contraction of the gallbladder and secretion of pancreatic enzymes are stimulated by the gut hormone cholecystokinin, which is secreted by the intestinal cells when stomach contents enter the intestine. Bile salts act as detergents, binding to the globules of dietary fat as they are broken up by the peristaltic action of the intestinal muscle. This emulsified fat, which has an increased surface area compared with unemulsified fat, is attacked by digestive enzymes from the pancreas (Fig. 29.3).

## B. Action of Pancreatic Lipase

The major enzyme that digests dietary triacylglycerols is a lipase produced in the pancreas. Pancreatic lipase is secreted along with another protein, colipase, in response to the release of cholecystokinin from the intestine. The peptide hormone secretin is also released by the small intestine in response to acidic materials (such as the partially digested materials from the stomach, which contains hydrochloric

acid [HCl] ) entering the duodenum. Secretin signals the liver, pancreas, and certain intestinal cells to secrete bicarbonate. Bicarbonate raises the pH of the contents of the intestinal lumen into a range ( $\mathrm{pH} \sim 6$ ) that is optimal for the action of all of the digestive enzymes of the intestine.

Bile salts inhibit pancreatic lipase activity by coating the substrate and not allowing the enzyme access to it. The colipase binds to the dietary fat and to the lipase, relieving the bile salt inhibition and allowing triglyceride to enter the active site of the lipase. This enhances lipase activity. Pancreatic lipase hydrolyzes fatty acids of all chain lengths from positions 1 and 3 of the glycerol moiety of the triacylglycerol, producing free fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol-that is, glycerol with a fatty acid esterified at position 2 (Fig. 29.4). The pancreas also produces esterases that remove fatty acids from compounds (such as cholesterol esters) and phospholipase $A_{2}$ (which is released in its zymogen form and is activated by trypsin) that digests phospholipids to a free fatty acid and a lysophospholipid (see Fig. 29.4B and C).

## II. Absorption of Dietary Lipids

The fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerols produced by digestion are packaged into micelles, tiny microdroplets that are emulsified by bile salts (see Fig. 29.3). For bile salt micelles to form, the concentration of bile salts in the intestinal lumen must reach 5 to 15 mM (the critical micelle concentration [CMC]). Below this concentration, the bile salts are soluble; above it, micelles will form. Other dietary lipids, such as cholesterol, lysophospholipids, and fat-soluble vitamins, are also packaged in micelles. The micelles travel through a layer of water (the unstirred water layer) to

$\square$Al M.'s serum levels of pancreatic lipase were elevated-a finding consistent with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The elevated level of this enzyme in the blood is the result of its escape from the inflamed exocrine cells of the pancreas into the surrounding pancreatic veins. The cause of the inflammatory pancreatic process in this case was related to the toxic effect of acute and chronic excessive alcohol ingestion.

In patients such as Will S. who have severe and recurrent episodes of increased red blood cell destruction (hemolytic anemia), greater than normal amounts of the red-cell pigment heme must be processed by the liver and spleen. In these organs, heme (derived from hemoglobin) is degraded to bilirubin, which is excreted by the liver in the bile.

If large quantities of bilirubin are presented to the liver as a consequence of acute hemolysis, the capacity of the liver to conjugate it-that is, convert it to the water-soluble bilirubin diglucuronide-can be overwhelmed. As a result, a greater percentage of the bilirubin entering the hepatic biliary ducts in patients with hemolysis is in the less water-soluble forms. In the gallbladder, these relatively insoluble particles tend to precipitate as gallstones that are rich in calcium bilirubinate. In some patients, one or more stones may leave the gallbladder through the cystic duct and enter the common bile duct. Most pass harmlessly into the small intestine and are later excreted in the stool. Larger stones, however, may become entrapped in the lumen of the cystic or common bile duct, where they cause varying degrees of obstruction to bile flow (cholestasis) with associated ductal spasm, producing pain. If adequate amounts of bile salts do not enter the intestinal lumen, dietary fats cannot readily be emulsified and digested.

When he was finally able to tolerate a full diet, Al M.'s stools became bulky glistening, yellow-brown, and foul-smelling. They floated on the surface of the toilet water. What caused this problem?

FIGURE 29.5 Recycling of bile salts. Bile salts are synthesized in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, secreted into the small intestine, resorbed in the ileum, and returned to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation. Under normal circumstances, $5 \%$ or less of luminal bile acids are excreted in the stool.
the microvilli on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells, where the fatty acids, 2-monoacylglycerols, and other dietary lipids are absorbed, but the bile salts are left behind in the lumen of the gut.

The bile salts are extensively resorbed when they reach the ileum. Greater than $95 \%$ of the bile salts are recirculated, traveling through the enterohepatic circulation to the liver, which secretes them into the bile for storage in the gallbladder and ejection into the intestinal lumen during another digestive cycle (Fig. 29.5).

Short- and medium-chain fatty acids (C4 to C12) do not require bile salts for their absorption. They are absorbed directly into intestinal epithelial cells. Because they do not need to be packaged to increase their solubility, they enter the portal blood (rather than the lymph) and are transported to the liver bound to serum albumin.

## III. Synthesis of Chylomicrons

Within the intestinal epithelial cells, the fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerols are condensed by enzymatic reactions in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form triacylglycerols. The fatty acids are activated to fatty acyl coenzyme A (fatty acyl-CoA) by the same process used for activation of fatty acids before $\beta$-oxidation (see Chapter 30). A fatty acyl-CoA then reacts with 2-monoacylglycerol to form diacylglycerol, which reacts with another fatty acyl-CoA to form triacylglycerol (Fig. 29.6). The reactions for triacylglycerol synthesis in intestinal cells differ from those in liver and adipose cells in that 2-monoacylglycerol is an intermediate in triacylglycerol synthesis in intestinal cells, whereas phosphatidic acid is the necessary intermediate in other tissues.

Triacylglycerols, owing to their insolubility in water, are packaged in lipoprotein particles. If triacylglycerols entered the blood directly, they would coalesce, impeding blood flow. Intestinal cells package triacylglycerols together with proteins and phospholipids in chylomicrons, which are lipoprotein particles that do not readily coalesce in aqueous solutions (Fig. 29.7). Chylomicrons also contain

FIGURE 29.6 Resynthesis of triacylglycerols in intestinal epithelial cells.

The triacylglycerols are packaged in nascent chylomicrons and secreted into the lymph. AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CoA, coenzyme A.
cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, but their major component is triglyceride derived from the diet (Fig. 29.8). The protein constituents of the lipoproteins are known as apolipoproteins.

The major apolipoprotein associated with chylomicrons as they leave the intestinal cells is B-48. The B-48 apolipoprotein is structurally and genetically related to the B-100 apolipoprotein synthesized in the liver that serves as a major protein of another lipid carrier, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). These two apolipoproteins are encoded by the same gene. In the intestine, the primary transcript of this gene undergoes RNA editing (Fig. 29.9, and see Chapter 15). A stop codon is generated that causes a protein to be produced in the intestine that is $48 \%$ of the size of the protein produced in the liver; hence, the designations $B-48$ and $B-100$.

The protein component of the lipoproteins is synthesized on the rough ER. Lipids, which are synthesized in the smooth ER, are complexed with the proteins to form the chylomicrons.
![ma124074519f](ma124074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 29.7 Example of the structure of a blood lipoprotein. Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is depicted. Lipoproteins contain phospholipids and proteins on the surface, with their hydrophilic regions interacting with water. Hydrophobic molecules are in the interior of the lipoprotein. The hydroxyl group of cholesterol is near the surface. In cholesterol esters, the hydroxyl group is esterified to a fatty acid. Cholesterol esters are found in the interior of lipoproteins and are synthesized by reaction of cholesterol with an activated fatty acid (see Chapter 32).

Because the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and $K$ ) are absorbed from micelles along with the long-chain fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerols, prolonged obstruction of the duct that carries exocrine secretions from the pancreas and the gallbladder into the intestine (via the common duct) could lead to a deficiency of these metabolically important substances.

Al M.'s stool changes are characteristic of steatorrhea (fat-laden stools caused by malabsorption of dietary fats), in this case caused by a lack of pancreatic secretions, particularly pancreatic lipase, which normally digests dietary fat. Steatorrhea also may be caused by insufficient production or secretion of ble salts. Therefore, Will S. might also develop this condition.

Olestra is an artificial fat substitute designed to allow individuals to obtain the taste and food consistency of fat without the calories from fat. The structure of Olestra is shown below and consists of a sucrose molecule to which fatty acids are esterified to the hydroxyl groups.
![ma144074519f](ma144074519f.jpg)

The fatty acids attached to sucrose are resistant to hydrolysis by pancreatic lipase, so Olestra passes through the intestine intact and is eliminated in the feces. As a result, no useful calories can be obtained through the metabolism of Olestra, although in the mouth, the sucrose portion of the molecule imparts a sweet taste. In addition, because Olestra has the ability to pass through the digestive system unimpeded, it can also carry with it essential fat-soluble vitamins. Therefore, foods prepared with Olestra are supplemented with these vitamins. Unfortunately, the side effects of cramping and diarrhea decreased the popularity of Olestra as a food additive.

Because of their high triacylglycerol content, chylomicrons are the least dense of the blood lipoproteins. When blood is collected from patients with certain types of hyperlipoproteinemias (high concentrations of lipoproteins in the blood) in which chylomicron levels are elevated, and the blood is allowed to stand in the refrigerator overnight, the chylomicrons float to the top of the liquid and coalesce, forming a creamy layer.
![ma154074519f](ma154074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 29.9 B apolipoprotein gene. The gene, located on chromosome 2, is transcribed and translated in liver to produce apoB-100, which is 4,536 amino acids in length (one of the longest single-polypeptide chains). In intestinal cells, RNA editing converts a cytosine (C) to a uracil (U) via deamination, producing a stop codon. Consequently, the B apolipoprotein of intestinal cells (apoB-48) contains only 2,152 amino acids. ApoB-48 is $48 \%$ of the size of apoB-100. mRNA, messenger RNA.

## IV. Transport of Dietary Lipids in the Blood

By the process of exocytosis, nascent chylomicrons are secreted by the intestinal epithelial cells into the chyle of the lymphatic system and enter the blood through the thoracic duct. Nascent chylomicrons begin to enter the blood within 1 to 2 hours after the start of a meal; as the meal is digested and absorbed, they continue to enter the blood for many hours. Initially, the particles are called nascent (newborn) chylomicrons. As they accept proteins from HDL within the lymph and the blood, they become "mature" chylomicrons. HDL is the lipoprotein particle with the highest concentration of proteins, and lowest concentration of triacylglycerol (see Chapter 32 for further discussion of HDL and other lipoprotein particles found in the body).

HDL transfers proteins to the nascent chylomicrons, particularly apoE and apoCII (Fig. 29.10). ApoE is recognized by membrane receptors, particularly those on the surface of liver cells, allowing apoE-bearing lipoproteins to enter these cells by endocytosis for subsequent digestion by lysosomes. ApoCII acts as

HDL functions in the transfer of these apolipoproteins and also in transfer of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver (see Table V.I in the introduction to SectionV).

an activator of $L P L$, the enzyme on capillary endothelial cells, primarily within muscle and adipose tissue, that digests the triacylglycerols of the chylomicrons and VLDL in the blood.

## V. Fate of Chylomicrons

The triacylglycerols of the chylomicrons are digested by LPL attached to the proteoglycans in the basement membranes of endothelial cells that line the capillary walls (Fig. 29.11). LPL is produced by adipose cells, muscle cells (particularly cardiac muscle), and cells of the lactating mammary gland. The isozyme synthesized in adipose cells has a higher $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ than the isozyme synthesized in muscle cells. Therefore, adipose LPL is more active after a meal, when chylomicrons levels are elevated in the blood. Insulin stimulates the synthesis and secretion of adipose LPL, so that after a meal, when triglyceride levels increase in circulation, LPL has been upregulated (through insulin release) to facilitate the hydrolysis of fatty acids from the triglyceride.

The fatty acids released from triacylglycerols by LPL are not very soluble in water. They become soluble in blood by forming complexes with the protein albumin. The major fate of the fatty acids is storage as triacylglycerol in adipose tissue. However, these fatty acids also may be oxidized for energy in muscle and other tissues (see Fig. 29.11). The LPL in the capillaries of muscle cells has a lower $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ than adipose LPL. Thus, muscle cells can obtain fatty acids from blood lipoproteins whenever they are needed for energy, even if the concentration of the lipoproteins is low.

The glycerol released from chylomicron triacylglycerols by LPL may be used for triacylglycerol synthesis in the liver in the fed state.

The portion of a chylomicron that remains in the blood after LPL action is known as a chylomicron remnant. The remnant has lost many of the apoCII molecules bound to the mature chylomicron, which exposes apoE. This remnant binds to receptors on hepatocytes (the major cells of the liver), which recognize apoE, and is

0One manner in which individuals can lose weight is to inhibit the activity of pancreatic lipase. This results in reduced fat digestion and absorption and a reduced caloric yield from the diet. The drug orlistat is a chemically synthesized derivative of lipostatin, a natural lipase inhibitor found in certain bacteria. The drug works in the intestinal lumen and forms a covalent bond with the active-site serine residues of both gastric and pancreatic lipase, thereby inhibiting their activities. Nondigested triglycerides are not absorbed by the intestine and are eliminated in the feces. Under normal use of the drug, approximately $30 \%$ of dietary fat absorption is inhibited. Because excessive nondigested fat in the intestines can lead to gastrointestinal distress related to excessive intestinal gas formation, individuals who take this drug need to follow a diet with reduced daily intake of fat, which should be evenly distributed among the meals of the day.

FIGURE 29.II Fate of chylomicrons. Nascent chylomicrons are synthesized in intestinal epithelial cells, secreted into the lymph, pass into the blood, and become mature chylomicrons (see Fig. 29.10). On capillary walls in adipose tissue and muscle, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activated by apoCII digests the triacylglycerols (TG) of chylomicrons to fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids (FA) are oxidized in muscle or stored in adipose cells as triacylglycerols. The remnants of the chylomicrons are taken up by the liver by receptor-mediated endocytosis (through recognition of apoE on the remnant). Lysosomal enzymes within the hepatocyte digest the remnants, releasing the products into the cytosol.

Heparin is a complex polysaccharide (a glycosaminoglycan) that is a component of proteoglycans (see Chapter 47). Isolated heparin is frequently used as an anticoagulant because it binds to antithrombin III (ATIII), and the activated ATIII then binds factors necessary for clotting and inhibits them from working. As LPL is bound to the capillary endothelium through binding to proteoglycans, heparin also can bind to LPL and dislodge it from the capillary wall. This leads to loss of LPL activity and an increase of triglyceride content in the blood.
taken up by the process of endocytosis. Lysosomes fuse with the endocytic vesicles, and the chylomicron remnants are degraded by lysosomal enzymes. The products of lysosomal digestion (e.g., fatty acids, amino acids, glycerol, cholesterol, phosphate) can be reused by the cell.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Will S. The upper abdominal ultrasound study showed a large gallstone lodged in Will S.'s cystic duct, with dilation of this duct proximal to the stone. Intravenous fluids were continued, he was not allowed to take anything by mouth, antibiotics were started, and he was scheduled for a cholecystectomy.

Gallstones can also obstruct the common bile duct, which can cause bilirubin to flow back into the venous blood draining from the liver. As a consequence, serum bilirubin levels, particularly the direct (conjugated) fraction, increase. Tissues such as the sclerae of the eye take up this pigment, which causes them to become yellow (jaundiced, icteric). You can also see inflammation from a cystic duct obstruction and cholecystitis causing some obstruction of the common bile duct and mild elevation of bilirubin.

Al M. Alcohol excess may produce proteinaceous plugs in the small pancreatic ducts, causing back pressure injury and autodigestion of the pancreatic acini drained by these obstructed channels. This process causes one form of acute pancreatitis. Al M. had an episode of acute alcohol-induced pancreatitis superimposed on a more chronic alcohol-related inflammatory process in the pancreas-in other words, chronic pancreatitis. As a result of decreased secretion of pancreatic lipase through the pancreatic ducts and into the lumen of the small intestine, dietary fat was not absorbed at a normal rate, and steatorrhea (fat-rich stools) occurred. If abstinence from alcohol does not allow adequate recovery of the enzymatic secretory function of the pancreas, Mr. M. will have to take a commercial preparation of pancreatic enzymes with meals that contain even minimal amounts of fat.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Microsomal Triglyceride Transfer Protein. The assembly of chylomicrons within the ER of the enterocyte requires the activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). The protein is a dimer of two nonidentical subunits. The smaller subunit ( 57 kDa ) is protein disulfide isomerase (PDI; see Chapter 7, Section IX.A), whereas the larger subunit ( 97 kDa ) contains the triglyceride transfer activity. MTP accelerates the transport of triglycerides, cholesterol esters, and phospholipids across membranes of subcellular organelles. The role of PDI in this complex is not known; the disulfide isomerase activity of this subunit is not needed for triglyceride transport to occur. The lack of triglyceride transfer activity leads to the disease abetalipoproteinemia. This disease affects both chylomicron assembly in the intestine and VLDL assembly in the liver. Both particles require a B apolipoprotein for their assembly (apoB-48 for chylomicrons, apoB-100 for VLDL), and MTP binds to the B apolipoproteins. For both chylomicron and VLDL assembly, a small apoB-containing particle is first produced within the lumen of the ER. The appropriate apoB is made on the rough ER and is inserted into the ER lumen during its synthesis (see Chapter 15, Section VIII). As the protein is being translated, lipid (a small amount of triglyceride) begins to associate with the protein, and the lipid association is catalyzed by MTP. This leads to the generation of small apoB-containing particles; these particles are not formed in patients with abetalipoproteinemia. Thus, it appears that MTP activity is necessary to transfer triacylglycerol formed within the ER to the apoB protein. The second stage of particle assembly is the fusion of the initial apoB particle with triacylglycerol droplets within the ER. The role of MTP in this second step is still

![ma184074519f](ma184074519f.jpg)

under investigation; it may be required for the transfer of triacylglycerol from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the ER to form this lipid droplet. These steps are illustrated in Figure 29.12.

The symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia include lipid malabsorption (and its accompanying symptoms such as steatorrhea and vomiting), which can result in caloric deficiencies and weight loss. Because lipid-soluble vitamin distribution occurs through chylomicron circulation, signs and symptoms of deficiencies in the lipid-soluble vitamins may be seen in these patients.

MTP inhibitors have been investigated and studied for their effect on circulating lipid and cholesterol levels. Although the inhibitors discovered to date are effective in lowering circulating lipid levels, they also initiate severe hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), an unacceptable complication which could lead to liver failure. The steatosis comes about by an accumulation of triglyceride in the liver owing to the inability to form VLDL and export the triglyceride from the liver. The accumulation of triglyceride within hepatocytes will eventually interfere with hepatic function and structure. Current research for MTP inhibitors is aimed toward reducing the severity of fat accumulation in the liver (e.g., by specifically targeting the intestinal MTP without affecting the hepatic MTP).

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Triacylglycerols are the major fat source in the human diet.
- Lipases (lingual lipase in the saliva and gastric lipase in the stomach) perform limited digestion of triacylglycerol before food enters the intestine.
- As food enters the intestine, cholecystokinin is released, which signals the gallbladder to release bile acids and the exocrine pancreas to release digestive enzymes.
- Within the intestine, bile salts emulsify fats, which increase their accessibility to pancreatic lipase and colipase.
- Triacylglycerols are degraded to form free fatty acids and 2-monoacylgylcerol by pancreatic lipase and colipase.
- Dietary phospholipids are hydrolyzed by pancreatic phospholipase A2 in the intestine.
- Dietary cholesterol esters (cholesterol esterified to a fatty acid) are hydrolyzed by pancreatic cholesterol esterase in the intestine.
- Micelles, consisting of bile acids and the products of fat digestion, form within the intestinal lumen and interact with the enterocyte membrane. Lipid-soluble components diffuse from the micelle into the cell.
- Bile salts are resorbed farther down the intestinal tract and are returned to the liver by the enterohepatic circulation.
- The intestinal epithelial cells resynthesize triacylglycerol and package them into nascent chylomicrons for release into the circulation.

- Once they are in the circulation, the nascent chylomicrons interact with HDL particles and acquire two additional protein components, apoCII and apoE.
- ApoCII activates LPL on capillary endothelium of muscle and adipose tissue, which digests the triglycerides in the chylomicron. The fatty acids released from the chylomicron enter the muscle for energy production or the fat cell for storage. The glycerol released is metabolized only in the liver.
- As the chylomicron loses triglyceride, its density increases and it becomes a chylomicron remnant. Chylomicron remnants are removed from circulation by the liver through specific binding of the remnant to apoE receptors on the liver membrane.
- Once it is in the liver, the remnant is degraded and the lipids are recycled.
- Table 29.1 summarizes the diseases discussed in this chapter.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is B. Chylomicrons transport dietary lipids, and $>80 \%$ of the chylomicron is triglyceride. All other components are present at $<10 \%$; hence, all other answers are incorrect.
2. The answer is D. HDL transfers apolipoproteins CII and E to nascent chylomicrons to convert them to mature chylomicrons. Bile salts are required to emulsify dietary lipid, 2-monacylglycerol is a digestion product of pancreatic lipase, lipoprotein lipase digests triglyceride from mature chylomicrons, and the lymphatic system delivers the nascent chylomicrons to the bloodstream.
3. The answer is A. Both apoB-48 and apoB-100 are derived from the same gene and from the same messenger RNA (there is no difference in splicing between the two; thus, B is incorrect). However, RNA editing introduces a stop codon in the message such that $\mathrm{B}_{48}$ stops protein synthesis approximately $48 \%$ along the message. Thus, proteolytic cleavage is not correct. $\mathrm{B}_{48}$ is found only in chylomicrons, and $\mathrm{B}_{100}$ is found only in VLDL particles.
4. The answer is B. The bile salts must be above their CMC in order to form micelles with the components of lipase digestion, fatty acids and 2-monoacylgycerol. In the absence of micelle formation, lipid absorption would not occur. The CMC is independent of triglyceride concentration (thus, A is incorrect). Bile
salts do not bind or activate lipase (thus, C and E are incorrect). The absorption of bile salts in the ileum is not related to digestion (thus, D is incorrect).
5. The answer is D. Nascent chylomicrons would be synthesized, which can only acquire apoCII from HDL (thus, A is incorrect). The chylomicrons would be degraded in part by LPL, leading to chylomicron remnant formation. However, the chylomicron remnants would remain in circulation because of the lack of apoE (thus, B is incorrect). Because these remnant particles still contain a fair amount of triglyceride, serum triglyceride levels will be elevated (thus, C and E are incorrect).
6. The answer is B. Lipase and colipase together are required to digest triglycerides from the diet. Both are secreted by the exocrine pancreas through the pancreatic duct into the common duct and then into the intestine. If colipase cannot make its way into the intestine, lipase is relatively inactive, and triglyceride digestion will not occur. Thus, the triglycerides are eliminated via the feces, leading to steatorrhea. The simultaneous reduction in other pancreatic exocrine secretions leading to an inability to digest proteins (lack of trypsin; pepsin is found in the stomach), or cholesterol esters (cholesterol esterase), or starch (amylase) does not lead to steatorrhea because the triglycerides account for the majority of fat in the diet.

7. The answer is E. The patient, when taking the drug, is not digesting fat or absorbing fat-soluble vitamins (the night-blindness is caused by a lack of vitamin A). This can occur because of mutations in lipase or colipase, or an inability to release cholecystokinin. In the absence of cholecystokinin, the digestive enzymes from the pancreas (including lipase and colipase) will not be secreted to the intestine, nor will bile acids be secreted from the gallbladder to the intestine. This would lead to inefficient triglyceride digestion and to loss of triglyceride and lipid-soluble vitamins in the stools. Loss of LPL activity would lead to elevated triglyceride levels in the blood but not the stool. Loss of albumin synthesis would lead to problems in blood volume but would not lead to steatorrhea. Alterations in glucagon and insulin release do not affect triglyceride digestion in the intestine.
8. The answer is A. Of those listed, only vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin, and the fat-soluble vitamins are
absorbed along with the lipids in the intestine. The other fat-soluble vitamins are D, E, and A. Vitamin $B_{1}$ is thiamin, $\mathrm{B}_{3}$ is niacin, and $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ is pyridoxamine. All of the B vitamins, and vitamin C, are water-soluble, so their absorption into the intestinal epithelial cells would not be blocked by this drug.
9. The answer is D. Intestinal cholecystokinin stimulates release of pancreatic lipase to digest triglyceride, along with other enzymes to digest carbohydrates and proteins. Intestinal secretin signals the liver, pancreas, and some intestinal cells to secrete bicarbonate. The pancreas does not produce cholecystokinin or secretin.
10. The answer is C. Short- and medium-chain fatty acids do not require bile salts for their absorption and therefore do not go into micelles or the lymph. They are absorbed directly into intestinal epithelial cells and enter the portal blood, where they bind to serum albumin.

# Oxidation of Fatty Acids and Ketone Bodies 

Fatty acids are a major fuel for humans and supply our energy needs between meals and during periods of increased demand, such as exercise. During overnight fasting, fatty acids become the major fuel for cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and liver. The liver converts fatty acids to ketone bodies (acetoacetate and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-hydroxybutyrate), which also serve as major fuels for tissues (e.g., the gut). The brain, which does not have a significant capacity for fatty acid oxidation, can use ketone bodies as a fuel during prolonged fasting.

The route of metabolism for a fatty acid depends somewhat on its chain length. Fatty acids are generally classified as very-long-chain-length fatty acids ( $>$ C20), long-chain fatty acids (Cl2 to C20), medium-chain fatty acids (C6 to Cl2), and short-chain fatty acids (C4).

ATP is generated from oxidation of fatty acids in the pathway of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-oxidation. Between meals and during overnight fasting, long-chain fatty acids are released from adipose tissue triacylglycerols. They circulate through blood bound to albumin (Fig. 30.1). In cells, they are converted to fatty acyl coenzyme A (fatty acyl-CoA) derivatives by acyl-CoA synthetases. The activated acyl group is transported into the mitochondrial matrix bound to carnitine, where fatty acyl-CoA is regenerated. In the pathway of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-oxidation, the fatty acyl group is sequentially oxidized to yield reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD[2H]), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). Subsequent oxidation of NADH and FAD(2H) in the electron-transport chain, and oxidation of acetyl-CoA to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from oxidative phosphorylation.

Many fatty acids have structures that require variations of this basic pattern. Longchain fatty acids that are unsaturated fatty acids generally require additional isomerization and oxidation-reduction reactions to rearrange their double bonds during $\beta$-oxidation. Metabolism of water-soluble medium-chain-length fatty acids does not require carnitine and occurs only in the liver. Odd-chain-length fatty acids undergo $\beta$-oxidation to the terminal three-carbon propionyl coenzyme A (propionylCoA), which enters the TCA cycle as succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA).

Fatty acids that do not readily undergo mitochondrial $\beta$-oxidation are oxidized first by alternate routes that convert them to more suitable substrates or to urinary excretion products. Excess fatty acids may undergo microsomal $\omega$-oxidation, which converts them to dicarboxylic acids that appear in urine. Very-long-chain fatty acids (both straight-chain and branched fatty acids such as phytanic acid) are whittled down to size in peroxisomes. Peroxisomal $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ - and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-oxidation generates hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathbf{H}_{2} \mathbf{O}_{2}\right)$, NADH, acetyl-CoA, or propionyl-CoA and a short- to medium-chain-length acyl-CoA. The acyl-CoA products are transferred to mitochondria to complete their metabolism.

In the liver, much of the acetyl-CoA generated from fatty acid oxidation is converted to the ketone bodies acetoacetate and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-hydroxybutyrate, which enter the blood (see Fig. 30.1). In other tissues, these ketone bodies are converted to acetyl-CoA, which is oxidized in the TCA cycle. The liver synthesizes ketone bodies but cannot use them as a fuel.

The rate of fatty acid oxidation is linked to the rate of NADH, FAD(2H), and acetyl-CoA oxidation and thus to the rate of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP use. Additional regulation occurs through malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA),

which inhibits mitochondrial entry of the fatty acylcarnitine derivatives. Fatty acids and ketone bodies are used as fuel when their level increases in the blood, which is determined by hormonal regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis.

On the day of admission for this episode, Lola had missed breakfast, and by noon she was extremely fatigued, nauseated, and weak. She was unable to hold any food in her stomach and was rushed to the hospital, where an infusion of glucose was started intravenously. Her symptoms responded dramatically to this therapy.

Her initial serum glucose level was low, at $38 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. (reference range for fasting serum glucose levels, 70 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level was slightly elevated at $26 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. (reference range, 8 to $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) because of vomiting, which led to a degree of dehydration. Her blood levels of liver transaminases were slightly elevated, although her liver was not palpably enlarged. Despite elevated levels of free fatty acids ( 4.3 mM ) in the blood, which were later tested, blood ketone bodies were below normal.

Dilanne A., a 27-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus, had been admitted to the hospital in a ketoacidotic coma a year ago (see Chapter 4). She had been feeling drowsy and had been vomiting for 24 hours before that admission. At the time of admission, she was clinically dehydrated, her blood pressure was low, and her breathing was deep and rapid (Kussmaul breathing). Her pulse was rapid, and her breath had the odor of acetone. Her arterial blood pH was 7.08 (reference range, 7.36 to 7.44 ), and her blood ketone body levels were 15 mM (normal is $\sim 0.2 \mathrm{mM}$ for a person on a normal diet).

## I. Fatty Acids as Fuels

The fatty acids oxidized as fuels are principally long-chain fatty acids released from adipose tissue triacylglycerol stores between meals, during overnight fasting, and during periods of increased fuel demand (e.g., during exercise). Adipose tissue triacylglycerols are derived from two sources; dietary lipids and triacylglycerols synthesized in the liver. The major fatty acids oxidized are the long-chain fatty acids, palmitate, oleate, and stearate, because they are highest in dietary lipids and are also synthesized in humans.

Between meals, a decreased insulin level and increased levels of insulin counterregulatory hormones (e.g., glucagon) activate lipolysis, and free fatty acids are transported to tissues bound to serum albumin. Within tissues, energy is derived from oxidation of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA in the pathway of $\beta$-oxidation. Most of the enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation are present as two or three isoenzymes, which have different but overlapping specificities for the chain length of the fatty acid. Metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids, odd-chain-length fatty acids, and medium-chain-length fatty acids requires variations of this basic pattern. The acetyl-CoA produced from fatty acid oxidation is principally oxidized in the TCA cycle or converted to ketone bodies in the liver.

## A. Characteristics of Fatty Acids Used as Fuels

Fat constitutes approximately $38 \%$ of the calories in the average North American diet. Of this, more than $95 \%$ of the calories are present as triacylglycerols (three fatty acids esterified to a glycerol backbone). During ingestion and absorption, dietary triacylglycerols are broken down into their constituents and then reassembled for transport to adipose tissue in chylomicrons (see Chapter 29). Thus, the fatty acid composition of adipose triacylglycerols varies with the type of food consumed.

The most common dietary fatty acids are the saturated long-chain fatty acids palmitate (C16) and stearate (C18), the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate (C18:1), and the polyunsaturated essential fatty acid linoleate (C18:2) (To review fatty acid nomenclature, consult Chapter 5.) Animal fat contains principally saturated and monounsaturated long-chain fatty acids, whereas vegetable oils contain linoleate and some longer chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids. They also contain smaller amounts of branched-chain and odd-chain-length fatty acids. Medium-chain-length fatty acids are present principally in dairy fat (e.g., milk, butter), maternal milk, and vegetable oils.

(1)The liver transaminases measured in the blood are aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which was previously designated serum glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which was previously designated serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT). Elevation of these enzymes in the serum reflects damage to the liver cell plasma membrane. Transaminases catalyze the transfer of the nitrogen group of an amino acid to an acceptor $\alpha$-keto acid. For AST, aspartate donates the nitrogen to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, forming oxaloacetate (the corresponding $\alpha$-keto acid to aspartate) and glutamate. For ALT, alanine donates the nitrogen to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, forming pyruvate and glutamate. Transaminase activity is measured using a coupled reaction: Both oxaloacetate and pyruvate can be reduced by NADH to form, respectively, malate and lactate, in the presence of the appropriate secondary enzyme (malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase). Thus, automated procedures that follow the loss of NADH in the reaction mix (by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm ) can be used to measure the activity of AST and ALT in serum samples.

(2)During Otto S.'s distance running (a moderate-intensity exercise), decreases in insulin and increases in insulin counterregulatory hormones, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, increase adipose tissue lipolysis. Thus, his muscles are being provided with a supply of fatty acids in the blood that they can use as a fuel.

(3)Lola B. developed symptoms during fasting, when adipose tissue lipolysis was elevated. Under these circumstances, muscle tissue, liver, and many other tissues are oxidizing fatty acids as a fuel. After overnight fasting, approximately $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ of our energy supply is derived from the oxidation of fatty acids.

Adipose tissue triacylglycerols also contain fatty acids synthesized in the liver, principally from excess calories ingested as glucose. The pathway of fatty acid synthesis generates palmitate, which can be elongated to form stearate or unsaturated to form oleate. These fatty acids are assembled into triacylglycerols and transported to adipose tissue as the lipoprotein very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL).

# B. Transport and Activation of Long-Chain Fatty Acids 

Long-chain fatty acids are hydrophobic and, therefore, water-insoluble. In addition, they are toxic to cells because they can disrupt the hydrophobic bonding between amino acid side chains in proteins. Consequently, they are transported in the blood and in cells bound to proteins.

## I. Cellular Uptake of Long-Chain Fatty Acids

During fasting and other conditions of metabolic need, long-chain fatty acids are released from adipose tissue triacylglycerols by lipases. They travel in the blood bound in the hydrophobic binding pocket of albumin, the major serum protein (see Fig. 30.1).

Fatty acids enter cells both by a saturable transport process and by diffusion through the lipid plasma membrane. A fatty acid-binding protein in the plasma membrane facilitates transport. An additional fatty acid-binding protein binds the fatty acid intracellularly and may facilitate its transport to the mitochondrion. The free fatty acid concentration in cells is, therefore, extremely low.

## 2. Activation of Long-Chain Fatty Acids

Fatty acids must be activated to acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) derivatives before they can participate in $\beta$-oxidation and other metabolic pathways (Fig. 30.2). The process of activation involves an acyl-CoA synthetase (also called a thiokinase) that uses ATP energy to form the fatty acyl-CoA thioester bond. In this reaction, the $\beta$-bond of ATP is cleaved to form a fatty acyl adenosine monophosphate (AMP) intermediate and pyrophosphate $\left(\mathrm{PP}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$. Subsequent cleavage of PP, helps to drive the reaction.

The acyl-CoA synthetase that activates long-chain fatty acids, 12 to 20 carbons in length, is present in three locations in the cell: the endoplasmic reticulum, outer

mitochondrial membranes, and peroxisomal membranes (Table 30.1). This enzyme has no activity toward C22 or longer fatty acids and little activity below C12. In contrast, the synthetase for activation of very-long-chain fatty acids is present in peroxisomes, and the medium-chain-length fatty acid-activating enzyme is present only in the mitochondrial matrix of liver and kidney cells.

## 3. Fates of Fatty Acyl Coenzyme A

Fatty acyl-CoA formation, like the phosphorylation of glucose, is a prerequisite to metabolism of the fatty acid in the cell (Fig. 30.3). The multiple locations of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase reflect the location of different metabolic routes

FIGURE 30.3 Major metabolic routes for long-chain fatty acyl coenzyme As (acylCoAs). Fatty acids are activated to acyl-CoA compounds for degradation in mitochondrial $\beta$-oxidation, or incorporation into triacylglycerols or membrane lipids. When $\beta$-oxidation is blocked through an inherited enzyme deficiency, or metabolic regulation, excess fatty acids are diverted into triacylglycerol synthesis.

Several inherited diseases in the metabolism of carnitine or acylcarnitines have been described. These include defects in the following enzymes or systems: the transporter for carnitine uptake into muscle, CPTI, carnitine:acylcarnitine translocase, and CPTII. Classical CPTII deficiency, the most common of these diseases (although still very rare), is characterized by adolescent to adult onset of recurrent episodes of acute myoglobinuria, with muscle pain and weakness, precipitated by prolonged exercise or fasting. During these episodes, the patient is weak, and may be somewhat hypoglycemic with diminished ketosis (hypoketosis), but metabolic decompensation is not severe. Lipid deposits are found in skeletal muscles. Both creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and long-chain acylcarnitines are elevated in the blood. CPTII levels in fibroblasts are approximately $25 \%$ of normal. The residual CPTII activity probably accounts for the mild effect on liver metabolism. In contrast, when CPTII deficiency presents in infants, CPTII levels are $<10 \%$ of normal, the hypoglycemia and hypoketosis are severe, hepatomegaly occurs from the triacylglycerol deposits, and cardiomyopathy is also present.

Fatty acylcarnitine
FIGURE 30.4 Structure of fatty acylcarnitine. Carnitine palmitoyltransferases catalyze the reversible transfer of a long-chain fatty acyl group from the fatty acyl coenzyme A (fatty acyl-CoA) to the hydroxyl group of carnitine. The atoms in the green box originate from the fatty acyl-CoA.
taken by fatty acyl-CoA derivatives in the cell (e.g., triacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, oxidation and plasmalogen synthesis in the peroxisome, and $\beta$-oxidation in mitochondria). In the liver and some other tissues, fatty acids that are not being used for energy generation are reincorporated (re-esterified) into triacylglycerols.

## 4. Transport of Long-Chain Fatty Acids into Mitochondria

Carnitine serves as the carrier that transports activated long-chain fatty acyl groups across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 30.4). Carnitine acyltransferases are able to reversibly transfer an activated fatty acyl group from coenzyme A (CoA) to the hydroxyl group of carnitine to form an acylcarnitine ester. The reaction is reversible, so the fatty acyl-CoA derivative can be regenerated from the carnitine ester.

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI; also called carnitine acyltransferase I [CATI]), the enzyme that transfers long-chain fatty acyl groups from CoA to carnitine, is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 30.5). Fatty acylcarnitine crosses the inner mitochondrial membrane with the aid of a translocase. The fatty acyl group is transferred back to CoA by a second enzyme, carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPTII [or CATII]). The carnitine released in this reaction returns to the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial membrane by the same translocase that brings fatty acylcarnitine to the matrix side. Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, now located within the mitochondrial matrix, is a substrate for $\beta$-oxidation.

Carnitine is obtained from the diet or synthesized from the side chain of lysine by a pathway that begins in skeletal muscle, and is completed in the liver. The reactions use $S$-adenosylmethionine to donate methyl groups, and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is also required for these reactions. Skeletal muscles have a high-affinity uptake system for carnitine, and most of the carnitine in the body is stored in skeletal muscle.

FIGURE 30.5 Transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria. The fatty acyl coenzyme A (fatty acyl-CoA) crosses the outer mitochondrial membrane. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I in the outer mitochondrial membrane transfers the fatty acyl group to carnitine and releases CoASH. The fatty acylcarnitine is translocated into the mitochondrial matrix as carnitine moves out. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II on the inner mitochondrial membrane transfers the fatty acyl group back to CoASH, to form fatty acyl-CoA in the matrix. AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CoA, coenzyme A; $P P_{i}$, pyrophosphate.

## C. $\beta$-Oxidation of Long-Chain Fatty Acids

The oxidation of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA in the $\beta$-oxidation spiral conserves energy as $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ and NADH. FAD(2H) and NADH are oxidized in the electron-transport chain, generating ATP from oxidative phosphorylation. Acetyl-CoA is oxidized in the TCA cycle or converted to ketone bodies.

## I. The $\beta$-Oxidation Spiral

The fatty acid $\beta$-oxidation pathway sequentially cleaves the fatty acyl group into two-carbon acetyl-CoA units, beginning with the carboxyl end attached to CoA (Fig. 30.6). Before cleavage, the $\beta$-carbon is oxidized to a keto group in two reactions that generate NADH and FAD(2H); thus, the pathway is called $\beta$-oxidation. As each acetyl group is released, the cycle of $\beta$-oxidation and cleavage begins again, but each time, the fatty acyl group is two carbons shorter.

The $\beta$-oxidation pathway consists of four separate steps or reactions (Fig. 30.7).

1. In the first step, a double bond is formed between the $\beta$ - and $\alpha$-carbons by an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase that transfers electrons to FAD. The double bond is in the trans configuration (a $\Delta^{2}$-trans double bond).
2. In the next step, an -OH from water is added to the $\beta$-carbon, and an -H from water is added to the $\alpha$-carbon. The enzyme is called an enoyl

What is the total ATP yield for the oxidation of 1 mol of palmitic acid to carbon dioxide and water?

CoA hydratase (hydratases add the elements of water, and "-ene" in a name denotes a double bond).
3. In the third step of $\beta$-oxidation, the hydroxyl group on the $\beta$-carbon is oxidized to a ketone by a hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. In this reaction, as in the conversion of most alcohols to ketones, the electrons are transferred to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to form NADH.
4. In the last reaction of the sequence, the bond between the $\beta$ - and $\alpha$-carbons is cleaved by a reaction that attaches CoASH to the $\beta$-carbon, and acetylCoA is released. This is a thiolytic reaction (lysis refers to breakage of the bond, and thio refers to the sulfur), catalyzed by enzymes called $\beta$-ketothiolases. The release of two carbons from the carboxyl end of the original fatty acyl-CoA produces acetyl-CoA and a fatty acyl-CoA that is two carbons shorter than the original. It is of interest to note that the $\beta$-oxidation spiral uses the same reaction types seen in the TCA cycle in the conversion of succinate to oxaloacetate.
The shortened fatty acyl-CoA repeats these four steps until all of its carbons are converted to acetyl-CoA. $\beta$-Oxidation is thus a spiral rather than a cycle. In the last spiral, cleavage of the four-carbon fatty acyl-CoA (butyryl coenzyme A [butyrylCoA]) produces two molecules of acetyl-CoA. Thus, an even-chain fatty acid such as palmitoyl coenzyme A (palmitoyl-CoA), which has 16 carbons, is cleaved seven times, producing seven molecules of $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$, seven of NADH, and eight of acetyl-CoA.

## 2. Energy Yield of $\beta$-Oxidation

Like the FAD in all flavoproteins, $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ bound to the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases is oxidized back to FAD without dissociating from the protein (Fig. 30.8). ETFs in the mitochondrial matrix accept electrons from the enzyme-bound FAD(2H) and transfer these electrons to electron-transfer flavoprotein- $\mathrm{CoQ}$ oxidoreductase (ETF-QO) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. ETF-QO, also a flavoprotein, transfers the electrons to CoQ in the electron-transport chain. Oxidative phosphorylation thus generates approximately 1.5 ATP for each $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ produced in the $\beta$-oxidation spiral.

The total energy yield from the oxidation of 1 mol of palmitoyl-CoA to 8 mol of acetyl-CoA is, therefore, 28 mol of ATP: 1.5 for each of the $7 \mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$, and 2.5 for each of the 7 NADH. To calculate the energy yield from oxidation of 1 mol of palmitate, two ATP need to be subtracted from the total because two high-energy phosphate bonds are cleaved when palmitate is activated to palmitoyl-CoA.

## 3. Chain-Length Specificity in $\beta$-Oxidation

The four reactions of $\beta$-oxidation are catalyzed by sets of enzymes that are each specific for fatty acids with different chain lengths (see Table 30.1). The acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, which catalyze the first step of the pathway, are part of an enzyme family that, in mammals, has three different ranges of specificity. The subsequent steps of the spiral use enzymes that are specific for long- or short-chain enoyl coenzyme As (enoyl-CoAs). Although these enzymes are structurally distinct, their specificities overlap to some extent. As the fatty acyl chains are shortened by consecutive cleavage of two carbon units, they are transferred from enzymes that act on longer chains to those that act on shorter chains. Medium- or short-chain fatty acylCoA that may be formed from dietary fatty acids, or transferred from peroxisomes, enters the spiral at the enzyme that is most active for fatty acids of its chain length.

## 4. Oxidation of Unsaturated Fatty Acids

Approximately one-half of the fatty acids in the human diet are unsaturated, containing cis double bonds, with oleate ( $\mathrm{C} 18: 1, \Delta^{9}$ ) and linoleate ( $18: 2, \Delta^{9,12}$ ) being the most common. In $\beta$-oxidation of saturated fatty acids, a trans double bond is created between the second and third ( $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ) carbons. For unsaturated fatty acids to undergo the $\beta$-oxidation spiral, their cis double bonds must be isomerized to

trans double bonds that will end up between the second and third carbons during $\beta$-oxidation, or the double bond must be reduced. The process is illustrated for the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleate in Figure 30.9. Linoleate is obtained from the diet and cannot be synthesized by humans; thus, it is considered an essential fatty acid. Therefore, only that portion of linoleate that is not needed for other processes will be oxidized. Linoleate undergoes $\beta$-oxidation until one double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 near the carboxyl end of the fatty acyl chain and the other is between carbons 6 and 7. An isomerase moves the double bond from the 3,4-position so that it is trans and in the 2,3-position, and $\beta$-oxidation continues. When a conjugated

FIGURE 30.9 Oxidation of linoleate. After three spirals of $\beta$-oxidation (dashed lines), there is now a 3,4-cis double bond and a 6,7-cis double bond. The 3,4-cis double bond is isomerized to a 2,3-trans double bond, which is in the proper configuration for the normal enzymes to act. One spiral of $\beta$-oxidation occurs, plus the first step of a second spiral. A reductase that uses reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) now converts these two double bonds (between carbons 2 and 3 and between carbons 4 and 5) to one double bond between carbons 3 and 4 in a trans configuration. The isomerase (which can act on double bonds that are in either the cis or the trans configuration) moves this double bond to the 2,3-trans position, and $\beta$-oxidation can resume. CoA, coenzyme A.

After reviewing Lola B.'s previous hospital records, a specialist suspected that Lola's medical problems were caused by a disorder in fatty acid metabolism. A battery of tests showed that Lola's blood contained elevated levels of several partially oxidized medium-chain fatty acids, such as octanoic acid ( 80 ) and 4 -decenoic acid $\left(10: 1, \Delta^{4}\right)$. A urine specimen showed an increase in organic acid metabolites of medium-chain fatty acids containing 6 to 10 carbons, including medium-chain acylcarnitine derivatives. The profile of acylcarnitine species in the urine was characteristic of a genetically determined medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency in this disease, long-chain fatty acids are metabolized by $\beta$-oxidation to a medium-chain-length acyl-CoA, such as octanoyl coenzyme A. Because further oxidation of this compound is blocked in MCAD deficiency, the medium-chain acyl group is transferred back to carnitine. These acylcarnitines are water-soluble and appear in blood and urine. The specific enzyme deficiency was demonstrated in cultured fibroblasts from Lola's skin as well as in her circulating monocytic leukocytes.

In LCAD deficiency, fatty acylcarnitines accumulate in the blood. Those containing 14 carbons predominate. However, these do not appear in the urine.

Palmitic acid is 16 carbons long, with no double bonds, so it requires seven oxidation spirals to be completely converted to acetyl-CoA. After seven spirals, there are $7 \mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H}), 7 \mathrm{NADH}$, and 8 acetyl-CoA. Each NADH yields 2.5 ATP, each FAD(2H) yields 1.5 ATP, and each acetyl-CoA yields 10 ATP as it is processed through the TCA cycle. This then yields $17.5+10.5+80=108$ ATP. However, activation of palmitic acid to palmitoyl-CoA requires two high-energy bonds, so the net yield is $108-2$, or 106 mol of ATP.

The unripe fruit of the ackee tree produces a toxin, hypoglycin, which causes a condition known as Jamaican vomiting sickness. The victims of the toxin are usually unwary children who eat this unripe fruit and develop a severe hypoglycemia, which is often fatal.

Although hypoglycin causes hypoglycemia, it acts by inhibiting an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase involved in $\beta$-oxidation that has specificity for short- and medium-chain fatty acids. Because more glucose must be oxidized to compensate for the decreased ability of fatty acids to serve as fuel, blood glucose levels may fall to extremely low levels. Fatty acid levels, however, rise because of decreased $\beta$-oxidation. As a result of the increased fatty acid levels, $\omega$-oxidation increases, and dicarboxylic acids are excreted in the urine. The diminished capacity to oxidize fatty acids in liver mitochondria results in decreased levels of acetyl-CoA, the substrate for ketone body synthesis.

FIGURE 30.10 Formation of propionyl coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA) from odd-chain fatty acids. Successive spirals of $\beta$-oxidation cleave each of the bonds marked with dashed lines, producing acetyl coenzyme A (acetylCoA) except for the three carbons at the $\omega$-end, which produce propionyl-CoA.
pair of double bonds is formed (two double bonds separated by one single bond) at positions 2 and 4 , an NADPH-dependent reductase reduces the pair to one trans double bond at position 3. Then, isomerization and $\beta$-oxidation resume.

In oleate (C18:1, $\Delta^{9}$ ), there is only one double bond between carbons 9 and 10. It is handled by an isomerization reaction similar to that shown for the double bond at position 9 of linoleate.

## 5. Odd-Chain-Length Fatty Acids

Fatty acids that contain an odd number of carbon atoms undergo $\beta$-oxidation, producing acetyl-CoA, until the last spiral, when five carbons remain in the fatty acyl-CoA. In this case, cleavage by thiolase produces acetyl-CoA and a three-carbon fatty acyl-CoA, propionyl coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA) (Fig. 30.10). Carboxylation of propionyl-CoA yields methylmalonyl coenzyme A (methylmalonyl-CoA), which is ultimately converted to succinyl-CoA in a vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-dependent reaction (Fig. 30.11). Propionyl-CoA also arises from the oxidation of branched-chain amino acids.

Succinyl CoA
FIGURE 30.II Conversion of propionyl coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA) to succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA). Succinyl-CoA, an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, can form malate, which can be converted to glucose in the liver through the process of gluconeogenesis. Certain amino acids also form glucose by this route (see Chapter 37). ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CoA, coenzyme A; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.

The propionyl-CoA-succinyl-CoA pathway is a major anaplerotic route for the TCA cycle and is used in the degradation of valine, isoleucine, and several other compounds. In the liver, this route provides precursors of oxaloacetate, which is converted to glucose. Thus, this small proportion of the odd-carbon-number fatty acid chain can be converted to glucose. In contrast, the acetyl-CoA formed from $\beta$ oxidation of even-chain-number fatty acids in the liver either enters the TCA cycle, where it is principally oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, or it is converted to ketone bodies.

## D. Oxidation of Medium-Chain-Length Fatty Acids

Dietary medium-chain-length fatty acids are more water-soluble than long-chain fatty acids and are not stored in adipose triacylglycerol. After a meal, they enter the blood and pass into the portal vein to the liver. In the liver, they enter the mitochondrial matrix by the monocarboxylate transporter and are activated to acyl-CoA derivatives in the mitochondrial matrix (see Fig. 30.1). Medium-chain-length acylCoAs, like long-chain acyl-CoAs, are oxidized to acetyl-CoA via the $\beta$-oxidation spiral. Medium-chain acyl-CoAs also can arise from the peroxisomal oxidation pathway.

The medium-chain-length acyl-CoA synthetase has a broad range of specificity for compounds of approximately the same size that contain a carboxyl group, such as drugs (salicylate, from aspirin metabolism, and valproate, which is used to treat epileptic seizures) or benzoate, a common component of plants. Once the drug CoA derivative is formed, the carboxyl group is conjugated with glycine to form a urinary excretion product. With certain disorders of fatty acid oxidation, medium- and short-chain fatty acylglycines may appear in the urine, together with acylcarnitines or dicarboxylic acids. Octanoylglycine, for example, will appear in the urine of a patient with MCAD deficiency.

## E. Regulation of $\beta$-Oxidation

Fatty acids are used as fuels principally when they are released from adipose tissue triacylglycerols in response to hormones that signal fasting or increased demand. Many tissues, such as muscle and kidney, oxidize fatty acids completely to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. In these tissues, the acetyl-CoA produced by $\beta$-oxidation enters the TCA cycle. The $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ and the NADH from $\beta$-oxidation and the TCA cycle are reoxidized by the electron-transport chain, and ATP is generated. The process of $\beta$-oxidation is regulated by the cells' requirements for energy (i.e., by the levels of ATP and NADH) because fatty acids cannot be oxidized any faster than NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ are reoxidized in the electron-transport chain.

Fatty acid oxidation also may be restricted by the mitochondrial CoASH pool size. Acetyl-CoASH units must enter the TCA cycle or another metabolic pathway to regenerate CoASH required for formation of the fatty acyl-CoA derivative from fatty acylcarnitine.

An additional type of regulation occurs at CPTI. CPTI is inhibited by malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA), which is synthesized in the cytosol of many tissues by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Fig. 30.12). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is regulated by several different mechanisms, some of which are tissue-dependent. In skeletal muscles and liver, it is inhibited when it is phosphorylated by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Thus, during exercise, when AMP levels increase, AMPK is activated and phosphorylates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which becomes inactive. Consequently, malonyl-CoA levels decrease, CPTI is activated, and the $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids is able to restore ATP homeostasis and decrease AMP levels. In liver, in addition to the negative regulation by the AMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by insulin-dependent mechanisms leading to elevated cytoplasmic citrate, an allosteric activator, which promotes the conversion of malonyl-CoA to palmitate in the fatty acid synthesis pathway. Thus, in the liver, malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPTI prevents newly synthesized fatty acids from being oxidized.

0As Otto S. runs, his skeletal muscles increase their use of ATP and their rate of fuel oxidation. Fatty acid oxidation is accelerated by the increased rate of the electrontransport chain. As ATP is used and AMP increases, the AMPK acts to facilitate fuel use and maintain ATP homeostasis. Phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase results in a decreased level of malonylCoA and increased activity of CPTI. At the same time, AMPK facilitates the recruitment of glucose transporters into the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle, thereby increasing the rate of glucose uptake. AMP and hormonal signals also increase the supply of glucose 6-P from glycogenolysis. Thus, his muscles are supplied with more fuel, and all the oxidative pathways are accelerated.

$\beta$-Oxidation is strictly an aerobic pathway, dependent on oxygen, a good blood supply, and adequate levels of mitochondria. Tissues that lack mitochondria, such as red blood cells, cannot oxidize fatty acids by $\beta$-oxidation. Fatty acids also do not serve as a significant fuel for the brain. They are not used by adipocytes, whose function is to store triacylglycerols to provide a fuel for other tissues. Those tissues that do not use fatty acids as a fuel, or use them only to a limited extent, use ketone bodies instead.

# II. Alternative Routes of Fatty Acid Oxidation 

Fatty acids that are not readily oxidized by the enzymes of $\beta$-oxidation enter alternative pathways of oxidation, including peroxisomal $\beta$ - and $\alpha$-oxidation and microsomal $\omega$-oxidation. The function of these pathways is to convert as much as possible of the unusual fatty acids to compounds that can be used as fuels or biosynthetic precursors and to convert the remainder to compounds that can be excreted in bile or urine. During prolonged fasting, fatty acids released from adipose triacylglycerols may enter the $\omega$-oxidation or peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation pathway, even though they have a normal composition. These pathways not only use fatty acids, they act on xenobiotic (a term used to cover all organic compounds that are foreign to an organism) carboxylic acids that are large hydrophobic molecules resembling fatty acids.

## A. Peroxisomal Oxidation of Fatty Acids

A small proportion of our diet consists of very-long-chain fatty acids ( 20 or more carbons) or branched-chain fatty acids arising from degradative products of chlorophyll. Very-long-chain fatty acid synthesis also occurs within the body, especially in cells of the brain and nervous system, which incorporate them into the sphingolipids of myelin. These fatty acids are oxidized by peroxisomal $\beta$ - and $\alpha$-oxidation pathways, which are essentially chain-shortening pathways.

## I. Very-Long-Chain Fatty Acids

Very-long-chain fatty acids of 24 to 26 carbons are oxidized exclusively in peroxisomes by a sequence of reactions similar to mitochondrial $\beta$-oxidation in that they generate acetyl-CoA and NADH. However, the peroxisomal oxidation of straightchain fatty acids stops when the chain reaches 4 to 6 carbons in length. Some of the long-chain fatty acids also may be oxidized by this route.

![ma334074519f](ma334074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 30.13 Oxidation of fatty acids in peroxisomes. The first step of $\beta$-oxidation is catalyzed by a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-containing oxidase. The electrons are transferred from $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which is reduced to hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right) \cdot \mathrm{CoA}$, coenzyme A .

The long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase is present in the peroxisomal membrane, and the acyl-CoA derivatives enter the peroxisome by a transporter that does not require carnitine. The first enzyme of peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation is an oxidase, which donates electrons directly to molecular oxygen and produces hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ (Fig. 30.13). (In contrast, the first enzyme of mitochondrial $\beta$-oxidation is a dehydrogenase that contains FAD and transfers the electrons to the electron-transport chain via ETF.) Thus, the first enzyme of peroxisomal oxidation is not linked to energy production. The three remaining steps of $\beta$-oxidation are catalyzed by enoylCoA hydratase, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and thiolase, enzymes with activities similar to those found in mitochondrial $\beta$-oxidation but coded for by different genes. Thus, one NADH and one acetyl-CoA are generated for each turn of the spiral. The peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation spiral continues generating acetyl-CoA until a mediumchain acyl-CoA, which may be as short as butyryl-CoA, is produced (Fig. 30.14).

These shortto medium-chain fatty acyl-CoAs are converted to carnitine derivatives by COT or CAT in the peroxisomes. In the mitochondria, short-chain fatty acylcarnitine is converted back to acyl-CoA derivatives by either CPTII or CAT.

Zellweger syndrome, the most severe form of a group of related conditions called the Zellweger spectrum disorder, results from defective peroxisomal biogenesis. It leads to complex developmental and metabolic phenotypes that affect, principally, the liver and the brain. One of the metabolic characteristics of these diseases is an elevation of C260 and C26:1 fatty acid levels in plasma. Refsum disease is caused by a deficiency in a single peroxisomal enzyme, the phytanoyl coenzyme A hydroxylase that carries out $\alpha$-oxidation of phytanic acid. Symptoms include retinitis pigmentosa, cerebellar ataxia, and chronic polyneuropathy. Because phytanic acid is obtained solely from the diet, placing patients on a low-phytanic acid diet has resulted in marked improvement.

FIGURE 30.15 Oxidation of phytanic acid. A peroxisomal $\alpha$-hydroxylase oxidizes the $\alpha$-carbon, and its subsequent oxidation to a carboxyl group releases the carboxyl carbon as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Subsequent spirals of peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation alternately release propionyl and acetyl coenzyme A. At a chain length of approximately eight carbons, the remaining branched fatty acid is transferred to mitochondria as a medium-chain carnitine derivative.
![ma364074519f](ma364074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 30.16 $\omega$-Oxidation of fatty acids converts them to dicarboxylic acids.

Within the peroxisome, the acetyl groups can be transferred from CoA to carnitine by an acetylcarnitine transferase, or they can enter the cytosol. A similar reaction converts medium-chain-length acyl-CoAs and the short-chain butyryl-CoA to acylcarnitine derivatives. These acylcarnitines diffuse from the peroxisome to the mitochondria, pass through the outer mitochondrial membrane, and are transported through the inner mitochondrial membrane via the carnitine translocase system. They are converted back to acyl-CoAs by carnitine acyltransferases appropriate for their chain length and enter the normal pathways for $\beta$-oxidation and acetyl-CoA metabolism. The electrons from NADH and acetyl-CoA can also pass from the peroxisome to the cytosol. The export of NADH-containing electrons occurs through use of a shuttle system similar to those described for NADH electron transfer into the mitochondria.

Peroxisomes are present in almost every cell type and contain many degradative enzymes, in addition to fatty acyl-CoA oxidase, that generate hydrogen peroxide. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ can generate toxic free radicals. Thus, these enzymes are confined to peroxisomes, where the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ can be neutralized by the free-radical defense enzyme catalase. Catalase converts $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ to water and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see Chapter 25).

## 2. Long-Chain Branched-Chain Fatty Acids

Two of the most common branched-chain fatty acids in the diet are phytanic acid and pristanic acid, which are degradation products of chlorophyll and thus are consumed in green vegetables. Animals do not synthesize branched-chain fatty acids. These two multimethylated fatty acids are oxidized in peroxisomes to the level of a branched C 8 fatty acid, which is then transferred to mitochondria. The pathway thus is similar to that for the oxidation of straight very-long-chain fatty acids.

Phytanic acid, a multimethylated C20 fatty acid, is first oxidized to pristanic acid using the $\alpha$-oxidation pathway (Fig. 30.15). Phytanic acid hydroxylase introduces a hydroxyl group on the $\alpha$-carbon, which is then oxidized to a carboxyl group with release of the original carboxyl group as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. By shortening the fatty acid by one carbon, the methyl groups will appear on the $\alpha$-carbon rather than the $\beta$-carbon during the $\beta$-oxidation spiral and can no longer interfere with oxidation of the $\beta$-carbon. Peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation thus can proceed normally, releasing propionylCoA and acetyl-CoA with alternate turns of the spiral. When a medium-chain length of approximately eight carbons is reached, the fatty acid is transferred to the mitochondrion as a carnitine derivative, and $\beta$-oxidation is resumed.

## B. $\omega$-Oxidation of Fatty Acids

Fatty acids also may be oxidized at the $\omega$-carbon of the chain (the terminal methyl group) by enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 30.16). The $\omega$-methyl group is first oxidized to an alcohol by an enzyme that uses cytochrome P450, molecular oxygen, and NADPH. Dehydrogenases convert the alcohol group to a carboxylic acid. The dicarboxylic acids produced by $\omega$-oxidation can undergo $\beta$-oxidation, forming compounds with 6 to 10 carbons that are water-soluble. Such compounds may then enter the blood, be oxidized as medium-chain fatty acids, or be excreted in urine as medium-chain dicarboxylic acids.

Normally, $\omega$-oxidation is a minor process. However, in conditions that interfere with $\beta$-oxidation (such as carnitine deficiency or deficiency in an enzyme of $\beta$-oxidation), $\omega$-oxidation produces dicarboxylic acids in increased amounts. These dicarboxylic acids are excreted in the urine.

Lola B. was excreting dicarboxylic acids in her urine, particularly adipic acid (which has six carbons) and suberic acid (which has eight carbons):

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
" \mathrm{OOC}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{COO}^{-} & \text {Adipic acid } \\
" \mathrm{OOC}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{COO}^{-} & \text {Suberic acid }
\end{array}
$$

Octanoylglycine was also found in the urine.

The pathways of peroxisomal $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-oxidation, and microsomal $\omega$-oxidation, are not feedback-regulated. These pathways function to decrease levels of waterinsoluble fatty acids or of xenobiotic compounds with a fatty acid-like structure that would become toxic to cells at high concentrations. Thus, their rate is regulated by the availability of substrate.

## III. Metabolism of Ketone Bodies

Overall, fatty acids released from adipose triacylglycerols serve as the major fuel for the body during fasting. These fatty acids are completely oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ by some tissues. In the liver, much of the acetyl-CoA generated from $\beta$ oxidation of fatty acids is used for synthesis of the ketone bodies acetoacetate and $\beta$ hydroxybutyrate, which enter the blood. In skeletal muscles and other tissues, these ketone bodies are converted back to acetyl-CoA, which is oxidized in the TCA cycle with generation of ATP. An alternate fate of acetoacetate in tissues is the formation of cytosolic acetyl-CoA.

## A. Synthesis of Ketone Bodies

In the liver, ketone bodies are synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix from acetylCoA generated from fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 30.17). The thiolase reaction of fatty acid oxidation, which converts acetoacetyl-CoA to two molecules of acetyl-CoA, is a reversible reaction, although formation of acetoacetyl-CoA is not the favored direction. Therefore, when acetyl-CoA levels are high, this reaction can generate acetoacetyl-CoA for ketone body synthesis. The acetoacetyl-CoA will react with acetyl-CoA to produce 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA). The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is HMG-CoA synthase. In the next reaction of the pathway, HMG-CoA lyase catalyzes the cleavage of HMG-CoA to form acetylCoA and acetoacetate.

Acetoacetate can enter the blood directly or it can be reduced by $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase to $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, which enters the blood (see Fig. 30.17). This dehydrogenase reaction is readily reversible and interconverts these two ketone bodies, which exist in an equilibrium ratio determined by the NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio of the mitochondrial matrix. Under normal conditions, the ratio of $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate in the blood is approximately 3:1.

An alternative fate of acetoacetate is spontaneous decarboxylation, a nonenzymatic reaction that cleaves acetoacetate into $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and acetone (see Fig. 30.17). Because acetone is volatile, it is expired by the lungs. A small amount of acetone may be further metabolized in the body.

## B. Oxidation of Ketone Bodies as Fuels

Acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate can be oxidized as fuels in most tissues, including skeletal muscle, brain, certain cells of the kidney, and cells of the intestinal mucosa. Cells transport both acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate from the circulating blood into the cytosol and into the mitochondrial matrix. Here, $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized back to acetoacetate by $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. This reaction produces NADH. Subsequent steps convert acetoacetate to acetyl-CoA (Fig. 30.18).

In mitochondria, acetoacetate is activated to acetoacetyl-CoA by succinylCoA:acetoacetate-CoA transferase. As the name suggests, CoA is transferred from succinyl-CoA, a TCA-cycle intermediate, to acetoacetate. Although the liver produces ketone bodies, it does not use them because this thiotransferase enzyme is not present in sufficient quantity.

One molecule of acetoacetyl-CoA is cleaved to two molecules of acetyl-CoA by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, the same enzyme that is involved in $\beta$-oxidation. The principal fate of this acetyl-CoA is oxidation in the TCA cycle.

(4)Ketogenic diets, which are high-fat diets with a 3:1 ratio of lipid to carbohydrate, are being used to reduce the frequency of epileptic seizures in children with refractory seizures. The reason for its effectiveness in the treatment of epilepsy is not known. Ketogenic diets are also used to treat children with PDH deficiency. Ketone bodies can be used as a fuel by the brain in the absence of PDH. They also can provide a source of cytosolic acetyl-CoA for acetylcholine synthesis. They often contain medium-chain triglycerides, which induce ketosis more effectively than long-chain triglycerides.

The portion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) shown in the tinted box is released as acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), and the remainder of the molecule forms acetoacetate.Acetoacetate is reduced to $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate or decarboxylated to acetone. Note that the dehydrogenase that interconverts acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate is specific for the D-isomer. Thus, it differs from the dehydrogenases of $\beta$-oxidation, which act on 3-hydroxy acyl-CoA derivatives and is specific for the L-isomer. CoA, coenzyme A; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

FIGURE 30.18 Oxidation of ketone bodies. $\beta$-Hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which is activated by accepting a coenzyme A (CoA) group from succinyl-CoA. Acetoacetyl-CoA is cleaved to two acetylCoA, which enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle and are oxidized. CoA, coenzyme A; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

The energy yield from oxidation of acetoacetate is equivalent to the yield for oxidation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle (20 ATP) minus the energy for activation of acetoacetate (1 ATP). The energy of activation is calculated at one high-energy phosphate bond because succinyl-CoA is normally converted to succinate in the TCA cycle, with generation of one molecule of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (the energy equivalent of ATP). However, when the high-energy thioester bond of succinyl-CoA is transferred to acetoacetate, succinate is produced without the generation of this GTP. Oxidation of $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate generates one additional NADH. Therefore, the net energy yield from 1 mol of $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate is approximately 21.5 mol of ATP.

## C. Alternative Pathways of Ketone Body Metabolism

Although fatty acid oxidation is usually the major source of ketone bodies, they also can be generated from the catabolism of certain amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, lysine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. These amino acids are called ketogenic amino acids because their carbon skeleton is catabolized to acetyl-CoA or acetoacetyl-CoA, which may enter the pathway of ketone body synthesis in liver. Leucine and isoleucine also form acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA in other tissues as well as the liver.

Acetoacetate can be activated to acetoacetyl-CoA in the cytosol by an enzyme similar to the acyl-CoA synthetases. This acetoacetyl-CoA can be used directly in cholesterol synthesis. It also can be cleaved to two molecules of acetyl-CoA by a cytosolic thiolase. Cytosolic acetyl-CoA is required for processes such as acetylcholine synthesis in neuronal cells.

## IV. The Role of Fatty Acids and Ketone Bodies in Fuel Homeostasis

Fatty acids are used as fuels whenever fatty acid levels are elevated in the blood (i.e., during fasting and starvation); because of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet; or during long-term low- to mild-intensity exercise. Under these conditions, a decrease in insulin and increased levels of glucagon, epinephrine, or other hormones stimulate adipose tissue lipolysis. Fatty acids begin to increase in the blood approximately 3 to 4 hours after a meal and progressively increase with time of fasting up to approximately 2 to 3 days (Fig. 30.19). In the liver, the rate of ketone body synthesis increases as the supply of fatty acids increases. However, the blood level of ketone bodies continues to increase, presumably because their use by skeletal muscles decreases.

After 2 to 3 days of starvation, ketone bodies rise to a level in the blood that enables them to enter brain cells, where they are oxidized, thereby reducing the amount of glucose required by the brain. During prolonged fasting, they may supply as much as two-thirds of the energy requirements of the brain. The reduction in glucose requirements spares skeletal muscle protein, which is a major source of amino acid precursors for hepatic glucose synthesis from gluconeogenesis.
![ma394074519f](ma394074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 30.19 Levels of ketone bodies in the blood at various times during fasting. Glucose levels remain relatively constant, as do levels of fatty acids. Ketone body levels, however, increase markedly, rising to levels at which they can be used by the brain and other nervous tissue. (From Cahill GF Jr,Aoki TT. How metabolism affects clinical problems. Med Times. 1970;98:106.)

Children are more prone to ketosis than adults because their bodies enter the fasting state more rapidly. Their bodies use more energy per unit mass (because their ratio of muscle to adipose tissue is higher), and liver glycogen stores are depleted faster (the ratio of their brain mass to liver mass is higher). In children, blood ketone body levels reach 2 mM in 24 hours; in adults, it takes $>3$ days to reach this level. Mild pediatric infections that cause anorexia and vomiting are the most common causes of ketosis in children. Mild ketosis is observed in children after prolonged exercise, perhaps attributable to an abrupt decrease in muscular use of fatty acids liberated during exercise. The liver then oxidizes these fatty acids and produces ketone bodies.

Why can't red blood cells use ketone bodies for energy?

## A. Preferential Use of Fatty Acids

As fatty acid levels increase in the blood, they are used by skeletal muscles and certain other tissues in preference to glucose. Fatty acid oxidation generates NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ through both $\beta$-oxidation and the TCA cycle, resulting in relatively high $\mathrm{NADH} / \mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratios, acetyl-CoA concentrations, and ATP/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or ATP/AMP levels. In skeletal muscles, AMPK (see Section I.E) adjusts the concentration of malonyl-CoA so that CPTI and $\beta$-oxidation operate at a rate that is able to sustain ATP homeostasis. With adequate levels of ATP obtained from fatty acid (or ketone body) oxidation, the rate of glycolysis is decreased. The activity of the regulatory enzymes in glycolysis and the TCA cycle (pyruvate dehydrogenase [PDH] and phosphofructokinase-1 [PFK-1]) are decreased by the changes in concentration of their allosteric regulators (concentrations of ADP, an activator of PDH, decrease; NADH and acetyl-CoA, inhibitors of PDH, increase under these conditions; and ATP and citrate, inhibitors of PFK-1, increase). As a consequence, glucose 6-phosphate (glucose 6-P) accumulates. Glucose 6-P inhibits hexokinase, thereby decreasing the uptake of glucose from the blood and its entry into glycolysis. In skeletal muscles, this pattern of fuel metabolism is facilitated by the decrease in insulin concentration (see Chapter 35). Preferential use of fatty acids does not, however, restrict the ability of glycolysis to respond to an increase in AMP or ADP levels, such as might occur during exercise or oxygen limitation.

## B. Tissues that Use Ketone Bodies

Skeletal muscles, the heart, the liver, and many other tissues use fatty acids as their major fuel during fasting and under other conditions that increase fatty acids in the blood. However, several other tissues (or cell types), such as the brain, use ketone bodies to a greater extent. For example, cells of the intestinal mucosa, which transport fatty acids from the intestine to the blood, use ketone bodies and amino acids, rather than fatty acids, during starvation. Adipocytes, which store fatty acids in triacylglycerols, do not use fatty acids as a fuel during fasting but can use ketone bodies. Ketone bodies cross the placenta and can be used by the fetus. Almost all tissues and cell types, with the exception of liver and red blood cells, are able to use ketone bodies as fuel.

## C. Regulation of Ketone Body Synthesis

Several events, in addition to the increased supply of fatty acids from adipose triacylglycerols, promote hepatic ketone body synthesis during fasting. The decreased insulin/glucagon ratio results in inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and decreased malonyl-CoA levels, which activates CPTI, thereby allowing fatty acyl-CoA to enter the pathway of $\beta$-oxidation (Fig. 30.20). When oxidation of fatty acyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA generates enough NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ to supply the ATP needs of the liver, acetyl-CoA is diverted from the TCA cycle into ketogenesis, and oxaloacetate in the TCA cycle is diverted toward malate and into glucose synthesis (gluconeogenesis). This pattern is regulated by the NADH/ $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio, which is relatively high during $\beta$-oxidation. As fasting continues, increased transcription of the gene for mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase facilitates high rates of ketone body production. Although the liver has been described as "altruistic" because it provides ketone bodies for other tissues, it is simply getting rid of fuel that it does not need.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

Otto S. As Otto S. runs, he increases the rate at which his muscles oxidize all fuels. The increased rate of ATP use stimulates the electron-transport chain, which oxidizes NADH and $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ much faster, thereby increasing the rate at which fatty acids are oxidized. During exercise, he also uses muscle glycogen stores, which contribute glucose to glycolysis. In some of the fibers, the

glucose is used anaerobically, thereby producing lactate. Some of the lactate will be used by his heart, and some will be taken up by the liver to be converted to glucose. As he trains, he increases his mitochondrial capacity, as well as his oxygen delivery, resulting in an increased ability to oxidize fatty acids and ketone bodies. As he runs, he increases fatty acid release from adipose tissue triacylglycerols. In the liver, fatty acids are being converted to ketone bodies, providing his muscles with another fuel. As a consequence, he experiences mild ketosis after his 12-mile run.

Lola B. MCAD deficiency, the cause of Lola B.'s problems, has emerged as one of the most common of the inborn errors of metabolism, with a carrier frequency ranging from 1 in 40 in northern European populations to $<1$ in 100 in Asian populations. Overall, the predicted disease frequency for MCAD deficiency is 1 in 15,000 people. More than 25 enzymes and specific transport proteins participate in mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism. At least 15 of these enzymes have been implicated in inherited diseases in humans.

MCAD deficiency is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by the substitution of a T for an A at position 985 of the $M C A D$ gene. This mutation causes a lysine to replace a glutamate residue in the protein, resulting in the production of an unstable dehydrogenase.

The most frequent manifestation of MCAD deficiency is intermittent hypoketotic hypoglycemia during fasting (low levels of ketone bodies and low levels of glucose in the blood). Fatty acids normally would be oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ under these conditions. In MCAD deficiency, however, fatty acids are oxidized only until they reach medium-chain length. As a result, the body must rely to a greater extent on oxidation of blood glucose to meet its energy needs.

Mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and catalyzes the final three steps of long-chain fatty acid oxidation (the hydratase step, the L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase step, and the $\beta$-ketothiolase step). Deficiencies in MTP are rare (I in 200,000 newborns), and the symptoms are quite diverse, depending on the nature of the mutation and the enzyme activity affected by the mutation. Overall, defects in MTP are often associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Because long-chain fatty acid oxidation is impaired, treatment of the disorder often uses dietary supplementation with medium-chain triacylglycerol, as no pharmacologic agents have yet to be developed to treat this disorder.

However, hepatic gluconeogenesis appears to be impaired in MCAD. Inhibition of gluconeogenesis may be caused by the lack of hepatic fatty acid oxidation to supply the energy required for gluconeogenesis, or by the accumulation of unoxidized fatty acid metabolites that inhibit gluconeogenic enzymes. As a consequence, liver glycogen stores are depleted more rapidly, and hypoglycemia results. The decrease in hepatic fatty acid oxidation results in less acetylCoA for ketone body synthesis, and consequently, a hypoketotic hypoglycemia develops.

Some of the symptoms once ascribed to hypoglycemia are now believed to be caused by the accumulation of toxic fatty acid intermediates, especially in patients with only mild reductions in blood glucose levels. Lola B.'s mild elevation in the blood of liver transaminases may reflect an infiltration of her liver cells with unoxidized medium-chain fatty acids.

The management of MCAD-deficient patients includes the intake of a relatively high-carbohydrate diet and the avoidance of prolonged fasting.

Dianne A. Dianne A., a 26-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus, was admitted to the hospital in diabetic ketoacidosis. In this complication of diabetes mellitus, an acute deficiency of insulin, coupled with a relative excess of glucagon, results in a rapid mobilization of fuel stores from muscle (amino acids) and adipose tissue (fatty acids). Some of the amino acids are converted to glucose, and fatty acids are converted to ketones (acetoacetate, $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone). The high glucagon:insulin ratio promotes the hepatic production of ketones. In response to the metabolic "stress," the levels of insulin-antagonistic hormones, such as catecholamines, glucocorticoids, and growth hormone, are increased in the blood. The insulin deficiency further reduces the peripheral use of glucose and ketones. As a result of this interrelated dysmetabolism, plasma glucose levels can reach $500 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(27.8 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ or more (normal fasting levels are 70 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, or 3.9 to $5.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ), and plasma ketones rise to levels of 8 to $15 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ or more (normal is in the range of 0.2 to $2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, depending on the fed state of the individual).

The increased glucose presented to the renal glomeruli induces an osmotic diuresis, which further depletes intravascular volume, further reducing the renal excretion of hydrogen ions and glucose. As a result, the metabolic acidosis worsens, and the hyperosmolarity of the blood increases, at times exceeding $330 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$ (normal is in the range of 285 to $295 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$ ). The severity of the hyperosmolar state correlates closely with the degree of central nervous system dysfunction and may end in coma and even death if left untreated.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Acetylation and Regulation of Fatty Acid Oxidation. Previously, in Chapter 16, acetylation of histones was described as a mechanism of regulating gene expression. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) would catalyze histone acetylation on lysine side chains, leading to histone dissociation from the DNA. This freed the DNA to bind factors important for transcription to occur. Recent work has indicated that acetylation of very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) regulates the activity of the enzyme, and offers more complexity to the regulation of fatty acid oxidation. Acetylation of VLCAD reduces enzymatic activity, whereas deacetylation will restore activity.

A family of proteins known as the sirtuins are $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$-dependent protein deacetylases. There are seven forms in humans, designated SIRT1 through SIRT7, all of which affect certain areas of metabolism. The sirtuins catalyze the reaction shown in Figure 30.21, in which $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$is split into nicotinamide and 2-O-acetyl ADP-ribose, and the protein target is deacetylated (the acetate group is transferred from the target to the $2^{\prime}$-hydroxy group of the ribose attached to the nicotinamide in $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$).

![ma414074519f](ma414074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 30.2I Generalized sirtuin reaction.

SIRT3 is localized to the mitochondrial matrix, and recent evidence indicates that it is a key regulator for fatty acid oxidation within the mitochondria. Using mice as a model system (which use LCAD, an enzyme present only at very low levels in human tissues), it was demonstrated that SIRT3 expression is upregulated during fasting in the liver. A primary target of SIRT3 deacetylation activity is LCAD, which is hyperacetylated on lysine-42. When hyperacetylated, LCAD activity is reduced. As LCAD will initiate fatty acid oxidation, regulating LCAD activity will regulate overall use of long-chain fatty acids by liver mitochondria. Fasting will upregulate the sirtuins, leading to activation of LCAD and increased fatty acid oxidation by the liver. Mice lacking SIRT3 activity were deficient in fatty acid oxidation during fasting conditions, accumulating long-chain intermediates and triglyceride in the liver. Human VLCAD (the predominant form in humans, as opposed to LCAD in mice) was also demonstrated to be acetylated, and SIRT3 would deacetylate the enzyme in a test tube.

The recent finding of acetylation as a regulatory tool for fatty acid oxidation provides another avenue for complex regulation between various aspects of metabolism, and it provides fertile ground for further research in this area.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Fatty acids are a major fuel for humans.
- During overnight fasting, fatty acids become the major fuel for cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and liver.
- The nervous system has a limited ability to use fatty acids directly as fuel. The liver converts fatty acids to ketone bodies, which can be used by the nervous system as a fuel during prolonged periods of fasting.
- Fatty acids are released from adipose tissue triacylglycerols under appropriate hormonal stimulation.
- In cells, fatty acids are activated to fatty acyl-CoA derivatives by acyl-CoA synthetases.
- Acyl-CoAs are transported into the mitochondria for oxidation via carnitine.
- ATP is generated from fatty acids by the pathway of $\beta$-oxidation.
- In $\beta$-oxidation, the fatty acyl group is sequentially oxidized to yield $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$, NADH, and acetyl-CoA. Although the reactions are similar, enzyme specificity is determined by the acyl chain length of the substrate.
- Unsaturated and odd-chain-length fatty acids require additional reactions for their metabolism.
- $\beta$-Oxidation is regulated by the levels of $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H}), \mathrm{NADH}$, and acetyl-CoA.
- The entry of fatty acids into mitochondria is regulated by malonyl-CoA levels.
- Alternative pathways for very-long-chain and branched-chain fatty acid oxidation occur within peroxisomes.
- If $\beta$-oxidation is impaired, other pathways of oxidation will be used, such as $\alpha$ - and $\omega$-oxidation.
- Table 30.2 summarizes the diseases discussed in this chapter.

7. A 6-month-old infant is brought to your office because of frequent crying episodes, lethargy, and poor eating. These symptoms were especially noticeable after the child had had an ear infection, at which time he did not eat well. The parents stated that this situation has happened before, but they found if they fed the child frequently, the lethargic episodes could be reduced in number. The results of blood work indicated that the child was hypoglycemic and hypoketotic. Six to eight carbon-chain dicarboxylic acids and acylcarnitine derivatives were found in the urine of the child as well. Based on your understanding of fatty acid metabolism, which enzyme would you expect to be defective in this child?
A. CPTI
B. CPTII
C. LCAD
D. MCAD
E. Carnitine:acylcarnitine translocase

B. Medium-chain
C. Long-chain
D. Very-long-chain
E. Odd-chain-length

A. Acetoacetate
B. $\beta$-Hydroxybutyrate
C. Acetone
D. Acetyl-CoA
E. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$
10. A newborn child has been determined to be unable to oxidize phytanic acid and is placed on a diet containing very low levels of this unusual fatty acid. The organelle most likely to contain the defective enzyme, or be altered in this disorder, is which one of the following?
A. Endoplasmic reticulum
B. Golgi apparatus
C. Lysosome
D. Mitochondria
E. Peroxisome

1. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. The ETF:QO is required to transfer the electrons from the $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to CoQ . When the oxidoreductase is missing, the electrons cannot be transferred, and the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase cannot continue to oxidize fatty acids because it contains a reduced cofactor instead of an oxidized cofactor. During times of fasting, when fatty acids are the primary energy source, no energy will be forthcoming, gluconeogenesis is shut down, and death may result. The lack of this enzyme does not affect the other pathways listed as potential answers.
2. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. An 18-carbon saturated fatty acid would require eight spirals of fatty acid oxidation, which yields $8 \mathrm{NADH}, 8 \mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$, and 9 acetyl-CoA. As each NADH gives rise to 2.5 ATP, and each $\mathrm{FAD}(2 \mathrm{H})$ gives rise to 1.5 ATP, the reduced cofactors will give rise to 32 ATP. Each acetyl-CoA gives rise to 10 ATP, for a total of 90 ATP. This then yields 122 ATP, but we must subtract 2 ATP for the activation step, at which two high-energy bonds are expended. Thus, the net yield is 120 ATPs for each molecule of fatty acid oxidized.
3. The answer is A. Fatty acid oxidation is initiated by the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (an oxidation step), followed by hydration of the double bond formed in the first step, followed by the hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase step (another oxidation), and then attack of the $\beta$-carbonyl by CoA, breaking a carbon-carbon bond (the thiolase step).
4. The answer is A. People with type 1 diabetes exhibit high blood glucose levels caused by the lack of insulin and the inability of peripheral tissues to effectively transport glucose from the blood into the tissue. Individuals on diets would have low blood glucose levels because the majority of energy is being derived from fat and ketone body production. The level of free fatty acids in the blood would be elevated under both conditions owing to the high glucagon-to-insulin ratio. Lactate levels are low under both conditions because glycolysis does not need to act rapidly to provide energy. Six- and eight-carbon dicarboxylic acids in the serum are indicative of a problem in oxidizing fatty acids (MCAD deficiency), which does not apply under these conditions. Carnitine levels in the blood would be expected to be low in both individuals because the tissues require the carnitine for fatty acid oxidation, which is a primary energy source for each type of individual.
5. The answer is E. Fatty acids are the major fuel for the body during prolonged exercise and fasting. Answers $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and C are incorrect because glucose would be the major fuel after eating. Answer D is incorrect because, at the start of exercise, muscle glycogen and gluconeogenesis are being used as the major source of fuel.
6. The answer is A. A defect in CPTII activity would lead to fatty acids being added to carnitine (via CPTI) but not being able to have the carnitine removed. This would lead to a buildup of acylcarnitine levels in the blood. This would also lead to an inability to oxidize fatty acids or synthesize ketone bodies. Because of the lack of energy for gluconeogenesis (owing to reduced fatty acid oxidation), blood glucose levels would be low. The buildup of acylcarnitine in muscle will damage the muscle and release creatine phosphokinase into circulation, leading to increased levels of creatine phosphokinase. The lack of carnitine to accept fatty acids would lead to an accumulation of free fatty acids in the blood.
7. The answer is D. The lack of energy from fatty acid oxidation resulted in an inability to synthesize sufficient glucose for the circulation, resulting in the lethargy. Eating frequently maintained blood glucose levels such that the brain could function, and the symptoms were alleviated. As medium-chain fatty acids could not be metabolized further by $\beta$-oxidation, $\omega$-oxidation is used and dicarboxylic acids accumulate. Because short-chain dicarboxylic fatty acids are found in the urine, some fatty acid metabolism is occurring, but it cannot go to completion. Even if CPTI, CPTII, or carnitine:acylcarnitine translocase were partially defective, once a fatty acid was transported into the mitochondria, it would be able to be oxidized to completion, and the short-chain dicarboxylic acids would not be observed. Because the observed dicarboxylic acids are short-chain, LCAD activity is normal.
8. The answer is E. Fatty acids that contain an odd number of carbons produce propionyl-CoA, a three-carbon fatty acyl-CoA in the final spiral of $\beta$-oxidation. This is ultimately converted to succinyl-CoA in a vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-dependent reaction. Propionyl-CoA also arises from the oxidation of branched-chain amino acids. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is not needed for the complete oxidation of fatty acids with an even number of carbons (saturated or unsaturated).
9. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate are the ketone bodies produced by the liver. Acetoacetate can be converted to acetone and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Because acetone is volatile, it is expired by the lungs. In ketoacidosis, increased production of acetone gives the classic odor to the breath.
10. The answer is E. The child most likely has a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder such that functional peroxisomes are not produced. The first step of phytanic acid oxidation occurs in the peroxisomes, and lacking either the peroxisomes or phytanic acid oxidase activity can lead to an accumulation of phytanic acid in the blood.

# Synthesis of Fatty Acids, Triacylglycerols, and the Major Membrane Lipids 

Fatty acids are synthesized mainly in the liver in humans, with dietary glucose serving as the major source of carbon. Glucose is converted through glycolysis to pyruvate, which enters the mitochondrion and forms both acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and oxaloacetate (OAA) (Fig. 31.1). These two compounds condense, forming citrate. Citrate is transported to the cytosol, where it is cleaved to form acetyl-CoA, the source of carbon for the reactions that occur on the fatty acid synthase complex. The key regulatory enzyme for the process, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, produces malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) from acetyl-CoA.

The growing fatty acid chain, attached to the fatty acid synthase complex in the cytosol, is elongated by the sequential addition of two-carbon units provided by malonyl-CoA. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH), produced by the pentose phosphate pathway and malic enzyme, provides reducing equivalents. When the growing fatty acid chain is 16 carbons in length, it is released as palmitate. After activation to a coenzyme A (CoA) derivative, palmitate can be elongated and desaturated to produce a series of fatty acids.

FIGURE 31.1 Lipogenesis, the synthesis of triacylglycerols (TG) from glucose. In humans, the synthesis of fatty acids from glucose occurs mainly in the liver. Fatty acids (FA) are converted to TG, packaged in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and secreted into the blood. CoA, coenzyme A; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; FACoA, fatty acyl coenzyme A; Glycerol 3-P, glycerol 3-phosphate; NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; OAA, oxaloacetate.

Eicosanoids are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids containing 20 carbon atoms, which are found in cell membranes esterified to membrane phospholipids. Arachidonic acid, derived from the diet or synthesized from linoleate, is the compound from which most eicosanoids are produced in the body. Compounds that serve as signals for eicosanoid production bind to cell membrane receptors and activate phospholipases that cleave the polyunsaturated fatty acids from cell membrane phospholipids.

Fatty acids, produced in cells or obtained from the diet, are used by various tissues for the synthesis of triacylglycerols (the major storage form of fuel) and the glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids (the major components of cell membranes).

In the liver, triacylglycerols are produced from fatty acyl coenzyme A (fatty acylCoA) and glycerol 3-phosphate (glycerol 3-P). Phosphatidic acid serves as an intermediate in this pathway. The triacylglycerols are not stored in the liver but rather packaged with apolipoproteins and other lipids in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and secreted into the blood (see Fig. 31.1).

In the capillaries of various tissues (particularly adipose tissue, muscle, and the lactating mammary gland), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) digests the triacylglycerols of VLDL, forming fatty acids and glycerol (Fig. 31.2). The glycerol travels to the liver, where it is used. Some of the fatty acids are oxidized by muscle and other tissues. After a meal, however, most of the fatty acids are converted to triacylglycerols in adipose cells, where they are stored. These fatty acids are released during fasting and serve as the predominant fuel for the body.

Glycerophospholipids are also synthesized from fatty acyl-CoA, which forms esters with glycerol 3-P, producing phosphatidic acid.Various head groups are added to carbon 3 of the glycerol 3-P moiety of phosphatidic acid, generating amphipathic compounds such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and cardiolipin (Fig. 31.3A). In the formation of plasmalogens and platelet-activating factor (PAF), a long-chain fatty alcohol forms an ether with carbon I, replacing the fatty acyl ester (see Fig. 31.3B). Cleavage of phospholipids is catalyzed by phospholipases found in cell membranes, lysosomes, and pancreatic juice.

Sphingolipids, which are prevalent in membranes and the myelin sheath of the central nervous system, are built on serine rather than glycerol. In the synthesis of

FIGURE 31.2 Fate of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triacylglycerol (TG). The TG of VLDL, produced in the liver, is digested by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) present on the endothelial cells lining the capillaries in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue. Fatty acids are released and either oxidized in the muscle or stored in adipose tissue as TG. Glycerol is used by the liver because hepatocytes contain glycerol kinase. CoA, coenzyme A; FA, fatty acid (or fatty acyl group); FACoA, fatty acyl coenzyme A.

FIGURE 31.3 A. General structure of a glycerophospholipid. The fatty acids are joined by ester bonds to the glycerol moiety. Various combinations of fatty acids may be present. The fatty acid at carbon 2 of the glycerol is usually unsaturated. The head group is the group attached to the phosphate on position 3 of the glycerol moiety. The most common head group is choline, but ethanolamine, serine, inositol, or phosphatidylglycerol also may be present. The phosphate group is negatively charged, and the head group may carry a positive charge (choline and ethanolamine) or both a positive and a negative charge (serine). The inositol may be phosphorylated and thus negatively charged. B. General structure of a plasmalogen. Carbon I of glycerol is joined to a longchain fatty alcohol by an ether linkage. The fatty alcohol group has a double bond between carbons I and 2. The head group is usually ethanolamine or choline. C. General structures of the sphingolipids. The "backbone" is sphingosine rather than glycerol. Ceramide is sphingosine with a fatty acid joined to its amino group by an amide linkage. Sphingomyelin contains phosphocholine, whereas glycolipids (D) contain carbohydrate groups.
![ma444074519f](ma444074519f.jpg)
sphingolipids, serine and palmitoyl-CoA condense, forming a compound that is related to sphingosine. Reduction of this compound, followed by addition of a second fatty acid in amide linkage, produces ceramide. Carbohydrate groups attach to ceramide, forming glycolipids such as the cerebrosides, globosides, and gangliosides (see Fig. 31.3D). The addition of phosphocholine to ceramide produces sphingomyelin (see Fig. 31.3C). These sphingolipids are degraded by lysosomal enzymes.

# THE WAITING ROOM 

![ma454074519f](ma454074519f.jpg)

4Emma W. has done well with regard to her respiratory function since her earlier hospitalization for an acute asthma exacerbation (see Chapter 28). She has been maintained on two puffs of triamcinolone acetonide, a potent inhaled corticosteroid, two times per day, and has not required systemic steroids for months. The glucose intolerance precipitated by high intravenous and oral doses of the synthetic glucocorticoid prednisone during her earlier hospitalization resolved after this drug was discontinued. She has come to her doctor now because she is

The dietitian did a careful analysis of Percy V's diet, which was indeed low in fat, adequate in protein, but excessive in carbohydrates, especially refined sugars. Percy's total caloric intake averaged about 430 kilocalories (kcal) per day in excess of his isocaloric requirements. This excess carbohydrate was being converted to fats, accounting for Percy's weight gain. A new diet with a total caloric content that would prevent further gain in weight was prescribed.

$M$Cholesterol determinations in serum use a sequence of enzyme-coupled reactions. Cholesteryl esterase is used to release the fatty acids esterified to circulating cholesterol, producing free cholesterol. The second enzyme in the sequence, cholesterol oxidase, oxidizes cholesterol and reduces oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide. Horseradish peroxidase is then used to catalyze the conversion of a colorless dye to a colored dye, via an oxidation-reduction reaction using the electrons from hydrogen peroxide. The intensity of the color obtained is directly proportional to the level of cholesterol in the sample.
concerned that the low-grade fever and cough she has developed over the last 36 hours may trigger another asthma exacerbation.

Percy V.'s mental depression slowly responded to antidepressant medication, to the therapy sessions with his psychiatrist, and to frequent visits from an old high school sweetheart whose husband had died several years earlier. While he was hospitalized for malnutrition, Mr. V.'s appetite returned. By the time of discharge, he had gained back 8 of the 22 lb he had lost and weighed 131 lb .

During the next few months, Mr. V. developed a craving for "sweet foods" such as the candy he bought and shared with his new friend. After 6 months of this highcarbohydrate courtship, Percy had gained another 22 lb and now weighed 153 lb , 8 lb more than he weighed when his depression began. He became concerned about the possibility that he would soon be overweight and consulted his dietitian, explaining that he had faithfully followed his low-fat diet but had "gone overboard" with carbohydrates. He asked whether it was possible to become fat without eating fat.

$\square$Cora N.'s hypertension and heart failure have been well controlled on medication, and she has lost 10 lb since she had her recent heart attack. Her fasting serum lipid profile before discharge from the hospital indicated a significantly elevated serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of $175 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, a serum triacylglycerol level of $280 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range, 60 to $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), and a serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level of $34 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range, $>50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ for healthy women). While she was still in the hospital, she was asked to obtain the most recent serum lipid profiles of her older brother and her younger sister, both of whom were experiencing chest pain. Her brother's profile showed normal triacylglycerols, moderately elevated LDL cholesterol, and significantly suppressed HDL cholesterol levels. Her sister's profile showed only hypertriglyceridemia (high blood triacylglycerols).

$\square$Christy L. was born 9 weeks prematurely. She appeared normal until about 30 minutes after delivery, when her respirations became rapid at 64 breaths per minute with audible respiratory grunting. The spaces between her ribs (intercostal spaces) retracted inward with each inspiration, and her lips and fingers became cyanotic from a lack of oxygen in her arterial blood. An arterial blood sample indicated a low partial pressure of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}\right)$ and a slightly elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{PCO}_{2}\right)$. The arterial pH was somewhat suppressed, in part from an accumulation of lactic acid secondary to the hypoxemia (a low level of oxygen in her blood). A chest radiograph showed a fine reticular granularity of the lung tissue, especially in the left lower lobe area. From these clinical data, a diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), also known as hyaline membrane disease, was made.

Christy was immediately transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit, where, with intensive respiration therapy, she slowly improved.

## I. Fatty Acid Synthesis

Fatty acids are synthesized whenever an excess of calories is ingested. The major source of carbon for the synthesis of fatty acids is dietary carbohydrate. An excess of dietary protein also can result in an increase in fatty acid synthesis. In this case, the carbon source is amino acids that can be converted to acetylCoA or tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (see Chapter 37). Fatty acid synthesis occurs primarily in the liver in humans, although it can also occur, to a lesser extent, in adipose tissue.

When an excess of dietary carbohydrate is consumed, glucose is converted to acetyl-CoA, which provides the two-carbon units that condense in a series of reactions on the fatty acid synthase complex, producing palmitate (see Fig. 31.1). Palmitate is then converted to other fatty acids. The fatty acid synthase complex is located in the cytosol and, therefore, it uses cytosolic acetyl-CoA.

## A. Conversion of Glucose to Cytosolic Acetyl Coenzyme A

The pathway for the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-CoA from glucose begins with glycolysis, which converts glucose to pyruvate in the cytosol (Fig. 31.4). Pyruvate enters mitochondria, where it is converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and to OAA by pyruvate carboxylase. The pathway pyruvate follows is dictated by the acetyl-CoA levels in the mitochondria. When acetyl-CoA levels are high, PDH is inhibited and pyruvate carboxylase activity is stimulated. As OAA levels increase because of the activity of pyruvate carboxylase, OAA condenses with acetyl-CoA to form citrate. This condensation reduces the acetyl-CoA levels, which leads to the activation of PDH and inhibition of pyruvate carboxylase. Through such reciprocal regulation, citrate can be continuously synthesized and transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane. In the cytosol, citrate is cleaved by citrate lyase to re-form acetyl-CoA and OAA. This circuitous route is required because PDH, the enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, is found only in mitochondria and because acetyl-CoA cannot directly cross the mitochondrial membrane.

Reduced nicotinic adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is required for fatty acid synthesis and is generated by the pentose phosphate pathway (see Chapter 27) and from recycling of the OAA produced by citrate lyase (see Fig. 31.4). OAA is converted back to pyruvate in two steps: the reduction of OAA to malate by the $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$-dependent malate dehydrogenase and the oxidation and decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate by an $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$-dependent malate dehydrogenase (malic enzyme) (Fig. 31.5). The pyruvate formed by malic enzyme is reconverted to citrate. The NADPH that is generated by malic enzyme, along with the NADPH generated by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and gluconate 6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the pentose phosphate pathway, is used for the reduction reactions that occur on the fatty acid synthase complex.

The generation of cytosolic acetyl-CoA from pyruvate is stimulated by elevation of the insulin/glucagon ratio after a carbohydrate meal. Insulin activates PDH by stimulating the phosphatase that dephosphorylates the enzyme to an active form (see Chapter 23). The synthesis of malic enzyme, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and citrate lyase is induced by the high insulin/glucagon ratio. The ability of citrate to accumulate, and to leave the mitochondrial matrix for the synthesis of fatty acids, is attributable to the allosteric inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase by high energy levels within the matrix under these conditions. The concerted regulation of glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis is described in Chapter 34.

FIGURE 31.5 Reaction catalyzed by malic enzyme. This enzyme is also called the decarboxylating or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)-dependent malate dehydrogenase.

Why might certain enzymes use AMP as an allosteric regulator signifying low energy levels as opposed to ADP?

## B. Conversion of Acetyl Coenzyme A to Malonyl Coenzyme A

Cytosolic acetyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA, which serves as the immediate donor of the two-carbon units that are added to the growing fatty acid chain on the fatty acid synthase complex. To synthesize malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA carboxylase adds a carboxyl group to acetyl-CoA in a reaction that requires biotin and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (Fig. 31.6).

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis. Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation, allosteric modification, and induction/ repression of its synthesis (Fig. 31.7). Citrate allosterically activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase by causing the individual enzyme molecules (each composed of four subunits) to polymerize. Palmitoyl coenzyme A (palmitoyl-CoA), produced from palmitate (the end product of fatty acid synthase activity), inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Phosphorylation by the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase inhibits the enzyme in the fasting state when energy levels are low. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated by dephosphorylation in the fed state when energy and insulin levels are high. A high insulin/glucagon ratio also results in induction of the synthesis of both acetyl-CoA carboxylase and the next enzyme in the pathway, fatty acid synthase.

## C. Fatty Acid Synthase Complex

As an overview, fatty acid synthase sequentially adds two-carbon units from malonyl-CoA to the growing fatty acyl chain to form palmitate. After the addition of each two-carbon unit, the growing chain undergoes two reduction reactions that require NADPH.
![ma484074519f](ma484074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 31.6 Reaction catalyzed by ace-
FIGURE 31.7 Regulation of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) carboxylase. This enzyme is regulated allosterically, both positively and negatively, by phosphorylation ( $\Omega$ ) and dephosphorylation, and by diet-induced induction ( $\Theta$ ). It is active in the dephosphorylated state when citrate causes it to polymerize. Dephosphorylation is catalyzed by an insulinstimulated phosphatase. Low energy levels, via activation of the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase, cause the enzyme to be phosphorylated and inactivated. The ultimate product of fatty acid synthesis, palmitate, is converted to its coenzyme A (CoA) derivative, palmitoyl coenzyme A (palmitoyl-CoA), which inhibits the enzyme. A highcalorie diet increases the rate of transcription of the gene for acetyl-CoA carboxylase, whereas a low-calorie diet reduces transcription of this gene. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $P_{0}$ inorganic phosphate.

The highly active adenylate kinase reaction, 2 ADP $\leftrightarrow$ AMP + ATP allows AMP to be a more sensitive indicator of low energy levels than ADP. Thus, as ADP levels increase, so do AMP levels. The ratio of [AMP]/[ATP] is proportional to the square of the [ADP]/[ATP] ratio. Thus, if the ratio of [ADP]/[ATP] increases 5 -fold, the [AMP]/[ATP] may increase 25 -fold. The alterations in the concentration of AMP, therefore, are a more sensitive indicator of low energy levels in the cell than alterations in the concentration of ADP.

Fatty acid synthase is a large enzyme composed of two identical subunits, which each have seven catalytic activities and an acyl carrier protein ( $A C P$ ) segment in a continuous polypeptide chain. The $A C P$ segment contains a phosphopantetheine residue that is derived from the cleavage of coenzyme A. The key feature of the $A C P$ is that it contains a free sulfhydryl group (from the phosphopantetheine residue). The two dimers associate in a head-to-tail arrangement, so that the phosphopantetheinyl sulfhydryl group on one subunit and a cysteinyl sulfhydryl group on another subunit are closely aligned.

In the initial step of fatty acid synthesis, an acetyl moiety is transferred from acetyl-CoA to the $A C P$ phosphopantetheinyl sulfhydryl group of one subunit and then to the cysteinyl sulfhydryl group of the other subunit. The malonyl moiety from malonyl-CoA then attaches to the $A C P$ phosphopantetheinyl sulfhydryl group of the first subunit. The acetyl and malonyl moieties condense, with the release of the malonyl carboxyl group as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. A four-carbon $\beta$-keto acyl chain is now attached to the $A C P$ phosphopantetheinyl sulfhydryl group (Fig. 31.8).

A series of three reactions reduces the four-carbon keto group to an alcohol, then removes water to form a double bond, and lastly reduces the double bond (Fig. 31.9). NADPH provides the reducing equivalents for these reactions. The net result is that the original acetyl group is elongated by two carbons.

The four-carbon fatty acyl chain is then transferred to the cysteinyl sulfhydryl group and subsequently condenses with a malonyl group. This sequence of reactions is repeated until the chain is 16 carbons in length. At this point, hydrolysis occurs, and palmitate is released (Fig. 31.10).

Palmitate is elongated and desaturated to produce a series of fatty acids. In the liver, palmitate and other newly synthesized fatty acids are converted to triacylglycerols that are packaged into VLDL for secretion.

In the liver, the oxidation of newly synthesized fatty acids back to acetyl-CoA via the mitochondrial $\beta$-oxidation pathway is prevented by malonyl-CoA. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, the enzyme involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria (see Chapter 30), is inhibited by malonyl-CoA (Fig. 31.11). Malonyl-CoA levels are elevated when acetyl-CoA carboxylase is activated, and thus, fatty acid oxidation is inhibited while fatty acid synthesis is proceeding. This inhibition prevents the occurrence of a futile cycle.

## D. Elongation of Fatty Acids

After synthesis on the fatty acid synthase complex, palmitate is activated, forming palmitoyl-CoA. Palmitoyl-CoA and other activated long-chain fatty acids can be elongated, two carbons at a time, by a series of reactions that occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 31.12). Malonyl-CoA serves as the donor of the two-carbon units, and NADPH provides the reducing equivalents. The series of elongation reactions resembles those of fatty acid synthesis except that the fatty acyl chain is attached to coenzyme A rather than to the phosphopantetheinyl residue of an $A C P$. The major elongation reaction that occurs in the body involves the conversion of palmityl-CoA (C16) to stearyl-CoA (C18). Very-long-chain fatty acids (C22 to C24) are also produced, particularly in the brain.

## E. Desaturation of Fatty Acids

Desaturation of fatty acids involves a process that requires molecular oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right), \mathrm{NADH}$, and cytochrome $\mathrm{b}_{5}$. The reaction, which occurs in the endoplasmic

The acetyl group, which is attached to a cysteinyl sulfhydryl group, condenses with the malonyl group. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is released, and a 3-ketoacyl group is formed.

FIGURE 31.9 Reduction of a $\beta$-ketoacyl group on the fatty acid synthase complex. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is the reducing agent.
reticulum, results in the oxidation of both the fatty acid and NADH (Fig. 31.13). The most common desaturation reactions involve the placement of a double bond between carbons 9 and 10 in the conversion of palmitic acid to palmitoleic acid $\left(16: 1, \Delta^{9}\right)$ and the conversion of stearic acid to oleic acid $\left(18: 1, \Delta^{9}\right)$. Other positions that can be desaturated in humans include carbons 5 and 6 .

Polyunsaturated fatty acids with double bonds three carbons from the methyl end ( $\omega 3$ fatty acids) and six carbons from the methyl end ( $\omega 6$ fatty acids) are required for the synthesis of eicosanoids (see Section II of this chapter). Because humans cannot synthesize these fatty acids de novo (i.e., from glucose via palmitate), they must be present in the diet or the diet must contain other fatty acids that can be converted to these fatty acids. We obtain $\omega 6$ and $\omega 3$ polyunsaturated fatty acids mainly from dietary plant oils that contain the $\omega 6$ fatty acid linoleic acid $\left(18: 2, \Delta^{9,12}\right)$ and the $\omega 3$ fatty acid $\alpha$-linolenic acid $\left(18: 3, \Delta^{9,12,15}\right)$. Linoleic and linolenic acids are thus considered essential fatty acids for the human diet. In the body, linoleic acid can be converted by elongation and desaturation reactions to arachidonic acid $\left(20: 4, \Delta^{5,8,11,14}\right)$, which is used for the synthesis of the major class of human prostaglandins and other eicosanoids (Fig. 31.14). Elongation and desaturation of $\alpha$-linolenic acid produces eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5, $\Delta^{5,8,11,14,17}$ ), which is the precursor of a different class of eicosanoids (see Section II).

Plants are able to introduce double bonds into fatty acids in the region between C10 and the $\omega$-end and, therefore, can synthesize $\omega 3$ and $\omega 6$ polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fish oils also contain $\omega 3$ and $\omega 6$ fatty acids, particularly EPA ( $\omega 3,20: 5$, $\Delta^{5,8,11,14,17}$ ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( $\omega 3,22: 6, \Delta^{4,7,10,13,16,19}$ ). The fish obtain these fatty acids by eating phytoplankton (plants that float in water).

Arachidonic acid is listed in some textbooks as an essential fatty acid. Although it is an $\omega 6$ fatty acid, it is not essential in the diet if linoleic acid is present because arachidonic acid can be synthesized from dietary linoleic acid (see Fig. 31.14).

The essential fatty acid linoleic acid is required in the diet for at least three reasons: (1) It serves as a precursor of arachidonic acid from which eicosanoids are produced. (2) It covalently binds another fatty acid attached to cerebrosides in the skin, forming an unusual lipid (acylglucosylceramide) that helps to make the skin impermeable to water. This function of linoleic acid may help to explain the red, scaly dermatitis and other skin problems associated with a dietary deficiency of essential fatty acids. (3) It is the precursor of important neuronal fatty acids.

## II. Synthesis of the Eicosanoids

Eicosanoids (eicosa is the Greek word for the number 20) are biologically active lipids derived from 20-carbon fatty acids. They consist primarily of the prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes. These lipids are the most potent regulators of cellular function in nature and are produced by almost every cell in the body. They act mainly as "local" hormones, affecting the cells that produce them or neighboring cells of a different type.

Eicosanoids participate in many processes in the body, particularly the inflammatory response that occurs after infection or injury. The inflammatory response is the sum of the body's efforts to destroy invading organisms and to repair damage. It includes control of bleeding through the formation of blood clots. In the process of protecting the body from a variety of insults, the inflammatory response can produce symptoms such as pain, swelling, and fever. An exaggerated or inappropriate expression of the normal inflammatory response may occur in individuals who have allergic or hypersensitivity reactions.

In addition to participating in the inflammatory response, eicosanoids also regulate smooth muscle contraction (particularly in the intestine and uterus). They increase water and sodium excretion by the kidney and are involved in regulating blood pressure. They frequently serve as modulators; some eicosanoids stimulate and others inhibit the same process. For example, some serve as constrictors and others as dilators of blood vessels. They are also involved in regulating bronchoconstriction and bronchodilation.

## A. Source of the Eicosanoids

The most abundant, and therefore the most common, precursor of the eicosanoids is arachidonic acid (C20:4, $\Delta^{5,8,11,14}$ ), a polyunsaturated fatty acid with 20 carbons and four double bonds. Because arachidonic acid cannot be synthesized in the body (it is an $\omega 6$ fatty acid), the diet must contain arachidonic acid or other fatty acids from which arachidonic acid can be produced (such as linoleic acid, found in plant oils). An overview of eicosanoid biosynthesis is shown in Fig. 31.15.

The arachidonic acid present in membrane phospholipids is released from the lipid bilayer as a consequence of the activation of membrane-bound phospholipase A2 or C (see Fig. 31.15). This activation occurs when a variety of stimuli (agonists), such as histamine or the cytokines interact with a specific plasma membrane receptor on the target cell surface. Phospholipase A2 is specific for the sn-2 position of phosphoacylglycerols, the site of attachment of arachidonic acid to the glycerol moiety. Phospholipase C, conversely, hydrolyzes phosphorylated inositol from the inositol glycerophospholipids, generating a diacylglycerol (DAG) containing arachidonic acid. This arachidonic acid is subsequently released by the action of other lipases.

## B. Pathways for Eicosanoid Synthesis

After arachidonic acid is released into the cytosol, it is converted to eicosanoids by a variety of enzymes with activities that vary among tissues. This variation explains why some cells, such as those in the vascular endothelium, synthesize prostaglandins $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{I}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PGE}_{2}\right.$ and $\left.\mathrm{PGI}_{2}\right)$, whereas cells such as platelets synthesize primarily thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}\left(\mathrm{TXA}_{2}\right)$ and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE).

Three major pathways for the metabolism of arachidonic acid occur in various tissues (Fig. 31.16). The first of these, the cyclooxygenase pathway, leads to the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The second, the lipoxygenase pathway, yields the leukotrienes, HETEs, and lipoxins. The third pathway, catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 system, is responsible for the synthesis of the epoxides, HETEs, and diHETEs. Only the cyclooxygenase pathway will be discussed further in this text. Information about the other pathways can be found in the online supplement to the text.

## C. Cyclooxygenase Pathway: Synthesis of the Prostaglandins and Thromboxanes

## I. Structures of the Prostaglandins

Prostaglandins are fatty acids containing 20 carbon atoms, including an internal 5 -carbon ring. In addition to this ring, each of the biologically active prostaglandins has a hydroxyl group at carbon 15, a double bond between carbons 13 and 14, and various substituents on the ring.

The nomenclature for the prostaglandins (PGs) involves the assignment of a capital letter (PGE), an Arabic numeral subscript ( $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}$ ), and, for the PGF family, a Greek letter subscript (e.g., $\mathrm{PGF}_{2 \alpha}$ ). The capital letter, in this case " F ," refers to the ring substituents shown in Figure 31.17.

The subscript that follows the capital letter $\left(\mathrm{PGF}_{1}\right)$ refers to the PG series 1,2 , or 3 determined by the number of unsaturated bonds present in the linear portion of the hydrocarbon chain. It does not include double bonds in the internal ring. Prostaglandins of the 1 -series have one double bond (between carbons 13 and 14). The 2 -series has two double bonds (between carbons 13 and 14, and 5 and 6), and the 3 -series has three double bonds (between carbons 13 and 14, 5 and 6, and 17 and 18). The double bonds between carbons 13 and 14 are trans; the others are cis. The precursor for the 1 -series of prostaglandins is cis $\Delta^{8,11,14}$ eicosatrienoic acid; for the 2 -series, it is arachidonic acid; for the 3 -series, it is cis $\Delta^{5,8,11,14,17}$ EPA.

The Greek letter subscript, found only in the F series, refers to the position of the hydroxyl group at carbon 9 . This hydroxyl group primarily exists in the $\alpha$-position, where it lies below the plane of the ring, as does the hydroxyl group at carbon 11.

FIGURE 31.13 Desaturation of fatty acids. The process occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and uses molecular oxygen. Both the fatty acid and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are oxidized. Human desaturases cannot introduce double bonds between carbon 9 and the methyl end, and are limited to positions 5,6 , and 9. Therefore, $m$ is $\leq 7$. CoA, coenzyme A; Cyt, cytochrome; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; Fatty acyl CoA, fatty acyl coenzyme A.

# 2. Structure of the Thromboxanes 

The thromboxanes, derived from arachidonic acid via the cyclooxygenase pathway, closely resemble the prostaglandins in structure except that they contain a six-membered ring that includes an oxygen atom (see Fig. 31.15). The most common thromboxane, $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$, contains an additional oxygen atom attached both to carbon 9 and carbon 11 of the ring. The thromboxanes were named for their action in producing blood clots (thrombi).

FIGURE 31.14 Conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid. Dietary linoleic acid (as linoleoyl coenzyme A [linoleoyl CoA]) is desaturated at carbon 6, elongated by two carbons, and then desaturated at carbon 5 to produce arachidonyl coenzyme A (arachidonyl CoA). CoA, coenzyme A; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

The measurement of prostaglandin levels, in plasma or urine, is best done by radioimmunoassay (see Chapter 41, "Biochemical Comments"). Antibodies specific for each prostaglandin, or thromboxane form, are commercially available, and through competition with a standard amount of antigen, one can determine the concentration of the metabolite in the biologic fluid. Recently a more sensitive technique has been developed, which can assay prostaglandin levels as low as $40 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$. This technique is called fluorescent polarization immunoassay (FPIA). The method is based on the properties of small fluorescent molecules. Molecules that fluoresce absorb light at a particular wavelength and will emit light of a lower wavelength (the fluorescence). If one excites a small fluorophore with polarized light, the fluorescence will be polarized if the molecule rotates slowly; if the molecule rotates rapidly, the emitted light will not be polarized. If, then, the fluorophore is bound to a much larger molecule, such as an antibody its rotation would be greatly diminished, and the fluorescent signal emitted will be highly polarized. One can, therefore, measure the polarization of the emitted light as a function of how much fluorescent standard is bound to the antibody. So for these assays, a known amount of a fluorescent prostaglandin is incubated with the samples; if the sample contains nonfluorescent prostaglandin, it will compete for binding with the fluorescent prostaglandin, relegating some fluorescent prostaglandin to being nonbound. When the excitation light hits the sample, the amount of polarization will decrease in proportion to the amount of fluorescent prostaglandin displaced from the antibody. Through use of a standard curve, one can then calculate the level of prostaglandin in the sample to very low levels.

FIGURE 31.17 Ring substituents of the prostaglandins (PG). The letter after PG denotes the configuration of the ring and its substituents. $R_{4}, R_{7}$, and $R_{8}$ represent the nonring portions of the molecule. $R_{4}$ contains four carbons (including the carboxyl group). $R_{7}$ and $R_{8}$ contain seven and eight carbons, respectively. Note that the prostacyclins (PGI) contain two rings.

## 3. Biosynthesis of the Prostaglandins and Thromboxanes

Only the biosynthesis of those prostaglandins derived from arachidonic acid (e.g., the 2 -series, such as $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}, \mathrm{PGI}_{2}, \mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ ) is described because those derived from eicosatrienoic acid (the 1 -series) or from EPA (the 3 -series) are present in very small amounts in humans on a normal diet.

The biochemical reactions that lead to the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes are illustrated in Figure 31.18. The initial step, which is catalyzed by a cyclooxygenase, forms the five-membered ring and adds four atoms of oxygen (two between carbons 9 and 11, and two at carbon 15) to form the unstable endoperoxide, $\mathrm{PGG}_{2}$. The hydroperoxy group at carbon 15 is quickly reduced to a hydroxyl group by a peroxidase to form another endoperoxide, $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$.

The next step is tissue-specific (see Fig. 31.18). Depending on the type of cell involved, $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ may be reduced to $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{PGD}_{2}$ by specific enzymes (PGE synthase and PGD synthase). $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ may be further reduced by PGE 9-ketoreductase to form $\mathrm{PGF}_{2 \alpha} . \mathrm{PGF}_{2 \alpha}$ also may be formed directly from $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ by the action of an endoperoxide reductase. Some of the major functions of the prostaglandins are listed in Table 31.1.
$\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ may be converted to the thromboxane $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$, a reaction catalyzed by TXA synthase (see Fig. 31.18). This enzyme is present in high concentration in platelets. In the vascular endothelium, however, $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ is converted to the prostaglandin $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ (prostacyclin) by PGI synthase (see Fig. 31.18). $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ have important antagonistic biologic effects on vasomotor and smooth muscle tone and on platelet aggregation. Some of the known functions of the thromboxanes are listed in Table 31.2.

In the 1990s, the cyclooxygenase enzyme was found to exist as two distinct isoforms designated COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is regarded as a constitutive form of the enzyme, is widely expressed in almost all tissues, is the only form expressed in mature platelets, and is involved in the production of prostaglandins and

The predominant eicosanoid in platelets $\varepsilon \mathrm{TXA}_{2}$, a potent vasoconstrictor and a stimulator of platelet aggregation. The latter action initiates thrombus formation at sites of vascular injury as well as in the vicinity of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque in the lumen of vessels such as the coronary arteries. Such thrombi may cause sudden total occlusion of the vascular lumen, causing acute ischemic damage to tissues distal to the block (i.e., acute myocardial infarction).

Aspirin, by covalently acetylating the active site of cyclooxygenase, blocks the production of $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ from its major precursor, arachidonic acid. By causing this mild hemostatic defect, low-dose aspirin has been shown to be effective in prevention of acute myocardial infarction. For Ivan A. (who has symptoms of coronary heart disease), aspirin is used to prevent a first heart attack (primary prevention). For Anne J. and Cora N. (who already have had heart attacks), aspirin is used in the hope of preventing a second heart attack (secondary prevention).

FIGURE 31.18 Formation of prostaglandins (including the prostacyclin $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ ) and thromboxane $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ from arachidonic acid. The conversion of arachidonic acid to $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ is catalyzed by a membrane-bound enzyme, prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase, which has cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities. The reducing agent is glutathione (GSH), which is oxidized to form a disulfide between the two glutathione molecules (GSSG).

Because of the importance of prostaglandins in mediating the inflammatory response, drugs that block prostaglandin production should provide relief from pain.

The cyclooxygenase enzyme is inhibited by all nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). Aspirin transfers an acetyl group to the enzyme, irreversibly inactivating it (Fig. 31.19). Other NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) act as reversible inhibitors of cyclooxygenase. Ibuprofen is the major ingredient in popular over-the-counter NSAIDs such as Motrin and Advil (see Fig. 31.19). Although they have some relative selectivity for inhibiting either COX-1 or COX-2, NSAIDs block the activity of both isoforms. These findings provided the impetus for the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors, which act as potent antiinflammatory agents by inhibiting COX-2 activity, but with less gastrointestinal and antiplatelet side effects than commonly associated with NSAID use. These adverse effects of NSAIDs are thought to be caused by COX-1 inhibition. An example of a selective COX-2 inhibitor is celecoxib (Celebrex). Some properties of COX-1 and COX-2 are indicated in Table 31.3.

## 4. Inactivation of the Prostaglandins and Thromboxanes

Prostaglandins and thromboxanes are rapidly inactivated. Their half-lives $\left(t_{1 / 2}\right)$ range from seconds to minutes. The prostaglandins are inactivated by oxidation of the 15 -hydroxy group, critical for their activity, to a ketone. The double-bond at carbon 13 is reduced. Subsequently, both $\beta$ - and $\omega$-oxidation of the nonring portions occur, producing dicarboxylic acids that are excreted in the urine. Active $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ is rapidly metabolized to $\mathrm{TXB}_{2}$ by cleavage of the oxygen bridge between carbons 9 and 11 to form two hydroxyl groups. $\mathrm{TXB}_{2}$ has no biologic activity.

$\sigma$Diets that include cold-water fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel, brook trout, herring), with a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, EPA, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), result in a high content of these fatty acids in membrane phospholipids. It has been suggested that such diets are effective in preventing heart disease, in part because they lead to formation of more $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ relative to $\mathrm{TXA}_{2} \mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ is less effective in stimulating platelet aggregation than its counterpart in the 2 -series, $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$.

$\sigma$Although the COX-2 inhibitors did relieve the development of gastrointestinal ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs, further studies indicated that specific COX-2 inhibitors may have a negative effect on cardiovascular function. Vioxx was withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer because of these negative patient studies. It has been postulated that long-term use of COX-2 inhibitors alter the balance of prostacyclin (antithrombotic, $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ ) and thromboxane (prothrombotic) because platelets, the major source of the thromboxanes, do not express COX-2 and thromboxane synthesis is not reduced with COX-2 inhibitors (see Figure 31.18 and Table 31.3). This will tilt the balance of the eicosanoids synthesized toward a thrombotic pathway. The COX-2 inhibitors that remain on the market must be used with caution, because they are contraindicated in patients with ischemic heart disease or stroke.

Data adapted from Patrono and Baigent (see References ) indicate that low-dose aspirin ( 50 to $100 \mathrm{mg} /$ day) reduces platelet thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}\left(\mathrm{TXA}_{2}\right)$ levels by $97 \%$, with no effect on whole-body prostaglandin $1_{2}\left(\mathrm{PGI}_{2}\right)$, thereby leading to cardioprotection. High-dose aspirin ( 650 to $1,300 \mathrm{mg} /$ day), in addition to reducing $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ levels, also reduced $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ levels by $60 \%$ to $80 \%$. COX-2 specific inhibitors, at high levels, had no effect on TXA2 levels but reduced whole-body $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ levels by $60 \%$ to $80 \%$, leading to an increased risk of myocardial infarction.

## D. Mechanism of Action of the Eicosanoids

The eicosanoids have a wide variety of physiologic effects, which are generally initiated through interaction of the eicosanoid with a specific receptor on the plasma membrane of a target cell (Table 31.4). This eicosanoid-receptor binding either activates the adenylate cyclase-cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) system (PGE, PGD, and PGI series) or causes an increase in the level of calcium in the cytosol of target cells ( $\mathrm{PGF}_{2 \alpha}, \mathrm{TXA}_{2}$, the endoperoxides, and the leukotrienes).

In some systems, the eicosanoids appear to modulate the degree of activation of adenylate cyclase in response to other stimuli. In these instances, the eicosanoid may bind to a regulatory subunit of the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G-proteins) within the plasma membrane of the target cell (see Chapter 11). If the eicosanoid binds to the stimulatory subunit, the effect of the stimulus is amplified. Conversely, if the eicosanoid binds to the inhibitory subunit, the cellular response to the stimulus is reduced. Through these influences on the activation of adenylate cyclase, eicosanoids contribute to the regulation of cell function.

Some of the biologic effects of certain eicosanoids occur as a result of a paracrine or autocrine action. One paracrine action is the contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells caused by $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ released from circulating platelets (vasoconstriction).

An autocrine action of eicosanoids is exemplified by platelet aggregation induced by $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ produced by the platelets themselves.

The eicosanoids influence the cellular function of almost every tissue of the body. Certain organ systems are affected to a greater degree than others.

## III. Synthesis of Triacylglycerols and VLDL Particles

In liver and adipose tissue, triacylglycerols are produced by a pathway that contains a phosphatidic acid intermediate (Fig. 31.20). Phosphatidic acid is also the precursor of the glycerolipids found in cell membranes and the blood lipoproteins.

FIGURE 31.20 Synthesis of triacylglycerol in liver and adipose tissue. Glycerol 3-phosphate is produced from glucose in both tissues. It is also produced from glycerol in liver, but not in adipose tissue, which lacks glycerol kinase. The steps from glycerol 3-phosphate are the same in the two tissues. FA, fatty acyl group; CoA, coenzyme A; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; VLDL, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL).
![ma634074519f](ma634074519f.jpg)

Although our knowledge of the spectrum of biologic actions of the endogenous eicosanoids is incomplete, several actions are well enough established to allow their application in a variety of clinical situations or diseases. For example, drugs that are analogs of $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ suppress gastric ulceration, in part by inhibiting secretion of hydrochloric acid in the mucosal cells of the stomach. Analogs of $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}$ are used in the treatment of sexual impotence. Men with certain forms of sexual impotence can self-inject this agent into the corpus cavernosum of the penis to induce immediate but temporary penile tumescence. The erection lasts for 1 to 3 hours. The stimulatory action of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGF}_{2 \mathrm{a}}$, on uterine muscle contraction has led to the use of these prostaglandins to induce labor and to control postpartum bleeding. $\mathrm{PGE}_{1}$ is also used as palliative therapy in neonates with congenital heart defects to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus until surgery can be performed. Analogs of $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ have been shown to be effective in the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension.

The gene for glycerol kinase is located on the X-chromosome, close to the DMD gene (which codes for dystrophin) and the NROBI gene, which codes for a protein designated as DAXI. DAXI is critical for the development of the adrenal glands, pituitary, hypothalamus, and gonads. Complex glycerol kinase deficiency results from a contiguous deletion of the X-chromosome, which deletes all or part of the glycerol kinase gene along with the NROBI gene and/or the DMD gene. The patient exhibits adrenal insufficiency, hyperglycerolemia, and, if the DMD gene is deleted, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.

Abetalipoproteinemia, which is caused by a lack of MTP (see Chapter 29) activity, results in an inability to assemble both chylomicrons in the intestine and VLDL particles in the liver.

Why do some people with alcoholism have high VLDL levels?
![ma644074519f](ma644074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 31.21 Composition of a typical very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle. The major component is triacylglycerol (TG). C, cholesterol; CE, cholesterol ester; PL, phospholipid.

The sources of glycerol 3-P, which provides the glycerol moiety for triacylglycerol synthesis, differ in liver and adipose tissue. In liver, glycerol 3-P is produced from the phosphorylation of glycerol by glycerol kinase or from the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) derived from glycolysis. White adipose tissue lacks glycerol kinase and can produce glycerol 3-P only from glucose via DHAP. Thus, adipose tissue can store fatty acids only when glycolysis is activated; that is, in the fed state.

In both adipose tissue and liver, triacylglycerols are produced by a pathway in which glycerol 3-P reacts with fatty acyl-CoA to form phosphatidic acid. Dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid produces DAG. Another fatty acyl-CoA reacts with the DAG to form a triacylglycerol (see Fig. 31.20).

The triacylglycerol, which is produced in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the liver, is packaged with cholesterol, phospholipids, and proteins (synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum) to form VLDL (Fig. 31.21, see Fig. 29.7). The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which is required for chylomicron assembly, is also required for VLDL assembly. The major protein of VLDL is apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100). There is one long apoB-100 molecule wound through the surface of each VLDL particle. ApoB-100 is encoded by the same gene as the apoB-48 of chylomicrons, but it is a longer protein (see Fig. 29.9). In intestinal cells, RNA editing produces a stop codon in the mRNA produced by the gene and a protein which is $48 \%$ the size of apoB-100 (apoB-48; see Figure 29.9).

VLDL is processed in the Golgi complex and secreted into the blood by the liver (Figs. 31.22 and 31.23). The fatty acid residues of the triacylglycerols ultimately are stored in the triacylglycerols of adipose cells. Note that, in comparison to chylomicrons (see Chapter 29), VLDL particles are more dense, as they contain a lower percentage of triglyceride (and hence more protein) than do the chylomicrons. Similar to chylomicrons, VLDL particles are first synthesized in a nascent form, and on entering the circulation, they acquire apolipoproteins CII and E from HDL particles to become mature VLDL particles.

The fact that several different abnormal lipoprotein profiles were found in Cora N. and her siblings, and that each had evidence of coronary artery disease, suggests that Cora has familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH). This diagnostic impression is further supported by the finding that Cora's profile of lipid abnormalities appeared to change somewhat from one determination to the next, a characteristic of FCH. This hereditary disorder of lipid metabolism is believed to be quite common, with an estimated prevalence of about I per 100 population.

The mechanisms for FCH are incompletely understood but may involve, in part, a genetically determined increase in the production of apoB-I 00 . As a result, packaging of VLDL is increased, and blood VLDL levels may be elevated. Depending on the efficiency of lipolysis of VLDL by LPL, VLDL levels may be normal and LDL levels may be elevated, or both VLDL and LDL levels may be high. In addition, the phenotypic expression of FCH in any given family member may be determined by the degree of associated obesity, the diet, the use of specific drugs, or other factors that change over time. Furthermore, FCH may be a multigenic trait, and even though the disease appears as an autosomal-dominant trait in pedigree analysis, no genes have yet been definitively linked to this condition.

## IV. Fate of the VLDL Triglyceride

LPL, which is attached to the basement membrane proteoglycans of capillary endothelial cells, cleaves the triacylglycerols in both VLDL and chylomicrons, forming fatty acids and glycerol. Apolipoprotein CII, which these lipoproteins obtain from HDL, activates LPL. The low $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the muscle LPL isozyme permits muscle to use the fatty acids of chylomicrons and VLDL as a source of fuel even when the blood concentration of these lipoproteins is very low. The LPL isozyme in adipose tissue has a high $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ and is most active after a meal, when blood levels of chylomicrons and VLDL are elevated. The fate of the VLDL particle after triglyceride has been removed by LPL is the generation of an intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) particle, which can further lose triglyceride to become an LDL particle. The fate of the IDL and LDL particles is discussed in Chapter 32.

## V. Storage of Triacylglycerols in Adipose Tissue

After a meal, the triacylglycerol stores of adipose tissue increase (Fig. 31.24). Adipose cells synthesize LPL and secrete it into the capillaries of adipose tissue when the insulin/glucagon ratio is elevated. This enzyme digests the triacylglycerols of both chylomicrons and VLDL. The fatty acids enter adipose cells and are activated, forming fatty acyl-CoA, which reacts with glycerol 3-P to form triacylglycerol by the same pathway used in the liver (see Fig. 31.20). Because adipose tissue lacks glycerol kinase and cannot use the glycerol produced by LPL, the glycerol travels through the blood to the liver, which uses it for the synthesis of triacylglycerol. In adipose cells, under fed conditions, glycerol 3-P is derived from glucose.

In addition to stimulating the synthesis and release of LPL, insulin stimulates glucose metabolism in adipose cells. Insulin leads to the activation of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 by activation of the kinase activity of phosphofructokinase-2, which increases fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels. Insulin also stimulates the dephosphorylation of PDH, so that the pyruvate produced by glycolysis can be oxidized in the TCA cycle. Furthermore, insulin stimulates the conversion of glucose to fatty acids in adipose cells, although the liver is the major site of fatty acid synthesis in humans.

## VI. Release of Fatty Acids from Adipose Triacylglycerols

During fasting, the decrease of insulin and the increase of glucagon cause cAMP levels to rise in adipose cells, stimulating lipolysis (Fig. 31.25). PKA phosphorylates hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) to produce a more active form of the enzyme. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is the rate-limiting enzyme of triglyceride degradation, and it catalyzes the conversion of triglyceride to diglyceride plus a free fatty acid. Activated HSL coverts diglyceride to monoacylglycerol plus a free fatty acid, and monoglyceride lipase converts monoacylglycerol to free glycerol and a free fatty acid.

(1)In alcoholism, NADH levels in the liver are elevated (see Chapter 28). High levels of NADH inhibit the oxidation of fatty acids. Therefore, fatty acids, mobilized from adipose tissue, are re-esterified to glycerol 3-P in the liver, forming triacylglycerols, which are packaged into VLDL and secreted into the blood. Elevated VLDL is frequently associated with chronic alcoholism. As alcohol-induced liver disease progresses, the ability to secrete the triacylglycerols is diminished, resulting in a fatty liver.

(2)Fatty acids for VLDL synthesis in the liver may be obtained from the blood or they may be synthesized from glucose. In a healthy individual, the major source of the fatty acids of VLDL triacylglycerol is excess dietary glucose. In individuals with diabetes mellitus, fatty acids mobilized from adipose triacylglycerols in excess of the oxidative capacity of tissues are a major source of the fatty acids re-esterified in liver to VLDL triacylglycerol. These individuals frequently have elevated levels of blood triacylglycerols.

(3) Because the fatty acids of adipose triacylglycerols come both from chylomicrons and VLDL, we produce our major fat stores both from dietary fat (which produces chylomicrons) and dietary sugar (which produces VLDL). An excess of dietary protein also can be used to produce the fatty acids for VLDL synthesis. The dietitian carefully explained to Percy V. that we can become fat from eating excess fat, excess sugar, or excess protein.

ATGL is regulated, in part, by a protein designated as comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58). In the basal state, CGI-58 is complexed with perilipin 1 (PLIN1), and ATGL activity is low. When PKA is activated, PLIN1 is phosphorylated, releasing bound CGI-58, which binds to ATGL to activate it. Perilipins are proteins that bind to triacylglycerol droplets and regulate their ability to be degraded. The end result, after PKA activation, is that fatty acids and glycerol are released into the blood. Simultaneously, to regulate the amount of fatty acids released into circulation, triglyceride synthesis occurs along with glyceroneogenesis (see a further explanation of glyceroneogenesis in
![ma684074519f](ma684074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 31.25 Mobilization of adipose triacylglycerol (TG). In the fasted state, when insulin levels are low and glucagon is elevated, intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) increases and activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates both perilipin I and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Phosphorylated perilipin-I dissociates from CGI-58, which then binds to adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL), activating the lipase. Phosphorylated HSL is active and participates in the breakdown of adipose TG. Re-esterification of fatty acids does occur, along with the synthesis of glycerol 3-phosphate, in the fasted state, in order to regulate the release of fatty acids from the adipocyte.

the online supplement). Glyceroneogenesis refers to the adipocyte resynthesizing triglyceride from newly synthesized glycerol 3-P (derived from amino acids or lactate) and free fatty acids, as a mechanism to reduce fatty acid export from the adipocyte.

The fatty acids, which travel in the blood complexed with albumin, enter cells of muscle and other tissues, where they are oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water to produce energy. During prolonged fasting, acetyl-CoA produced by $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver is converted to ketone bodies, which are released into the blood. The glycerol derived from lipolysis in adipose cells is used by the liver during fasting as a source of carbon for gluconeogenesis.

## VII. Metabolism of Glycerophospholipids and Sphingolipids

Fatty acids, obtained from the diet or synthesized from glucose, are the precursors of glycerophospholipids and of sphingolipids (Fig. 31.26). These lipids are major components of cellular membranes. Glycerophospholipids are also components of blood lipoproteins, bile, and lung surfactant. They are the source of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid, that serve as precursors of the eicosanoids. Ether glycerophospholipids differ from other glycerophospholipids in that the alkyl or alkenyl chain (an alkyl chain with a double bond) is joined to carbon 1 of the glycerol moiety by an ether rather than an ester bond. Examples of ether lipids are the plasmalogens and plateletactivating factor (PAF). Sphingolipids are particularly important in forming the myelin sheath surrounding nerves in the central nervous system, and in signal transduction.

In glycerolipids and ether glycerolipids, glycerol serves as the backbone to which fatty acids and other substituents are attached. Sphingosine, derived from serine, provides the backbone for sphingolipids.

## A. Synthesis of Phospholipids Containing Glycerol

## I. Glycerophospholipids

The initial steps in the synthesis of glycerophospholipids are similar to those of triacylglycerol synthesis. Glycerol 3-P reacts with two activated fatty acids to form

In some cases of hyperlipidemia, LPL is defective. If a blood lipid profile is performed on patients with an LPL deficiency, which lipids will be elevated?
![ma694074519f](ma694074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 31.26 Types of glycerolipids and sphingolipids. Glycerolipids contain glycerol, and sphingolipids contain sphingosine. The category of phospholipids overlaps both glycerolipids and sphingolipids. The head groups include choline, ethanolamine, serine, inositol, glycerol, and phosphatidylglycerol. The carbohydrates are monosaccharides (which may be sulfated), oligosaccharides, and oligosaccharides with branches of N -acetylneuraminic acid. $P$, phosphate.

![ma704074519f](ma704074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 31.27 Strategies for addition of the head group to form glycerophospholipids. In both cases, cytidine triphosphate (CTP) is used to drive the reaction. CDP, cytidine diphosphate; CMP, cytidine monophosphate; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate; $P P_{i}$, pyrophosphate.
phosphatidic acid. Two different mechanisms are then used to add a head group to the molecule (Fig. 31.27). A head group is a chemical group, such as choline or serine, attached to the phosphate on carbon 3 of a glycerol moiety that contains hydrophobic groups, usually fatty acids, at positions 1 and 2 . Head groups are hydrophilic, either charged or polar. The head groups all contain a free hydroxyl group, which is used to link to the phosphate on carbon 3 of the glycerol backbone.

In the first mechanism, phosphatidic acid is cleaved by a phosphatase to form DAG. DAG then reacts with an activated head group. In the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, the head group choline is activated by combining with cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to form cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-choline (Fig. 31.28). Phosphocholine is then transferred to carbon 3 of DAG, and cytidine monophosphate (CMP) is released. Phosphatidylethanolamine is produced by a similar reaction involving CDP-ethanolamine.

Various types of interconversions occur among these phospholipids (see Fig. 31.28). Phosphatidylserine is produced by a reaction in which the ethanolamine moiety of phosphatidylethanolamine is exchanged for serine. Phosphatidylserine can be converted back to phosphatidylethanolamine by a decarboxylation reaction. Phosphatidylethanolamine can be methylated to form phosphatidylcholine (see Chapter 38).

In the second mechanism for the synthesis of glycerolipids, phosphatidic acid reacts with CTP to form CDP-DAG (Fig. 31.29). This compound can react with phosphatidylglycerol (which itself is formed from the condensation of CDP-DAG and glycerol 3-P) to produce cardiolipin or with inositol to produce phosphatidylinositol. Cardiolipin is a component of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Phosphatidylinositol can be phosphorylated to form phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{PIP}_{2}\right)$, which is a component of cell membranes. In response to signals such as the binding of hormones to membrane receptors, $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ can be cleaved to form the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate (see Chapter 11).

## 2. Ether Glycerolipids

The ether glycerolipids are synthesized from the glycolytic intermediate DHAP. A fatty acyl-CoA reacts with carbon 1 of DHAP, forming an ester (Fig. 31.30). This fatty acyl group is exchanged for a fatty alcohol, produced by reduction of a fatty acid. Thus, the ether linkage is formed. Then, the keto group on carbon 2 of the DHAP moiety is reduced and esterified to a fatty acid. Addition of the head group proceeds by a series of reactions analogous to those for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. Formation of a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 of the alkyl group

FIGURE 31.28 Synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine. The multiple pathways reflect the importance of phospholipids in membrane structure. For example, phosphatidylcholine (PC) can be synthesized from dietary choline when it is available. If choline is not available, PC can be made from dietary carbohydrate, although the amount synthesized is inadequate to prevent choline deficiency. SAM is S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl group donor for many biochemical reactions (see Chapter 38). CDP, cytidine diphosphate; $C M P$, cytidine monophosphate.

produces a plasmalogen. Ethanolamine plasmalogen is found in myelin and choline plasmalogen in heart muscle. PAF is similar to choline plasmalogen except that an acetyl group replaces the fatty acyl group at carbon 2 of the glycerol moiety, and the alkyl group on carbon 1 is saturated. PAF is released from phagocytic blood cells in response to various stimuli. It causes platelet aggregation, edema, and hypotension, and it is involved in the allergic response. Plasmalogen synthesis occurs within peroxisomes, and, in individuals with Zellweger syndrome (a defect in peroxisome biogenesis), plasmalogen synthesis is compromised. If it is severe enough, this syndrome leads to death at an early age.

# B. Degradation of Glycerophospholipids 

Phospholipases located in cell membranes or in lysosomes degrade glycerophospholipids. Phospholipase A1 removes the fatty acyl group on carbon 1 of the glycerol

The RDS of a premature infant such as Christy L. is, in part, related to a deficiency in the synthesis of a substance known as lung surfactant. The major constituents of surfactant are dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, apolipoproteins (surfactant proteins: Sp-A,B,C), and cholesterol.
![ma744074519f](ma744074519f.jpg)

These components of lung surfactant normally contribute to a reduction in the surface tension within the air spaces (alveoli) of the lung, preventing their collapse. The premature infant has not yet begun to produce adequate amounts of lung surfactant.

moiety, and phospholipase A2 removes the fatty acid on carbon 2 (Fig. 31.31). The C2 fatty acid in cell membrane phospholipids is usually an unsaturated fatty acid, which is frequently arachidonic acid. It is removed in response to signals for the synthesis of eicosanoids. The bond joining carbon 3 of the glycerol moiety to phosphate is cleaved by phospholipase C. Hormonal stimuli activate phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ to produce the second messengers DAG and inositol

trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$. The bond between the phosphate and the head group is cleaved by phospholipase D, producing phosphatidic acid and the free alcohol of the head group.

Phospholipase A2 provides the major repair mechanism for membrane lipids damaged by oxidative free-radical reactions. Arachidonic acid, which is a polyunsaturated fatty acid, can be peroxidatively cleaved in free-radical reactions to malondialdehyde and other products. Phospholipase A2 recognizes the distortion of membrane structure caused by the partially degraded fatty acid and removes it. Acyltransferases then add back a new arachidonic acid molecule.

## C. Sphingolipids

Sphingolipids serve in intercellular communication and as the antigenic determinants of the ABO blood groups. Some are used as receptors by viruses and bacterial toxins, although it is unlikely that this was the purpose for which they originally evolved. Before the functions of the sphingolipids were elucidated, these compounds appeared to be inscrutable riddles. They were, therefore, named for the Sphinx of Thebes, who killed passersby that could not solve her riddle.

The synthesis of sphingolipids begins with the formation of ceramide (Fig. 31.32). Serine and palmitoyl-CoA condense to form a product that is reduced. A very-long-chain fatty acid (usually containing 22 carbons) forms an amide with the amino group, a double bond is generated, and ceramide is formed.

Ceramide reacts with phosphatidylcholine to form sphingomyelin, a component of the myelin sheath (Fig. 31.33) and the only sphingosine-based phospholipid. Ceramide also reacts with uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugars to form cerebrosides (which contain a single monosaccharide, usually galactose or glucose). Galactocerebroside may react with $3^{\prime}$-phosphoadenosine $5^{\prime}$-phosphosulfate ([PAPS] an active sulfate donor; Fig. 31.34) to form sulfatides, the major sulfolipids of the brain.

Additional sugars may be added to ceramide to form globosides, and gangliosides are produced by the addition of $N$-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) as branches from the oligosaccharide chains (see Fig. 31.33 and Chapter 27).

Sphingolipids are degraded by lysosomal enzymes (see Table 27.5). Deficiencies of these enzymes result in a group of lysosomal storage diseases known as the sphingolipidoses, or the gangliosidoses.

## VIII. The Adipocyte as an Endocrine Organ

It has become increasingly apparent in recent years that adipose tissue does more than just store triglyceride; it is also an active endocrine organ that secretes a variety of factors to regulate both glucose and fat metabolism. Two of the best-characterized factors are leptin and adiponectin.

## A. Leptin

Leptin was initially discovered in an obese mouse model as a circulating factor that, when added to a genetically obese mouse (ob/ob), resulted in a loss of weight. Leptin binds to a receptor that is linked to JAK (see Chapter 11), so leptin's signal is transmitted by variations in the activity of the STAT transcription factors. Leptin is released from adipocytes as their triglyceride levels increase and binds to receptors in the hypothalamus, which leads to the release of neuropeptides that signal a cessation of eating (anorexigenic factors). Giving leptin to leptin-deficient patients will result in a weight loss, but administering leptin to obese patients does not have the same effect. It is believed that the lack of a leptin effect is the result of the development of leptin resistance in many obese patients. Leptin resistance could result from the constant stimulation of the leptin receptors in obese individuals, leading to receptor desensitization. Another possibility is leptin-induced synthesis of factors that

![ma784074519f](ma784074519f.jpg)

block leptin-induced signal transduction. As an example, leptin induces the synthesis of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), a factor that antagonizes STAT activation. Long-term leptin stimulation may lead to constant expression of SOCS3, which would result in a diminished cellular response to leptin.

# B. Adiponectin 

Adiponectin is the most abundantly secreted hormone from the adipocyte. Unlike leptin, adiponectin secretion is reduced as the adipocyte gets larger. The reduced secretion of adiponectin may be linked to the development of insulin resistance in obesity (reduced cellular responses to insulin; see the "Biochemical Comments" for a further discussion of insulin resistance). Adiponectin will bind to either of two receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2), which initiates a signal transduction cascade resulting in the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and activation of the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\alpha$ (PPAR $\alpha$ ).

Within the muscle, activation of AMPK leads to enhanced fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake. Within the liver, activation of AMPK also leads to enhanced fatty acid oxidation as opposed to synthesis. AMPK activation in liver and muscle then lead to a reduction of blood glucose levels and free fatty acids. Recall that as the adipocytes increase in size, less adiponectin is released; so, as obesity occurs, it is more difficult for circulating fatty acids and glucose to be used by the tissues. This contributes, in part, to the elevated glucose and fat levels seen in the circulation of obese patients (the insulin-resistance syndrome).

Activation of PPAR $\alpha$ (see Chapter 44 for more details) leads to enhanced fatty acid oxidation by the liver and muscle. PPAR $\alpha$ is the target of the fibrate group of

FIGURE 31.34 The synthesis of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), an active sulfate donor.

lipid-lowering drugs. PPAR $\alpha$ activation leads to increased transcription of genes involved in fatty acid transport, energy uncoupling, and fatty acid oxidation (for further information on the action of fibrates, see the "Biochemical Comments" in Chapter 33).

The thiazolidinedione group of antidiabetic drugs (such as pioglitazone) is used to control type 2 diabetes. These drugs bind to and activate PPAR $\gamma$ in adipose tissues and lead, in part, to increased adiponectin synthesis and release, which aids in reducing circulating fat and glucose levels.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

(4)Emma W. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation, in part, through their inhibitory effect on phospholipase A2. In addition, suppression of COX2 induction is now thought to be a primary antiinflammatory mechanism of action for glucocorticoids. Despite the unquestionable value of glucocorticoid therapy in a variety of diseases associated with acute inflammation of tissues, it has many potential adverse effects. The sudden appearance of temporary glucose intolerance when Emma W. was treated with large doses of prednisone, a gluconeogenic steroid (glucocorticoid), is just one of the many potential adverse effects of this class of drugs when they are given systemically in pharmacologic doses over an extended period. The inhaled steroids, conversely, have far fewer systemic side effects because their absorption across the bronchial mucosa into the circulation is very limited. This property allows them to be used over prolonged periods in the treatment of asthma. The fact that inhalation allows direct delivery of the agent to the primary site of inflammation adds to their effectiveness in the treatment of these patients.

Percy V. If Percy V. had continued to eat a hypercaloric diet rich in carbohydrates, he would have become obese. In an effort to define obesity, it has been agreed internationally that the ratio of the patient's body weight in kilograms to his or her height in meters squared $\left(W / H^{2}\right)$ is the most useful and reproducible measure. This ratio is referred to as the body mass index (BMI). Normal men and women fall into the range of 18.5 to 25 . Percy's current value is 21.3 and rising.

It is estimated that $>30 \%$ of adults in the United States have a BMI $>30$, with $>60 \%$ exhibiting a $\mathrm{BMI}>25$. For individuals with a $\mathrm{BMI}>27$, which is quite close to a weight $20 \%$ above the "ideal" or desirable weight, an attempt at weight loss should be strongly advised. The idea that obesity is a benign condition unless it is accompanied by other risk factors for cardiovascular disease is disputed by several long-term, properly controlled prospective studies. These studies show that obesity is an independent risk factor not only for heart attacks and strokes, but for the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and gallbladder disease.

Percy did not want to become overweight and decided to follow his new diet faithfully.

(5)Cora N. Because Cora N.'s lipid profile indicated an elevation in both serum triacylglycerols and LDL cholesterol, she was classified as having a combined hyperlipidemia. The dissimilarities in the lipid profiles of Cora and her two siblings, both of whom were experiencing anginal chest pain, are characteristic of the multigenic syndrome referred to as familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH).

Approximately $1 \%$ of the North American population has FCH. It is the most common cause of coronary artery disease in the United States. In contrast to patients with familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ), patients with FCH do not have fatty deposits within the skin or tendons (xanthomas) (see Chapter 32). In FCH, coronary artery disease usually appears by the fifth decade of life.

Treatment of FCH includes restriction of dietary fat. Patients who do not respond adequately to dietary therapy are treated with antilipidemic drugs. Selection of the appropriate antilipidemic drugs depends on the specific phenotypic expression of the patients' multigenic disease as manifest by their particular serum lipid profile. In Cora's case, a decrease in both serum triacylglycerols and LDL cholesterol must be achieved.

Because Cora has known coronary artery disease, she was prescribed a highdose statin (atorvastatin). Treatment of hypercholesterolemia is based on overall risk of cardiovascular disease. Nicotinic acid (niacin) could also potentially be used to treat patients with hyperlipidemia because these agents have the potential to lower serum triacylglycerol levels and cause a reciprocal rise in serum HDL cholesterol levels as well as lowering serum total and LDL cholesterol levels. The mechanisms suggested for niacin's triacylglycerol-lowering action include enhancement of the action of LPL, inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue, and a decrease in esterification of triacylglycerols in the liver (see Chapter 32, Table 32.6). The mechanism by which niacin lowers the serum total and LDL cholesterol levels is related to the decrease in hepatic production of VLDL. When the level of VLDL in the circulation decreases, the production of its daughter particles, IDL and LDL, also decreases. Niacin's side effects of flushing and itching are often found to be intolerable.

Statins, such as atorvastatin, inhibit cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway (see Chapter 32). After 3 months of therapy, atorvastatin decreased Cora's LDL cholesterol from a pretreatment level of $175 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ to 122 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Her fasting serum triacylglycerol concentration was decreased from a pretreatment level of $280 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ to $178 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

Cora was also told to take 81 mg of aspirin every day. In the presence of aspirin, cyclooxygenase is irreversibly inactivated by acetylation. New cyclooxygenase molecules are not produced in platelets because platelets have no nuclei and, therefore, cannot synthesize new mRNA. Thus, the inhibition of cyclooxygenase by aspirin persists for the lifespan of the platelet ( 7 to 10 days). When aspirin is taken daily at doses between 81 and 325 mg , new platelets are affected as they are generated. Higher doses do not improve efficacy but do increase side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and easy bruisability.

Patients with established or suspected atherosclerotic coronary disease, such as Anne J., Cora N., and Ivan A., benefit from the action of low-dose aspirin ( 81 $\mathrm{mg} /$ day), which produces a mild defect in hemostasis. This action of aspirin helps to prevent thrombus formation in the area of an atherosclerotic plaque at critical sites in the vascular tree.

Christy L. suffered from RDS, which is a major cause of death in the newborn. RDS is preventable if prematurity can be avoided by appropriate management of high-risk pregnancy and labor. Before delivery, the obstetrician must attempt to predict and possibly treat pulmonary prematurity in utero. For example, estimation of fetal head circumference by ultrasonography, monitoring for fetal arterial oxygen saturation, and determination of the ratio of the concentrations of phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) and that of sphingomyelin in the amniotic fluid may help to identify premature infants who are predisposed to RDS (Fig. 31.35).

The administration of synthetic corticosteroids to women at risk of preterm birth can reduce the incidence or mortality of RDS by stimulating fetal synthesis of lung surfactant. They are given to women who are between 24 and 34 weeks pregnant and at risk of delivering within 7 days.

The administration of one dose of surfactant into the trachea of the premature infant immediately after birth, for babies with very poor respiratory function, can improve morbidity and mortality.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Metabolic Syndrome. Obesity is a relatively modern problem brought about by an excess of nutrients and reduced physical activity. As individuals become obese, adipocyte function, in terms of its biochemical and endocrine roles, is altered. Adiponectin levels fall, and with it, reduced fatty acid oxidation occurs in tissues. The release of free fatty acids is also increased in large adipocytes, presumably because of the high concentration of substrate (triglyceride), even if HSL is not activated. This is coupled with a deficiency of perilipins in obese individuals. Perilipins are adipocyte phosphoproteins that bind to triacylglycerol droplets and regulate the accessibility of the triglyceride to the lipases. A decrease in perilipin synthesis leads to an enhanced basal rate of lipolysis.

Fat cells begin to proliferate early in life, starting in the third trimester of gestation. Proliferation essentially ceases before puberty, and thereafter, fat cells change mainly in size. However, some increase in the number of fat cells can occur in adulthood if preadipocytes are induced to proliferate by growth factors and changes in the nutritional state. Weight reduction results in a decrease in the size of fat cells rather than a decrease in number. After weight loss, the amount of LPL, an enzyme involved in the transfer of fatty acids from blood triacylglycerols to the triacylglycerol stores of adipocytes, increases. In addition, the amount of mRNA for LPL also increases. All of these factors suggest that individuals who become obese, particularly those who do so early in life, will have difficulty losing weight and maintaining a lower body adipose mass.

Signals that initiate or inhibit feeding are extremely complex and include psychological and hormonal factors as well as neurotransmitter activity. These signals are integrated and relayed through the hypothalamus. Destruction of specific regions of the hypothalamus can lead to overeating and obesity or to anorexia and weight loss. Overeating and obesity are associated with damage to the ventromedial or the paraventricular nucleus, whereas weight loss and anorexia are related to damage to more lateral hypothalamic regions. Compounds that act as satiety signals have been identified in brain tissue and include leptin and glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1). Appetite suppressors developed from compounds such as these may be used in the future for the treatment of obesity.

Increased circulating levels of nonesterified (or free) fatty acids (NEFA) are observed in obesity and are associated with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is also a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. There are several theories as to why increased NEFA promote insulin resistance. One will be presented here, along with the effects of NEFA on insulin release from the pancreas. As NEFA levels in the circulation rise, muscle begins to use predominantly NEFA as an energy source. This reduces muscle glucose metabolism, as a result of the buildup of acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria, export of citrate to the cytoplasm, and inhibition of phosphofructokinase-1. Because glucose is not being metabolized, its uptake by muscle is reduced. Because muscle is the predominant tissue that takes up glucose in response to insulin, impaired glucose uptake (resulting from fat oxidation) is manifest as a sign of insulin resistance. NEFA are also postulated to interfere with pancreatic $\beta$-cell secretion of insulin, further contributing to insulin resistance (see the following for more on this topic).

Obesity, insulin resistance, and altered blood lipid levels are the start of a syndrome known as metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome commonly is diagnosed mostly based on criteria from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention and the American Heart Association/ National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI). For a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, at least three of the following components should be evident:

- Increased waist circumference: 40 inches or more for men, 35 inches or more for woman
- Elevated triglycerides ( $\geq 150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )
- Reduced HDL ( $<40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ for men, $<50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ for women)
- Elevated blood pressure ( $\geq 130 / 85 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ )
- Elevated fasting glucose ( $\geq 100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )

Individuals with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Treatment, in addition to lifestyle changes to reduce weight, increase exercise, and change diet, will be discussed further in Chapter 32.

A characteristic of the metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance. Part of this resistance is caused by altered insulin release from the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas under hyperlipidemic conditions. To understand how this occurs, it is necessary to revisit normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (see Fig. 19.11).

Glucose is metabolized in the pancreatic $\beta$-cell to generate ATP, which closes ATP-sensitive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, which leads to a membrane depolarization, which activates voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the membrane. The corresponding increase in intracellular calcium levels leads to stimulation of the exocytosis of insulin-containing vesicles. However, the process is more complicated than this and is coupled to pyruvate cycling within the $\beta$-cell and the generation of NADPH. The exact role of NADPH in stimulating insulin release has not yet been elucidated.

Islet cells express pyruvate carboxylase but very low levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. As seen in Figure 31.36, NADPH is generated in the cytosol of the islet cells by malic enzyme and the cytosolic isozyme of isocitrate dehydrogenase, which uses $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$instead of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$as the mitochondrial enzyme does.

Thus, under normal conditions, glucose is metabolized to pyruvate, and the pyruvate enters the mitochondria. Some of the pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA to generate energy; some of the pyruvate is converted to OAA. The OAA generated can be converted to malate and exported to the cytoplasm, where it is recycled to pyruvate by malic enzyme, generating NADPH. Alternatively, the OAA and acetylCoA generated within the mitochondria can condense and form citrate, isocitrate, and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, all of which can leave the mitochondria and enter the cytosol. Cytosolic isocitrate is oxidized to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, generating NADPH. Cytosolic citrate is split by citrate lyase to acetyl-CoA and OAA, and the OAA is reduced to malate and cycled to pyruvate, generating more NADPH. The cytosolic acetylCoA is used for limited fatty acid production in the islet cell. The elevated cytosolic NADPH then aids, in an unknown manner, in the release of insulin from the $\beta$-cell.

Obesity-related derangements in metabolic regulation. Annu Rev Biochem. 2006;75:367-401.)

So what goes wrong when $\beta$-cells are chronically exposed to high levels of NEFA in the circulation? The $\beta$-cell begins to oxidize the fatty acids, which dramatically raises the acetyl-CoA levels in the $\beta$-cell mitochondria. This leads to the activation of pyruvate carboxylase and enhanced pyruvate cycling, with significant increases in resting NADPH levels. This, then, leads to blunted increases in NADPH levels when glucose levels increase, as pyruvate cycling is already maximal because of the activation of pyruvate carboxylase. Thus, the $\beta$-cell releases less insulin in response to the increase in blood glucose levels, thereby contributing further to hyperglycemia that was initiated by the resistance to insulin's action in peripheral tissues.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Fatty acids are synthesized mainly in the liver, primarily from glucose.
- Glucose is converted to pyruvate via glycolysis, which enters the mitochondrion and forms both acetyl-CoA and OAA, which then forms citrate.
- The newly synthesized citrate is transported to the cytosol, where it is cleaved to form acetyl-CoA, which is the source of carbons for fatty acid biosynthesis.
- Two enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (the key regulatory step) and fatty acid synthase, produce palmitic acid ( 16 carbons, no double bonds) from acetylCoA. After activation to palmitoyl-CoA, the fatty acid can be elongated or desaturated (adding double bonds) by enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum.
- The eicosanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes) are potent regulators of cellular function (such as the inflammatory response, smooth muscle contraction, blood pressure regulation, and bronchoconstriction and bronchodilation) and are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids containing 20 carbon atoms.
- The prostaglandins and thromboxanes require cyclooxygenase activity to be synthesized, whereas the leukotrienes require lipoxygenase activity.
- Cyclooxygenase is the target of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, which covalently acetylates and inactivates the enzyme in platelets.
- Fatty acids are used to produce triacylglycerols (for energy storage) and glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids (for structural components of cell membranes).
- Liver-derived triacylglycerol is packaged with various apolipoproteins and secreted into the circulation as very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL).
- As with dietary chylomicrons, lipoprotein lipase in the capillaries of adipose tissue, muscle, and the lactating mammary gland digests the triacylglycerol of VLDL, forming fatty acids and glycerol.
- Glycerophospholipids, synthesized from fatty acyl-CoA and glycerol 3-P, are all derived from phosphatidic acid. Various head groups are added to phosphatidic acid to form the mature glycerophospholipids.
- Phospholipid degradation is catalyzed by phospholipases.
- Sphingolipids are synthesized from sphingosine, which is derived from palmitoyl-CoA and serine. Glycolipids, such as cerebrosides, globosides, and gangliosides, are sphingolipids.
- The sole sphingosine-based phospholipid is sphingomyelin.
- The adipocyte is an active endocrine organ, producing adipokines that help to regulate appetite and adipocyte size.
- Metabolic syndrome refers to a clustering of a variety of metabolic abnormalities that together dramatically increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
- Diseases discussed in the chapter are summarized in Table 31.5.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is A. Fatty acids, cleaved from the triacylglycerols of blood lipoproteins by the action of LPL, are taken up by adipose cells and react with coenzyme A to form fatty acyl-CoA. Glucose is converted via DHAP to glycerol 3-P, which reacts with fatty acyl-CoA to form phosphatidic acid (adipose tissue lacks glycerol kinase, so it cannot use glycerol directly). After inorganic phosphate is released from phosphatidic acid, the resulting diacylglycerol reacts with another fatty acyl-CoA to form a triacylglycerol, which is stored in adipose cells (2-monoacylglycerol is an intermediate of triglyceride synthesis only in the intestine, not in adipose tissue).
2. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. The triacylglycerol is degraded by pancreatic lipase, which releases the fatty acids at positions 1 and 3. The fatty acids released are then transported to the cell surface in a bile salt micelle. The only exception are short-chain fatty acids (shorter than palmitic acid), which can diffuse to the cell surface and enter the intestinal cell in the absence of micelle formation.
3. The answer is B. Dietary carbohydrate is converted to lipid in the liver and exported via VLDL. Thus, a low-carbohydrate diet will reduce VLDL formation and reduce the hyperlipoproteinemia.
4. The answer is B. Pyruvate carboxylase is activated, within the mitochondria, by acetyl-CoA. High acetylCoA will also inhibit PDH, thereby allowing the pyruvate produced to be used for gluconeogenesis, and not energy production. In MCAD, fatty acids are not fully oxidized (thereby reducing the amount of energy available for gluconeogenesis), and acetyl-CoA levels do not reach a point at which pyruvate carboxylase can be fully activated, thereby reducing precursor levels available for gluconeogenesis. Glucose 6-phosphatase activity is not affected by acetyl-CoA levels, nor is phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity (which is regulated at a transcriptional level) or fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity (which is inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is not a regulated enzyme of glycolysis or gluconeogenesis.
5. The answer is E. When fatty acids are being synthesized, malonyl-CoA accumulates, which inhibits carnitine:palmitoyltransferase I. This blocks fatty acid entry into the mitochondrion for oxidation. Many tissues both synthesize and degrade fatty acids (such as liver and muscle; thus, A is incorrect). NADPH blocks the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction, but not fatty acid oxidation (thus, B is incorrect). Insulin has no effect on the synthesis of the enzymes involved in fatty acid degradation (unlike the effect of insulin on the induction of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis; thus, C is incorrect). Finally, newly synthesized fatty acids are converted to their CoA derivatives for elongation and desaturation (thus, E is incorrect).
6. The answer is C. Most prostaglandins are synthesized from arachidonic acid (cis- $\Delta^{5,8,11,14} \mathrm{C} 20: 4$ ), which is derived from the essential fatty acid linoleic acid (cis- $\Delta^{9,12}$ C18:2). Glucose, oleic acid, or acetyl-CoA cannot give rise to linoleic or arachidonic acid, as mammals cannot introduce double bonds six carbons from the $\omega$-end of a fatty acid. Leukotrienes are also derived from arachidonic acid, but they are not precursors of prostaglandins; they follow a different pathway.

7. The answer is A. Fatty acid synthesis requires NADPH, which can be generated by the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway or by malic enzyme activity. In the absence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, malic enzyme, along with a mitochondrial transhydrogenase, would provide the NADPH for fatty acid biosynthesis. Cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase can also produce NADPH under these conditions. Neither the fatty acid synthase, citrate lyase, C9-desaturase, or acetyl-CoA carboxylase generate NADPH.
8. The answer is A. Aspirin leads to the acetylation of COX-1 and COX-2, which inhibits the enzymes. Tylenol contains acetaminophen, which is a competitive inhibitor of both COX-1 and COX-2, but acetaminophen does not attach covalently to the enzymes. Advil contains ibuprofen, which is another competitive inhibitor of the COX enzymes. Vioxx and Celebrex contain inhibitors that are specific for COX-2, which is the form of cyclooxygenase that is induced during inflammation. Vioxx and Celebrex do not inhibit COX-1 activity.
9. The answer is B. Sphingolipids are important in signal transduction and the formation of myelin sheaths of the central nervous system. Glycerophospholipids are components of blood lipoproteins, bile, and lung surfactant. Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid required for signal transduction, but it is not formed from a sphingolipid.
10. The answer is B. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase which produces prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Thromboxanes are in platelets and inhibition of their aggregation reduces clotting which can prevent a heart attack. Prostaglandins are involved in inflammation. Leukotrienes and lipoxins are produced by lipoxygenase and epoxides by a chromosome P450 system.

# Cholesterol Absorption, Synthesis, Metabolism, and Fate 

Cholesterol is one of the most well-recognized molecules in human biology, in part because of the direct relationship between its concentrations in blood and tissues and the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Cholesterol, which is transported in the blood in lipoproteins because of its absolute insolubility in water, serves as a stabilizing component of cell membranes and as a precursor of the bile salts and steroid hormones. Precursors of cholesterol are converted to ubiquinone, dolichol, and, in the skin, to cholecalciferol, the active form of vitamin D. As a major component of blood lipoproteins, cholesterol can appear in its free, unesterified form in the outer shell of these macromolecules and as cholesterol esters in the lipoprotein core.

Cholesterol is obtained from the diet or synthesized by a pathway that occurs in most cells of the body but to a greater extent in cells of the liver and intestine. The precursor for cholesterol synthesis is acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which can be produced from glucose, fatty acids, or amino acids. Two molecules of acetyl-CoA form acetoacetyl coenzyme A (acetoacetyl-CoA), which condenses with another molecule of acetyl-CoA to form hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA). Reduction of HMG-CoA produces mevalonate. This reaction, catalyzed by HMGCoA reductase, is the major rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis. Mevalonate produces isoprene units that condense, eventually forming squalene. Cyclization of squalene produces the steroid ring system, and several subsequent reactions generate cholesterol. The adrenal cortex and the gonads also synthesize cholesterol in significant amounts and use it as a precursor for steroid hormone synthesis.

Cholesterol is packaged in chylomicrons in the intestine and in very-lowdensity lipoprotein (VLDL) in the liver. It is transported in the blood in these lipoprotein particles, which also transport triacylglycerols. As the triacylglycerols of the blood lipoproteins are digested by lipoprotein lipase (LPL), chylomicrons are converted to chylomicron remnants, and VLDL is converted to intermediatedensity lipoprotein (IDL) and subsequently to low-density lipoprotein (LDL). These products return to the liver, where they bind to receptors in cell membranes and are taken up by endocytosis and digested by lysosomal enzymes. LDL is also endocytosed by nonhepatic (peripheral) tissues. Cholesterol and other products of lysosomal digestion are released into the cellular pools. The liver uses this recycled cholesterol, and the cholesterol that is synthesized from acetyl-CoA, to produce VLDL and to synthesize bile salts.

Intracellular cholesterol obtained from blood lipoproteins decreases the synthesis of cholesterol within cells, stimulates the storage of cholesterol as cholesterol esters, and decreases the synthesis of LDL receptors. LDL receptors are found on the surface of the cells and bind various classes of lipoproteins before endocytosis.

Although high-density lipoprotein (HDL) contains triacylglycerols and cholesterol, its function is very different from that of the chylomicrons and VLDL, which transport triacylglycerols. HDL exchanges proteins and lipids with the other lipoproteins in the blood. HDL transfers apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apolipoprotein CII (apoCII) to chylomicrons and VLDL. After digestion of the VLDL triacylglycerols, apoE and apoCII are transferred back to HDL. In addition, HDL obtains cholesterol from other lipoproteins and from cell membranes and converts it to cholesterol

esters by the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) reaction. Then, HDL either directly transports cholesterol and cholesterol esters to the liver or transfers cholesterol esters to other lipoproteins via the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP). Ultimately, lipoprotein particles carry the cholesterol and cholesterol esters to the liver, where endocytosis and lysosomal digestion occur. Thus, reverse cholesterol transport (i.e, the return of cholesterol to the liver) is a major function of HDL.

Elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood are associated with the formation of atherosclerotic plaques that can occlude blood vessels, causing heart attacks and strokes. Although high levels of LDL cholesterol are especially atherogenic, high levels of HDL cholesterol are protective because HDL particles are involved in the process of removing cholesterol from tissues, such as the lining cells of vessels, and returning it to the liver.

Bile salts, which are produced in the liver from cholesterol obtained from the blood lipoproteins or synthesized from acetyl-CoA, are secreted into the bile. They are stored in the gallbladder and released into the intestine during a meal. The bile salts emulsify dietary triacylglycerols, thus aiding in digestion. The digestive products are absorbed by intestinal epithelial cells from bile salt micelles, tiny microdroplets that contain bile salts at their water interface. After the contents of the micelles are absorbed, most of the bile salts travel to the ileum, where they are resorbed and recycled by the liver. Less than $5 \%$ of the bile salts that enter the lumen of the small intestine are eventually excreted in the feces.

Although the fecal excretion of bile salts is relatively low, it is a major means by which the body disposes of the steroid nucleus of cholesterol. Because the ring structure of cholesterol cannot be degraded in the body, it is excreted mainly in the bile as free cholesterol and bile salts.

The steroid hormones, derived from cholesterol, include the adrenal cortical hormones (e.g., cortisol, aldosterone, and the adrenal sex steroids dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] and androstenedione) and the gonadal hormones (e.g., the ovarian and testicular sex steroids, such as testosterone and estrogen).

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$At his next office visit, Ivan A.'s case was reviewed by his physician. Mr. A. has several of the major risk factors for coronary heart disease. These include a sedentary lifestyle, marked obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and early type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, he has not been able to follow his doctor's advice with regard to a diabetic diet designed to effect a significant loss of weight, nor has he followed an aerobic exercise program. As a consequence, his weight has gone from 270 to 291 lb . After a 14 -hour fast, his serum glucose is now $214 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (normal, $<100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), and his serum total cholesterol level is $314 \mathrm{mg} /$ dL (according to recent guidelines, the LDL cholesterol value has an upper limit but not total cholesterol). His serum triacylglycerol level is $295 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (desired level is $150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ or less), and his serum HDL cholesterol is $24 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (desired level is $\geq 40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ for a man). His calculated serum LDL cholesterol level is $231 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (when LDL cholesterol is $>190 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, treatment is strongly recommended to help prevent cardiovascular disease). Mr. A. exhibits sufficient criteria to be classified as having metabolic syndrome.

$\square$Anne J. was carefully followed by her physician after she survived her heart attack. Before she was discharged from the hospital, after a 14-hour fast, her serum triacylglycerol level was $158 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (slightly above the upper range of normal), and her HDL cholesterol level was low at $32 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (normal for women is $\geq 50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Her serum total cholesterol level was elevated at $420 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. From these values, her LDL cholesterol level was calculated to be $356 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (current guidelines recommend starting medications for her treatment because of her known cardiovascular disease) (Table 32.1).

$\square$Until recently, the concentration of LDL cholesterol could only be directly determined by sophisticated laboratory techniques not available for routine clinical use. As a consequence, the LDL cholesterol concentration in the blood was derived indirectly by using the Friedewald formula: the sum of the HDL cholesterol level and the triacylglycerol (TG) level divided by 5 (which gives an estimate of the VLDL cholesterol level) subtracted from the total cholesterol level:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { LDL cholesterol }= & \text { total cholesterol } \\
& -[\text { HDL cholesterol } \\
& +(\text { TG } / 5)]
\end{aligned}
$$

This equation yields inaccurate LDL cholesterol levels $15 \%$ to $20 \%$ of the time and fails completely when serum triacylglycerol levels exceed $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

A recently developed test called LDL direct isolates LDL cholesterol by using a special immunoseparation reagent. Not only is this direct assay for LDL cholesterol more accurate than the indirect Friedewald calculation, it also is not affected by mildly to moderately elevated serum triacylglycerol levels and can be used for a patient who has not fasted. It does not require the expense of determining serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerol levels.

Both of Ms. J.'s younger brothers had "very high" serum cholesterol levels, and both had suffered heart attacks in their mid-40s. With this information, a tentative diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia, type IIA, was made, and the patient was started on a diet and medication as recommended by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association Task Force (see online references). This task force recommends that decisions with regard to when dietary and drug therapy should be initiated are based on risk of cardiovascular disease (Table 32.2).

Ms. J. was also started on a high-intensity statin, atorvastatin, because she had already experienced a myocardial infarction.

Her menstrual periods occurred on a monthly basis over the next 7 years, but the flow was scant. At age 20 years, she noted a gradual increase in her intermenstrual interval from her normal of 28 days to 32 to 38 days. The volume of her menstrual flow also gradually diminished. After 7 months, her menstrual periods ceased. She complained of increasing oiliness of her skin, the appearance of acnelike lesions on her face and upper back, and the appearance of short, dark terminal hairs on the mustache and sideburn areas of her face. The amount of extremity hair also increased, and she noticed a disturbing loss of hair from her scalp.

# I. Intestinal Absorption of Cholesterol 

Cholesterol absorption by intestinal cells is a key regulatory point in human sterol metabolism because it ultimately determines what percentage of the $1,000 \mathrm{mg}$ of biliary cholesterol produced by the liver each day and what percentage of the 300 mg of dietary cholesterol entering the gut per day is eventually absorbed into the blood. In normal subjects, approximately $55 \%$ of this intestinal pool enters the blood through the enterocyte each day. The details of cholesterol absorption from dietary sources is outlined in Chapter 30.

Although the absorption of cholesterol from the intestinal lumen is a diffusioncontrolled process, there is also a mechanism to remove unwanted or excessive cholesterol and plant sterols from the enterocyte. The transport of sterols out of the enterocyte and into the gut lumen is related to the products of genes that code for the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) protein family, specifically ABCG5 and ABCG8. These proteins couple ATP hydrolysis to the transport of unwanted or excessive cholesterol and plant sterols (phytosterols) from the enterocyte back into the gut lumen. Another member of the ABC family, ABCA1, is required for reverse cholesterol transport and the biogenesis of HDL. Cholesterol cannot be metabolized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water and is, therefore, eliminated from the body principally in the feces as unreabsorbed sterols and bile acids. ABC protein expression increases the amount of sterols present in the gut lumen, with the potential to increase elimination of the sterols into the feces. Patients with a condition known as phytosterolemia (a rare autosomal-recessive disease, also known as sitosterolemia) have a defect in the function of either ABCG5 or ABCG8 in the enterocytes, which leads to accumulation of cholesterol and phytosterols within these cells. These eventually reach the bloodstream, markedly elevating the level of cholesterol and phytosterol in the blood. This accounts for the increased cardiovascular morbidity in individuals with this disorder. From these genetic anomalies, it is clear that agents that either amplify the expression of the ABC proteins within enterocytes or that block cholesterol absorption from the lumen have therapeutic potential in the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia. Ezetimibe is a compound that, although structurally distinct from the sterols, lowers serum cholesterol levels by blocking cholesterol absorption by the enterocyte. The target of ezetimibe is the NiemannPick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1), which is believed to transport cholesterol into cells via an absorptive endocytotic mechanism involving the protein clathrin. The reduction of cholesterol absorption from the intestinal lumen has been shown to reduce blood levels of LDL cholesterol, particularly when used with a drug that also blocks endogenous cholesterol synthesis.

## II. Cholesterol Synthesis

Cholesterol is an alicyclic compound whose basic structure contains four fused rings (Fig. 32.1). In its "free" form, the cholesterol molecule contains several modifications to the basic ring structure (see Fig. 32.1B). Of note is the hydroxyl group at C3. Approximately one-third of plasma cholesterol exists in the free (or unesterified) form. The remaining two-thirds exists as cholesterol esters in which a long-chain fatty acid (usually linoleic acid) is attached by ester linkage to the hydroxyl group at C3 of the A ring. Esterified cholesterol is more hydrophobic than free cholesterol because of this modification. The proportions of free and esterified cholesterol in the blood can be measured using methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

The synthesis of cholesterol, like that of fatty acids, occurs in the cytoplasm and requires significant reducing power, which is supplied in the form of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The NADPH is produced by the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt pathway. All 27 carbons are derived from one precursor, acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA can be obtained from several sources, including the $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids; the oxidation of ketogenic

If less cholesterol is obtained from the diet, then cellular cholesterol synthesis would be upregulated. Thus, ezetimibe has a better chance of reducing whole-body cholesterol levels when endogenous cholesterol synthesis is also inhibited than in the absence of such inhibition.

Anne J.'s serum total and LDL cholesterol levels improved only modestly after 3 months on her revised diet and the statin. Three additional months on a more calorie-restricted heart-healthy diet, limited in saturated and trans fat, brought only a small weight loss, with little further improvement in her lab values.

amino acids, such as leucine and lysine; and the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. Energy is also required, which is provided by the hydrolysis of high-energy thioester bonds of acetyl-CoA and phosphoanhydride bonds of ATP. Cholesterol synthesis occurs in four stages.

## A. Stage 1: Synthesis of Mevalonate from Acetyl-CoA

The first stage of cholesterol synthesis leads to the production of the intermediate mevalonate (Fig. 32.2). The synthesis of mevalonate is the committed, rate-limiting step in cholesterol formation. In this cytoplasmic pathway, two molecules of ace-tyl-CoA condense, forming acetoacetyl-CoA, which then condenses with a third molecule of acetyl-CoA to yield the 6-carbon compound 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA). The HMG-CoA synthase in this reaction is present in the cytosol and is distinct from the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase that catalyses HMG-CoA synthesis involved in production of ketone bodies. The committed step and major point of regulation of cholesterol synthesis in stage 1 involves reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a reaction that is catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). HMGCoA reductase contains eight membrane-spanning domains, and the amino-terminal domain, which faces the cytoplasm, contains the enzymatic activity. The reducing equivalents for this reaction are donated by two molecules of NADPH. The regulation of the activity of HMG-CoA reductase is controlled in multiple ways and is described in Section II.E.

## B. Stage 2: Conversion of Mevalonate to Two Activated Isoprenes

In the second stage of cholesterol synthesis, three phosphate groups are transferred from three molecules of ATP to mevalonate (Fig. 32.3). The purpose of these phosphate transfers is to activate both carbon 5 and the hydroxyl group on carbon 3 for further reactions in which these groups will participate. The phosphate group attached to the C3 hydroxyl group of mevalonate in the 3-phospho-5-pyrophosphomevalonate intermediate is removed along with the carboxyl group on C 1 . This produces a double bond in the 5 -carbon product $\Delta^{5}$-isopentenyl pyrophosphate, the first of two

activated isoprenes that are necessary for the synthesis of cholesterol. The second activated isoprene is formed when $\Delta^{3}$-isopentenyl pyrophosphate is isomerized to dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (see Fig. 32.3). Isoprenes, in addition to being used for cholesterol biosynthesis, are also used in the synthesis of coenzyme Q and dolichol.

# C. Stage 3: Condensation of Six Activated Five-Carbon Isoprenes to Squalene 

The next stage in the biosynthesis of cholesterol involves the head-to-tail condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. The head in

this case refers to the end of the molecule to which pyrophosphate is linked. In this reaction, the pyrophosphate group of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate is displaced, and a 10-carbon chain, known as geranyl pyrophosphate, is generated (Fig. 32.4). Geranyl pyrophosphate then undergoes another head-to-tail condensation with isopentenyl pyrophosphate, resulting in the formation of the 15 -carbon intermediate, farnesyl pyrophosphate. After this, two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate undergo a head-to-head fusion, and both pyrophosphate groups are removed to form squalene, a compound that was first isolated from the liver of sharks (genus Squalus). Squalene contains 30 carbons ( 24 in the main chain and 6 in the methyl group branches; see Fig. 32.4).

Geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate are key components in cholesterol biosynthesis, and both farnesyl and geranyl groups can form covalent bonds with proteins, particularly the G-proteins and certain protooncogene products involved in signal transduction. These hydrophobic groups anchor the proteins in the cell membrane.

# D. Stage 4: Conversion of Squalene to the Steroid Nucleus 

The enzyme squalene monooxygenase adds a single oxygen atom from $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the end of the squalene molecule, forming an epoxide. NADPH then reduces the other oxygen atom of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The unsaturated carbons of the squalene 2,3-epoxide are aligned in a way that allows conversion of the linear squalene epoxide into a cyclic structure. The cyclization leads to the formation of lanosterol, a sterol with

the four-ring structure characteristic of the steroid nucleus. A series of complex reactions, containing many steps and elucidated in the late 1950s, leads to the formation of cholesterol (Fig. 32.5).

## E. Regulation of HMG-CoA Reductase

HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis and, as such, is highly regulated. It is also the target of the statins, which are cholesterollowering drugs. The regulation of the activity of HMG-CoA reductase is controlled in multiple ways, including transcriptional regulation, regulation of the amount of enzyme by proteolysis, and covalent modification.

## I. Transcriptional Regulation

The rate of synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase messenger RNA (mRNA) is controlled by one of the family of sterol-regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) (Fig. 32.6A). These transcription factors belong to the helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHIH-Zip) family of transcription factors that directly activate the expression of $>30$ genes dedicated to the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol, fatty acids, triacylglycerols, and phospholipids as well as the production of the NADPH cofactors required to synthesize these molecules.

SREBPs specifically enhance transcription of the HMG-CoA reductase gene by binding to the sterol-regulatory element (SRE) upstream of the gene. When bound, the rate of transcription is increased. SREBPs, after synthesis, are integral proteins of the ER. The SREBP is bound to SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) in the ER membrane when cholesterol levels are high. When cholesterol levels drop, the sterol leaves its SCAP-binding site, and the SREBP:SCAP complex is transported to the Golgi apparatus. Within the Golgi, two proteolytic cleavages occur (via the site 1 [S1P] and site 2 [S2P] proteases), which release the N -terminal transcription factor domain from the Golgi membrane. Once released, the active amino-terminal component travels to the nucleus to bind to SREs. The soluble SREBPs are rapidly turned over and need to be continuously produced to stimulate reductase mRNA transcription effectively. When cytoplasmic sterol levels rise, the sterols bind to SCAP and prevent translocation of the complex to the Golgi, leading to a decrease in transcription of the reductase gene and thus to less reductase protein being produced.

## 2. Proteolytic Degradation of HMG-CoA Reductase

Rising levels of cholesterol and bile salts in cells that synthesize these molecules also may cause a change in the oligomerization state of the membrane domain of HMGCoA reductase, rendering the enzyme more susceptible to proteolysis (see Fig. 32.6B). This, in turn, decreases its activity. The membrane domains of HMG-CoA reductase contain sterol-sensing regions, which are similar to those in SCAP.

## 3. Regulation by Covalent Modification

In addition to the inductive and repressive influences previously mentioned, the activity of the reductase is also regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (see Fig. 32.6C). Elevated glucagon levels increase phosphorylation of the enzyme, thereby inactivating it, whereas hyperinsulinemia increases the activity of the reductase by activating phosphatases, which dephosphorylate the reductase. Increased levels of intracellular sterols may also increase phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase, thereby reducing its activity as well (feedback suppression). Thyroid hormone also increases enzyme activity, whereas glucocorticoids decrease its activity. The enzyme that phosphorylates HMG-CoA reductase is the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase, which itself is regulated by phosphorylation by one of several AMP-activated protein kinase kinases (one of which is LKB1; see below). Thus, cholesterol synthesis decreases when ATP levels are low and increases when ATP levels are high, similar to what occurs with fatty acid synthesis (recall that

acetyl-CoA carboxylase is also phosphorylated and inhibited by the AMP-activated protein kinase). As has been seen during the discussion of cholesterol biosynthesis, large amounts of ATP are required to synthesize cholesterol, so low energy levels will lead to inhibition of the pathway.

# III. Several Fates of Cholesterol 

Almost all mammalian cells are capable of producing cholesterol. Most of the biosynthesis of cholesterol occurs within liver cells, although the gut, the adrenal cortex, and the gonads (as well as the placenta in pregnant women) also produce significant quantities of the sterol. A fraction of hepatic cholesterol is used for the synthesis of hepatic membranes, but the bulk of synthesized cholesterol is secreted from the hepatocyte as one of three moieties: cholesterol esters, biliary cholesterol (cholesterol found in the bile), or bile acids. Cholesterol ester production in the liver is catalyzed by acyl-CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). ACAT catalyzes the transfer of a fatty acid from coenzyme A to the hydroxyl group on carbon 3 of cholesterol (Fig. 32.7). The liver packages some of the very hydrophobic esterified cholesterol into the hollow core of lipoproteins, primarily VLDL. VLDL is secreted from the hepatocyte into the blood and transports the cholesterol esters (and triacylglycerols, phospholipids, apolipoproteins, etc.) to the tissues that require greater amounts of cholesterol than they can synthesize de novo. These tissues then use the cholesterol for the synthesis of membranes, for the formation of steroid hormones, and for the biosynthesis of vitamin D. The residual cholesterol esters not used in these ways are stored in the liver for later use.

The hepatic cholesterol pool also serves as a source of cholesterol for the synthesis of the relatively hydrophilic bile acids and their salts (see Section IV). These derivatives of cholesterol are very effective detergents because they contain both polar and nonpolar regions. They are introduced into the biliary ducts of the liver. They are stored and concentrated in the gallbladder and later discharged into the gut in response to the ingestion of food. They aid in the digestion of intraluminal lipids by forming micelles with them, which increases the surface area of lipids exposed to the digestive action of intraluminal lipases. Free cholesterol also enters the gut lumen via the biliary tract ( $\sim 1,000 \mathrm{mg}$ daily, which mixes with 300 mg of dietary cholesterol to form an intestinal pool, roughly $55 \%$ of which is resorbed by the enterocytes and enters the bloodstream daily). On a low-cholesterol diet, the liver synthesizes approximately 800 mg of cholesterol per day to replace bile salts and cholesterol lost from the enterohepatic circulation into the feces. Conversely, a greater intake of dietary cholesterol suppresses the rate of hepatic cholesterol synthesis (feedback repression).

# IV. Synthesis of Bile Salts 

## A. Conversion of Cholesterol to Cholic Acid and Chenocholic Acid

Bile salts are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol by reactions that hydroxylate the steroid nucleus and cleave the side chain. In the first and rate-limiting reaction, an $\alpha$-hydroxyl group is added to carbon 7 (on the $\alpha$ side of the B-ring). The activity of the $7 \alpha$-hydroxylase that catalyzes this step is decreased by an increase in bile salt concentration (Fig. 32.8).

In subsequent steps, the double bond in the B-ring is reduced, and an additional hydroxylation may occur. Two different sets of compounds are produced. One set has $\alpha$-hydroxyl groups at positions 3,7 , and 12 and produces the cholic acid series of bile salts. The other set has $\alpha$-hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 7 and produces the chenodeoxycholic acid series (also known as the chenocholic acid series; Fig. 32.9). Three carbons are removed from the side chain by an oxidation reaction. The remaining five-carbon fragment attached to the ring structure contains a carboxyl group (see Fig. 32.9).
![ma894074519f](ma894074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 32.8 The reaction catalyzed by $7 \alpha$-hydroxylase. An $\alpha$-hydroxyl group is formed at position 7 of cholesterol. This reaction, which is inhibited by bile salts, is the rate-limiting step in bile salt synthesis. NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.

![ma904074519f](ma904074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 32.9 Synthesis of bile salts. Two sets of bile salts are generated; one with $\alpha$-hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 7 (the chenodeoxycholate series) and the other with $\alpha$-hydroxyls at positions 3,7 , and 12 (the cholate series). Note how bile salt accumulation will inhibit the initial step of the pathway, catalyzed by $7 \alpha$-hydroxylase.

The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of the bile acids is approximately 6 . Therefore, in the contents of the intestinal lumen, which normally have a pH of 6 , approximately $50 \%$ of the molecules are present in the protonated form and $50 \%$ are ionized, which form bile salts. (The terms bile acids and bile salts are of ten used interchangeably, but bile salts actually refers to the ionized form of the molecules.)

# B. Conjugation of Bile Salts 

The carboxyl group at the end of the side chain of the bile salts is activated by a reaction that requires ATP and coenzyme A. The CoA derivatives can react with either glycine or taurine (which is derived from cysteine), forming amides that are known as conjugated bile salts (Fig. 32.10). In glycocholic acid and glycochenodeoxycholic acid, the bile acids are conjugated with glycine. These compounds have a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of approximately 4 , so compared to their unconjugated forms, a higher percentage of the molecules is present in the ionized form at the pH of the intestine. The taurine conjugates taurocholic acid and taurochenodeoxycholic acid have a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of approximately 2 . Therefore, compared with the glycoconjugates, an even greater percentage of the molecules of these conjugates is ionized in the lumen of the gut.

## C. Fate of the Bile Salts

Bile salts are produced in the liver and secreted into the bile (Fig. 32.11). They are stored in the gallbladder and released into the intestine during a meal, where they serve as detergents that aid in the digestion of dietary lipids (see Chapter 29).

Intestinal bacteria deconjugate and dehydroxylate the bile salts, removing the glycine and taurine residues and the hydroxyl group at position 7. The bile salts that lack a hydroxyl group at position 7 are called secondary bile salts. The deconjugated and dehydroxylated bile salts are less soluble and, therefore, are less readily resorbed from the intestinal lumen than the bile salts that have not been subjected to bacterial action (Fig. 32.12). Lithocholic acid, a secondary bile salt that has a hydroxyl group only at position 3, is the least soluble bile salt. Its major fate is excretion.

Greater than $95 \%$ of the bile salts are resorbed in the ileum and return to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation (via the portal vein; see Fig. 32.11).

![ma914074519f](ma914074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 32.10 Conjugation of bile salts. Conjugation lowers the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of the bile salts, making them better detergents; that is, they are more ionized in the contents of the intestinal lumen ( $\mathrm{pH} \approx 6$ ) than are the unconjugated bile salts ( $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}} \approx 6$ ). The reactions are the same for the chenodeoxycholic acid series of bile salts.

![ma934074519f](ma934074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 32.12 Structures of the primary and secondary bile salts. Primary bile salts form conjugates with taurine or glycine in the liver. After secretion into the intestine, they may be deconjugated and dehydroxylated by the bacterial flora, forming secondary bile salts. Note that dehydroxylation occurs at position 7 , forming the deoxy family of bile salts. Dehydroxylation at position 12 also leads to excretion of the bile salt.

The secondary bile salts may be reconjugated in the liver, but they are not rehydroxylated. The bile salts are recycled by the liver, which secretes them into the bile. This enterohepatic recirculation of bile salts is extremely efficient. Less than $5 \%$ of the bile salts entering the gut are excreted in the feces each day. Because the steroid nucleus cannot be degraded in the body, the excretion of bile salts serves as a major route for removal of the steroid nucleus and thus of cholesterol from the body.

## V. Transport of Cholesterol by the Blood Lipoproteins

Because they are hydrophobic and essentially insoluble in the water of the blood, cholesterol and cholesterol esters, like triacylglycerols and phospholipids, must be transported through the bloodstream packaged as lipoproteins. These macromolecules are water-soluble. Each lipoprotein particle is composed of a core of hydrophobic lipids such as cholesterol esters and triacylglycerols surrounded by a shell of polar lipids (the phospholipids), and a variety of apolipoproteins, which allows a hydration shell to form around the lipoprotein (see Fig. 29.7). This occurs when the positive charge of the nitrogen atom of the phospholipid (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or phosphatidylserine) forms an ionic bond with the negatively charged hydroxyl ion of the environment. The surface bound apolipoproteins also increase the water solubility of the lipoprotein particle. Free cholesterol molecules are dispersed throughout the lipoprotein shell to stabilize it in a way that allows it to maintain its spherical shape. The major carriers of lipids are chylomicrons (see Chapter 29), VLDL, and HDL. Metabolism of VLDL leads to $I D L$ and $L D L$. Metabolism of chylomicrons leads to formation of chylomicron remnants.

Through this carrier mechanism, lipids leave their tissue of origin, enter the bloodstream, and are transported to the tissues, where their components are either used in synthetic or oxidative process or stored for later use. The apolipoproteins ("apo" describes the protein within the shell of the particle in its lipid-free form) not only add to the hydrophilicity and structural stability of the particle, they have other functions as well: (1) They activate certain enzymes required for normal lipoprotein metabolism and (2) they act as ligands on the surface of the lipoprotein that target specific receptors on peripheral tissues that require lipoprotein delivery for their innate cellular functions.

Ten principal apolipoproteins have been characterized. Their tissue sources, molecular mass, distribution within lipoproteins, and metabolic functions are shown in Table 32.3.

The lipoproteins themselves are distributed among eight major classes. Some of their characteristics are shown in Table 32.4. Each class of lipoprotein has a specific function determined by its apolipoprotein content, its tissue of origin, and the proportion of the macromolecule made up of triacylglycerols, cholesterol esters, free cholesterol, and phospholipids (see Tables 32.3 and 32.4).

## A. Chylomicrons

Chylomicrons are the largest of the lipoproteins and the least dense because of their rich triacylglycerol content. They are synthesized from dietary lipids (the exogenous lipoprotein pathway) within the epithelial cells of the small intestine and then secreted into the lymphatic vessels draining the gut (see Fig. 29.11). They enter the bloodstream via the left subclavian vein. The major apolipoproteins of chylomicrons are apolipoprotein B-48 (apoB-48), apoCII, and apoE (see Table 32.3). The apoCII activates LPL, an enzyme that projects into the lumen of capillaries in adipose tissue, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and the acinar cells of mammary tissue. This activation allows LPL to hydrolyze the triacylglycerol of the chylomicrons, leading to the release of free fatty acids. The muscle cells then oxidize the fatty acids as fuel,

while the adipocytes and mammary cells store them as triacylglycerols (fat) or, in the case of the lactating breast, use them for milk formation. The partially hydrolyzed chylomicrons remaining in the bloodstream (the chylomicron remnants), now partly depleted of their core triacylglycerols, have lost their apoCII but still retain their apoE and apoB-48 proteins. Receptors in the plasma membranes of the liver cells bind to apoE on the surface of these remnants, allowing them to be taken up by the liver through a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis (see below).

LDL may be endocytosed by receptor-mediated processes in the liver or in peripheral cells. LDL also may be oxidized and taken up by "scavenger" receptors on macrophages. The scavenger pathway plays a role in atherosclerosis. FA, fatty acids; $P_{\mathrm{i}}$, inorganic phosphate.

# B. Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein 

If dietary intake of carbohydrates exceeds the immediate fuel requirements of the liver, the excess carbohydrates are converted to triacylglycerols, which, along with free and esterified cholesterol, phospholipids, and the major apolipoprotein apoB-100 (see Table 32.3), are packaged to form nascent VLDL. These particles are then secreted from the liver (the "endogenous" pathway of lipoprotein metabolism) into the bloodstream (Fig. 32.13), where they accept apoCII and apoE from circulating HDL particles. This then forms the mature VLDL particle. These particles are then transported from the hepatic veins to capillaries in skeletal and cardiac muscle and adipose tissue, as well as lactating mammary tissues, where LPL is activated by apoCII in the VLDL particles. The activated enzyme facilitates the hydrolysis of the triacylglycerol in VLDL, causing the release of fatty acids and glycerol from a portion of core triacylglycerols. These fatty acids are oxidized as fuel by muscle cells, used in the resynthesis of triacylglycerols in fat cells, and used for milk production in the lactating breast. As the VLDL particles are depleted of triacylglycerol, VLDL remnants are formed. Approximately $50 \%$ of these remnants are taken up from the blood by liver cells through the binding of VLDL apoE to the hepatocyte plasma membrane apoE receptor, followed by endocytic internalization of the VLDL remnant (similar to the fate of the chylomicron remnant).

## C. Intermediate-Density Lipoprotein and Low-Density Lipoprotein

Approximately half of the VLDL remnants are not taken up by the liver but, instead, have additional core triacylglycerols removed to form IDL, a specialized class of VLDL remnants. With the removal of additional triacylglycerols from IDL through

the action of hepatic triglyceride lipase within hepatic sinusoids, LDL is generated from IDL. As can be seen in Table 32.4, the LDL particles are rich in cholesterol and cholesterol esters. Approximately $60 \%$ of the LDL is transported back to the liver, where its apoB-100 binds to specific apoB-100 receptors in the liver cell plasma membranes, allowing particles to be endocytosed into the hepatocyte. The remaining $40 \%$ of LDL particles is carried to extrahepatic tissues such as adrenocortical and gonadal cells that also contain apoB-100 receptors, allowing them to internalize the LDL particles and use their cholesterol for the synthesis of steroid hormones. Some of the cholesterol of the internalized LDL is used for membrane synthesis and vitamin D synthesis as well. If an excess of LDL particles is present in the blood, this specific receptor-mediated uptake of LDL by hepatic and nonhepatic tissue becomes saturated. The "excess" LDL particles are now more readily available for nonspecific uptake of LDL by macrophages (scavenger cells) present near the endothelial cells of arteries. This exposure of vascular endothelial cells to high levels of LDL is believed to induce an inflammatory response by these cells, a process that has been suggested to initiate the complex cascade of atherosclerosis discussed below.

## D. High-Density Lipoprotein

The fourth class of lipoproteins is HDL, which plays several roles in whole-body lipid metabolism.

## I. Synthesis of HDL

HDL particles can be created by several mechanisms. The first is synthesis of nascent HDL by the liver and intestine as a relatively small molecule whose shell, like that of other lipoproteins, contains phospholipids, free cholesterol, and a variety of apolipoproteins, predominant among which are apoA1, apoAII, apoCI, and apoCII (see Table 32.3). Very low levels of triacylglycerols or cholesterol esters are found in the hollow core of this early, or nascent, version of HDL.

A second method for HDL generation is the budding of apolipoproteins from chylomicrons and VLDL particles as they are digested by LPL. The apolipoproteins (particularly apoAI) and shells can then accumulate more lipid, as described below.

A third method for HDL generation is free apoAI, which may be shed from other circulating lipoproteins. The apoAI acquires cholesterol and phospholipids from other lipoproteins and cell membranes, forming a nascent-like HDL particle within the circulation.

## 2. Maturation of Nascent HDL

In the process of maturation, the nascent HDL particles accumulate phospholipids and cholesterol from cells lining the blood vessels. As the central hollow core of nascent HDL progressively fills with cholesterol esters, HDL takes on a more globular shape to eventually form the mature HDL particle. The transfer of lipids to nascent HDL does not require enzymatic activity.

## 3. Reverse Cholesterol Transport

A major benefit of HDL particles derives from their ability to remove cholesterol from cholesterol-laden cells and to return the cholesterol to the liver, a process known as reverse cholesterol transport. This is particularly beneficial in vascular tissue; by reducing cellular cholesterol levels in the subintimal space, the likelihood that foam cells (lipid-laden macrophages that engulf oxidized LDL cholesterol and represent an early stage in the development of atherosclerotic plaque) will form within the blood vessel wall is reduced.

Reverse cholesterol transport requires a directional movement of cholesterol from the cell to the lipoprotein particle. Cells contain the protein ABCA1 (ATPbinding cassette protein 1) that uses ATP hydrolysis to move cholesterol from the inner leaflet of the membrane to the outer leaflet (similar to the efflux of phytosterols by ABCG5 and ABCG8; see Section I of this chapter). Once the cholesterol has

Two genetically determined disorders, familial HDL deficiency and Tangier disease, result from mutations in the ATP-binding cassette I (ABCA1) protein. Cholesteroldepleted HDL cannot transport free cholesterol from cells that lack the ability to express this protein. As a consequence, HDL is rapidly degraded. These disorders have established a role for the ABCAI protein in the regulation of HDL levels in the blood. In both disorders, early-onset coronary artery disease occurs, caused by the low levels of HDL.

Because Anne J. continued to experience intermittent chest pain in spite of good control of her hypertension and a 20-lb weight loss, her physician decided that in addition to seeing a cardiologist to further evaluate the chest pain, a second drug needed to be added to her regimen to further lower her blood LDL cholesterol level. Consequently, treatment with ezetimibe, a drug that blocks cholesterol absorption from the intestine, was added to complement the atorvastatin Anne was already taking.

reached the outer membrane leaflet, the HDL particle can accept it, but if the cholesterol is not modified within the HDL particle, the cholesterol can leave the particle by the same route that it entered. To trap the cholesterol within the HDL core, the HDL particle acquires the enzyme LCAT from the circulation (LCAT is synthesized and secreted by the liver). LCAT catalyzes the transfer of a fatty acid from the 2-position of lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) in the phospholipid shell of the particle to the 3-hydroxyl group of cholesterol, forming a cholesterol ester (Fig. 32.14). The cholesterol ester migrates to the core of the HDL particle and is no longer free to return to the cell.

Elevated levels of lipoprotein-associated cholesterol in the blood, particularly that associated with LDL and also the more triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, are associated with the formation of cholesterol-rich atheromatous plaque in the vessel wall, leading eventually to diffuse atherosclerotic vascular disease that can result in acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or symptomatic peripheral vascular insufficiency. High levels of HDL in the blood, therefore, are believed to be vasculoprotective because these high levels increase the rate of reverse cholesterol transport "away" from the blood vessels and "toward" the liver ("out of harm's way").

## 4. Fate of HDL Cholesterol

Mature HDL particles can bind to specific receptors on hepatocytes (such as the apoE receptor), but the primary means of clearance of HDL from the blood is

through its uptake by the scavenger receptor SR-B1. This receptor is present on many cell types. It does not carry out endocytosis per se, but once the HDL particle is bound to the receptor, its cholesterol and cholesterol esters are transferred into the cells. When depleted of cholesterol and its esters, the HDL particle dissociates from the SR-B1 receptor and reenters the circulation. SR-B1 receptors can be upregulated in certain cell types that require cholesterol for biosynthetic purposes, such as the cells that produce the steroid hormones. The SR-B 1 receptors are not downregulated when cholesterol levels are high.

## 5. HDL Interactions with Other Particles

In addition to its ability to pick up cholesterol from cell membranes, HDL also exchanges apolipoproteins and lipids with other lipoproteins in the blood. For example, HDL transfers apoE and apoCII to chylomicrons and to VLDL. The apoCII stimulates the degradation of the triacylglycerols of chylomicrons and VLDL by activating LPL (Fig. 32.15). After digestion of the chylomicrons and the VLDL triacylglycerols, apoE and apoCII are transferred back to HDL. When HDL obtains free cholesterol from cell membranes, the free cholesterol is esterified at the third carbon of the A-ring via the LCAT reaction (see Fig. 32.13). From this point, HDL either transports the free cholesterol and cholesterol esters directly to the liver, as described previously, or by CETP to circulating triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins such as VLDL and VLDL remnants (see Fig. 32.15). In exchange, triacylglycerols from the latter lipoproteins are transferred to HDL (Fig. 32.16). The greater the concentration of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins in the blood, the greater will be the rate of these exchanges.

The CETP exchange pathway may explain the observation that whenever triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins are present in the blood in high concentrations, the amount of cholesterol reaching the liver via cholesterol-enriched VLDL and VLDL remnants increases, coupled with a proportional reduction in the total amount of

(1)The CETP reaction, under conditions of high levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, generates elevated levels of HDLs, which are less atheroprotective than $\mathrm{HDL}_{2}$. CETP inhibitors are currently being evaluated as a means of increasing $\mathrm{HDL}_{2}$ levels, with limited success. Initial clinical trials of a promising drug was terminated early because of an increased incidence of cardiovascular events when the drug was given in combination with an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Different CETP inhibitors, however, are currently being examined as potential $\mathrm{HDL}_{2}$ elevating agents.

FIGURE 32.15 Functions and fate of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Nascent HDL is synthesized in liver and intestinal cells. It exchanges proteins with chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). HDL picks up cholesterol (C) from cell membranes. This cholesterol is converted to cholesterol ester (CE) by the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) reaction. HDL transfers CE to VLDL in exchange for triacylglycerol (TG).

cholesterol and cholesterol esters that are transferred directly to the liver via HDL. Mature HDL particles are designated as $H D L_{3}$; after reverse cholesterol transport and the accumulation of cholesterol esters, they become the atherogenic protective form, $\mathrm{HDL}_{2}$. The CETP reaction then leads to the loss of cholesterol and gain of triacylglycerol, such that the particles become larger and eventually regenerate $\mathrm{HDL}_{3}$ particles (see Table 32.4). Hepatic lipase can then remove triacylglycerol from $\mathrm{HDL}_{3}$ particles to regenerate $\mathrm{HDL}_{2}$ particles.

## VI. Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis of Lipoproteins

As stated earlier, each lipoprotein particle contains specific apolipoproteins on its surface that act as ligands for specific plasma membrane receptors on target tissues such as the liver, the adrenal cortex, the gonads, and other cells that require one or more of the components of the lipoproteins. With the exception of the scavenger receptor SR-B1, the interaction of ligand and receptor initiates the process of endocytosis shown for LDL in Figure 32.17. The receptors for LDL, for example, are found in specific areas of the plasma membrane of the target cell for circulating lipoproteins. These are known as coated pits, and they contain a unique protein called clathrin. The plasma membrane in the vicinity of the receptor-LDL complex invaginates and fuses to form an endocytic vesicle. These vesicles then fuse with lysosomes, acidic subcellular vesicles that contain several degradative enzymes. The cholesterol esters of LDL are hydrolyzed to form free cholesterol, which is rapidly re-esterified through the action of ACAT. This rapid re-esterification is necessary to avoid the damaging effect of high levels of free cholesterol on cellular membranes.
![ma984074519f](ma984074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 32.17 Cholesterol uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. LDL, low-density lipoprotein.

The newly esterified cholesterol contains primarily oleate or palmitoleate (monounsaturated fatty acids), unlike those of the cholesterol esters in LDL, which are rich in linoleate, a polyunsaturated fatty acid.

As is true for the synthesis and activity of HMG-CoA reductase, the synthesis of the LDL receptor itself is subject to feedback inhibition by increasing levels of cholesterol within the cell. As cholesterol levels increase within a cell, synthesis of the LDL receptor is inhibited. When the intracellular levels of cholesterol decrease, both synthesis of cholesterol from acetyl-CoA and synthesis of the LDL receptor are stimulated. One probable mechanism for this feedback regulation involves one or more of the SREBPs described previously. These proteins or the cofactors that are required for the full expression of genes that code for the LDL receptor are also capable of sensing the concentration of sterols within the cell. When sterol levels are high, the process that leads to the binding of the SREBP to the SRE of these genes is suppressed (see Fig. 32.6A). The rate of synthesis from mRNA for the LDL receptor is diminished under these circumstances. This, in turn, appropriately reduces the amount of cholesterol that can enter these cholesterol-rich cells by receptormediated endocytosis (downregulation of receptor synthesis). When the intracellular levels of cholesterol decrease, these processes are reversed, and cells act to increase their cholesterol levels. Both synthesis of cholesterol from acetyl-CoA and synthesis of LDL receptors are stimulated. An increased number of receptors (upregulation of receptor synthesis) results in an increased uptake of LDL cholesterol from the blood, with a subsequent reduction of LDL cholesterol levels. At the same time, the cellular cholesterol pool is replenished. The upregulation of LDL receptors forms the basis of the mechanism of statin drugs lowering blood LDL levels.

# VII. Lipoprotein Receptors 

The best-characterized lipoprotein receptor, the LDL receptor, specifically recognizes apoB-100 and apoE. Therefore, this receptor binds VLDL, IDL, and chylomicron remnants in addition to LDL. The binding reaction is characterized by its saturability and occurs with high affinity and a narrow range of specificity. Other receptors, such as the LDL receptor-related proteins (LRP) and the macrophage scavenger receptor (notably types SR-A1 and SR-A2, which are located primarily near the endothelial surface of vascular endothelial cells) have broad specificity and bind many other ligands in addition to the blood lipoproteins.

## A. The LDL Receptor

The LDL receptor has a mosaic structure encoded by a gene that was assembled by a process known as exon shuffling. The gene contains 18 exons and is $>45$ kilobases ( kb ) in length; it is located on the short arm of chromosome 19. The protein encoded by the gene is composed of six different regions (Fig. 32.18). The first region, at the amino terminus, contains the LDL-binding region, a cysteinerich sequence of 40 residues. Acidic side chains in this region bind ionic calcium. When these side chains are protonated, calcium is released from its binding sites. This release leads to conformational changes that allow the LDL to dissociate from its receptor docking site. Disulfide bonds, formed from the cysteine residues, have a stabilizing influence on the structural integrity of this portion of the receptor.

The second region of the receptor contains domains that are homologous with epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as with a complex consisting of six repeats that resembles the blades of the transducin $\beta$-subunit, forming a propellerlike moiety.

The third region of the LDL receptor contains a chain of $N$-linked oligosaccharides, whereas the fourth region contains a domain that is rich in serine and threonine and contains $O$-linked sugars. This region may have a role in physically extending the receptor away from the membrane so that the LDL-binding region is accessible to the LDL molecule.

![ma994074519f](ma994074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 32.18 Structure of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. The protein has six major regions, which are described in the text.

The fifth region contains 22 hydrophobic residues that constitute the membranespanning unit of the receptor, whereas the sixth region extends into the cytosol, where it regulates the interaction between the $C$-terminal domain of the LDL receptor and the clathrin-containing coated pit where the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis is initiated.

The number of LDL receptors, the binding of LDL to its receptors, and the postreceptor binding process can be diminished for a variety of reasons, all of which may lead to an accumulation of LDL cholesterol in the blood and premature atherosclerosis. These abnormalities can result from mutations in one (heterozygousseen in approximately 1 in 500 people) or both (homozygous-seen in about 1 in 1 million people) of the alleles for the LDL receptor (familial hypercholesterolemia). Heterozygotes produce approximately half of the normal complement of LDL receptors, whereas the homozygotes produce almost no LDL receptor protein (receptor-negative familial hypercholesterolemia). The latter have serum total cholesterol levels in the range of 500 to $800 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

The genetic mutations are mainly deletions, but insertions or duplications also occur as well as missense and nonsense mutations. Four classes of mutations have been identified. The first class involves "null" alleles that either direct the synthesis of no protein at all or a protein that cannot be precipitated by antibodies to the

LDL receptor. In the second class, the alleles encode proteins, but they cannot be transported to the cell surface. The third class of mutant alleles encodes proteins that reach the cell surface but cannot bind LDL normally. Finally, the fourth class encodes proteins that reach the surface and bind LDL but fail to cluster and internalize the LDL particles. The result of each of these mutations is that blood levels of LDL are elevated because cells cannot take up these particles at a normal rate.

## B. LDL Receptor-Related Protein-I

The LDL receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) is structurally related to the LDL receptor but recognizes a broader spectrum of ligands. LRP-1 is a member of a family of at least 8 proteins, all of which bind multiple ligands and have distinct roles in the cell. In addition to lipoproteins, LRP-1 binds the blood proteins $\alpha_{2}$-macroglobulin (a protein that inhibits blood proteases) and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and its inhibitors. The LRP-1 receptor recognizes the apoE of lipoproteins and binds remnants produced by the digestion of the triacylglycerols of chylomicrons and VLDL by LPL. Thus, one of its functions is believed to be clearing these remnants from the blood. The LRP-1 receptor is abundant in the cell membranes of the liver, brain, and placenta. In contrast to the LDL receptor, synthesis of the LRP-1 receptor is not significantly affected by an increase in the intracellular concentration of cholesterol. However, insulin causes the number of these receptors on the cell surface to increase, consistent with the need to remove chylomicron remnants that otherwise would accumulate after eating a meal.

## C. Macrophage Scavenger Receptor

Some cells, particularly the phagocytic macrophages, have nonspecific receptors known as scavenger receptors that bind various types of molecules, including oxidatively modified LDL particles. There are several different types of scavenger receptors. SR-B1 is used primarily for HDL binding, whereas the scavenger receptors expressed on macrophages are SR-A1 and SR-A2. Modification of LDL frequently involves oxidative damage, particularly of polyunsaturated fatty acyl groups (see Chapter 25). In contrast to the LDL receptors, the scavenger receptors are not subject to downregulation. The continued presence of scavenger receptors in the cell membrane allows the cells to take up oxidatively modified LDL long after intracellular cholesterol levels are elevated. When the macrophages become engorged with lipid, they are called foam cells. An accumulation of these foam cells in the subendothelial space of blood vessels form the earliest gross evidence of a developing atherosclerotic plaque known as a fatty streak.

The processes that cause oxidation of LDL involve superoxide radicals, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, and other oxidants (see Chapter 25). Antioxidants, such as vitamin E, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and carotenoids, may be involved in protecting LDL from oxidation.

## VIII. Anatomic and Biochemical Aspects of Atherosclerosis

The normal artery is composed of three distinct layers (Fig. 32.19). That which is closest to the lumen of the vessel, the intima, is lined by a monolayer of endothelial cells that are bathed by the circulating blood. Just beneath these specialized cells lies the subintimal extracellular matrix, in which some vascular smooth muscle cells are embedded (the subintimal space). The middle layer, known as the tunica media, is separated from the intima by the internal elastic lamina. The tunica media contains lamellae of smooth muscle cells surrounded by an elastin- and collagen-rich matrix. The external elastic lamina forms the border between the tunica media and the outermost layer, the adventitia. This layer contains nerve fibers and mast cells. It is the origin of the vasa vasorum, which supplies blood to the outer two-thirds of the tunica media.

Anne J.'s blood lipid levels ( $\mathrm{n} \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) were as follows:

| Triacylglycerol | 158 |
| :-- | --: |
| Total cholesterol | 420 |
| HDL cholesterol | 32 |
| LDL cholesterol | 356 |

She was diagnosed as having familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), type IIA, which is caused by genetic defects in the gene that encodes the LDL receptor (see Fig 32.18). As a result of the receptor defect, LDL cannot readily be taken up by cells, and its concentration in the blood is elevated.

LDL particles contain a high percentage, by weight, of cholesterol and cholesterol esters, more than other blood lipoproteins. However, LDL triacylglycerol levels are low because LDL is produced by digestion of the triacylglycerols of VLDL and IDL. Therefore, individuals with type IIA hyperlipoproteinemia have very high blood cholesterol levels, but their levels of triacylglycerols may be in or near the normal range (see Table 32.4).

Ivan A.'s blood lipid levels were as follows:

| Triacylglycerol | 295 |
| :-- | --: |
| Total cholesterol | 314 |
| HDL cholesterol | 24 |
| LDL cholesterol | 231 |

The elevated serum levels of LDL cholesterol found in patients such as Ivan A. who have type 2 diabetes mellitus is multifactorial. One of the mechanisms responsible for this increase involves the presence of chronically elevated levels of glucose in the blood of people with poorly controlled diabetes. This prolonged hyperglycemia increases the rate of nonenzymatic attachment of glucose to various proteins in the body, a process referred to as glycation or glycosylation of proteins.

Glycation may adversely affect the structure or the function of the protein involved. For example, glycation of the LDL receptor and of proteins in the LDL particle may interfere with the normal "fit" of LDL particles with their specific receptors. As a result, less circulating LDL is internalized into cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the serum LDL cholesterol level rises. In addition, because $\mathrm{Mr} A$. is obese, he exhibits higher than normal levels of circulating free fatty acids, which the liver uses to increase the synthesis of VLDL, leading to hypertriglyceridemia.

![ma1004074519f](ma1004074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 32.19 The different layers of the arterial wall.

○In addition to nutrition therapy, aimed at reducing her blood cholesterol levels, Anne J. was treated with atorvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors decrease the rate of synthesis of cholesterol in cells. As cellular cholesterol levels decrease, the synthesis of LDL receptors increases. As the number of receptors increase on the cell surface, the uptake of LDL is accelerated. Consequently, the blood level of LDL cholesterol decreases. Anne was also treated with ezetimibe, which blocks cholesterol absorption from the intestinal lumen but has not yet been shown to decrease cardiovascular risk.

HDL is considered to be the "good cholesterol" because it accepts free cholesterol from peripheral tissues, such as cells in the walls of blood vessels. This cholesterol is converted to cholesterol ester, part of which is transferred to VLDL by CETP, and returned to the liver by IDL and LDL. The remainder of the cholesterol is transferred directly as part of the HDL molecule to the liver. The liver reuses the cholesterol in the synthesis of VLDL, converts it to bile salts, or excretes it directly into the bile. HDL, therefore, tends to lower blood cholesterol levels. Lower blood cholesterol levels correlate with lower rates of death caused by atherosclerosis.

The initial step in the development of an atherosclerotic lesion within the wall of an artery is the formation of a fatty streak. The fatty streak represents an accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages or foam cells in the subintimal space. These fatty streaks are visible as a yellow-white linear streak that bulges slightly into the lumen of the vessel. These streaks are initiated when one or more known vascular risk factors for atherosclerosis, all of which have the potential to injure the vascular endothelial cells, reach a critical threshold at the site of future lesions. Examples of such risk factors include elevated intraarterial pressure (arterial hypertension); elevated circulating levels of various lipids such as LDL, chylomicron remnants, and VLDL remnants; low levels of circulating HDL; cigarette smoking; chronic elevations in blood glucose levels; high circulating levels of the vasoconstricting octapeptide angiotensin II; and others. The resulting insult to endothelial cells may trigger these cells to secrete adhesion molecules that bind to circulating monocytes and markedly slow their rate of movement past the endothelium. When these monocytic cells are slowed enough, they accumulate and have access to the physical spaces that exist between endothelial cells. This accumulation of monocytic cells resembles the classical inflammatory response to injury. These changes have led to the suggestion that atherosclerosis is, in fact, an inflammatory disorder and, therefore, is one that might be prevented or attenuated through the use of antiinflammatory agents. Two such agents, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), have been shown to suppress the inflammatory cascade, whereas statins also inhibit the action of HMG-CoA reductase.

The monocytic cells are transformed into macrophages that migrate through the spaces between endothelial cells. They enter the subintimal space under the influence of chemoattractant cytokines (e.g., chemokine macrophage chemoattractant protein I) secreted by vascular cells in response to exposure to oxidatively modified fatty acids within the lipoproteins.

These macrophages can replicate and exhibit augmented expression of receptors that recognize oxidatively modified lipoproteins. Unlike the classic LDL receptors on liver and many nonhepatic cells, these macrophage-bound receptors are high-capacity, low-specificity receptors (scavenger receptors). They bind to and internalize oxidatively modified fatty acids within LDLs to become subintimal foam cells as described previously. As these foam cells accumulate, they deform the overlying endothelium, causing microscopic separations between endothelial cells, exposing these foam cells and the underlying extracellular matrix to the blood. These exposed areas serve as sites for platelet adhesion and aggregation. Activated platelets secrete cytokines that perpetuate this process and increase the potential for thrombus (clot) formation locally. As the evolving plaque matures, a fibrous cap forms over its expanding "roof," which now bulges into the vascular

![ma1014074519f](ma1014074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 32.20 Evolution of an atherosclerotic plaque. Plaque capsule eroded near the "elbow" of plaque creating an early plaque fissure (A), which may heal as plaque increases in size (B) or may grow as thrombus expands, having an intraluminal portion and an intraintimal portion (C). If the fissure is not properly sealed, the thrombus may grow and completely occlude the vessel lumen (D), causing an acute infarction of tissues downstream of the vessel occlusion.
lumen, thereby partially occluding it. Vascular smooth muscle cells now migrate from the tunica media to the subintimal space and secrete additional plaque matrix material. The smooth muscle cells also secrete metalloproteinases that thin the fibrous cap near its "elbow" at the periphery of the plaque. This thinning progresses until the fibrous cap ruptures, allowing the plaque contents to physically contact the procoagulant elements present within the circulation. This leads to acute thrombus formation. If this thrombus completely occludes the remaining lumen of the vessel, an infarction of tissues distal to the occlusion (i.e., an acute myocardial infarction [AMI]) may occur (Fig. 32.20). Most plaques that rupture also contain focal areas of calcification, which appears to result from the induction of the same cluster of genes as those that promote the formation of bone. The inducers for this process include oxidized sterols as well as transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ ) derived from certain vascular cells.

Finally, high intraluminal shear forces develop in these thinning or eroded areas of the plaque's fibrous cap, inducing macrophages to secrete additional metalloproteinases that further degrade the arterial-fibrous cap matrix. This contributes further to plaque rupture and thrombus formation (see Fig. 32.20). The consequence is a macrovascular ischemic event such as an AMI or an acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

## IX. Steroid Hormones

Cholesterol is the precursor of all five classes of steroid hormones: glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, estrogens, and progestogens. These hormones are synthesized in the adrenal cortex, ovaries, testes, and ovarian corpus luteum. Steroid hormones are transported through the blood from their sites of synthesis

(1)In patients such as Anne $\mathbf{J}$. and Ivan $\mathbf{A}$. who have elevated levels ofVLDL or LDL. HDL levels are often low. These patients are predisposed to atherosclerosis and suffer from a high incidence of heart attacks and strokes.

Physical activity and estrogen administration both increase HDL levels. This is one of the reasons physical activity is often recommended to aid in the prevention or treatment of heart disease. Prior to menopause, the incidence of heart attacks is relatively low in women, but it rises after menopause and increases to the level found in men by the age of 65 or 70 years. Moderate consumption of ethanol (alcohol) has also been correlated with increased HDL levels. Recent studies suggest that the beneficial amount of ethanol may be quite low, about two small glasses of wine a day, and that beneficial effects ascribed to ethanol may result from other components of wine and alcoholic beverages. In spite of the evidence that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) decreases circulating levels of LDL and increases HDL levels, data from controlled trials show that HRT may actually increase the rate of atherosclerotic vascular disease in these women. As a result, the accepted indications for estrogen administration are now limited to intolerable "hot flashes" or vaginal dryness.

(2)Studies on LDL-receptor metabolism have recently identified a new potential drug target in order to increase LDL receptor expression on the cell surface. A protease with the cumbersome name of proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has been shown to regulate the levels of LDL receptor on the cell surface. PCSK9 does so by degrading the receptor; thereby reducing its expression on the cell surface. Humans with familial hypercholesterolemia have been identified with gain of function mutations in PCSK9; the protease is always active, reduces LDL receptor levels, and hypercholesterolemia results. Conversely, individuals have been identified with nonfunctional variants of PCSK9; their LDL levels are extremely low, and in population studies this group is much less likely to experience atherosclerotic disease than those with functional PCSK9. Recall that statins work, in part, by the activation of SREBP-2, which upregulates LDL receptor synthesis. SREBP-2 also upregulates PCSK9, which aids in regulating LDL receptor expression. Clinical trials using monoclonal antibodies directed against PCSK9, given in conjunction with a statin, showed a significant lowering of circulating LDL levels.

Lipoprotein(a) is essentially an LDL particle that is covalently bound to apolipoprotein(a). It is called lipoprotein little a to avoid confusion with the apolipoprotein A found in HDL. The structure of apolipoprotein(a) is very similar to that of plasminogen, a precursor of the protease plasmin that degrades fibrin, a major component of blood clots. Lipoprotein(a), however, cannot be converted to active plasmin. There are reports that high concentrations of lipoprotein(a) correlate with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, even in patients in whom the lipid profile is otherwise normal. The physiologic function of lipoprotein(a) remains elusive.

to their target organs, where, because of their hydrophobicity, they cross the cell membrane and bind to specific receptors in either the cytoplasm or the nucleus. The bound receptors then bind to DNA to regulate gene transcription (see Chapter 16, Section III.C.2, and Fig. 16.12). Because of their hydrophobicity, steroid hormones must be complexed with a serum protein. Serum albumin can act as a nonspecific carrier for the steroid hormones, but there are specific carriers as well. The cholesterol used for steroid hormone synthesis is either synthesized in the tissues from acetyl-CoA, extracted from intracellular cholesterol ester pools, or taken up by the cell in the form of cholesterol-containing lipoproteins (either internalized by the LDL receptor or absorbed by the SR-B1 receptor). In general, glucocorticoids and progestogens contain 21 carbons, androgens contain 19 carbons, and estrogens contain 18 carbons. The specific complement of enzymes present in the cells of an organ determines which hormones the organ can synthesize.

## A. Overview of Steroid Hormone Synthesis

The biosynthesis of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (in the adrenal cortex), and that of sex steroids (in the adrenal cortex and gonads), requires several distinct cytochrome P450 enzymes (see Chapter 25 and Table 32.5). These monooxygenases are involved in the transfer of electrons from NADPH through electron-transfer protein intermediates to molecular oxygen, which then oxidizes a variety of the ring carbons of cholesterol.

Cholesterol is converted to progesterone in the first two steps of the synthesis of all steroid hormones. Cytochrome P450 ${ }_{\text {SCC }}$ side-chain cleavage enzyme (previously referred to as cholesterol desmolase and classified as CYP11A) is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and removes six carbons from the side chain of cholesterol, forming pregnenolone, which has 21 carbons (Fig. 32.21). The next step,

the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone, is catalyzed by $3 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, an enzyme that is not a member of the cytochrome P450 family. Other steroid hormones are produced from progesterone by reactions that involve members of the P450 family. These include the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 11}$ (CYP11B1), which catalyzes $\beta$-hydroxylation at carbon 11, and two ER enzymes, $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 17}$ ( $17 \alpha$-hydroxylation, CYP17) and $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 21}$ (hydroxylation at carbon 21, CYP21). As the synthesis of the steroid hormones is discussed, notice how certain enzymes are used in more than one pathway. Defects in these enzymes lead to multiple abnormalities in steroid synthesis, which, in turn, results in a variety of abnormal phenotypes.

# B. Synthesis of Cortisol 

The adrenocortical biosynthetic pathway that leads to cortisol synthesis occurs in the middle layer of the adrenal cortex, known as the zona fasciculata. Free cholesterol is transported by an intracellular carrier protein to the inner mitochondrial membrane of cells (Fig. 32.22), where the side chain is cleaved to form pregnenolone. Pregnenolone returns to the cytosol, where it forms progesterone.

In the membrane of the ER, the enzyme $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 17}$ (CYP17) catalyzes the hydroxylation of C17 of progesterone or pregnenolone and can also catalyze the cleavage
![ma1034074519f](ma1034074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 32.22 Cellular route for cortisol synthesis. Cholesterol is synthesized from acetyl coenzyme A or derived from low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is endocytosed and digested by lysosomal enzymes. Cholesterol is stored in cells of the adrenal cortex as cholesterol esters. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) signals the cell to convert cholesterol to cortisol and transmits its signal through a G-protein-coupled receptor that results in the activation of adenylate cyclase, and, ultimately, protein kinase A. (I) cholesterol desmolase ( $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{SCC}}$, involved in side-chain cleavage); (2) $3 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; (3) $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase ( $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 17}$ ); (4) 21-hydroxylase ( $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 21}$ ); (5) $1 \mathrm{I} \beta$-hydroxylase ( $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 11}$ ). cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

of the two-carbon side chain of these compounds at C17 (a C17-C20 lyase activity), which forms androstenedione from $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone. These two separate functions of the same enzyme allow further steroid synthesis to proceed along two separate pathways: The 17-hydroxylated steroids that retain their side chains are precursors of cortisol (C21), whereas those from which the side chain was cleaved (C19 steroids) are precursors of androgens (male sex hormones) and estrogens (female sex hormones).

In the pathway of cortisol synthesis, the 17-hydroxylation of progesterone yields $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone, which, along with progesterone, is transported to the smooth ER. There, the membrane-bound $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 21}$ (CYP21, $21 \alpha$-hydroxylase) complex catalyzes the hydroxylation of C 21 of $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone to form 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone to form deoxycorticosterone (DOC), a precursor of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone (see Fig. 32.21).

The final step in cortisol synthesis requires transport of 11-deoxycortisol back to the inner membrane of the mitochondria, where $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 11}$ ( $11 \beta$-hydroxylase, CYP11B1) catalyzes the $\beta$-hydroxylation of the substrate at carbon 21 , in a reaction that requires molecular oxygen and electrons derived from NADPH, to form cortisol. The rate of biosynthesis of cortisol and other adrenal steroids depends on stimulation of the adrenal cortical cells by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).

## C. Synthesis of Aldosterone

The synthesis of the potent mineralocorticoid aldosterone in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex also begins with the conversion of cholesterol to progesterone (see Figs. 32.21 and 32.22). Progesterone is then hydroxylated at C21, a reaction catalyzed by $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 21}$ (CYP21), to yield 11-DOC. The $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 11}$ (CYP11B1) enzyme system then catalyzes the reactions that convert DOC to corticosterone. The terminal steps in aldosterone synthesis, catalyzed by the P450 aldosterone system (CYP11B2), involve the oxidation of corticosterone to 18-hydroxycorticosterone, which is oxidized to aldosterone.

The primary stimulus for aldosterone production is the octapeptide angioten$\sin$ II, although hyperkalemia (greater than normal levels of potassium in the blood) or hyponatremia (less than normal levels of sodium in the blood) may stimulate aldosterone synthesis directly as well. ACTH has a permissive action in aldosterone production. It allows cells to respond optimally to their primary stimulus, angiotensin II.

## D. Synthesis of the Adrenal Androgens

Adrenal androgen biosynthesis proceeds from cleavage of the two-carbon side chain of 17-hydroxypregnenolone at C 17 to form the 19-carbon adrenal androgen DHEA and its sulfate derivative (DHEAS) in the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex (see Fig. 32.21). These compounds, which are weak androgens, represent a significant percentage of the total steroid production by the normal adrenal cortex and are the major androgens synthesized in the adrenal gland.

Androstenedione, another weak adrenal androgen, is produced by oxidation of the $\beta$-hydroxy group to a carbonyl group by $3 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. This androgen is converted to testosterone primarily in extraadrenal tissues. Although the adrenal cortex makes very little estrogen, the weak adrenal androgens may be converted to estrogens in the peripheral tissues, particularly in adipose tissue (Fig. 32.23).

## E. Synthesis of Testosterone

Luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary stimulates the synthesis of testosterone and other androgens by the Leydig cells of the human testicle. In many ways, the pathways leading to androgen synthesis in the testicle are

Hyperplasia or tumors of the adrenal cortex that produce excess aldosterone result in a condition known as primary aldosteronism, which is characterized by enhanced sodium and water retention, resulting in hypertension.

Although aldosterone is the major mineralocorticoid in humans, excessive production of a weaker mineralocorticoid, DOC, which occurs in patients with a deficiency of the II-hydroxylase (the $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 1}$ enzyme, CYP11B1), may lead to clinical signs and symptoms of mineralocorticoid excess even though aldosterone secretion is suppressed in these patients.
![ma1044074519f](ma1044074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 32.23 Adrenal androgens. These weak androgens are converted to testosterone or estrogens in other tissues.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of diseases caused by a genetically determined deficiency in a variety of enzymes required for cortisol synthesis. The most common deficiency is that of $21 \alpha$-hydroxylase (CYP2I), the activity of which is necessary to convert progesterone to II-DOC and $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone to II-deoxycortisol. Thus, this deficiency reduces both aldosterone and cortisol production without affecting androgen production. If the enzyme deficiency is severe, the precursors for aldosterone and cortisol production are shunted to androgen synthesis, producing an overabundance of androgens, which leads to prenatal masculinization in females and postnatal virilization of males. Another enzyme deficiency in this group of diseases is that of II $\beta$-hydroxylase (CYPIIB1), which results in the accumulation of II-DOC. An excess of this mineralocorticoid leads to hypertension (through binding of II-DOC to the aldosterone receptor). In this form of CAH, II-deoxycortisol also accumulates, but its biologic activity is minimal, and no specific clinical signs and symptoms result. The androgen pathway is unaffected, and the increased ACTH levels may increase the levels of adrenal androgens in the blood. A third possible enzyme deficiency is that of $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase (CYP17). A defect in $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase leads to aldosterone excess and hypertension; however, because adrenal androgen synthesis requires this enzyme, no virilization occurs in these patients.

Biologically, the most potent circulating androgen is testosterone. Approximately $50 \%$ of the testosterone in the blood in a normal woman is produced equally in the ovaries and in the adrenal cortices. The remaining half is derived from ovarian and adrenal androstenedione, which, after secretion into the blood, is converted to testosterone in adipose tissue, muscle, liver, and skin. The adrenal cortex, however, is the major source of the relatively weak androgen DHEA. The serum concentration of its stable metabolite, DHEAS, is used as a measure of adrenal androgen production in hyperandrogenic patients with diffuse excessive growth of secondary sexual hair (e.g., facial hair as well as that in the axillae, the suprapubic area, the chest, and the upper extremities).

The results of the blood tests on Vera L. showed that her level of testosterone was normal but that her serum DHEAS level was significantly elevated. Which tissue was the most likely source of the androgens that caused Vera's hirsutism (a male pattern of secondary sexual hair growth)?
similar to those described for the adrenal cortex. In the human testicle, the predominant pathway leading to testosterone synthesis is through pregnenolone to $17 \alpha$-hydroxypregnenolone to DHEA (the $\Delta^{2}$ pathway), and then from DHEA to androstenedione, and from androstenedione to testosterone (see Fig. 32.21). As for all steroids, the rate-limiting step in testosterone production is the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. LH controls the rate of side-chain cleavage from cholesterol at carbon 21 to form pregnenolone and thus regulates the rate of testosterone synthesis. In its target cells, the double bond in ring A of testosterone is reduced through the action of $5 \alpha$-reductase, forming the active hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

## F. Synthesis of Estrogens and Progesterone

Ovarian production of estrogens, progestogens (compounds related to progesterone), and androgens requires the activity of the cytochrome P450 family of oxidative enzymes used for the synthesis of other steroid hormones. Ovarian estrogens are C 18 steroids with a phenolic hydroxyl group at C 3 and either a hydroxyl group (estradiol) or a ketone group (estrone) at C17. Although the major steroid-producing compartments of the ovary (the granulosa cell, the theca cell, the stromal cell, and the cells of the corpus luteum) have all of the enzyme systems required for the synthesis of multiple steroids, the granulosa cells secrete primarily estrogens, the thecal and stromal cells secrete primarily androgens, and the cells of the corpus luteum secrete primarily progesterone.

The ovarian granulosa cell, in response to stimulation by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland and through the catalytic activity of P450 aromatase (CYP19), converts testosterone to estradiol, the predominant and most potent of the ovarian estrogens (see Fig. 32.21). Similarly, androstenedione is converted to estrone in the ovary, although the major site of estrone production from androstenedione occurs in extraovarian tissues, principally skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.

## G. Vitamin D Synthesis

Vitamin D is unique in that it can be either obtained from the diet (as vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ ) or synthesized from a cholesterol precursor, a process that requires reactions in the skin, liver, and kidney. The calciferols, including several forms of vitamin D, are a family of steroids that affect calcium homeostasis (Fig. 32.24). Cholecalciferol (vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ ) requires ultraviolet light for its production from 7-dehydrocholesterol, which is present in cutaneous tissues (skin) in animals and available from ergosterol in plants. This irradiation cleaves the carbon-carbon bond at $\mathrm{C} 9-\mathrm{C} 10$, opening the B-ring to form cholecalciferol, an inactive precursor of $1,25-(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$-cholecalciferol (calcitriol). Calcitriol is the most potent biologically active form of vitamin D (see Fig. 32.24).

The formation of calcitriol from cholecalciferol begins in the liver and ends in the kidney, where the pathway is regulated. In this activation process, carbon 25 of vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ is hydroxylated in the microsomes of the liver to form 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcidiol). Calcidiol circulates to the kidney bound to vitamin D-binding globulin (transcalciferin). In the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, a mixed-function oxidase, which requires molecular $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and NADPH as cofactors, hydroxylates carbon 1 on the A-ring to form calcitriol. This step is tightly regulated and is the rate-limiting step in the production of the active hormone. The release of parathyroid hormone from the parathyroid gland results in activation of this last step of active hormone formation.
$1,25-(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}_{3}$ (calcitriol) is approximately 100 times more potent than $25-(\mathrm{OH})$ $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ in its actions, yet $25-(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{D}_{3}$ is present in the blood in a concentration that may be 100 times greater, which suggests that it may play some role in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.

The biologically active forms of vitamin D are sterol hormones and, like other steroids, diffuse passively through the plasma membrane. In the intestine, bone, and kidney, the sterol then moves into the nucleus and binds to specific vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ receptors. This complex activates genes that encode proteins mediating the action of active vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{3}$. In the intestinal mucosal cell, for example, transcription of genes that encode calcium-transporting proteins are activated. These proteins are capable of carrying $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (and phosphorus) absorbed from the gut lumen across the cell, making it available for eventual passage into the circulation.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Anne $\mathbf{J}$. is typical of patients with essentially normal serum triacylglycerol levels and elevated serum total cholesterol levels that are repeatedly in the upper $1 \%$ of the general population (e.g., 325 to $500 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). When similar lipid abnormalities are present in other family members in a pattern of auto-somal-dominant inheritance and no secondary causes for these lipid alterations (e.g., hypothyroidism) are present, the entity referred to as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), type IIA, is the most likely cause of this hereditary dyslipidemia.

FH is a genetic disorder caused by an abnormality in one or more alleles responsible for the formation or the functional integrity of high-affinity LDL receptors on the plasma membrane of cells that normally initiate the internalization of circulating LDL and other blood lipoproteins. Heterozygotes for FH (1 in 500 of the population) have roughly one-half of the normal complement or functional capacity of such receptors, whereas homozygotes ( 1 in 1 million of the population) have essentially no functional LDL receptors. The rare patient with the homozygous form of FH has a more extreme elevation of serum total and LDL cholesterol than does the heterozygote and, as a result, has a more profound predisposition to premature coronary artery disease.

Chronic hypercholesterolemia not only may cause the deposition of lipid within vascular tissues leading to atherosclerosis but also may cause the deposition of lipid within the skin and eye. When this occurs in the medial aspect of the upper and lower eyelids, it is referred to as xanthelasma. Similar deposits known as xanthomas may occur in the iris of the eye (arcus lipidalis) as well as the tendons of the hands ("knuckle pads") and Achilles tendons.

Although therapy aimed at inserting competent LDL receptor genes into the cells of patients with homozygous FH is being designed for the future, the current approach in the treatment of heterozygotes is to attempt to increase the rate of synthesis of LDL receptors in cells pharmacologically.

In addition to a HMG-CoA inhibitor, Anne $\mathbf{J}$. was treated with ezetimibe, to achieve the recommended decrease in her LDL. Ezetimibe blocks cholesterol absorption in the intestine, causing a portion of the dietary cholesterol to be carried into the feces rather than packaged into chylomicrons. This reduces the levels of chylomicronbased cholesterol and cholesterol delivered to the liver by chylomicron remnants.

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, such as atorvastatin, which Anne is also taking, stimulate the synthesis of additional LDL receptors by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. The subsequent decline in the intracellular free cholesterol pool stimulates the synthesis of additional LDL receptors. These additional receptors reduce circulating LDL cholesterol levels by increasing receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL particles.

A combination of strict dietary and dual pharmacologic therapy, aimed at decreasing the cholesterol levels of the body, is usually quite effective in correcting the lipid abnormality and, hopefully, the associated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients with heterozygous FH .

PTH, parathyroid hormone.

Anne J. was treated with a statin (atorvastatin) and ezetimibe. Ezetimibe reduces the percentage of absorption of free cholesterol present in the lumen of the gut and hence the amount of cholesterol available to the enterocyte to package into chylomicrons. This, in turn, reduces the amount of cholesterol returning to the liver in chylomicron remnants. The net result is a reduction in the cholesterol pool in hepatocytes. The latter induces the synthesis of an increased number of LDL receptors by the liver cells. As a consequence, the capacity of the liver to increase hepatic uptake of LDL from the circulation leads to a decrease in serum LDL levels. Despite this decrease in LDL levels, the drug has not been shown to decrease cardiovascular events in patients.
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Similar evidence for raising subnormal levels of serum HDL cholesterol is less conclusive but adequate to support such efforts, particularly in high-risk patients, such as Ivan A., who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors.

So far, Mr. A. has failed in his attempts to reach his diet and physical activity goals. His LDL cholesterol level is $231 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Based on his cardiovascular risk, he is a candidate for drug treatment. He should be given a high-intensity HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. A low daily dose of aspirin ( 81 mg ) could also be prescribed (see Chapter 31). It is important to gain early control of Mr. A.'s metabolic syndrome before the effects of insulin resistance can no longer be reversed. Various lipid-lowering agents are summarized in Table 32.6.

Vera L. Vera L. was born with a normal female genotype and phenotype, had normal female sexual development, spontaneous onset of puberty, and regular, although somewhat scanty, menses until the age of 20 years. At that point, she developed secondary amenorrhea (cessation of menses) and evidence of male hormone excess with early virilization (masculinization).

The differential diagnosis included an ovarian versus an adrenocortical source of the excess androgenic steroids. A screening test to determine whether the adrenal cortex or the ovary is the source of excess male hormone involves measuring the concentration of DHEAS in the patient's plasma because the adrenal cortex makes most of the DHEA and the ovary makes little or none. Vera's plasma DHEAS level was moderately elevated, identifying her adrenal cortices as the likely source of her virilizing syndrome.

If the excess production of androgens is not the result of an adrenal tumor, but rather the result of a defect in the pathway for cortisol production, the simple treatment is to administer glucocorticoids by mouth. The rationale for such treatment can be better understood by reviewing Figure 32.21. If Vera L. has a genetically determined partial deficiency in the $\mathrm{P} 450_{\mathrm{C} 11}$ enzyme system needed to convert 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, her blood cortisol levels would fall. By virtue of the normal positive feedback mechanism, a subnormal level of cortisol in the blood would induce the anterior pituitary to make more ACTH. The latter would

not only stimulate the cortisol pathway to increase cortisol synthesis to normal but, in the process, would also induce increased production of adrenal androgens such as DHEA and DHEAS. The increased levels of the adrenal androgens (although relatively weak androgens) would cause varying degrees of virilization, depending on the severity of the enzyme deficiency. The administration of a glucocorticoid by mouth would suppress the high level of secretion of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland that occurs in response to the reduced levels of cortisol secreted from the adrenal cortex. Treatment with prednisone (a synthetic glucocorticoid), therefore, will prevent the ACTH-induced overproduction of adrenal androgens. However, when ACTH secretion returns to normal, endogenous cortisol synthesis falls below normal. The administered prednisone brings the net glucocorticoid activity in the blood back to physiologic levels. Vera's adrenal androgen levels in the blood returned to normal after several weeks of therapy with prednisone (a synthetic glucocorticoid). As a result, her menses eventually resumed and her virilizing features slowly resolved.

Because Vera's symptoms began in adult life, her genetically determined adrenal hyperplasia is referred to as a nonclassic or atypical form of the disorder. A more severe enzyme deficiency leads to the "classic" disease, which is associated with excessive fetal adrenal androgen production in utero and manifests at birth, often with ambiguous external genitalia and virilizing features in the female neonate.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Drugs used to treat certain aspects of the metabolic syndrome improve insulin sensitivity and regulate lipid levels through modulation of the pathways discussed in Chapters 29 through 32. These drugs work by modifying the regulatory pathways that have been discussed so far with regard to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.

Metformin. Metformin has been used for more than 30 years as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Metformin reduces blood glucose levels by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis, which is active in these patients because of the liver's resistance to the effects of insulin. Metformin also reduces lipid synthesis in the liver, which aids in modulating blood lipid levels in these patients.

Metformin accomplishes its effects by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). It does so through activation of an upstream protein kinase, LKB1, via an unknown mechanism. As has been discussed previously, AMPK, when active, phosphorylates and reduces the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (required for fatty acid synthesis) and HMG-CoA reductase (reducing the biosynthesis of cholesterol). Activation of AMPK also activates glucose uptake by the muscle (see Chapter 45), which is significant for reducing circulating blood glucose levels.

The activation of AMPK also leads to a cascade of transcriptional regulation that reduces the liver's ability to undergo both gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. Activated AMPK phosphorylates a coactivator of the CREB transcription factor named transducer of regulated CREB activity 2 (TORC2) (Fig. 32.25). When TORC2 is phosphorylated, it is sequestered in the cytoplasm, and CREB becomes very inefficient at transcribing a gene that is required to upregulate genes that code for the enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. This important transcriptional coactivator is named peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- $\gamma$ coactivator $1 \alpha$ (PGC1 $\alpha$ ). PGC1 $\alpha$ participates in the transcriptional activation of key gluconeogenic enzymes, such as glucose 6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Thus, in the presence of metformin, hepatic gluconeogenesis is reduced and muscle uptake of blood glucose is enhanced, leading to stabilization of blood glucose levels. The physiologic regulators of LKB1 have yet to be identified.

Activation of AMPK also inhibits liver lipogenesis. In addition to phosphorylating and inhibiting acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity (which reduces malonyl-CoA

The LKB1 protein is a tumor suppressor; loss of LKB1 activity leads to PeutJeghers syndrome (PJS). PJS exhibits the early development of hamartomatous polyps (benign polyps) in the gastrointestinal tract and an increased incidence of carcinomas at a relatively young age. LKB1 regulates the activity of 14 kinases that include, and are similar to, the AMPK. Loss of the normal regulation of these kinases, because of the absence of LKB1 activity, significantly contributes to tumor formation.

FIGURE 32.25 Action of metformin on gluconeogenesis. Under normal conditions, increases of hepatic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels (e.g., in response to glucagon) activate cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which, in combination with transducer of regulated CREB activity 2 (TORC2), leads to increased transcription of genes required for gluconeogenesis. Under conditions of insulin resistance this pathway remains stimulated, even in the presence of insulin. Metformin stimulates the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates TORC2 and sequesters it in the cytoplasm, thereby decreasing synthesis of gluconeogenic enzymes and reducing hepatic output of glucose. The abbreviations used are defined in the text. PGC1 $\alpha$, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- $\gamma$ coactivator $1 \alpha$.
levels, leading to reduced fatty acid synthesis and enhanced fatty acid oxidation), AMPK activity decreases the transcription of key lipogenic enzymes, including fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The reduced transcriptional activity is mediated via an AMPK inhibition of the transcription of SREBP-1, which in addition to regulating the transcription of HMG-CoA reductase, also regulates the transcription of other lipogenic enzymes. The AMPK is discussed in more detail in the "Biochemical Comments" section of Chapter 34.

Fibrates. The fibrates are a class of drugs used to decrease lipid levels (principally triglycerides) in patients. A major target of the fibrates is peroxisome proliferator activated receptor- $\alpha$ (PPAR $\alpha$ ). Fibrate binding to PPAR $\alpha$ activates this transcription factor, which then leads to the transcription of a multitude of genes that degrade lipids. These targets include the genes for fatty acid transport proteins (so there is an enhanced rate of fatty acid transport into cells), fatty acid translocase (to increase mitochondrial uptake of the fatty acids), longchain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (activation of the fatty acids in the cytoplasm), and carnitine-palmitoyltransferase I (which enhances the uptake of fatty acids into the mitochondria). In addition, PPAR $\alpha$ activation enhances LPL expression, represses apoCIII expression (apoCIII inhibits the apoCII activation of LPL), and stimulates apoAI and apoAII synthesis, the major proteins in HDL. These transcriptional changes all lead to enhanced fat use and a reduction of circulating lipoprotein particles.

Thiazolidinediones. A third class of drugs used for the treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus is the thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which activate the PPAR $\gamma$ class of transcription factors. PPAR $\gamma$ is expressed primarily in adipose tissue. This transcription factor is responsible for activating the transcription of adiponectin (see Chapter 31, Section VIII.B), leading to increased circulating adiponectin levels. The increase in adiponectin reduces the fat content of the liver and enhances insulin sensitivity via an AMPK-dependent pathway. Thiazolidinediones also lead to a reduction in plasma free fatty acid levels, which leads to enhanced insulin sensitivity (see the "Biochemical Comments" in Chapter 31).

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Cholesterol regulates membrane fluidity and is a precursor of bile salts, steroid hormones (such as estrogen and testosterone), and vitamin D.
- Cholesterol, because of its hydrophobic nature, is transported in the blood as a component of lipoproteins.
- Within the lipoproteins, cholesterol can appear in its unesterified form in the outer shell of the particle or as cholesterol esters in the core of the particle.
- De novo cholesterol synthesis requires acetyl-CoA as a precursor, which is initially converted to HMG-CoA. The cholesterol synthesized in this way is packaged, along with triglyceride, into VLDL in the liver and then released into circulation.
- The conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid, catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase, is the regulated and rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis.
- In the circulation, the triglycerides in VLDL are digested by lipoprotein lipase, which converts the particle to IDL and then to LDL.
- IDL and LDL bind specifically to receptors on the liver cell, are internalized, and the particle components are recycled.
- A third lipoprotein particle, HDL, functions to transfer apolipoprotein E and apolipoprotein CII to nascent chylomicrons and nascent VLDL.
- HDL also participates in reverse cholesterol transport, the movement of cholesterol from cell membranes to the HDL particle, which returns the cholesterol to the liver.
- Atherosclerotic plaques are associated with elevated levels of blood cholesterol levels. High levels of LDL are more strongly associated with the generation of atherosclerotic plaques, whereas high levels of HDL are protective because of their participation in reverse cholesterol transport.
- Bile salts are required for fat emulsification and micelle formation in the small intestine.
- Bile salts are recycled via the enterohepatic circulation, forming the secondary bile acids in the process.
- The steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol, which is converted to pregnenolone, which is the precursor for the mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone), the glucocorticoids (such as cortisol), and the sex steroids (such as testosterone and estrogen).
- Lipid-lowering drugs act on a variety of targets within liver, intestine, and adipocytes.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 32.7.

B. Intestinal bacteria conjugate bile salts.
C. ATP and coenzyme Q conjugate bile salts.
D. ATP and coenzyme A deconjugate bile salts.
E. Enterohepatic circulation occurs at $100 \%$ efficiency.

1. The answer is B. The statins inhibit the enzyme HMGCoA reductase, which reduces HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. Therefore, HMG-CoA would be the metabolite that accumulates. The pathway is initiated with acetyl-CoA, which then forms acetoacetyl-CoA and then HMG-CoA. The HMG-CoA is reduced to mevalonic acid, which is then converted to isoprene units, to farnesyl units, geranyl units, and finally to squalene, which is converted to cholesterol.
2. The answer is C. Cholesterol is absolutely insoluble in water (it is very hydrophobic). It is a precursor of both the bile acids and the steroid hormones. Precursors of cholesterol are converted to ubiquinone, dolichol, and cholecalciferol (the active form of vitamin D). Cholesterol can appear unesterified in the outer shell of lipoproteins but as cholesterol esters in the core of such particles. Malonyl-CoA is the precursor of fatty acids; acetyl-CoA is the precursor for all the cholesterol carbons.
3. The answer is D. Total cholesterol is equal to the lipoproteins that carry it because cholesterol cannot freely float in blood serum. The total cholesterol would then be composed of the cholesterol content of HDL, VLDL, and LDL. Under fasting conditions, taking the triglyceride concentration and dividing it by 5 can estimate the cholesterol content of VLDL. Thus, for this patient, the HDL is $35 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, and the VLDL is $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. The total cholesterol is $400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, indicating that the calculated LDL cholesterol is $400-75$, or $325 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.
4. The answer is B. ApoCIII appears to inhibit the activation of LPL. ApoE acts as a ligand in binding several lipoproteins to the LDL receptor, the LRP, and possibly to a separate apoE receptor. ApoB-48 is required for the normal assembly and secretion of chylomicrons from the small bowel, whereas apoB-100 is required in the liver for the assembly and secretion of VLDL. ApoCII is the activator of LPL.
5. The answer is B. Because chylomicrons contain the most triacylglycerol, they are the least dense of the blood lipoproteins. Because VLDL contains more protein, it is denser than chylomicrons. Because LDL is produced by degradation of the triacylglycerol in VLDL, LDL is denser than VLDL. HDL is the densest of the blood lipoproteins. It has the most protein and the least triacylglycerol.
6. The answer is C. MTP is required for the synthesis of nascent chylomicrons and VLDL. In the intestine, the lack of MTP activity leads to an accumulation of lipid in the intestinal epithelial, such that further lipid is not transported in from the lumen. This leads to elevated lipid content in the stools, which is manifest as steatorrhea. As MTP is also needed for VLDL production, VLDL levels will drop, as will IDL and LDL levels, because they are derived from VLDL.
7. The answer is D. Statins directly inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, thereby reducing endogenous cholesterol synthesis in the tissues. As the cell becomes "starved" for cholesterol, the LDL receptors are upregulated (increased in number on the cell surface) such that more circulating cholesterol can be taken up by the cells, thereby satisfying the cell's need for cholesterol while lowering serum cholesterol levels. In the absence of functional LDL receptors (homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia IIA and IIB), statins are ineffective in significantly reducing circulating LDL cholesterol levels. Statins do not reduce the synthesis of chylomicrons or HDL, nor do they alter the activity of LPL or CETP.
8. The answer is A. Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by a mutation in MTP (the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein) such that neither chylomicrons (in the intestine) or VLDL (in the liver) are produced. Thus, as the liver produces triglyceride from dietary carbohydrate, the triglyceride cannot be exported and accumulates within the liver. The triglyceride will eventually interfere with hepatic function and structure, leading to liver failure if untreated. The inability to produce chylomicrons would not affect liver function (the intestinal cells would become lipid-laden, but that does not lead to hepatic steatosis). A defect in MTP does not affect LPL production or secretion, nor does it affect triglyceride production. HDL synthesis also is not affected by the loss of MTP.
9. The answer is A. Cortisol is produced by the middle layer of the adrenal cortex as a result of stimulation by ACTH. Aldosterone is produced by the outer layer of the adrenal cortex in response to stimulation by angiotensin II. Testosterone is produced by the Leydig cells of the testes and in the ovary in response to LH. Estrogen is produced by the ovarian follicle and corpus luteum in response to FSH. Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum in response to LH.
10. The answer is A. Bile salts are conjugated in the liver by a reaction that requires ATP and glycine or taurine such that a form of the bile salt is created in which the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of the terminal carboxylate group is reduced as compared to the native bile salt. This allows for a higher percentage of the ionized form of the bile salt in the intestine (which is approximately at pH 6.0 ), which greatly aids in the emulsification and digestion of the dietary fats. As the bile salts travel through the intestine, bacteria deconjugate and dehydroxylate the steroids, making them less soluble and less readily reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation. Consequently, a percentage of the modified bile salts are lost in the stool. If the enterohepatic circulation operated at $100 \%$ efficiency, no bile acids would be lost to the stool and this route for elimination of the steroid nucleus would not exist. Coenzyme Q has no role in conjugating or deconjugating bile salts.

## Metabolism of Ethanol

Ethanol is a dietary fuel that is metabolized to acetate principally in the liver, with the generation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The principal route for metabolism of ethanol is through hepatic alcohol dehydrogenases, which oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde in the cytosol (Fig. 33.1). Acetaldehyde is further oxidized by acetaldehyde dehydrogenases to acetate, principally in mitochondria. Acetaldehyde, which is toxic, also may enter the blood. NADH produced by these reactions is used for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation through oxidative phosphorylation. Most of the acetate enters the blood and is taken up by skeletal muscles and other tissues, where it is activated to acetyl coenzyme A (acetylCoA) and is oxidized in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Approximately $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of ingested ethanol is oxidized through a microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS), comprising cytochrome P450 enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum (especially CYP2EI). CYP2EI has a high $K_{m}$ for ethanol and is inducible by ethanol. Therefore, the proportion of ethanol metabolized through this route is greater at high ethanol concentrations and greater after chronic consumption of ethanol.

Acute effects of alcohol ingestion arise principally from the generation of NADH, which greatly increases the NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio of the liver. As a consequence, fatty acid oxidation is inhibited, and ketogenesis may occur. The elevated NADH/ $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio may also cause lactic acidosis and inhibit gluconeogenesis.

Ethanol metabolism may result in alcohol-induced liver disease, including hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), alcohol-induced hepatitis, and cirrhosis. The principal toxic products of ethanol metabolism include acetaldehyde and free radicals. Acetaldehyde forms adducts with proteins and other compounds. The hydroxyethyl radical produced by the MEOS and other radicals produced during inflammation cause irreversible damage to the liver. Many other tissues are adversely affected by ethanol, acetaldehyde, or by the consequences of hepatic dysmetabolism and injury. Genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes of ethanol metabolism may be responsible for individual variations in the development of alcoholism or the development of liver cirrhosis.

## THE WAITING ROOM

A dietary history for Ivan A. showed that he had continued his habit of drinking scotch and soda each evening while watching TV, but he did not add the ethanol calories to his dietary intake. He justifies this calculation on the basis of a comment he heard on a radio program that calories from alcohol ingestion "don't count" because they are empty calories that do not cause weight gain.

$\mathbf{O}$A1 M. was found lying semiconscious at the bottom of the stairs by his landlady when she returned from an overnight visit with friends. His face had multiple bruises and his right forearm was grotesquely angulated. Nonbloody dried vomitus stained his clothing. Mr. M. was rushed by ambulance to the emergency department at the nearest hospital. In addition to multiple bruises and the compound fracture of his right forearm, he had deep and rapid (Kussmaul) respirations and was moderately dehydrated.

Initial laboratory studies showed a relatively large anion gap of $34 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ (reference range, 9 to $15 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). An arterial blood gas analysis (which measures pH in addition to the levels of dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) confirmed the presence of a metabolic acidosis. Mr. M.'s blood alcohol level was only slightly elevated. His serum glucose was $68 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (low normal).

$\mathbf{P}$Jean T., a 46-year-old commercial artist, recently lost her job because of absenteeism. Her husband of 24 years had left her 10 months earlier. She complains of loss of appetite, fatigue, muscle weakness, and emotional depression. She has had occasional pain in the area of her liver, at times accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

On physical examination, the physician notes tenderness to light percussion over her liver, and her abdomen is mildly distended. There is a suggestion of mild jaundice (yellow discoloration of her skin and mucus membranes). No obvious neurologic or cognitive abnormalities are present.

After detecting a hint of alcohol on Jean's breath, the physician questions Jean about her drinking. Jean admits that for the last 5 or 6 years, she has been drinking gin on a daily basis ( $\sim 4$ to 5 drinks, or 68 to 85 g of ethanol) and eating infrequently. Laboratory tests showed that her serum ethanol level on the initial of fice visit was $245 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(0.245 \%)$; values $>150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(0.15 \%)$ are indicative of inebriation.

## I. Ethanol Metabolism

Ethanol is a small molecule that is both lipid- and water-soluble. It is therefore readily absorbed from the intestine by passive diffusion. A small percentage of ingested ethanol ( $0 \%$ to $5 \%$ ) enters the gastric mucosal cells of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract (tongue, mouth, esophagus, and stomach), where it is metabolized. The remainder enters the blood. Of this, $85 \%$ to $98 \%$ is metabolized in the liver, and only $2 \%$ to $10 \%$ is excreted through the lungs or kidneys.

The major route of ethanol metabolism in the liver is through liver alcohol dehydrogenase ( ADH ), a cytosolic enzyme that oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde with reduction of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to NADH (Fig. 33.2). If it is not removed by metabolism, acetaldehyde exerts toxic actions in the liver and can enter the blood and exert toxic effects in other tissues.

Approximately $90 \%$ of the acetaldehyde that is generated is further metabolized to acetate in the liver. The major enzyme involved is a low $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which oxidizes acetaldehyde to acetate with generation of NADH (see Fig. 33.2). Acetate, which has no toxic effects, may be activated to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in the liver (where it can enter either the TCA cycle or the pathway for fatty acid synthesis). However, most of the acetate that is generated enters the blood and is activated to acetyl-CoA in skeletal muscles

(1)The anion gap is calculated by subtracting the sum of the value for two anions, serum chloride and serum $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, from the serum sodium concentration. If the gap is greater than normal, it suggests that acids such as the ketone bodies acetoacetate and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-hydroxybutyrate are present in the blood in increased amounts.

(2)Jaundice is a yellow discoloration involving the sclerae (the "whites" of the eyes) and skin. It is caused by the deposition of bilirubin, a yellow degradation product of heme. Bilirubin accumulates in the blood under conditions of liver injury, bile duct obstruction, and excessive degradation of heme.

(3)Jean T. 3 admitted ethanol consumption exceeds the definition of moderate drinking. Moderate drinking is now defined as not more than two drinks per day for men but only one drink per day for women. A drink is defined as 12 oz of regular beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits ( 80 -proof).

and other tissues (see Fig. 33.1). Acetate is generally considered nontoxic and is a normal constituent of the diet.

The other principal route of ethanol oxidation in the liver is the MEOS, which also oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde (Fig. 33.3). The principal microsomal enzyme involved is a cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase isozyme (CYP2E1), which uses NADPH as an additional electron donor and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as an electron acceptor. This route accounts for only $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of ethanol oxidation in a moderate drinker.

Each of the enzymes involved in ethanol metabolism (ADH, ALDH, and CYP2E1) exists as a family of isoenzymes. Individual variations in the quantity of these isoenzymes influence several factors, such as the rate of ethanol clearance from the blood, the degree of inebriation exhibited by an individual, and differences in individual susceptibility to the development of alcohol-induced liver disease.

## A. Alcohol Dehydrogenase

ADH exists as a family of isoenzymes with varying specificity for chain length of the alcohol substrate (Table 33.1). Ethanol is a small molecule that does not exhibit much in the way of unique structural characteristics and, at high concentrations, is nonspecifically metabolized by many members of the ADH family. The alcohol dehydrogenases that exhibit the highest specificity for ethanol are members of the ADH1 family. Humans have six genes for this family of alcohol dehydrogenases, each of which exists as allelic variants (polymorphisms).

The ADH1 family members are present in high quantities in the liver, representing approximately $3 \%$ of all soluble protein. These alcohol dehydrogenases, commonly referred to collectively as liver ADH, have a low $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for ethanol between 0.02 and 5 mM (high affinities). Thus, the liver is the major site of ethanol metabolism and the major site at which the toxic metabolite acetaldehyde is generated.

Although the ADH4 and ADH2 enzymes make minor contributions to ethanol metabolism, they may contribute to its toxic effects. Ethanol concentrations can be quite high in the upper GI tract (e.g., beer is $\sim 0.8 \mathrm{M}$ ethanol), and acetaldehyde generated here by ADH4 enzymes (gastric ADH) might contribute to the risk for cancer associated with heavy drinking. ADH2 genes are expressed primarily in the liver and at lower levels in the lower GI tract.

TABLE 33 I Major Isozymes of Medium-Chain-Length Alcohol Dehydrogenases

GI, gastrointestinal.
Genes for ADH5 and ADH6 have also been identified. ADH5 does not metabolize ethanol but is active on long-chain alcohols. The function of ADH6 is still speculative.

The human has at least seven, and possibly more, genes that code for specific isoenzymes of medium-chain-length alcohol dehydrogenases, the major enzyme responsible for the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde in the human. These different alcohol dehydrogenases have an approximately $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ identity and are assumed to have arisen from a common ancestral gene similar to the ADH3 isoenzyme many millions of years ago. The ADH1 alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C) are all present in high concentration in the liver, and they have relatively high affinity and capacity for ethanol at low concentrations. (These properties are quantitatively reflected by their low $K_{\mathrm{m}}$, a parameter discussed in Chapter 9.) They have a $90 \%$ to $94 \%$ sequence identity and are able to form both homo- and heterodimers among themselves (e.g., $\beta \beta$ or $\beta \gamma$ ). However, none of the ADH1s can form dimers with an ADH subunit from subunits of $\mathrm{ADH} 2,-3$, or -4 . The three genes for class I alcohol dehydrogenases are arranged in tandem, head to tail, on chromosome 4. The genes for the other classes of ADH are also on chromosome 4 in nearby locations.

## B. Acetaldehyde Dehydrogenases

Acetaldehyde is oxidized to acetate, with the generation of NADH, by acetaldehyde dehydrogenases (see Fig. 33.2). More than $80 \%$ of acetaldehyde oxidation in the human liver is normally catalyzed by mitochondrial ALDH (ALDH2), which has a high affinity for acetaldehyde ( $K_{\mathrm{m}}=0.2 \mu \mathrm{M}$ ) and is highly specific. However, individuals with a common allelic variant of ALDH2 (designated as ALDH2*2) have a greatly decreased capacity for acetaldehyde metabolism because of an increased $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ $(46 \mu \mathrm{M})$ and a decreased $V_{\max }(0.017 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{mg}$ vs. $0.60 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{mg})$.

Most of the remainder of acetaldehyde oxidation occurs through a cytosolic ALDH (ALDH1). Additional aldehyde dehydrogenases act on a variety of organic alcohols, toxins, and pollutants.

The accumulation of acetaldehyde causes nausea and vomiting, and, therefore, inactive acetaldehyde dehydrogenases are associated with a distaste for alcoholic beverages and protection against alcoholism. In one of the common allelic variants of ALDH2 (ALDH2*2), a single substitution increases the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for acetaldehyde 230fold (lowers the affinity) and decreases the $V_{\max } 35$-fold, resulting in a very inactive enzyme. Homozygosity for the $A L D H 2 * 2$ allele affords absolute protection against alcoholism; no individual with this genotype has been found among alcoholics. Alcoholics are frequently treated with ALDH inhibitors (e.g., disulfiram) to help them abstain from alcohol intake. Unfortunately, alcoholics who continue to drink while taking this drug are exposed to the toxic effects of elevated acetaldehyde levels.

## C. Fate of Acetate

Metabolism of acetate requires activation to acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA synthetase in a reaction similar to that catalyzed by fatty acyl coenzyme A (fatty acyl-CoA) synthetases (Fig. 33.4). In liver, the principal isoform of acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACSI) is a cytosolic enzyme that generates acetyl-CoA for the cytosolic pathways of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Acetate entry into these pathways is under regulatory control by mechanisms involving cholesterol or insulin. Thus, most of the acetate generated enters the blood.

Acetate is taken up and oxidized by other tissues, notably heart and skeletal muscle, which have a high concentration of the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA synthetase isoform (ACSII). This enzyme is present in the mitochondrial matrix. It, therefore, generates acetyl-CoA that can enter the TCA cycle directly and be oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

## D. The Microsomal Ethanol-Oxidizing System

Ethanol is also oxidized to acetaldehyde in the liver by the MEOS, which comprises members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. Ethanol and NADPH

![ma1114074519f](ma1114074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 33.5 General structure of cytochrome P450 enzymes. $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds to the P450 Fe-heme in the active site and is activated to a reactive form by accepting electrons ( $\mathrm{e}^{-}$). The electrons are donated by the cytochrome P450 reductase, which contains a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) plus a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) or Fe-S center to facilitate the transfer of single electrons from NADPH to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. The P450 enzymes involved in steroidogenesis have a somewhat different structure. For CYP2EI, RH is ethanol $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{OH}\right)$ and ROH is acetaldehyde $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CHO}\right)$. NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.

ADHI A and ADHIC are present as functional polymorphisms that differ in their properties. Genetic polymorphisms for ADH partially account for the observed differences in ethanol elimination rates among various individuals or populations. Although susceptibility to alcoholism is a complex function of genetics and socioeconomic factors, possession of the ADHIB*2 allele, which encodes a relatively fast ADH (high $V_{\max }$ ) is associated with a decreased susceptibility to alcoholism-presumably because of nausea and flushing caused by acetaldehyde accumulation (because the ALDH gene cannot keep up with the amount of acetaldehyde produced). This particular allele has a relatively high frequency in the East Asian population and a low frequency among white Europeans. In contrast, the ADHIB*1/IB*1 genotype (homozygous for allele 1 of the ADHIB gene) is a risk factor for the development of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a neuropsychiatric syndrome that is commonly associated with alcoholism.
both donate electrons in the reaction, which reduces $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (Fig. 33.5). The cytochrome P450 enzymes all have two major catalytic protein components: an electron-donating reductase system that transfers electrons from NADPH (cytochrome P450 reductase) and a cytochrome P450. The cytochrome P450 protein contains the binding sites for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and the substrate (e.g., ethanol) and carries out the reaction. The enzymes are present in the endoplasmic reticulum, which on isolation from disrupted cells forms a membrane fraction after centrifugation that was formerly called microsomes by biochemists.

## I. CYP2EI

The MEOS is part of the superfamily of cytochrome P450 enzymes, all of which catalyze similar oxidative reactions. Within the superfamily, at least 10 distinct gene families are found in mammals. More than 100 different cytochrome P450 isozymes exist within these 10 gene families. Each isoenzyme has a distinct classification according to its structural relationship with other isoenzymes. The isoenzyme that has the highest activity toward ethanol is called CYP2E1. CYP represents cytochrome P450. In CYP2E1, the 2 refers to the gene family (isozymes with $>40 \%$ amino acid sequence identity), the $E$ to the subfamily (isozymes with $>55 \%$ sequence identity), and the 1 refers to the individual enzymes within this subfamily. A great deal of overlapping specificity exists among the various P450 isoenzymes, and ethanol is also oxidized by several other P450 isoenzymes. MEOS refers to the combined ethanol-oxidizing activity of all the P450 enzymes.

CYP2E1 has a much higher $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for ethanol than the ADH1 family members ( $11 \mathrm{mM}[51 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}]$ compared with 0.02 to $5 \mathrm{mM}[0.09$ to $22.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}]$ ). Thus, a greater proportion of ingested ethanol is metabolized through CYP2E1 at high levels of ethanol consumption than at low levels.

## 2. Induction of P450 Enzymes

The P450 enzymes are inducible both by their most specific substrate and by substrates for some of the other cytochrome P450 enzymes. Chronic consumption of ethanol increases hepatic CYP2E1 levels approximately 5- to 10-fold. However, it also causes a twofold to fourfold increase in some of the other P450s from the same subfamily, from different subfamilies, and even from different gene families. The endoplasmic reticulum undergoes proliferation, with a general increase in the content of microsomal enzymes, including those that are not involved directly in ethanol metabolism.

The increase in CYP2E1 with ethanol consumption occurs through transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational regulation. Increased levels of mRNA, resulting from induction of gene transcription or stabilization of message, are found in patients who are actively drinking. The protein is also stabilized against degradation. In general, the mechanism for induction of P450 enzymes by their substrates occurs through the binding of the substrate (or related compound) to an intracellular receptor protein, followed by binding of the activated receptor to a response element in the target gene. Ethanol induction of CYP2E1 appears to act via stabilization of the protein and protection against degradation (an increased half-life for the synthesized protein).

Although induction of CYP2E1 increases ethanol clearance from the blood, it has negative consequences. Acetaldehyde may be produced faster than it can be metabolized by acetaldehyde dehydrogenases, thereby increasing the risk of hepatic injury. An increased amount of acetaldehyde can enter the blood and can damage other tissues. In addition, cytochrome P450 enzymes are capable of generating free radicals, which also may lead to increased hepatic injury and cirrhosis (see Chapter 25).

Overlapping specificity in the catalytic activity of P450 enzymes and in their inducers is responsible for several types of drug interactions. For example,

phenobarbital, a barbiturate long used as a sleeping pill or for treatment of epilepsy, is converted to an inactive metabolite by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases CYP2B1 and CYP2B2. After treatment with phenobarbital, CYP2B2 is increased 50 - to 100 -fold. Individuals who take phenobarbital for prolonged periods develop a drug tolerance as CYP2B2 is induced, and the drug is metabolized to an inactive metabolite more rapidly. Consequently, these individuals use progressively higher doses of phenobarbital.

Ethanol is an inhibitor of the phenobarbital-oxidizing P450 system. When large amounts of ethanol are consumed, the inactivation of phenobarbital is directly or indirectly inhibited. Therefore, when high doses of phenobarbital and ethanol are consumed at the same time, toxic levels of the barbiturate can accumulate in the blood.

## E. Variations in the Pattern of Ethanol Metabolism

The routes and rates of ethanol oxidation vary from individual to individual. Differences in ethanol metabolism may influence whether an individual becomes a chronic alcoholic, develops alcohol-induced liver disease, or develops other diseases associated with increased alcohol consumption (e.g., hepatocarcinogenesis, lung cancer, breast cancer). Factors that determine the rate and route of ethanol oxidation in individuals include:

- Genotype-Polymorphic forms of alcohol dehydrogenases and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases can greatly affect the rate of ethanol oxidation and the accumulation of acetaldehyde. CYP2E1 activity may vary as much as 20 -fold among individuals partly because of differences in the inducibility of different allelic variants.
- Drinking history-The level of gastric ADH decreases and CYP2E1 increases with the progression from a naïve, to a moderate, and to a heavy and chronic consumer of alcohol.
- Gender-Blood levels of ethanol after consuming a drink are normally higher for women than for men, partly because of lower levels of gastric ADH activity in women. After chronic consumption of ethanol, gastric ADH decreases in both men and women, but the gender differences become even greater. Gender differences in blood alcohol levels also occur because women are normally smaller. Furthermore, in women, alcohol is distributed in a $12 \%$ smaller water space because a woman's body composition consists of more fat and less water than that of a man.
- Quantity-The amount of ethanol an individual consumes over a short period of time determines its metabolic route. Small amounts of ethanol are metabolized most efficiently through the low- $K_{m}$ pathway of ADH1 genes and ALDH2 genes. Little accumulation of NADH occurs to inhibit ethanol metabolism via these dehydrogenases. However, when higher amounts of ethanol are consumed within a short period, a disproportionately greater amount is metabolized through the MEOS. The MEOS, which has a much higher $K_{m}$ for ethanol, functions principally at high concentrations of ethanol. A higher activity of the MEOS may be expected to correlate with a tendency to develop alcohol-induced liver disease because both acetaldehyde and free radical levels will be increased.


## F. The Energy Yield of Ethanol Oxidation

The ATP yield from ethanol oxidation to acetate varies with the route of ethanol metabolism. If ethanol is oxidized by the major route of cytosolic ADH and mitochondrial ALDH, one cytosolic and one mitochondrial NADH are generated, with a maximum yield of 5 ATP. Oxidation of acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle and the electron-transport chain leads to the generation of 10 high-energy

As blood ethanol concentration rises above 18 mM (the legal intoxication limit is now defined as $0.08 \%$ in most states of the United States, which is $\sim 18 \mathrm{mM}$ ), the brain and central nervous system are affected. Induction of CYP2EI increases the rate of ethanol clearance from the blood, thereby contributing to increased alcohol tolerance. However, the apparent ability of a chronic alcoholic to drink without appearing inebriated is partly a learned behavior.

At Ivan A.'s low level of ethanol consumption, ethanol is oxidized to acetate via ADH and ALDH in the liver and the acetate is activated to acetyl-CoA and oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in skeletal muscle and other tissues. The overall energy yield of 13 ATP per ethanol molecule accounts for the caloric value of ethanol, approximately $7 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$. However, chronic consumption of substantial amounts of alcohol does not have the effect on body weight expected from the caloric intake. This is partly attributable to induction of MEOS, resulting in a proportionately greater metabolism of ethanol through the MEOS with its lower energy yield (only $\sim 8$ ATP). In general, weight-loss diets recommend no, or low, alcohol consumption because ethanol calories are "empty" in the sense that alcoholic beverages are generally low in vitamins, essential amino acids, and other required nutrients but are not empty of calories. phosphate bonds. However, activation of acetate to acetyl-CoA requires two high-energy phosphate bonds (one in the cleavage of ATP to adenosine monophosphate [AMP] + pyrophosphate and one in the cleavage of pyrophosphate to phosphate), which must be subtracted. Thus, the maximum total energy yield is 13 mol of ATP per mole of ethanol.

In contrast, oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde by CYP2E1 consumes energy in the form of NADPH, which is equivalent to 2.5 ATP. Thus, for every mole of ethanol metabolized by this route, only a maximum of 8.0 mol of ATP can be generated ( 10 ATP from acetyl-CoA oxidation through the TCA cycle, minus 2 for acetate activation; the NADH generated by ALDH is balanced by the loss of NADPH in the MEOS step).

## II. Toxic Effects of Ethanol Metabolism

Alcohol-induced liver disease, a common and sometimes fatal consequence of chronic ethanol abuse, may manifest itself in three forms: fatty liver, alcoholinduced hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Each may occur alone, or they may be present in any combination in a given patient. Alcohol-induced cirrhosis is discovered in up to $9 \%$ of all autopsies performed in the United States, with a peak incidence in patients 40 to 55 years of age.

However, ethanol ingestion also has acute effects on liver metabolism, including inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and stimulation of triacylglycerol synthesis, leading to a fatty liver. It also can result in ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis and cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, depending on the dietary state. These effects are considered reversible.

In contrast, acetaldehyde and free radicals generated from ethanol metabolism can result in alcohol-induced hepatitis, a condition in which the liver is inflamed and cells become necrotic and die. Diffuse damage to hepatocytes results in cirrhosis, characterized by fibrosis (scarring), disturbance of the normal architecture and blood flow, loss of liver function, and, ultimately, hepatic failure.

## A. Acute Effects of Ethanol Arising from the Increased NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$Ratio

Many of the acute effects of ethanol ingestion arise from the increased NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ ratio in the liver (Fig. 33.6). At lower levels of ethanol intake, the rate of ethanol oxidation is regulated by the supply of ethanol (usually determined by how much ethanol we consume) and the rate at which NADH is reoxidized in the electron-transport chain. NADH is not a very effective product inhibitor of ADH or ALDH, and there is no other feedback regulation by ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), or AMP. As a consequence, NADH generated in the cytosol and mitochondria tends to accumulate, increasing the NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio to high levels (see Fig. 33.6, circle 1). The increase is even greater as the mitochondria become damaged from acetaldehyde or free-radical injury.

## I. Changes in Fatty Acid Metabolism

The high NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio generated from ethanol oxidation inhibits the oxidation of fatty acids, which accumulate in the liver (see Fig. 33.6, circles 2 and 3) These fatty acids are re-esterified into triacylglycerols by combining with glycerol 3-phosphate (glycerol 3-P). The increased NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio increases the availability of glycerol-3-P by promoting its synthesis from intermediates of glycolysis. The triacylglycerols are incorporated into very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), which accumulate in the liver and enter the blood, resulting in an ethanol-induced hyperlipidemia.

Although just a few drinks may result in hepatic fat accumulation, chronic consumption of alcohol greatly enhances the development of a fatty liver. Reesterification

![ma1124074519f](ma1124074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 33.6 Acute effects of ethanol metabolism on lipid metabolism in the liver. (I) Metabolism of ethanol generates a high NADH/ $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio. (2) The high NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio inhibits fatty acid oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, resulting in accumulation of fatty acids. (3) Fatty acids are re-esterified to glycerol 3-phosphate by acyltransferases in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Glycerol 3-phosphate levels are increased because a high NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio favors its formation from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP; an intermediate of glycolysis). Ethanol-stimulated increases of ER enzymes also favors triacylglycerol formation. (4) NADH generated from ethanol oxidation can meet the requirements of the cell for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation from oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, acetyl coenzyme A (acetylCoA) oxidation in the TCA cycle is inhibited. (5) The high NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio shifts oxaloacetate toward malate, and acetyl-CoA is directed into ketone-body synthesis. Options (6) through (8) are discussed in the text. NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; VLDL, very-low-density lipoprotein; MEOS, microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; ALDH, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; etc, electron-transport chain.
of fatty acids into triacylglycerols by fatty acyl-CoA transferases in the endoplasmic reticulum is enhanced (see Fig. 33.6). Because the transferases are microsomal enzymes, they are induced by ethanol consumption just as the MEOS is induced. The result is a fatty liver (hepatic steatosis).

The source of the fatty acids can be dietary fat, fatty acids synthesized in the liver, or fatty acids released from adipose tissue stores. Adipose tissue lipolysis increases after ethanol consumption possibly because of a release of epinephrine.

# 2. Alcohol-Induced Ketoacidosis 

Fatty acids that are oxidized are converted to acetyl-CoA and subsequently to ketone bodies (acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate). Enough NADH is generated

## 2

Al M.'s admitting physician suspected an alcohol-induced ketoacidosis superimposed on a starvation ketoacidosis. Tests showed that A/s plasma $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate level was 40 times the upper limit of normal and, if measured, would show his plasma free fatty acid level was elevated. The increased NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio from ethanol consumption inhibited the TCA cycle and shifted acetyl-CoA from fatty acid oxidation into the pathway of ketone-body synthesis. The presence of the ketone bodies helped to explain the large anion gap measured when Mr. M. entered the hospital.
from oxidation of ethanol and fatty acids that there is no need to oxidize acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle. The very high NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio shifts the oxaloacetate in the TCA cycle to malate, leaving the oxaloacetate levels too low for citrate synthase to synthesize citrate (see Fig. 33.6, circle 4). The acetyl-CoA enters the pathway for ketone body synthesis instead of the TCA cycle.

Although ketone bodies are being produced at a high rate, their metabolism in other tissues is restricted by the supply of acetate, which is the preferred fuel. Thus, the blood concentration of ketone bodies may be much higher than is found under normal fasting conditions.

## 3. Lactic Acidosis, Hyperuricemia, and Hypoglycemia

Another consequence of the very high NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio is that the balance in the lactate dehydrogenase reaction is shifted toward lactate, resulting in a lactic acidosis (see Fig. 33.6, circle 6). The elevation of blood lactate may decrease excretion of uric acid (see Fig. 33.6, circle 7) by the kidney. Consequently, patients with gout (which results from precipitated uric acid crystals in the joints) are advised not to drink excessive amounts of ethanol. Increased degradation of purines also may contribute to hyperuricemia.

The increased NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio also can cause hypoglycemia in a fasting individual who has been drinking and is dependent on gluconeogenesis to maintain blood glucose levels (Fig. 33.6, circles 6 and 8). Alanine and lactate are major gluconeogenic precursors that enter gluconeogenesis as pyruvate. The high NADH/ $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio shifts the lactate dehydrogenase equilibrium to lactate, so that pyruvate formed from alanine is converted to lactate and cannot enter gluconeogenesis. The high NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio also prevents other major gluconeogenic precursors, such as oxaloacetate and glycerol, from entering the gluconeogenic pathway.

In contrast, ethanol consumption with a meal may result in a transient hyperglycemia, possibly because the high NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio inhibits glycolysis at the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase step.

## B. Acetaldehyde Toxicity

Many of the toxic effects of chronic ethanol consumption result from accumulation of acetaldehyde, which is produced from ethanol by both alcohol dehydrogenases and the MEOS. Acetaldehyde accumulates in the liver and is released into the blood after heavy doses of ethanol (Fig. 33.7). It is highly reactive and binds covalently to amino groups, sulfhydryl groups, nucleotides, and phospholipids to form "adducts."

## I. Acetaldehyde and Alcohol-Induced Hepatitis

One of the results of acetaldehyde-adduct formation with amino acids is a general decrease in hepatic protein synthesis (see Fig. 33.7, circle 1). Calmodulin, ribonuclease, and tubulin are some of the proteins affected. Proteins in the heart and other tissues also may be affected by acetaldehyde that appears in the blood.

As a consequence of forming acetaldehyde adducts of tubulin, there is a diminished secretion of serum proteins and VLDL from the liver. The liver synthesizes many blood proteins, including serum albumin, blood coagulation factors, and transport proteins for vitamins, steroids, and iron. These proteins accumulate in the liver, together with lipid. The accumulation of proteins results in an influx of water (see Fig. 33.7, circle 6) within the hepatocytes and a swelling of the liver that contributes to portal hypertension and a disruption of hepatic architecture.

## 2. Acetaldehyde and Free-Radical Damage

Acetaldehyde-adduct formation enhances free-radical damage. Acetaldehyde binds directly to glutathione and diminishes its ability to protect against $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and prevent lipid peroxidation (see Fig. 33.7, circle 2). It also binds to free-radical defense enzymes.

![ma1134074519f](ma1134074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 33.7 The development of alcohol-induced hepatitis. (I) Acetaldehyde-adduct formation decreases protein synthesis and impairs protein secretion. (2) Free-radical injury results partly from acetaldehyde-adduct formation with glutathione. (3) Induction of the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS) increases formation of free radicals, which leads to lipid peroxidation and cell damage. (4) Mitochondrial damage inhibits the electron-transport chain, which decreases acetaldehyde oxidation. (5) Microtubule damage increases very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and protein accumulation. (6) Cell damage leads to release of the hepatic enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; ROS, reactive oxygen species; etc, electron-transport chain.

Damage to mitochondria from acetaldehyde and free radicals perpetuates a cycle of toxicity (see Fig. 33.7, circles 3 and 4). With chronic consumption of ethanol, mitochondria become damaged, the rate of electron transport is inhibited, and oxidative phosphorylation tends to become uncoupled. Fatty acid oxidation is decreased even further, thereby enhancing lipid accumulation (see Fig. 33.7, circle 5). The mitochondrial changes further impair mitochondrial acetaldehyde oxidation, thereby initiating a cycle of progressively increasing acetaldehyde damage.

## C. Ethanol and Free-Radical Formation

Increased oxidative stress in the liver during chronic ethanol intoxication arises from increased production of free radicals, principally by CYP2E1. Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in the reductase and heme in the cytochrome P450 system transfer single electrons, thus operating through a mechanism that can generate free radicals. The hydroxyethyl radical $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$ is produced during ethanol metabolism and can be released as a free radical. Induction of CYP2E1, as well as other cytochrome P450 enzymes, can increase the generation of free radicals from drug metabolism and from the activation of toxins and carcinogens (see Fig. 33.7, circle 3). These effects are enhanced by acetaldehyde-adduct damage.

Phospholipids, the major lipid in cellular membranes, are a primary target of peroxidation caused by free-radical release. Peroxidation of lipids in the inner mitochondrial membrane may contribute to the inhibition of electron transport and

The noncaloric effect of heavy and chronic ethanol ingestion that led Ivan A. to believe ethanol has no calories may be partly attributable to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The hepatic mitochondria from tissues of chronic alcoholics may be partially uncoupled and unable to maintain the transmembrane proton gradient necessary for normal rates of ATP synthesis. Consequently, a greater proportion of the energy in ethanol is converted to heat. Metabolic disturbances such as the loss of ketone bodies in urine, or futile cycling of glucose, also might contribute to a diminished energy value for ethanol.

Because of the possibility of mild alcoholic hepatitis and perhaps chronic alcohol-induced cirrhosis, the physician ordered liver function studies on Jean T. The tests indicated an ALT level of 46 U/L. (reference range, 5 to 30 U/L) and an AST level of 98 U/L. (reference range, 10 to 30 U/L). The concentration of these enzymes is high in hepatocytes. When hepatocellular membranes are damaged in any way, these enzymes are released into the blood. Jean's serum alkaline phosphatase level was 195 U/L. (reference range, 56 to 155 U/L for an adult female). The serum total bilirubin level was $2.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. (reference range, 0.2 to $1.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ). These tests show impaired capacity for normal liver function. Her blood hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were slightly below the normal range, consistent with a toxic effect of ethanol on red blood cell production by bone marrow. Serum folate and vitamin $B_{12}$ levels were also slightly suppressed. Folate is dependent on the liver for its activation and recovery from the enterohepatic circulation. Vitamin $B_{12}$ is dependent on the liver for synthesis of its blood carrier proteins. Thus, Jean T. shows many of the consequences of hepatic damage. uncoupling of mitochondria, leading to inflammation and cellular necrosis. Induction of CYP2E1 and other P450 cytochromes also increases formation of other radicals and the activation of hepatocarcinogens.

## D. Hepatic Cirrhosis and Loss of Liver Function

Liver injury is irreversible at the stage that hepatic cirrhosis develops. Initially, the liver may be enlarged, full of fat, and crossed with collagen fibers (fibrosis) and may have nodules of regenerating hepatocytes ballooning between the fibers. As liver function is lost, the liver becomes shrunken (Laennec cirrhosis). During the development of cirrhosis, many of the normal metabolic functions of the liver are lost, including biosynthetic and detoxification pathways. Synthesis of blood proteins, including blood coagulation factors and serum albumin, is decreased. The capacity to incorporate amino groups into urea is decreased, resulting in the accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the blood. Conjugation and excretion of the yellow pigment bilirubin (a product of heme degradation) is diminished, and bilirubin accumulates in the blood. It is deposited in many tissues, including the skin and sclerae of the eyes, causing the patient to become visibly yellow. Such a patient is said to be jaundiced.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

When ethanol consumption is low ( $<15 \%$ of the calories in the diet), it is used efficiently to produce ATP, thereby contributing to Ivan A.'s weight gain. However, in individuals with chronic consumption of large amounts of ethanol, the caloric content of ethanol is not converted to ATP as effectively. Some of the factors that may contribute to this decreased efficiency include mitochondrial damage (inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and uncoupling) resulting in the loss of calories as heat, increased recycling of metabolites such as ketone bodies, and inhibition of the normal pathways of fatty acid and glucose oxidation. In addition, heavier drinkers metabolize an increased amount of alcohol through the MEOS, which generates less ATP.

Al M. Al M. was suffering from acute effects of high ethanol ingestion in the absence of food intake. Both heavy ethanol consumption and low caloric intake increase adipose tissue lipolysis and elevate blood fatty acids. As a consequence of his elevated hepatic NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio, acetyl-CoA produced from fatty acid oxidation was diverted from the TCA cycle into the pathway of ketone-body synthesis. Because his skeletal muscles were using acetate as a fuel, ketone-body use was diminished, resulting in ketoacidosis. Al's moderately low blood glucose level also suggests that his high hepatic NADH level prevented pyruvate and glycerol from entering the gluconeogenic pathway. Pyruvate is diverted to lactate, which may have contributed to his metabolic acidosis and anion gap, along with the ketone bodies.

Rehydration with intravenous fluids containing glucose, thiamin, and potassium was initiated. Al's initial potassium level was low, possibly secondary to vomiting. Thiamin is given in case there is thiamin deficiency. An orthopedic surgeon was consulted regarding the compound fracture of his right forearm.

Jean T. Jean T.'s signs and symptoms, as well as her laboratory profile, were consistent with the presence of mild reversible alcohol-induced hepatocellular inflammation (alcohol-induced hepatitis) superimposed on a degree of irreversible scarring of liver tissues, known as chronic alcoholic (Laennec) cirrhosis of the liver. The chronic inflammatory process associated with long-term ethanol abuse in patients such as Jean T. is accompanied by increases in the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Her elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels in the blood were consistent with hepatic damage. Her values for ALT and AST were significantly below those seen in acute viral hepatitis. In addition, the ratio of the absolute values for serum

TABLE 33.3 Hepatic Injury

| STAGE OF INJURY | MAIN FEATURES |
| :--: | :--: |
| Fibrosis: increase of connective tissue | Accumulation of both fibrillar and basement membrane-like collagens Increase of laminin and fibronectin <br> Thickening of connective tissue septae <br> Capillary formation within the sinusoids |
| Sclerosis: aging of fibrotic tissue | Decrease of hyaluronic acid and heparan sulfate proteoglycans Increase of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans <br> Progressive fragmentation and disappearance of elastic fibers Distortion of sinusoidal architecture and parenchymal damage |
| Cirrhosis: end-stage process of liver fibrotic degeneration | Whole liver heavily distorted by thick bands of collagen surrounding nodules of hepatocytes with regenerative foci |

ALT and AST often differ in the two diseases, tending to be $>1$ in acute viral hepatitis and $<1$ in chronic alcohol-induced cirrhosis. The reason for the difference in ratio of enzyme activities released is not fully understood, but a lower level of ALT in the serum may be attributable to an alcohol-induced deficiency of pyridoxal phosphate. In addition, serologic tests for viral hepatitis were nonreactive. Her serum folate and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ were also slightly suppressed, indicating impaired nutritional status.

Jean was strongly cautioned to abstain from alcohol immediately and to improve her nutritional status. In addition, she was referred to the hospital drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit for appropriate psychological therapy and supportive social counseling. The physician also arranged for a follow-up office visit in 2 weeks.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

$\Delta$Fibrosis in Chronic Alcohol-Induced Liver Disease. Fibrosis is the excessive accumulation of connective tissue in parenchymal organs. In the liver, it is a frequent event following a repeated or chronic insult of sufficient intensity (such as chronic ethanol intoxication or infection by a hepatitis virus) to trigger a "wound healing-like" reaction. Regardless of the insult, the events are similar: An overproduction of extracellular matrix components occurs, with the tendency to progress to sclerosis, accompanied by a degenerative alteration in the composition of matrix components (Table 33.2). Some individuals ( $<20 \%$ of those who chronically consume alcohol) go on to develop cirrhosis.

The development of hepatic fibrosis after ethanol consumption is related to stimulation of the mitogenic development of stellate (Ito) cells into myofibroblasts, and stimulation of the production of collagen type I and fibronectin by these cells. The stellate cells are perisinusoidal cells lodged in the space of Disse that produce extracellular matrix protein. Normally, the space of Disse contains basement mem-brane-like collagen (collagen type IV) and laminin. As the stellate cells are activated, they change from a resting cell filled with lipids and vitamin A to one that proliferates, loses its vitamin A content, and secretes large quantities of extracellular matrix components.

One of the initial events in the activation and proliferation of stellate cells is the activation of Kupffer cells, which are macrophages that reside in the liver sinusoids (Fig. 33.8). The Kupffer cells are probably activated by a product of the damaged hepatocytes, such as necrotic debris, iron, reactive oxygen species (ROS), acetaldehyde, or aldehyde products of lipid peroxidation. Kupffer cells also may produce acetaldehyde from ethanol internally through their own MEOS pathway.

$\Delta$h liver fibrosis, disruption of the normal liver architecture, including sinusoids, impairs blood from the portal vein. Increased portal vein pressure (portal hypertension) causes capillaries to anastomose (to meet and unite or run into each other) and form thin-walled dilated esophageal venous conduits known as esophageal varices. When these burst, there is hemorrhaging into the GI tract. The bleeding can be very profuse because of the high venous pressure within these varices in addition to the adverse effect of impaired hepatic function on the production of blood-clotting proteins.

$\square$Although the full spectrum of alcoholinduced liver disease may be present in a well-nourished individual, the presence of nutritional deficiencies enhances the progression of the disease. Ethanol creates nutritional deficiencies in several different ways. The ingestion of ethanol reduces the Gl absorption of foods that contain essential nutrients, including vitamins, essential fatty acids, and essential amino acids. For example, ethanol interferes with absorption of folate, thiamin, and other nutrients. Secondary malabsorption can occur through Gl complications, pancreatic insufficiency, and impaired hepatic metabolism or impaired hepatic storage of nutrients such as vitamin A Changes in the level of transport proteins produced by the liver also strongly affect nutrient status.

![ma1144074519f](ma1144074519f.jpg)

FIGURE 33.8 Proposed model for the development of hepatic fibrosis involving hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and stellate (Ito) cells. ROS, reactive oxygen species; NO, nitric oxide: TGF- $\beta_{1}$, transforming growth factor $\beta_{1}$.

Activated Kupffer cells produce several products that contribute to activation of stellate cells. They generate additional ROS through NADPH oxidase during the oxidative burst and reactive nitrogen-oxygen species (RNOS) through inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (see Chapter 25). In addition, they secrete an impressive array of growth factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, and other reactive molecules. The cytokine transforming growth factor $\beta_{1}\left(\right.$ TGF- $\beta_{1}$ ), produced by both Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells, is a major player in the activation of stellate cells. Once they are activated, the stellate cells produce collagen and proteases, leading to an enhanced fibrotic network within the liver. Stellate cells may also be partially activated by hepatocyte release of ROS and acetaldehyde directly, with the involvement of Kupffer cells.

Recent evidence also indicates that chronic alcohol usage can disrupt gene regulation within the liver, through modification of the activity of sirtuin1 (see "Biochemical Comments" in Chapter 30). Sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) is a histone deacetylase that uses $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$as a substrate (see Fig. 30.21), producing nicotinamide and acetyl-ADP-ribose. Deacylation of appropriate targets leads to alterations in gene expression. Ethanol will lead to a downregulation of SIRT-1 activity. Ethanol may lead to reduced SIRT-1 activity through an increase in the NADH/ $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio in the liver, thereby reducing the level of substrate $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$required for SIRT-1 activity.

Interestingly, it also appears that a reduction in SIRT-1 activity leads to a reduction in AMP-activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Under normal conditions, SIRT-1 deacetylates LBK1, activating it, which phosphorylates and activates the AMPK. AMPK (see "Biochemical Comments" in Chapter 34) phosphorylates and inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase, resulting in reduced production of malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA). Malonyl-CoA is an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI), so reduced levels of malonyl-CoA lead to increased activity of CPTI and increased levels of fatty acid oxidation. Ethanol-induced inhibition of SIRT-1 will lead to inhibition of hepatic AMPK (because of LBK1 remaining inactive), thereby activating acetyl-CoA carboxylase, producing malonyl-CoA, and blocking fatty acid oxidation in the liver. This will result in the fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis in the liver, leading to the development of alcoholic fatty liver disease.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is A. Acetate is converted to acetyl-CoA by other tissues so that it can enter the TCA cycle to generate ATP. Answer B is incorrect because acetaldehyde, not acetate, is toxic to cells. Answer C is incorrect because acetate is excreted by the lung and kidney and not in the bile. Answer D is incorrect because acetate cannot enter the TCA cycle directly. It must be converted to acetyl-CoA first. Answer E is incorrect because alcohol dehydrogenase converts ethanol into acetaldehyde. It does not convert acetate into NADH.
2. The answer is B. There is an increase in the NADH/ $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio because NADH is produced by the conversion of ethanol to acetate (thus, D is incorrect). The increased ratio of NADH/ $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$favors the conversion of gluconeogenic precursors (such as pyruvate and oxaloacetate) to their reduced counterparts (lactate and malate, respectively) in order to generate $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$for ethanol metabolism. This reduces the concentration of gluconeogenic precursors and slows down gluconeogenesis (thus, E is incorrect) and can lead to lactic acidosis.

Answer A is incorrect because the increase of NADH inhibits fatty acid oxidation. Answer C is incorrect because ketogenesis increases as a result of the increase of NADH and acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria. NADH inhibits key enzymes of the TCA cycle, thereby diverting acetyl-CoA from the TCA cycle and toward ketone-body synthesis.
3. The answer is C. Disulfiram blocks the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate (the reaction catalyzed by ALDH). The accumulation of acetaldehyde is toxic and causes vomiting and nausea. Answers A and B are incorrect because disulfiram would not interfere with the absorption of ethanol or the first step of its metabolism. Answer D is incorrect because an ALDH inhibitor (such as disulfiram) would inhibit the conversion of ethanol to acetate, not increase the rate of the conversion. Answer E is incorrect because disulfiram does not interfere with the excretion of acetate, nor does acetate accumulation lead to nausea and vomiting.
4. The answer is E. An increase in the concentration of CYP2E1 (the MEOS system) would result in an increase of ethanol metabolism and clearance from the blood (thus, A is incorrect). An increased rate of acetaldehyde production would result (thus, B is incorrect). The increase in CYP2E1 would cause an increase in the probability of producing free radicals (thus, C is incorrect). Answer D is incorrect because hepatic damage would be more likely to occur because there is an increase of free-radical production. Answer E is correct because the increased clearance rate of ethanol from the blood results in a higher alcohol tolerance level.
5. The answer is E. Liver cirrhosis is irreversible. It is an end-stage process of liver fibrosis. Answers A, B, C, and D are all consequences of liver disease, but they are all reversible. Therefore, E is the only answer that is correct.
6. The answer is D. The gluconeogenic precursors are lactate, glycerol, and amino acids (primarily alanine) from muscle protein degradation. Under the conditions of high alcohol intake for extended periods, the NADH/ $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio is very high owing to alcohol being converted to acetaldehyde and then acetic acid. Gluconeogenesis is impaired because of the high levels of NADH present. Lactate cannot be converted to pyruvate (the reaction requires $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, which is present in very low levels). Alanine can be converted to pyruvate, which is converted to oxaloacetate via pyruvate carboxylase, but the oxaloacetate is trapped and cannot be converted to malate owing to the low $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$levels as well. Glycerol metabolism requires first, phosphorylation to glycerol 3-P, and then oxidation of carbon 2 to form dihydroxyacetone phosphate, an $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$-requiring reaction. Thus, when $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$levels are low, glycerol 3-P, lactate, and oxaloacetate will all be trapped and cannot efficiently progress through the gluconeogenic pathway.
7. The answer is B. The patient is likely to be thiamindeficient, which is a required factor for oxidative decarboxylation reactions (pyruvate dehydrogenase and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) and transketolase. Ethanol interferes with the absorption of thiamin from the digestive tract. The reaction of ribose 5-phosphate with xylulose 5-phosphate to produce sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is catalyzed by transketolase. The conversion of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to erythrose 4-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate is a threecarbon transfer catalyzed by transaldolase, which does not require an exogenous vitamin for activity. The conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to ribulose 5-phosphate is catalyzed by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which requires niacin as a cofactor but not thiamin. Isocitrate dehydrogenase, which requires niacin (but not thiamin), catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to PEP and does not require a vitamin cofactor.
8. The answer is E. An isozyme of ALDH has a dramatically increased $K_{\mathrm{m}}(>200$-fold) and a 10 -fold reduced $V_{\max }$. In such individuals, acetaldehyde, the toxic component of alcohol ingestion, accumulates to a large extent, leading to the individual having a very low tolerance for alcohol. A slow-acting ADH would not lead to a low tolerance to alcohol because acetaldehyde accumulation (the toxic intermediate of alcohol metabolism) would be slowed such that the acetaldehyde produced can be safely metabolized without any side effects. Acetate, once produced, is not toxic, so a slow-acting acetyl-CoA synthetase (which uses acetate as a substrate) would not lead to the accumulation of a toxic intermediate. MEOS is used as an alternative ethanol-oxidizing system when ethanol levels are high. A slow-acting MEOS would reduce the production of acetaldehyde, which is the toxic intermediate of alcohol metabolism. This would not lead to a low level of tolerance to alcohol. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is not involved in ethanol metabolism (the acetyl-CoA formed would be used for energy). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is needed for fatty acid synthesis, and if its activity were low, fatty acid production would be reduced, but it would have no effect on the tolerance to alcohol.
9. The answer is B. The main route for metabolism of ethanol is through ADH in the cytosol producing acetaldehyde, which is the toxic intermediate of alcohol metabolism. Acetaldehyde is further oxidized in mitochondria to acetate, which is then activated by tissues to acetyl-CoA, which is oxidized in the TCA cycle. If entry of acetaldehyde into the mitochondria is blocked, then acetaldehyde accumulates and acetate is not formed. The MEOS is in the endoplasmic reticulum (cytosolic) and would continue to produce acetaldehyde and $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$.

10. The answer is A. The MEOS is induced by ethanol and uses a cytochrome P450 system to oxidize ethanol. The cytochrome P450 enzyme systems transfer a single electron at a time through an iron within a heme group in the cytochrome, and this is the step at which the electron may escape and convert oxygen to superoxide, thereby generating ROS. ADH and ALDH transfer hydride ions to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, and there is a very low probability
of electrons escaping from those oxidation-reduction reactions. Acetyl-CoA synthetase does not catalyze an oxidation-reduction reaction (it catalyzes the conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA), nor does citrate synthase (the formation of citrate from acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate). The possibility of losing an electron during a reaction in which electrons are not being transferred is very low.

# Integration of Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism 

This chapter summarizes and integrates the major pathways for the use of carbohydrates and fats as fuels. We concentrate on reviewing the regulatory mechanisms that determine the flux of metabolites in the fed and fasting states, integrating the pathways that were described separately under carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The next section of the book covers the mechanisms by which the pathways of nitrogen metabolism are coordinated with fat and carbohydrate metabolism.

For the species to survive, it is necessary for us to store excess food when we eat and to use these stores when we are fasting. Regulatory mechanisms direct compounds through the pathways of metabolism involved in the storage and use of fuels. These mechanisms are controlled by hormones, by the concentration of available fuels, and by the energy needs of the body.

Changes in hormone levels, in the concentration of fuels, and in energy requirements affect the activity of key enzymes in the major pathways of metabolism. Intracellular enzymes are generally regulated by activation and inhibition, by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (or other covalent modifications), by induction and repression of synthesis, and by degradation. Activation and inhibition of enzymes cause immediate changes in metabolism. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of enzymes affect metabolism slightly less rapidly. Induction and repression of enzyme synthesis are much slower processes, usually affecting metabolic flux over a period of hours. Degradation of enzymes decreases the amount available to catalyze reactions.

The pathways of metabolism have multiple control points and multiple regulators at each control point. The function of these complex mechanisms is to produce a graded response to a stimulus and to provide sensitivity to multiple stimuli so that an exact balance is maintained between flux through a given step (or series of steps) and the need or use for the product. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is an example of an enzyme that has multiple regulatory mechanisms. Regardless of insulin levels, the enzyme cannot become fully activated in the presence of products and absence of substrates.

The major hormones that regulate the pathways of fuel metabolism are insulin and glucagon. In liver, all effects of glucagon are reversed by insulin, and some of the pathways that insulin activates are inhibited by glucagon. Thus, the pathways of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are generally regulated by changes in the insulin/ glucagon ratio.

Although glycogen is a critical storage form of fuel because blood glucose levels must be carefully maintained, adipose triacylglycerols are quantitatively the major fuel store in the human. After a meal, both dietary glucose and fat are stored in adipose tissue as triacylglycerol. This fuel is released during fasting, when it provides the main source of energy for the tissues of the body. The length of time we can survive without food depends mainly on the size of our bodies' fat stores.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$
Within 2 months of her surgery to remove a benign insulin-secreting $\beta$-cell tumor of the pancreas, Connie C. (see Chapter 19) was again jogging lightly. She had lost the 8 lb that she had gained in the 6 weeks before her surgery. Because her hypoglycemic episodes were no longer occurring, she had no need to eat frequent carbohydrate snacks to prevent the adrenergic and neuroglycopenic symptoms that she had experienced when her tumor was secreting excessive amounts of insulin.

00A few months after her last hospitalization, Dianne A. was once again brought to the hospital emergency department in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Blood samples for glucose and electrolytes were drawn repeatedly during the first 24 hours. The hospital laboratory reported that the serum in each of these specimens appeared opalescent rather than having its normal clear or transparent appearance. This opalescence results from light-scattering caused by the presence of elevated levels of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins in the blood.

0When Deborah S. initially presented (see Chapter 19) with type 2 diabetes mellitus at age 39 , she was approximately 30 lb over her ideal weight. Her high serum glucose levels were accompanied by abnormalities in her 14-hour fasting lipid profile. Her serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triacylglycerol levels were elevated, and her serum highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level was below the normal range.

## I. Regulation of Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism in the Fed State

## A. Mechanisms that Affect Glycogen and Triacylglycerol Synthesis in Liver

After a meal, the liver synthesizes glycogen and triacylglycerol. The level of glycogen stored in the liver can increase from approximately 80 g after an overnight fast to a limit of approximately 200 to 300 g . Although the liver synthesizes triacylglycerol, it does not store this fuel but rather packages it in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and secretes it into the blood. The fatty acids of the VLDL triacylglycerols secreted from the liver are stored as adipose triacylglycerols. Adipose tissue has an almost infinite capacity to store fat, limited mainly by the ability of the heart to pump blood through the capillaries of the expanding adipose mass. Although we store fat throughout our bodies, it tends to accumulate in places where it does not interfere too much with our mobility: in the abdomen, hips, thighs, and buttocks.

Both the synthesis of liver glycogen and the conversion by the liver of dietary glucose to triacylglycerol (lipogenesis) are regulated by mechanisms involving key enzymes in these pathways.

## I. Glucokinase

After a meal, glucose can be converted to glycogen or to triacylglycerol in the liver. For both processes, glucose is first converted to glucose 6-phosphate by glucokinase, a liver enzyme that has a high $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for glucose (Fig. 34.1). Because of the enzyme's low affinity for glucose, this enzyme is most active in the fed state, when the concentration of glucose is particularly high because the hepatic portal vein carries digestive products directly from the intestine to the liver. Synthesis of glucokinase is also induced by insulin (which is elevated after a meal) and repressed by glucagon (which is elevated during fasting). In keeping with the liver's function in maintaining blood glucose levels, this system is set up such that the liver can metabolize glucose only when sugar levels are high and not when sugar levels are low.

## 2. Glycogen Synthase

In the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to glycogen, the key regulatory enzyme is glycogen synthase. This enzyme is activated by dephosphorylation, which occurs when insulin is elevated and glucagon is decreased (Fig. 34.2) and by the increased level of glucose.

## 3. Phosphofructokinase-1 and Pyruvate Kinase

For lipogenesis, glucose 6-phosphate is converted through glycolysis to pyruvate. Key enzymes that regulate this pathway in the liver are phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) and pyruvate kinase. PFK-1 is allosterically activated in the fed state by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (see Fig. 34.1). Phosphofructokinase-2, the enzyme that produces the activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, is dephosphorylated and the kinase activity is active after a meal (see Chapter 22). Pyruvate kinase is also activated by dephosphorylation, which is stimulated by the increase of the insulin/glucagon ratio in the fed state (see Fig. 34.1).

## 4. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase and Pyruvate Carboxylase

The conversion of pyruvate to fatty acids requires a source of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in the cytosol. Pyruvate can only be converted to acetyl-CoA in mitochondria, so it enters mitochondria and forms acetyl-CoA through the PDH reaction. This enzyme is dephosphorylated and most active when its supply of substrates and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is high, its products are used, and insulin is present (see Fig. 23.15).

Pyruvate is also converted to oxaloacetate (OAA). The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction, pyruvate carboxylase, is activated by acetyl-CoA. Because acetylCoA cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane directly to form fatty acids in the cytosol, it condenses with OAA, producing citrate. The citrate that is not required for tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity crosses the membrane and enters the cytosol.

As fatty acids are produced under conditions of high energy, the high reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NADH} / \mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$ratio in the mitochondria inhibits isocitrate dehydrogenase, which leads to citrate accumulation within the mitochondrial matrix. As the citrate accumulates, it is transported out into the cytosol to donate carbons for fatty acid synthesis.

## 5. Citrate Lyase, Malic Enzyme, and Glucose 6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase

In the cytosol, citrate is cleaved by citrate lyase, an inducible enzyme, to form OAA and acetyl-CoA (Fig. 34.3). The acetyl-CoA is used for fatty acid biosynthesis and for cholesterol synthesis, pathways that are activated by insulin. OAA is recycled to pyruvate via cytosolic malate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme, which is inducible. Malic enzyme generates NADPH for the reactions of the fatty acid synthase complex. NADPH is also produced by the two enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway (see Chapter 27), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is also induced by insulin.

## 6. Acetyl Coenzyme A Carboxylase

Acetyl-CoA is converted to malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA), which provides the two-carbon units for elongation of the growing fatty acyl chain on the fatty acid synthase complex. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, is controlled by three of the major mechanisms that regulate enzyme activity (Fig. 34.4). It is activated by citrate, which causes the enzyme to polymerize, and inhibited by long-chain fatty acyl coenzyme A (fatty acyl-CoA). A phosphatase stimulated by insulin activates the enzyme by dephosphorylation. The third means by which this enzyme is regulated is induction: The quantity of the enzyme increases in the fed state.

active and malonyl-CoA levels are elevated, newly synthesized fatty acids are converted to triacylglycerols for storage rather than being transported into mitochondria for oxidation and formation of ketone bodies.

## 7. Fatty Acid Synthase Complex

In a well-fed individual, the quantity of the fatty acid synthase complex is increased (see Fig. 34.3). The genes that produce this enzyme complex are induced by increases in the insulin/glucagon ratio. The amount of the complex increases slowly after a few days of a high-carbohydrate diet.

Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which generates NADPH in the pentose phosphate pathway, and malic enzyme, which produces NADPH, are also induced by the increase of insulin.

The palmitate produced by the synthase complex is converted to palmityl-CoA and elongated and desaturated to form other fatty acyl-CoA molecules, which are converted to triacylglycerols. These triacylglycerols are packaged and secreted into the blood as VLDL.

## B. Mechanisms that Affect the Fate of Chylomicrons and VLDL

The lipoprotein triacylglycerols in chylomicrons and VLDL are hydrolyzed to fatty acids and glycerol by lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme attached to endothelial cells of capillaries in muscle and adipose tissue. The enzyme found in muscle, particularly heart muscle, has a low $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for these blood lipoproteins. Therefore, it acts even when these lipoproteins are present at very low concentrations in the blood. The fatty acids enter muscle cells and are oxidized for energy. The enzyme found in adipose tissue has a higher $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ and is most active after a meal when blood lipoprotein levels are elevated.

## C. Mechanisms that Affect Triacylglycerol Storage in Adipose Tissue

Insulin stimulates adipose cells to synthesize and secrete LPL, which hydrolyzes the chylomicron and VLDL triacylglycerols. Apolipoprotein CII, donated to chylomicrons and VLDL by HDL activates LPL (Fig. 34.6).

FIGURE 34.5 Inhibition of transport of fatty acids (FA) into mitochondria by malonyl coenzymeA (malonyl-CoA). In the fed state, malonylCoA (the substrate for fatty acid synthesis produced by acetyl coenzyme A [acetyl-CoA] carboxylase) is elevated. It inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI), preventing the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria. Therefore, substrate is not available for $\beta$-oxidation and ketone-body synthesis. CoA, coenzyme A; CPTII, carnitine palmitoyltransferase II.

The measurement of triglycerides in blood samples is performed using a coupled assay. The sample is incubated with a lipase that converts the triglyceride to glycerol and three fatty acids. The glycerol is then converted to glycerol 3-phosphate (glycerol $3-P$ ) by glycerol kinase and ATP, and the glycerol $3-P$ is then oxidized by a bacterial glycerol $3-P$ dehydrogenase to produce dihydroxyacetone phosphate and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide, in the presence of peroxidase, will oxidize a colorless substrate, which turns color when oxidized. Measurement of the color change is directly proportional to the amount of glycerol generated in the sample. Comparing values before and after lipase addition will also allow the free glycerol content in the blood to be determined.

4Dianne A. has type I diabetes mellitus, a disease associated with a severe deficiency or absence of insulin caused by destruction of the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas. One of the effects of insulin is to stimulate production of LPL. Because of low insulin levels, Dianne A. tends to have low levels of this enzyme. Hydrolysis of the triacylglycerols in chylomicrons and in VLDL is decreased, and hypertriglyceridemia results.

Why does Deborah S. have a hypertriglyceridemia?

$\square$Twenty percent to $30 \%$ of patients with an insulinoma gain weight as part of their syndrome. Connie C. gained 8 lb in the 6 weeks before her surgery. Although she was primed by her high insulin levels both to store and to use fuel more efficiently, she would not have gained weight if she had not consumed more calories than she required for her daily energy expenditure during her illness (see Chapter 1). Connie consumed extra carbohydrate calories, mostly as hard candies and table sugar, to avoid the symptoms of hypoglycemia.

Dianne A. suffers from hyperglycemia because her insulin levels tend to be low and her glucagon levels tend to be high. Her muscle and adipose cells do not take up glucose at a normal rate, and she produces glucose by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. As a result, her blood glucose levels are elevated. Deborah S. is in a similar metabolic state. However, in this case, she produces insulin but her tissues are resistant to its actions.

Insulin normally inhibits lipolysis by decreasing the lipolytic activity of adipocyte triglyceride lipase and HSL in the adipocyte. Individuals such as Dianne A., who have a deficiency of insulin, have increased lipolysis and a subsequent increase in the concentration of free fatty acids in the blood. The liver, in turn, uses some of these fatty acids to synthesize triacylglycerols, which then are used in the hepatic production of VLDL. VLDL is not stored in the liver but is secreted into the blood, raising its serum concentration. Dianne also has low levels of LPL because of decreased insulin levels. Her hypertriglyceridemia is the result, therefore, of both overproduction ofVLDL by the liver and decreased breakdown ofVLDL triacylglycerol for storage in adipose cells.

The serum begins to appear cloudy when the triacylglycerol level reaches $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. As the triacylglycerol level increases still further, the degree of serum opalescence increases proportionately.

Fatty acids released from chylomicrons and VLDL by LPL are stored as triacylglycerols in adipose cells. The glycerol released by LPL is not used by adipose cells because they lack glycerol kinase. Glycerol can be used by liver cells, however, because these cells do contain glycerol kinase. In the fed state, liver cells convert glycerol to the glycerol moiety of the triacylglycerols of VLDL, which is secreted from the liver to distribute the newly synthesized triglycerides to the tissues.

Insulin causes the number of glucose transporters in adipose cell membranes to increase. Glucose enters these cells and is oxidized, producing energy and providing the glycerol 3-P moiety for triacylglycerol synthesis (via the dihydroxyacetone phosphate intermediate of glycolysis).

## II. Regulation of Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism during Fasting

## A. Mechanisms in Liver that Serve to Maintain Blood Glucose Levels

During fasting, the insulin/glucagon ratio decreases. Liver glycogen is degraded to produce blood glucose because enzymes of glycogen degradation are activated by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-directed phosphorylation (see Fig. 26.7). Glucagon stimulates adenylate cyclase to produce cAMP, which activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates phosphorylase kinase, which then phosphorylates and activates glycogen phosphorylase. PKA also phosphorylates but, in this case, inactivates glycogen synthase.

Gluconeogenesis is stimulated because the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, and glucose 6-phosphatase is induced and because there is an increased availability of precursors. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is also activated because the levels of its inhibitor, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, are low (Fig. 34.7). During fasting, the activities of the corresponding enzymes of glycolysis are decreased.

Induction of enzyme synthesis requires activation of transcription factors. One of the factors that is activated is cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). CREB is phosphorylated and activated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which itself is activated upon glucagon or epinephrine stimulation. Other transcription factors are activated by cAMP, but the regulation of those factors by cAMP is not as well understood as it is for CREB.

## B. Mechanisms that Affect Lipolysis in Adipose Tissue

During fasting, as blood insulin levels fall and glucagon levels rise, the level of cAMP rises in adipose cells. Consequently, PKA is activated which leads to the activation of both adipocyte triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; see Fig. 31.25). These activated lipases cleave fatty acids from triacylglycerols. Other hormones (e.g., epinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], growth hormone) also lead to the activation of these enzymes (see Chapter 41). The resynthesis of triglyceride (using regenerated glycerol 3-P) by the adipocyte regulates the rate of release of fatty acids during fasting.

## C. Mechanisms that Affect Ketone Body Production by the Liver

As fatty acids are released from adipose tissue during fasting, they travel in the blood complexed with albumin. These fatty acids are oxidized by various tissues, particularly muscle. In the liver, fatty acids are transported into mitochondria because acetyl-CoA carboxylase is inactive, malonyl-CoA levels are low, and CPTI is active (see Fig. 34.5). Acetyl-CoA, produced by $\beta$-oxidation, is converted to ketone bodies. Ketone bodies are used as an energy source by many tissues (Table 34.1) to spare the use of glucose and the necessity of degrading muscle protein to provide the precursors for gluconeogenesis. The high levels of acetyl-CoA in the liver (derived

FIGURE 34.7 Regulation of gluconeogenesis (red arrows) and glycolysis (black arrows) during fasting. The gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, and glucose 6-phosphatase are induced (T). Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is also active because, during fasting, the level of its inhibitor, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, is low. The corresponding enzymes of glycolysis are not very active during fasting. The rate of glucokinase is low because it has a high $K_{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{\alpha}$, for glucose and the glucose concentration is low. Phosphofructokinase-1 is not very active because the concentration of its activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is low. Pyruvate kinase is inactivated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated phosphorylation.

Deborah S. has type 2 diabetes mellitus. She produces insulin, but her adipose tissue is partially resistant to its actions. Therefore, her adipose tissue does not produce as much $\mathrm{LR}_{+}$as a normal person, which is one of the reasons whyVLDL and chylomicrons remain elevated in her blood.

Because Dianne A. produces very little insulin, she is prone to developing ketoacidosis. When insulin levels are low, adipocyte triglyceride lipase and HSL of adipose tissue are very active, resulting in increased lipolysis. The fatty acids that are released travel to the liver; where they are converted to the triacylglycerols of VLDL. They also undergo $\beta$-oxidation and conversion to ketone bodies. If Dianne does not take exogenous insulin or if her insulin levels decrease abruptly for some physiologic reason, she may develop DKA. In fact, she has had repeated bouts of DKA.

For reasons that are not as well understood, individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, such as Deborah S. do not tend to develop DKA. One possible explanation is that the insulin resistance is tissue-specific; the insulin sensitivity of adipocytes may be greater than that of muscle and liver. It has been suggested that the level of insulin required to suppress lipolysis is only $10 \%$ that required to enhance glucose use by muscle and adipocyte. Such a tissue-specific sensitivity would lead to less fatty acids being released from adipocytes in type 2 diabetes than in type I diabetes, although in both cases, the release of fatty acids would be greater than that of an individual without the disease. If, however, a type I diabetic person has a precipitating event, such as the release of stress hormones (see Chapter 41), then ketoacidosis is more likely to be found as the stress hormones counteract the effects of insulin on the adipocyte.
from fat oxidation) inhibit PDH (which prevents pyruvate from being converted to acetyl-CoA) and activate pyruvate carboxylase, which produces OAA for gluconeogenesis. The OAA does not condense with acetyl-CoA to form citrate for two reasons. The first is that under these conditions (a high rate of fat oxidation in the liver mitochondria), energy levels in the mitochondrial matrix are high; that is, there are high levels of NADH and ATP present. The high NADH level inhibits isocitrate dehydrogenase. As a result, citrate accumulates and inhibits citrate synthase from producing more citrate. The second reason that citrate synthesis is depressed is that the high $\mathrm{NADH} / \mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio also diverts OAA into malate, such that the malate can exit the mitochondria (via the malate/aspartate shuttle) for use in gluconeogenesis.

## D. Regulation of the Use of Glucose and Fatty Acids by Muscle

During exercise, the fuel that is used initially by muscle cells is muscle glycogen. As exercise continues and the blood supply to the tissue increases, glucose is taken up from the blood and oxidized. Liver glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis replenish the blood glucose supply. However, as insulin levels drop, the concentration of the GLUT4 transporters in the membrane is reduced, thereby reducing glucose entry from the circulation into the muscle. However, muscle GLUT4 transporters are also induced by high AMP levels, through the action of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Thus, if energy levels are low and the concentration of AMP increases, glucose can still be transported from the circulation into the muscle to provide energy. This will most frequently be the case during periods of exercise.

In addition, as fatty acids become available because of increased lipolysis of adipose triacylglycerols, the exercising muscle begins to oxidize fatty acids. $\beta$-Oxidation produces NADH and acetyl-CoA, which slow the flow of carbon from glucose through the reaction catalyzed by PDH (see Fig. 23.15). Thus, the oxidation of fatty acids provides a major portion of the increased demand for ATP generation and spares blood glucose.

## III. The Importance of AMP and Fructose 2,6-Bisphosphate

The switch between catabolic and anabolic pathways is often regulated by the levels of AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in cells, particularly the liver. It is logical for AMP to be a critical regulator. Because a cell uses ATP in energy-requiring pathways, the levels of AMP accumulate more rapidly than that of ADP because of the adenylate kinase reaction ( $2 \mathrm{ADP} \rightarrow$ ATP and AMP). The rise in AMP levels then signals that more energy is required (usually through allosteric binding sites on enzymes and the activation of the AMPK), and the cell will switch to the activation of catabolic pathways. As AMP levels drop, and ATP levels rise, the anabolic pathways are activated to store the excess energy.

The levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate are also critical in regulating glycolysis versus gluconeogenesis in the liver. Under conditions of high blood glucose, and insulin release, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels are high because the PFK-2 kinase is in its activated state. The fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activates PFK-1 and inhibits fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, thereby allowing glycolysis to proceed. When blood glucose levels are low and glucagon is released, PFK-2 is phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the kinase activity is inhibited (and the phosphatase activity is activated), thereby lowering fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels and inhibiting glycolysis while favoring gluconeogenesis.

## IV. General Summary

All of the material in this chapter was presented previously. However, because this information is so critical for understanding biochemistry in a way that will allow it to be used in interpreting clinical situations, it was summarized in this chapter. In addition, the information presented previously under carbohydrate metabolism has

been integrated with lipid metabolism. We have, for the most part, left out the role of allosteric modifiers and other regulatory mechanisms that finely coordinate these processes to an exquisite level. Because such details may be important for specific clinical situations, we hope this summary will serve as a framework to which the details can be fitted as students advance in their clinical studies.

Figure 34.8 is a comprehensive figure, and Tables 34.2 and 34.3 provide a list of the major regulatory enzymes of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the liver, an order to the events that occur, and the mechanisms by which they are controlled. This figure and tables should help students to integrate this mass of material.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

$\square$Connie C. Connie C.'s younger sister was very concerned that Connie's pancreatic tumor might be genetically determined or potentially malignant, so she accompanied Connie to her second postoperative visit to the endocrinologist. The doctor explained that insulinomas are very rarely familial, with around $10 \%$ of patients with insulinomas having a genetically determined syndrome known as multiple endocrine neoplasia, type I, or simply MEN I. This syndrome includes additional secretory neoplasms, which may occur in the anterior pituitary or the parathyroid glands. Connie's tumor showed no evidence of malignancy, and the histologic slides, although not always definitive, showed a benign-appearing process. The doctor was careful to explain, however, that close observation for recurrent hypoglycemia and for the signs and symptoms suggestive of other facets of MEN I would be necessary for the remainder of Connie's and her immediate family's life.

$\square$Dianne A. Diabetes mellitus is a well-accepted risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease; the risk is 3 to 4 times higher in the population with diabetes than in the population without diabetes. Although chronically elevated serum levels of chylomicrons and VLDL may contribute to this atherogenic predisposition, the premature vascular disease seen in Dianne A. and other patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, as well as Deborah S. and other patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, is also related to other abnormalities in lipid metabolism. Among these are the increase in glycation (nonenzymatic attachment of glucose molecules to proteins) of LDL apolipoproteins as well as glycation of the proteins of the LDL receptor, which occurs when serum glucose levels are chronically elevated. These glycations interfere with the normal interaction or "fit" of the circulating LDL particles with their specific receptors on cell membranes. As a consequence, the rate of uptake of circulating LDL by the normal target cells is diminished. The LDL particles, therefore, remain in the circulation and eventually bind nonspecifically to "scavenger" receptors located on macrophages adjacent to the endothelial surfaces of blood vessels, one of the early steps in the process of atherogenesis.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

AMP-Activated Protein Kinase. The AMPK is a pivotal regulatory molecule in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. The hepatic targets of AMPK include the following proteins:

- Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (phosphorylation reduces activity, leading to reduced fatty acid synthesis)
- Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2) kinase (this protein is activated when phosphorylated, and it will lead to a reduction in protein synthesis)
- Glycerol 3-P acyltransferase (GPAT) (phosphorylation reduces activity, leading to reduced triglyceride synthesis)
- 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (phosphorylation reduces activity, leading to reduced cholesterol synthesis)
- Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) (active when phosphorylated, reduces malonyl-CoA levels, allowing fatty acid oxidation to occur)
- Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (reduced activity when phosphorylated, leading to reduced protein synthesis)
- Tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) (increased activity when phosphorylated, leading to reduced protein synthesis)
- TORC2 (the protein is sequestered in the cytoplasm when phosphorylated, leading to decreased expression [at the transcriptional level] of gluconeogenic enzymes)
The overall effect of AMPK activation is reduced fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis (via effects on acetyl-CoA carboxylase, GPAT, and MCD), reduced cholesterol synthesis (via inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase), and reduced protein synthesis (via effects on mTOR and TSC2). There is a concomitant increase in fatty acid oxidation to raise ATP levels. Because the processes described previously are all highly energy-dependent, it makes sense to turn them off when energy levels are low, as exemplified by increased AMP levels.
mTOR (rapamycin is a drug that is a potent immunosuppressant) is a protein kinase, which, when active, phosphorylates key proteins that regulate and initiate protein synthesis. AMPK phosphorylation of mTOR blocks the activation of mTOR. mTOR can be activated by TSC2 through a complex pathway involving the GTPbinding protein Rheb. The TSC complex (consisting of TSC1 and TSC2) acts as a GTPase-activating protein for Rheb. Rheb-GTP activates mTOR, whereas RhebGDP does not. Phosphorylation of TSC2 by the AMPK activates the GTPase-activating activity of TSC2, leading to Rheb-GDP formation, and reduced mTOR activity. The reduced mTOR activity leads to a reduction of protein synthesis.
mTOR also plays a critical role in transmitting the signal from the insulin receptor to an increase in protein synthesis within the cell. Insulin receptor activation leads to Akt activation (see Fig. 11.14). The protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B) will phosphorylate the TSC1/TSC2 complex and inactivate the GTPase-activating component of the complex. Under these conditions, then, Rheb-GTP will be long-lived, and mTOR will be active, leading to an enhancement of protein synthesis in the cell. The interaction of TSC1/TSC2, mTOR, and its regulatory kinases is depicted in Figure 34.9.

The AMPK can be activated in several ways, all of which depend on increased AMP levels within the cell. As the concentration of AMP increases, AMPK is activated by allosteric means, or by phosphorylation by LKB1 (see Chapter 32), or by phosphorylation by a calmodulin kinase kinase. AMPK is inactivated by dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases, or a decrease in AMP levels. Small changes in intracellular AMP levels can have profound effects on AMPK activity because of these multiple regulatory pathways.

AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex that consists of a catalytic subunit ( $\alpha$ ) and two regulatory subunits ( $\beta$ and $\gamma$ ). The allosteric activation of AMPK occurs via AMP binding to the $\alpha$-subunit; the phosphorylation activation of AMPK occurs via threonine phosphorylation on the $\alpha$-subunit. Different tissues express different isoforms of the $\alpha-, \beta$-, and $\gamma$-subunits, giving rise to a wide variety of isozymes of AMPK in the different tissues.

FIGURE 34.9 Central role of mTOR and the TSC I/TSC2 complex in regulating protein synthesis. The TSC I/TSC2 complex acts as a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating protein for the G-protein Rheb.When active, Rheb-GTP activates the mTOR kinase, leading to phosphorylation events that promote protein synthesis (S6KI and 4E-BPs are phosphorylated). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation of the TSCI/TSC2 complex activates the complex such that the GTPase activity of Rheb is enhanced, leading to Rheb inactivation and loss of mTOR kinase activity. This will lead to a decrease in protein synthesis. Insulin binding to its receptor leads to the activation of the protein kinase Akt (see Fig. II.I4). Akt will phosphorylate the TSCI/TSC2 complex at sites distinct from AMPK, and which inhibits the GTPase-activating activity of the complex. This allows RhebGTP to be active for extended periods of time, activating mTOR, and increasing protein synthesis in the cell in response to insulin.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Three key controlling elements determine whether a fuel is metabolized or stored: hormones, concentration of available fuels, and energy needs of the body.
- Key intracellular enzymes are generally regulated by allosteric activation and inhibition, by covalent modification, by transcriptional control, and by degradation.
- Regulation is complex in order to allow sensitivity and feedback to multiple stimuli so that an exact balance can be maintained between synthesis of a product and need for the product.

- The insulin/glucagon ratio is primarily responsible for the hormonal regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.
- The key enzymes of glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid degradation, glycogen synthesis, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis are all regulated in a coordinated manner, allowing the appropriate pathways to be activated and inhibited without the creation of futile cycles.
- This chapter summarizes, in one package, all of the major regulatory events discussed in the previous 15 chapters.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 34.4.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is B. The acetone on the woman's breath (which is produced by decarboxylation of acetoacetate; thus, E is incorrect) and the ketones in her urine indicate that she is in DKA. This is caused by low insulin levels, so her blood glucose levels are high because the glucose is not being taken up by the peripheral tissues (thus, A and C are incorrect). An insulin injection will reduce her blood glucose levels and decrease the release of fatty acids from adipose triglycerides. Consequently, ketone-body production will decrease. Glucagon injections would just exacerbate the woman's current condition (thus, D is incorrect).
2. The answer is D. Chylomicrons are blood lipoproteins produced from dietary fat. VLDL are produced mainly from dietary carbohydrate. Intermediate-density lipoprotein and LDL are produced from VLDL. HDL does not transport triacylglycerol to the tissues.
3. The answer is B. Consider the energy required to convert dietary carbohydrates to triacylglycerol. Some ATP is generated from glycolysis and the PDH reaction, but energy is also lost as the fatty acids are synthesized (the synthesis of each malonyl-CoA requires ATP, and the reduction
steps require two molecules of NADPH). Dietary fat, however, only requires activation and attachment to glycerol; the fatty acid chain does not need to be synthesized. Therefore, it requires less energy to package dietary fat into chylomicrons than it does to convert dietary carbohydrate into fatty acids for incorporation into VLDL. Thus, weight gain will be more rapid if all the excess calories are derived from fat as opposed to carbohydrates.
4. The answer is B. Metabolism of ethanol leads to production of NADH in the liver, which will inhibit fatty acid oxidation in the liver. Because the patient has not eaten for 5 days, the insulin/glucagon ratio is low, adipocyte triglyceride lipase and HSL are activated, and fatty acids are being released by the adipocyte and taken up by the muscle and liver. However, because the liver NADH levels are high as a result of ethanol metabolism, the fatty acids received from the adipocyte are repackaged into triacylglycerol (the high NADH promotes the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol 3-P as well) and secreted from the liver in the form of VLDL. None of the other answers is a correct statement.

5. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The clotting problems are caused by a lack of vitamin K, a lipid-soluble vitamin. Vitamin K is absorbed from the diet in mixed micelles and packaged with chylomicrons for delivery to the other tissues. Individuals with abetalipoproteinemia lack the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and cannot produce chylomicrons effectively, vitamin K deficiency can result. Such patients also cannot produce VLDL, but lipidsoluble vitamin distribution does not depend on VLDL particles, only on chylomicrons. The other answers are all incorrect statements.
6. The answer is E. After eating a high-carbohydrate meal, the excess carbohydrates in the liver are first stored as glycogen and then sent through glycolysis to generate pyruvate and then acetyl-CoA, for eventual fatty acid production. After time, as the blood glucose is used by tissues, its levels will drop, and glucagon will be released from the pancreas, which will stimulate glycogenolysis in the liver such that glucose can be exported to raise blood glucose levels. The glucagon release also stimulates lipolysis, and energy from fatty acid oxidation is used to produce glucose via gluconeogenesis.
7. The answer is B. Insulin is required for muscle and fat cells to synthesize and release LPL to bind to the capillary walls of the capillaries supplying these tissues with blood. In the absence of insulin, LPL levels would be reduced, and there would be a reduced rate of triglyceride removal from both chylomicrons and VLDL particles. Chylomicron synthesis would be normal on a normal diet. The problem is that the lipid is not leaving the chylomicron as rapidly as it normally would because of the reduced levels of LPL on the capillary walls. VLDL synthesis would actually increase, owing to fatty acid synthesis by the liver (because of the high levels of glucose in the blood), and because of excess fatty acids reaching the liver owing to increased lipolysis of triacylglycerol in the fat cell, as induced by the absence of insulin.
8. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. When blood glucose levels are low and the muscle requires energy, ATP is used and ADP is produced. Adenylate kinase catalyzes the conversion of two ADP to ATP and AMP, and an increase in AMP leads to the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase. This kinase phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase. This leads to lower levels of malonyl-CoA, and a release of the inhibition of CPTI, such that fatty acid oxidation is enhanced because the fatty acids can enter the mitochondrial matrix to be oxidized. The increase in AMP levels also activates PFK-1, speeding up the glycolytic pathway. Citrate does not accumulate under conditions in which the insulin/glucagon ratio is low, and acetyl-CoA is not an allosteric modifier of any glycolytic enzyme.
9. The answer is D. In type 1 diabetes mellitus, the patient is producing low or no insulin, which means that C-peptide levels are very low or nondetectable. The patients are usually thin because low insulin does not promote adipose tissue storage of triacylglycerol. There is no insulin resistance in type 1 because the patients are not producing insulin. Insulin resistance at the cellular level primarily causes type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because of the resistance, insulin levels are generally elevated to attempt to overcome this resistance. With elevated insulin levels, adipose tissue storage of triacylglycerol is high and the patient is almost always overweight. There are exceptions to this general statement, and those are patients who have inherited a mutation leading to type 2 diabetes, such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY).
10. The answer is E. Initially, muscles use glucose from muscle glycogen, and fatty acids provided by the adipocyte. As the run continues, the levels of AMP increase in the muscle, which leads to activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase. This kinase leads to a reduction of malonyl-CoA levels in the muscle (by inhibiting, via phosphorylation, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and activating, via phosphorylation, MCD), which allows for fatty acid entrance into the mitochondria. The muscle does not contain sufficient glycogen to provide energy for the entire marathon, so a mixture of fatty acids and glucose (from glycogen) is used by the muscle for optimal performance. In an adult, there is no ketone-body production during the race. Blood glucose can be taken up by the muscle (the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase stimulates the fusion of GLUT4 containing vesicles with the plasma membrane), but the runner will race at a pace that allows some of the blood glucose to be used by the nervous system, which requires that the muscles use fatty acids to generate energy.

# Nitrogen Metabolism 

Dietary proteins are the primary source of the nitrogen that is metabolized by the body (Fig. VI.1). Amino acids, produced by digestion of dietary proteins, are absorbed through intestinal epithelial cells and enter the blood. Various cells take up these amino acids, which enter the cellular pools. They are used for the synthesis of proteins and other nitrogen-containing compounds or they are oxidized for energy.

Protein synthesis, the translation of messenger RNA on ribosomes (see Chapter 15), is a dynamic process. Within the body, proteins are constantly being synthesized and degraded, partially draining and then refilling the cellular amino acid pools.

Compounds derived from amino acids include cellular proteins, hormones, neurotransmitters, creatine phosphate, the heme of hemoglobin and the cytochromes, the skin pigment melanin, and the purine and pyrimidine bases of nucleotides and nucleic acids. In fact, all of the nitrogen-containing compounds of the body are synthesized from amino acids. Many of these pathways are outlined in the following chapters.

In addition to serving as the precursors for the nitrogen-containing compounds of the body and as the building blocks for protein synthesis, amino acids are also a source of energy. Amino acids are either oxidized directly or the amino acid carbons are converted to glucose and then oxidized or stored as glycogen. The amino acid carbons may also be converted to fatty acids and stored as adipose triacylglycerols. Glycogen and triacylglycerols are oxidized during periods of fasting. The liver is the major site of amino acid oxidation. However, most tissues can oxidize the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine).

Before the carbon skeletons of amino acids are oxidized, the nitrogen must be removed. Amino acid nitrogen forms ammonia, which is toxic to the body. In the liver, ammonia and the amino groups from amino acids are converted to urea, which is nontoxic, water-soluble, and readily excreted in the urine. The process by which urea is produced is known as the urea cycle. The liver is the organ responsible for producing urea. Branched-chain amino acids can be oxidized in many tissues, but the nitrogen must always travel to the liver for disposal.

Although urea is the major nitrogenous excretory product of the body, nitrogen is also excreted in other compounds (Table VI.1). Uric acid is the degradation product of the purine bases, creatinine is produced from creatine phosphate, and ammonia is released from glutamine, particularly by the kidney, where it helps to buffer the urine by reacting with protons to form ammonium ions $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}\right)$. These compounds are excreted mainly in the urine, but substantial amounts are also lost in the feces and through the skin. Small amounts of nitrogen-containing metabolites are formed from the degradation of neurotransmitters, hormones, and other specialized amino acid products and excreted in the urine. Some of these degradation products, such as bilirubin (formed from the degradation of heme), are excreted mainly in the feces.

Eleven of the 20 amino acids used to form proteins are synthesized in the body if an adequate amount is not present in the diet (Table VI.2). Ten of these amino acids can be produced from glucose; the 11th, tyrosine, is synthesized from the essential amino acid phenylalanine. It should be noted that cysteine, one of the

FIGURE VI.I Summary of amino acid metabolism. Dietary proteins are digested to amino acids in the stomach and intestine, which are absorbed by the intestinal epithelium, transferred to the circulation, and taken up by cells. Amino acids are used to synthesize proteins and other ni-trogen-containing compounds. The carbon skeletons of amino acids are also oxidized for energy, and the nitrogen is converted to urea and other nitrogenous excretory products.

The healthy human adult is in nitrogen balance; in other words, the amount of nitrogen excreted each day (mainly in the urine) equals the amount consumed (mainly as dietary protein). Negative nitrogen balance occurs when the amount of nitrogen excreted is greater than the amount consumed, and positive nitrogen balance occurs when the amount excreted is less than that consumed (see Chapter 1).
