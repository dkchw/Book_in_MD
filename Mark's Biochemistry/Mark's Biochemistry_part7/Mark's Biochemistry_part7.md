# Nitrogen Metabolism 

Dietary proteins are the primary source of the nitrogen that is metabolized by the body (Fig. VI.1). Amino acids, produced by digestion of dietary proteins, are absorbed through intestinal epithelial cells and enter the blood. Various cells take up these amino acids, which enter the cellular pools. They are used for the synthesis of proteins and other nitrogen-containing compounds or they are oxidized for energy.

Protein synthesis, the translation of messenger RNA on ribosomes (see Chapter 15), is a dynamic process. Within the body, proteins are constantly being synthesized and degraded, partially draining and then refilling the cellular amino acid pools.

Compounds derived from amino acids include cellular proteins, hormones, neurotransmitters, creatine phosphate, the heme of hemoglobin and the cytochromes, the skin pigment melanin, and the purine and pyrimidine bases of nucleotides and nucleic acids. In fact, all of the nitrogen-containing compounds of the body are synthesized from amino acids. Many of these pathways are outlined in the following chapters.

In addition to serving as the precursors for the nitrogen-containing compounds of the body and as the building blocks for protein synthesis, amino acids are also a source of energy. Amino acids are either oxidized directly or the amino acid carbons are converted to glucose and then oxidized or stored as glycogen. The amino acid carbons may also be converted to fatty acids and stored as adipose triacylglycerols. Glycogen and triacylglycerols are oxidized during periods of fasting. The liver is the major site of amino acid oxidation. However, most tissues can oxidize the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine).

Before the carbon skeletons of amino acids are oxidized, the nitrogen must be removed. Amino acid nitrogen forms ammonia, which is toxic to the body. In the liver, ammonia and the amino groups from amino acids are converted to urea, which is nontoxic, water-soluble, and readily excreted in the urine. The process by which urea is produced is known as the urea cycle. The liver is the organ responsible for producing urea. Branched-chain amino acids can be oxidized in many tissues, but the nitrogen must always travel to the liver for disposal.

Although urea is the major nitrogenous excretory product of the body, nitrogen is also excreted in other compounds (Table VI.1). Uric acid is the degradation product of the purine bases, creatinine is produced from creatine phosphate, and ammonia is released from glutamine, particularly by the kidney, where it helps to buffer the urine by reacting with protons to form ammonium ions $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}\right)$. These compounds are excreted mainly in the urine, but substantial amounts are also lost in the feces and through the skin. Small amounts of nitrogen-containing metabolites are formed from the degradation of neurotransmitters, hormones, and other specialized amino acid products and excreted in the urine. Some of these degradation products, such as bilirubin (formed from the degradation of heme), are excreted mainly in the feces.

Eleven of the 20 amino acids used to form proteins are synthesized in the body if an adequate amount is not present in the diet (Table VI.2). Ten of these amino acids can be produced from glucose; the 11th, tyrosine, is synthesized from the essential amino acid phenylalanine. It should be noted that cysteine, one of the

FIGURE VI.I Summary of amino acid metabolism. Dietary proteins are digested to amino acids in the stomach and intestine, which are absorbed by the intestinal epithelium, transferred to the circulation, and taken up by cells. Amino acids are used to synthesize proteins and other ni-trogen-containing compounds. The carbon skeletons of amino acids are also oxidized for energy, and the nitrogen is converted to urea and other nitrogenous excretory products.

The healthy human adult is in nitrogen balance; in other words, the amount of nitrogen excreted each day (mainly in the urine) equals the amount consumed (mainly as dietary protein). Negative nitrogen balance occurs when the amount of nitrogen excreted is greater than the amount consumed, and positive nitrogen balance occurs when the amount excreted is less than that consumed (see Chapter 1).

# TABLEVI.1 Major Nitrogenous Urinary Excretory Products

${ }^{6}$ Under normal circumstances, approximately $90 \%$ of the nitrogen excreted in the urine is in the form of urea. The exact amounts of each component vary, however, depending on dietary protein intake and physiologic state. For instance, $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$excretion increases during acidosis because the kidney secretes ammonia to bind protons in the urine.

Nine amino acids are essential in the human. "Essential" means that the carbon skeleton cannot be synthesized, and therefore, these amino acids are required in the diet (Table VI.3). The essential amino acids are also called the "indispensable" amino acids. Arginine is essential during periods of growth; in adults, it is no longer considered essential.

After nitrogen is removed from amino acids, the carbon skeletons are oxidized (Fig. VI.2). Most of the carbons are converted to pyruvate, intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, or to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). In the liver, particularly during fasting, these carbons may be converted to glucose or to ketone bodies and released into the blood. Other tissues then oxidize the glucose and ketone bodies. Ultimately, the carbons of the amino acids are converted to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

# Protein Digestion and Amino Acid Absorption 

Proteolytic enzymes (also called proteases) break down dietary proteins into their constituent amino acids in the stomach and the intestine. Many of these digestive proteases are synthesized as larger, inactive forms known as zymogens. After zymogens are secreted into the digestive tract, they are cleaved to produce the active proteases.

In the stomach, pepsin begins the digestion of proteins by hydrolyzing them to smaller polypeptides. The contents of the stomach pass into the small intestine, where enzymes produced by the exocrine pancreas act. The pancreatic proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and the carboxypeptidases) cleave the polypeptides into oligopeptides and amino acids.

Further cleavage of the oligopeptides to amino acids is accomplished by enzymes produced by the intestinal epithelial cells. These enzymes include aminopeptidases located on the brush border and other peptidases located within the cells. Ultimately, the amino acids produced by protein digestion are absorbed through the intestinal epithelial cells and enter the blood.

A large number of overlapping transport systems exist for amino acids in cells. Some systems contain facilitative transporters, whereas others express sodium-linked transporters, which allow the active transport of amino acids into cells. Defects in amino acid transport can lead to disease.

Proteins are also continually synthesized and degraded (turnover) in cells. A wide variety of proteases in cells carry out this activity. Lysosomal proteases (cathepsins) degrade proteins that enter lysosomes. Cytoplasmic proteins targeted for turnover are covalently linked to the small protein ubiquitin, which then interacts with a large protein complex, the proteasome, to degrade the protein in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent process. The amino acids released from proteins during turnover can then be used for the synthesis of new proteins or for energy generation.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Susan F., a young child with cystic fibrosis (see Chapter 17), has had repeated bouts of bronchitis/bronchiolitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With each of these infections, her response to aerosolized antibiotics has been good. However, her malabsorption of food continues, resulting in foulsmelling, glistening, bulky stools. Her growth records show a slow decline. She is now in the 24th percentile for height and the 20th percentile for weight. She is often listless and irritable, and she tires easily. When her pediatrician discovered that her levels of the serum proteins albumin and prealbumin were low to lownormal (indicating protein malnutrition), Susan was given enteric-coated microspheres of pancreatic enzymes. Almost immediately, the character of Susan's stools became more normal and she began gaining weight. Over the next 6 months, her growth curves showed improvement, and she seemed brighter, more active, and less irritable.

For the first few months after a painful episode of renal colic, during which he passed a kidney stone (see Chapter 6), David K. had faithfully maintained a high daily fluid intake and had taken the medication required to increase the pH of his urine. David had been diagnosed with cystinuria, a genetically determined amino acid substitution in the transport protein that normally reabsorbs cysteine, arginine, and lysine from the kidney lumen back into the renal tubular cells. Therefore, his urine contained high amounts of these amino acids. Cystine, which is less soluble than the other amino acids, precipitates in the urine to form renal stones (also known as calculi). The measures David was instructed to follow were necessary to increase the solubility of the large amounts of cystine present in his urine and thereby to prevent further formation of kidney stones. With time, however, he became increasingly complacent about his preventive program. After failing to take his medication for a month, he experienced another severe episode of renal colic with grossly bloody urine. Fortunately, he passed the stone spontaneously, after which he vowed to comply faithfully with his prescribed therapy.

His mother heard that some dietary amino acids were not absorbed in patients with cystinuria and asked whether any dietary changes would reduce David's chances of developing additional renal stones.

## I. Protein Digestion

The digestion of proteins begins in the stomach and is completed in the intestine (Fig. 35.1). The enzymes that digest proteins are produced as inactive precursors (zymogens) that are larger than the active enzymes. The inactive zymogens are secreted from the cells in which they are synthesized and enter the lumen of the digestive tract, where they are cleaved to smaller forms that have proteolytic activity (Fig. 35.2). These active enzymes have different specificities; no single enzyme can completely digest a protein. However, by acting in concert, they can digest dietary proteins to amino acids and small peptides, which are cleaved by peptidases associated with intestinal epithelial cells.

## A. Digestion in the Stomach

Pepsinogen is secreted by the chief cells of the stomach. The gastric parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid $(\mathrm{HCl})$. The acid in the stomach lumen alters the conformation of pepsinogen so that it can cleave itself, producing the active protease pepsin. Thus, the activation of pepsinogen is autocatalytic.

Dietary proteins are denatured by the acid in the stomach. This inactivates the proteins and partially unfolds them so that they are better substrates for proteases. However, at the low pH of the stomach, pepsin is not denatured and acts as an
![ma03589491dc](ma03589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 35.1 Digestion of proteins. The proteolytic enzymes-pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and the carboxypeptidasesare produced as zymogens (the pro and ogen, in red, accompanying the enzyme name) that are activated by cleavage after they enter the gastrointestinal lumen (see Fig. 35.2). Pepsinogen is produced within the stomach and is activated within the stomach (to pepsin) as the pH drops owing to hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) secretion.

Kwashiorkor, a common problem of children in Third World countries, is caused by a deficiency of protein in a diet that is adequate in calories. Children with kwashiorkor suffer from muscle wasting and decreased concentration of plasma proteins, particularly albumin. The result is an increase in interstitial fluid that causes edema and a distended abdomen, which makes the children appear "plump" (see Chapter 40). The muscle wasting is caused by the lack of essential amino acids in the diet; existing proteins must be broken down to produce these amino acids for new protein synthesis. These problems may be compounded by a decreased ability to produce digestive enzymes and new intestinal epithelial cells because of a decreased availability of amino acids for the synthesis of new proteins.

$\mathbf{M}$
Elastase is also found in neutrophils, which are white blood cells that engulf and destroy invading bacteria. Neutrophils frequently act in the lung, and elastase is sometimes released into the lung as the neutrophils work. In normal individuals, the released elastase is blocked from destroying lung cells by the action of circulating $\alpha_{1}$-antitrypsin, a protease inhibitor that is synthesized and secreted by the liver. Certain individuals have a genetic mutation that leads to the production of an inactive $\alpha_{1}$-antitrypsin protein ( $\alpha_{1}$-antitrypsin deficiency). The lack of this enzyme activity leads to the development of emphysema caused by proteolytic destruction of lung cells, which results in a reduction in the expansion/contraction capability of the lungs. Deficiency of $\alpha_{1}$-antitrypsin can be measured using a dried blood spot. The blood is solubilized using a buffer and then various amounts of the blood sample are incubated with antibodies specific for $\alpha_{1}$-antitrypsin. The antigenantibody complexes formed will disperse light, and the extent of light-scattering is proportional to the concentration of $\alpha_{1}$-antitrypsin in the solution. This procedure is known as rote nephelometry. Obtaining blood samples from a finger prick and allowing the blood to dry on a card enables rapid screening of individuals for this disorder.

FIGURE 35.2 Activation of the gastric and pancreatic zymogens. Pepsinogen catalyzes its own cleavage as the pH of the stomach drops. Trypsinogen is cleaved by enteropeptidase in the intestine to form the active protease trypsin. Trypsin then plays a key role by catalyzing the cleavage and activation of the other pancreatic zymogens.
endopeptidase, cleaving peptide bonds at various points within the protein chain. Although pepsin has fairly broad specificity, it tends to cleave peptide bonds in which the carboxyl group is provided by an aromatic or acidic amino acid (Fig. 35.3). Smaller peptides and some free amino acids are produced.

## B. Digestion by Enzymes from the Pancreas

As the gastric contents empty into the intestine, they encounter the secretions from the exocrine pancreas. Recall that the exocrine pancreas secretes amylase for starch digestion, and lipase and colipase for dietary triacylglycerol digestion. Another pancreatic secretion is bicarbonate, which, in addition to neutralizing stomach acid, raises the pH so that the pancreatic proteases, which are also present in pancreatic secretions, can be active. As secreted, these pancreatic proteases are in the inactive proenzyme form (zymogens). Because the active forms of these enzymes can digest each other, it is important for their zymogen forms all to be activated within a short span of time. This is accomplished by the cleavage of trypsinogen to the active enzyme trypsin, which then cleaves the other pancreatic zymogens, producing their active forms (see Fig. 35.2).

The zymogen trypsinogen is cleaved to form trypsin by enteropeptidase (a protease, formerly called enterokinase) secreted by the brush-border cells of the small intestine. Trypsin catalyzes the cleavages that convert chymotrypsinogen to the active enzyme chymotrypsin, proelastase to elastase, and the procarboxypeptidases to the carboxypeptidases. Thus, trypsin plays a central role in digestion because it both cleaves dietary proteins and activates other digestive proteases produced by the pancreas.

Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase are serine proteases (see Chapter 8) that act as endopeptidases. Trypsin is the most specific of these enzymes, cleaving peptide bonds in which the carboxyl (carbonyl) group is provided by lysine or arginine (see Fig. 35.3). Chymotrypsin is less specific but favors residues that contain hydrophobic amino acids. Elastase cleaves not only elastin (for which it was named) but also other proteins at bonds in which the carboxyl group is contributed by amino acid residues with small side chains (alanine, glycine, and serine). The actions of these pancreatic endopeptidases continue the digestion of dietary proteins begun by pepsin in the stomach.

The smaller peptides formed by the action of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase are attacked by exopeptidases, which are proteases that cleave one amino acid at a time from the end of the chain. Procarboxypeptidases, zymogens produced by the pancreas, are converted by trypsin to the active carboxypeptidases. These exopeptidases remove amino acids from the carboxyl ends of peptide chains. Carboxypeptidase A preferentially releases hydrophobic amino acids, whereas carboxypeptidase B releases basic amino acids (arginine and lysine).

## C. Digestion by Enzymes from Intestinal Cells

Exopeptidases produced by intestinal epithelial cells act within the brush border and also within the cell. Aminopeptidases, located on the brush border, cleave one amino acid at a time from the amino end of peptides. Intracellular peptidases act on small peptides that are absorbed by the cells.

The concerted action of the proteolytic enzymes produced by cells of the stomach, pancreas, and intestine cleaves dietary proteins to amino acids. The digestive enzymes digest themselves as well as dietary protein. They also digest the intestinal cells that are regularly sloughed off into the lumen. These cells are replaced by cells that mature from precursor cells in the duodenal crypts. The amount of protein that is digested and absorbed each day from digestive juices and cells released into the intestinal lumen may be equal to, or greater than, the amount of protein consumed in the diet ( 50 to 100 g ).

## II. Absorption of Amino Acids

Amino acids are absorbed from the intestinal lumen through secondary active $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ dependent transport systems and through facilitated diffusion.

## A. Cotransport of Sodium lons and Amino Acids

Amino acids are absorbed from the lumen of the small intestine principally by semispecific $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent transport proteins in the luminal membrane of the intestinal cell brush border, similar to that already seen for carbohydrate transport (Fig. 35.4). The cotransport of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and the amino acid from the outside of the apical membrane to the inside of the cell is driven by the low intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration.
![ma05589491dc](ma05589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 35.4 Transepithelial amino acid transport. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent carriers transport both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and an amino acid into the intestinal epithelial cell from the intestinal lumen. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ is pumped out on the serosal side (across the basolateral membrane) in exchange for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase. On the serosal side, the amino acid is carried by a facilitated transporter down its concentration gradient into the blood. This process is an example of secondary active transport. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $P_{0}$ inorganic phosphate.
![ma06589491dc](ma06589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 35.3 Action of the digestive proteases. Pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase are endopeptidases; they hydrolyze peptide bonds within chains. The others are exopeptidases; aminopeptidases remove the amino acid at the N terminus and the carboxypeptidases remove the amino acid at the C terminus. For each proteolytic enzyme, the amino acid residues involved in the peptide bond that is cleaved are listed beside the R group to the right of the enzyme name.

Patients with cystic fibrosis, such as Susan F., have a genetically determined defect in the function of the chloride channels. In the pancreatic secretory ducts, which carry pancreatic enzymes into the lumen of the small intestine, this defect causes inspissation (drying and thickening) of pancreatic exocrine secretions, eventually leading to obstruction of these ducts. One result of this problem is the inability of pancreatic enzymes to enter the intestinal lumen to digest dietary proteins (as well as fats and carbohydrates).

Why do patients with cystinuria and Hartnup disease have hyperaminoaciduria without associated hyperaminoacidemia?

Low intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$results from the pumping of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$out of the cell by a $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}-$ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) on the serosal membrane. Thus, the primary transport mechanism is the creation of a sodium gradient; the secondary transport process is the coupling of amino acids to the influx of sodium. This mechanism allows the cells to concentrate amino acids from the intestinal lumen. The amino acids are then transported out of the cell into the interstitial fluid principally by facilitated transporters in the serosal membrane (see Fig. 35.4).

At least six different $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent amino acid carriers are located in the apical brush-border membrane of the epithelial cells. These carriers have an overlapping specificity for different amino acids. One carrier preferentially transports neutral amino acids, another transports proline and hydroxyproline, a third preferentially transports acidic amino acids, and a fourth transports basic amino acids (lysine, arginine, the urea-cycle intermediate ornithine) and cystine (two cysteine residues linked by a disulfide bond). In addition to these $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent carriers, some amino acids are transported across the luminal membrane by facilitated transport carriers. Most amino acids are transported by more than one transport system.

As with glucose transport, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent carriers of the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells are also present in the renal epithelium. However, different isozymes are present in the cell membranes of other tissues. Conversely, the facilitated transport carriers in the serosal membrane of the intestinal epithelial are similar to those found in other cell types in the body. During starvation, the intestinal epithelia, like these other cells, take up amino acids from the blood to use as an energy source. Thus, amino acid transport across the serosal membrane is bidirectional.

## B. Transport of Amino Acids into Cells

Amino acids that enter the blood are transported across cell membranes of the various tissues principally by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent cotransporters and, to a lesser extent, by facilitated transporters (Table 35.1). In this respect, amino acid transport differs from glucose transport, which is $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent transport in the intestinal and renal epithelium but facilitated transport in other cell types. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$dependence of amino acid transport in liver, muscle, and other tissues allows these cells to concentrate amino acids from the blood. These transport proteins have a different genetic basis, amino acid composition, and somewhat different specificity than those in the luminal membrane of intestinal epithelia. They also differ somewhat among tissues. For instance, the $N$-system for glutamine uptake is present in the liver but either is not present in other tissues or is present as an isoform with different properties. As with the epithelial cell transporters, there is also some overlap in specificity of the transport proteins, with most amino acids being transported by more than one carrier.

## III. Protein Turnover and Replenishment of the Intracellular Amino Acid Pool

The amino acid pool within cells is generated both from dietary amino acids and from the degradation of existing proteins within the cell. All proteins within cells have a half-life $\left(t_{1 / 2}\right)$, a time at which $50 \%$ of the protein that was synthesized at a particular time will have been degraded. Some proteins are inherently short-lived, with half-lives of 5 to 20 minutes. Other proteins are present for extended periods, with half-lives of many hours or even days. Thus, proteins are continuously being synthesized and degraded in the body, using a variety of enzyme systems to do so (Table 35.2). Examples of proteins that undergo extensive synthesis and degradation are hemoglobin, muscle proteins, digestive enzymes, and the proteins of cells sloughed off from the gastrointestinal tract. Hemoglobin is produced in reticulocytes and reconverted to amino acids by the phagocytic cells that remove mature red blood cells from the circulation on a daily basis. Muscle protein is degraded during periods of fasting, and the amino acids are used for gluconeogenesis. After ingestion of protein in the diet, muscle protein is resynthesized. Adults cannot increase the amount of muscle or other body proteins by eating an excess amount of protein. If dietary protein is consumed in excess of our needs, it is converted to glycogen and triacylglycerols, which are then stored.

A large amount of protein is recycled daily in the form of digestive enzymes, which are themselves degraded by digestive proteases. In addition, approximately one-fourth of the cells lining the walls of the gastrointestinal tract are lost each day and replaced by newly synthesized cells. As cells leave the gastrointestinal wall, their proteins and other components are digested by enzymes in the lumen of the gut, and the products are absorbed. Additionally, red blood cells have a lifespan of about 120 days. Every day, $3 \times 10^{11}$ red blood cells die and are phagocytosed. The hemoglobin in these cells is degraded to amino acids by lysosomal proteases, and their amino acids are reused in the synthesis of new proteins. Only approximately $6 \%(\sim 10 \mathrm{~g})$ of the protein that enters the digestive tract (including dietary proteins, digestive enzymes, and the proteins in sloughed-off cells) is excreted in the feces each day. The remainder is recycled.

Proteins are also recycled within cells. The differences in amino acid composition of the various proteins of the body, the vast range in turnover times $\left(t_{1 / 2}\right)$, and the recycling of amino acids are all important factors that help to determine the requirements for specific amino acids and total protein in the diet. The synthesis of many enzymes is induced in response to physiologic demand (such as fasting or feeding). These enzymes are continuously being degraded. Intracellular proteins

| Cathepsins | Cysteine proteases | Lysosomal enzymes |
| Caspases | Cysteine proteases, which cleave after aspartate | Apoptosis; activated from procaspases (see Chapter 18) |

(1)Trace amounts of polypeptides pass into the blood. They may be transported through intestinal epithelial cells, probably by pinocytosis, or they may slip between the cells that line the gut wall. This process is particularly troublesome for premature infants, because it can lead to allergies caused by proteins in their food.

2Patients with cystinuria and Hartnup disease have defective transport proteins in both the intestine and the kidney. These patients do not absorb the affected amino acids at a normal rate from the digestive products in the intestinal lumen. They also do not readily resorb these amino acids from the glomerular filtrate into the blood. Therefore, they do not have hyperaminoacidemia (a high concentration in the blood). Normally, only a few percentage of the amino acids that enter the glomerular filtrate are excreted in the urine; most are resorbed. In these diseases, much larger amounts of the affected amino acids are excreted in the urine, resulting in hyperaminoaciduria.

David K. and other patients with cystinuria have a genetically determined defect in the transport of cystine and the basic amino acids-lysine, arginine, and ornithineacross the brush-border membranes of cells in both their small intestine and renal tubules (system $\mathrm{B}^{0+}$ ). However, they do not appear to have any symptoms of amino acid deficiency, in part because the amino acids cysteine (which is oxidized in blood and urine to form the disulfide cystine) and arginine can be synthesized in the body (i.e., they are "nonessential" amino acids). Ornithine (an amino acid that is not found in proteins but serves as an intermediate of the urea cycle) can also be synthesized. The most serious problem for these patients is the insolubility of cystine, which can form kidney stones that may lodge in the ureter, causing genitourinary bleeding, obstruction of the ureters, and severe pain known as renal colic.

are also damaged by oxidation and other modifications that limit their function. Mechanisms for intracellular degradation of unnecessary or damaged proteins involve lysosomes and the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

# A. Lysosomal Protein Turnover 

Lysosomes participate in the process of autophagy, in which intracellular components are surrounded by membranes that fuse with lysosomes, and endocytosis (see Chapter 10). Autophagy is a complex regulated process in which cytoplasm is sequestered into vesicles and delivered to the lysosomes. Within the lysosomes, the cathepsin family of proteases degrades the ingested proteins to individual amino acids. The recycled amino acids can then leave the lysosome and rejoin the intracellular amino acid pool. Although the details of how autophagy is induced are still being investigated, starvation of a cell is a trigger to induce this process. This will allow old proteins to be recycled and the newly released amino acids used for new protein synthesis, to enable the cell to survive starvation conditions. The mTOR kinase (see Chapter 34) plays a key role in regulating autophagy, as outlined in Figure 35.5.
![ma07589491dc](ma07589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 35.5 Overview of mTOR participation in autophagy. When active, the mTOR kinase will phosphorylate a protein crucial to the initiation of phagosome formation, which will inhibit autophagy. mTOR kinase is activated by Rheb-guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Under low-energy conditions (starvation) autophagy is favored as the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated, which phosphorylates the TSCI/ TSC2 complex, activating its Rheb-GTPase-activating activity. This leads to the inactivation of Rheb (Rheb-GTP is converted to the inactive Rheb-guanosine diphosphate [GDP]), which leads to the inactivation of mTOR. When inactive, mTOR does not block autophagy, and self-proteolysis is favored, as is an inhibition of protein synthesis. In the presence of growth factors, such as insulin, which activate the Akt kinase, Akt phosphorylates the TSCI/TSC2 complex at a site distinct from the AMPK site. The phosphorylation event by Akt leads to an inhibition of the TSC I/TSC2 Rheb-GTPase-activating activity, which allows Rheb to be active for extended periods of time. Active Rheb leads to activation of mTOR, and inhibition of autophagy, and activation of protein synthesis. ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

The regulatory particle (shown in this figure as the 19 S regulator; others are $\mathrm{PA} 2 \mathrm{~B} \alpha \beta 1, \mathrm{PA} 2 \mathrm{~B} \gamma$, and PA 200 ) regulates the activity of this proteolytic complex by recruiting to the complex the substrates for proteolysis. The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) requirement is to unfold and denature the proteins targeted for destruction. ADP, adenosine diphosphate.

# B. The Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway 

Ubiquitin is a small protein ( 76 amino acids) that is highly conserved. Its amino acid sequence in yeast and humans differs by only three residues. Ubiquitin targets intracellular proteins for degradation by covalently binding to the $\varepsilon$-amino group of lysine residues. This is accomplished by a three-enzyme system that adds ubiquitin to proteins targeted for degradation. Often, the target protein is polyubiquitinylated, a process in which additional ubiquitin molecules are added to previous ubiquitin molecules, forming a long ubiquitin tail on the target protein. After polyubiquitinylation is complete, the targeted protein is released from the three-enzyme complex, and is directed to the proteasome, via a variety of mechanisms.

A protease complex, known as the proteasome, then degrades the targeted protein, releasing intact ubiquitin that can again mark other proteins for degradation (Fig. 35.6). The basic proteasome is a cylindrical 20S protein complex with multiple internal proteolytic sites. ATP hydrolysis is used both to unfold the tagged protein and to push the protein into the core of the cylinder. The complex is regulated by four different types of regulatory particles (cap complexes), which bind the ubiquinylated protein (a step that requires ATP) and deliver them to the complex. After the target protein is degraded, the ubiquitin is released intact and recycled. The resulting amino acids join the intracellular pool of free amino acids.

Many proteins that contain regions rich in the amino acids proline (P), glutamate (E), serine (S), and threonine (T) have short half-lives. These regions are known as PEST sequences based on the one-letter abbreviations used for these amino acids. Most of the proteins that contain PEST sequences are hydrolyzed by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Susan F. Susan F.'s growth and weight curves were both subnormal until her pediatrician added pancreatic enzyme supplements to her treatment plan. These supplements digest dietary protein, releasing essential and other amino acids from the dietary protein, which are then absorbed by the epithelial cells of Susan's small intestine, through which they are transported into the blood.

A discernible improvement in Susan's body weight and growth curves was noted within months of starting this therapy.

Besides the proportions of essential amino acids present in various foods, the quality of a dietary protein is also determined by the rate at which it is digested and, in a more general way, by its capacity to contribute to the growth of the infant. In this regard, the proteins in foods of animal origin are more digestible than are those derived from plants. For example, the digestibility of proteins in eggs is approximately $97 \%$; that of meats, poultry, and fish is $85 \%$ to $100 \%$; and that from wheat, soybeans, and other legumes ranges from $75 \%$ to $90 \%$.

The official daily dietary "protein requirement" accepted by the US and Canadian governments is 0.8 g of protein per kilogram of desirable body weight for adults ( $\sim 56 \mathrm{~g}$ for an adult man and 44 g for an adult woman). On an average weight basis, the requirement per kilogram is much greater for infants and children. This fact underscores the importance of improving Susan F.'s protein digestion to optimize her potential for normal growth and development.

David K. In patients with cystinuria, such as David K., the inability to normally absorb cystine and basic amino acids from the gut and the increased loss of these amino acids in the urine may be expected to cause a deficiency of these compounds in the blood. However, because three of these amino acids can be synthesized in the body (i.e., they are nonessential amino acids), their concentrations in the plasma remain normal, and clinical manifestations of a deficiency state do not develop. It is not clear why symptoms related to a lysine deficiency have not been observed.

In another disorder with a transport defect, which was first observed in the Hartnup family and bears their name, the intestinal and renal transport defect involves the neutral amino acids (monoamine, monocarboxylic acids), including several essential amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) as well as certain nonessential amino acids (alanine, serine, and tyrosine). A reduction in the availability of these essential amino acids may be expected to cause a variety of clinical disorders. Yet, children with the Hartnup disorder identified by routine newborn urine screening almost always remain clinically normal.

However, some patients with the Hartnup biochemical phenotype eventually develop pellagralike manifestations, which usually include a photosensitivity rash, ataxia, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Pellagra results from a dietary deficiency of the vitamin niacin or the essential amino acid tryptophan, which are both precursors for the nicotinamide moiety of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and NADP. In asymptomatic patients, the transport abnormality may be incomplete and so subtle as to allow no phenotypic expression of Hartnup disease. These patients also may be capable of absorbing some small peptides that contain the neutral amino acids.

The only rational treatment for patients who have pellagralike symptoms is to administer niacin (nicotinic acid) in oral doses up to $300 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. Although the rash, ataxia, and neuropsychiatric manifestations of niacin deficiency may disappear, the hyperaminoaciduria and intestinal transport defect do not respond to this therapy. In addition to niacin, a high-protein diet may benefit some patients.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

The $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-Glutamyl Cycle. The $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-glutamyl cycle is necessary for the synthesis of glutathione, a compound that protects cells from oxidative damage (see Chapter 25). When it was first discovered, the cycle was thought to be important in amino acid transport, but its involvement in such transport is now thought to be limited to salvage of cysteine. The enzymes of the cycle are present in many tissues, although certain tissues lack one or more of the enzymes of the cycle.

![ma09589491dc](ma09589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 35.7 The $\gamma$-glutamyl cycle. In cells of the intestine and kidney, amino acids can be transported across the cell membrane by reacting with glutathione ( $\gamma$-glutamyl-cysteinylglycine) to form a $\gamma$-glutamyl amino acid. The amino acid is released into the cell, and glutathione is resynthesized. However, the major role of this cycle is glutathione synthesis because many tissues lack the transpeptidase and 5-oxoprolinase activities. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.

The entire cycle is presented in Figure 35.7. In this case, the extracellular amino acid reacts with glutathione ( $\gamma$-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) in a reaction catalyzed by a transpeptidase present in the cell membrane. A $\gamma$-glutamyl amino acid is formed, which travels across the cell membrane and releases the amino acid into the cell. The other products of these two reactions are reconverted to glutathione.

The reactions that convert glutamate to glutathione in the $\gamma$-glutamyl cycle are the same reactions as those required for the synthesis of glutathione. The enzymes for glutathione synthesis, but not the transpeptidase, are found in most tissues. The oxoprolinase is also missing from many tissues, so the major role of this pathway is one of glutathione synthesis from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. The transpeptidase is the only protease in the cell that can break the $\gamma$-glutamyl linkage in glutathione. Glutathione is also involved in reducing compounds such as hydrogen peroxide (see Chapter 25). It also protects cells, particularly erythrocytes, from oxidative damage, through formation of oxidized glutathione, two glutathione residues connected by a disulfide bond (see Chapter 25).

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Proteases (proteolytic enzymes) break down dietary proteins into peptides and then their constituent amino acids in the stomach and intestine.
- Pepsin initiates protein breakdown in the stomach.
- Upon entering the small intestine, inactive zymogens secreted from the pancreas are activated to continue protein digestion.
- Enzymes produced by the intestinal epithelial cells are also required to fully degrade proteins.
- The amino acids generated by proteolysis in the intestinal lumen are transported into the intestinal epithelial cells, from which they enter the circulation for use by the tissues.
- Transport systems for amino acids are similar to transport systems for monosaccharides; both facilitative and active transport systems exist.

- There are several overlapping transport systems for amino acids in cells.
- Protein degradation (turnover) occurs continuously in all cells.
- Proteins can be degraded by lysosomal enzymes (cathepsins).
- Proteins are also targeted for destruction by being covalently linked to the small protein ubiquitin.
- The ubiquitin-tagged proteins interact with the proteasome, a large complex that degrades proteins to small peptides in an ATP-dependent process.
- Amino acids released from proteins during turnover can be used for the synthesis of new proteins, for energy generation, or for gluconeogenesis.
- Diseases discussed in the chapter are summarized in Table 35.3.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is C. Trypsinogen, which is secreted by the intestine, is activated by enteropeptidase, a protein found in the intestine (thus, D is backward and incorrect). Once trypsin is formed, it activates all of the other zymogens secreted by the pancreas. Trypsin does not activate pepsinogen (thus, B is incorrect) because pepsinogen is found in the stomach and autocatalyzes its own activation when the pH drops as a result of acid secretion. Trypsin has no effect on intestinal motility (hence, E is incorrect) and also does not have a much broader base of substrates than any other protease (trypsin cleaves on the carboxyl side of basic side chains, lysine, and arginine; thus, A is incorrect).
2. The answer is C. Leucine can be transported by several different amino acid systems. Leucine is an essential amino acid, so the body cannot synthesize it (thus, A is incorrect). If the intestine cannot absorb leucine, then the kidneys do not have a chance to reabsorb it, so B is incorrect. Leucine and isoleucine have different struc-
tures and cannot substitute for each other in all positions within a protein (thus, D is incorrect). Leucine is an important component of proteins and is required for protein synthesis; hence, E is incorrect.
3. The answer is D. Kwashiorkor is a disease that results from eating a calorie-sufficient diet that lacks protein. None of the other answers is correct.
4. The answer is C. Pepsinogen, under acidic conditions, autocatalyzes its conversion to pepsin in the stomach. Both enteropeptidase and aminopeptidases are synthesized in active form by the intestine (thus, A and D are incorrect). Enteropeptidase activates trypsinogen (thus, B is incorrect), which then activates proelastase (thus, E is incorrect).
5. The answer is E. Because of the lack of protein in the diet, protein synthesis in the liver is impaired (lack of essential amino acids). The liver can still synthesize fatty acids from carbohydrate or fat sources, but very-lowdensity lipoprotein (VLDL) particles cannot be assembled because of the shortage of apolipoprotein B-100.

Thus, the fatty acids remain in the liver, leading to a fatty liver. None of the other answers explains this finding.
6. The answer is C. Branched-chain amino acids can be oxidized in many tissues, but the nitrogen must travel to the liver for disposal. The muscle is the primary site of branched-chain amino acid oxidation because of the high level of the branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase in that tissue. Amino acid carbons can be oxidized directly, converted to glucose, and then oxidized or stored as glycogen, or they can be converted to fatty acids and stored as adipose triacylglycerols. Although urea is the major nitrogenous excretory product, nitrogen is also excreted in other compounds such as uric acid, creatinine, and ammonia. These compounds are excreted mostly in the urine, but substantial amounts are lost in feces and through the skin.
7. The answer is B. Pepsin is synthesized in the stomach. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidases are secreted from the pancreas into the small intestine. Aminopeptidases are found on the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells. Cathepsins degrade proteins that enter lysosomes. Ubiquitin is a small protein that is covalently linked to proteins targeted for turnover in the cytoplasm.
8. The answer is D. Elastase, found in neutrophils, can be released into the lung, where it causes proteolytic destruction of normal lung cells, leading to emphysema. $\alpha$-Antitrypsin is a protease inhibitor synthesized in the liver and released into the circulation that blocks the action of elastase in the lung. Trypsin is not found in the lung. $\alpha$-Antitrypsin was named owing to the fact that it will also inhibit trypsin activity, although that is not its physiologic function.
9. The answer is E. Trypsinogen is cleaved by the enzyme enteropeptidase, which is secreted by the brush-border cells of the small intestine. Trypsin then cleaves chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, and procarboxypeptidase to their active forms. Pepsinogen is essentially autocatalytic in the presence of acid and is found in the stomach. Pepsin does not activate zymogens in the small intestine.
10. The answer is E. Proteins are constantly being synthesized and degraded. Only about $6 \%$ of protein that enters the gastrointestinal tract is excreted in feces each day. The remainder is recycled. Excess proteins above dietary and metabolic needs are converted to glycogen and triacylglycerols for storage. The patient will gain weight as adipose tissue instead of increasing muscle mass.

# Fate of Amino Acid Nitrogen: Urea Cycle 

In comparison with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, the metabolism of amino acids is complex. We must be concerned not only with the fate of the carbon atoms of the amino acids but also with the fate of the nitrogen. During their metabolism, amino acids travel in the blood from one tissue to another. Ultimately, most of the nitrogen is converted to urea in the liver, and the carbons are oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ by several tissues (Fig. 36.1).

After a meal that contains protein, amino acids released by digestion (see Chapter 35) pass from the gut through the hepatic portal vein to the liver (see Fig. 36.2A). In a normal diet containing 60 to 100 g of protein, most of the amino acids are used for the synthesis of proteins in the liver and in other tissues. Excess amino acids may be converted to glucose or triacylglycerol.

During fasting, muscle protein is cleaved to amino acids. Some of the amino acids are partially oxidized to produce energy (see Fig. 36.2B). Portions of these amino acids are converted to alanine and glutamine, which, along with other amino acids, are released into the blood. Glutamine is oxidized by various tissues, including the lymphocytes, gut, and kidney, which convert some of the carbons and nitrogen to alanine. Alanine and other amino acids travel to the liver, where the carbons are converted to glucose and ketone bodies and the nitrogen is converted to urea, which is excreted by the kidneys. Glucose, produced by gluconeogenesis, is subsequently oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ by many tissues, and ketone bodies are oxidized by tissues such as muscle and kidney.

Several enzymes are important in the process of interconverting amino acids and in removing nitrogen so that the carbon skeletons can be oxidized. These include dehydratases, transaminases, glutamate dehydrogenase, glutaminase, and deaminases.

The conversion of amino acid nitrogen to urea occurs mainly in the liver. Urea is formed in the urea cycle from $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, bicarbonate, and the nitrogen of aspartate (see Fig. 36.1). Initially, $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, bicarbonate, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) react to produce carbamoyl phosphate, which reacts with ornithine to form citrulline. Aspartate then reacts with citrulline to form argininosuccinate, which releases fumarate, forming arginine. Finally, arginase cleaves arginine to release urea and regenerate ornithine. The cycle is regulated in a feed-forward manner, such that when amino acid degradation is occurring, the rate of the cycle is increased.

FIGURE 36.1 Fate of amino acid carbons and nitrogen. Amino acid carbon can be used either for energy storage (glycogen, fatty acids) or for energy. Amino acid nitrogen is used for urea synthesis. One nitrogen of urea comes from $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, the other from aspartate.

![ma11589491dc](ma11589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 36.2 Roles of various tissues in amino acid metabolism. A. In the fed state, amino acids released by digestion of dietary proteins travel through the hepatic portal vein to the liver, where they are used for the synthesis of proteins, particularly the blood proteins, such as serum albumin. The carbon skeletons of excess amino acids are converted to glucose or to triacylglycerols. The latter are then packaged and secreted in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). The glucose produced from amino acids in the fed state is stored as glycogen or released into the blood if blood glucose levels are low. Amino acids that pass through the liver are converted to proteins in cells of other tissues. B. During fasting, amino acids are released from muscle protein. Some enter the blood directly. Others are partially oxidized and the nitrogen stored in the form of alanine and glutamine, which enter the blood. In the kidney, glutamine releases ammonia into the urine and is converted to alanine and serine. In the cells of the gut, glutamine is converted to alanine. Alanine (the major gluconeogenic amino acid) and other amino acids enter the liver, where their nitrogen is converted to urea, which is excreted in the urine, and their carbons are converted to glucose and ketone bodies, which are oxidized by various tissues for energy. RBCs, red blood cells; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Percy V. and his high school friend decided to take a Caribbean cruise, during which they sampled the cuisine of many of the islands on their itinerary. One month after their return to the United States, Percy complained of severe malaise, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, headache, and abdominal pain. He had a low-grade fever and noted a persistent and increasing pain in the area of his liver. His friend noted a yellow discoloration of the whites of Percy's eyes and skin. Percy's urine turned the color of iced tea, and his stool became a light clay color. His doctor found his liver to be enlarged and tender. Liver function tests were ordered.

Serologic testing for viral hepatitis types B and C were nonreactive, but tests for antibodies to antigens of the hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) in the serum were positive for the immunoglobulin M type.

A diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis type A was made, probably contracted from virus-contaminated food Percy had eaten while on his cruise. His physician explained that there was no specific treatment for type A viral hepatitis but recommended symptomatic and supportive care and prevention of transmission to others by the fecal-oral route. Percy took acetaminophen three to four times a day for fever and headaches throughout his illness.

## I. Fate of Amino Acid Nitrogen

## A. Transamination Reactions

Transamination is the major process for removing nitrogen from amino acids. In most instances, the nitrogen is transferred as an amino group from the original amino acid to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate, whereas the original amino acid is converted to its corresponding $\alpha$-keto acid (Fig. 36.3). For example, the amino acid aspartate can be transaminated to form its corresponding $\alpha$-keto acid, oxaloacetate. In the process, the amino group is transferred to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, which is converted to its corresponding amino acid, glutamate.

All amino acids except lysine and threonine undergo transamination reactions. The enzymes that catalyze these reactions are known as transaminases or aminotransferases. For most of these reactions, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and glutamate serve as one of the $\alpha$-keto acid-amino acid pairs. Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP; derived from vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ ) is the required cofactor for these reactions.

Overall, in a transamination reaction, an amino group from one amino acid becomes the amino group of a second amino acid. Because these reactions are readily reversible, they can be used to remove nitrogen from amino acids or to transfer nitrogen to $\alpha$-keto acids to form amino acids. Thus, they are involved both in amino acid degradation and in amino acid synthesis.

## B. Removal of Amino Acid Nitrogen as Ammonia

Cells in the body and bacteria in the gut release the nitrogen of certain amino acids as ammonia or ammonium ion $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}\right)$(Fig. 36.4). Because these two forms of nitrogen can be interconverted, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Ammonium ion releases a proton to form ammonia by a reaction with a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of 9.3. Therefore, at physiologic pH , the equilibrium favors $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$by a factor of approximately 100/1 (see Chapter 4, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation). However, it is important to note that $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is also present in the body because this is the form that can cross cell membranes. For example, $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ passes into the urine from kidney tubule cells and decreases the acidity of the urine by binding protons, forming $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$. Once the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$is formed, the compound can no longer freely diffuse across membranes.
![ma12589491dc](ma12589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 36.3 Transamination. The amino group from one amino acid is transferred to another. Pairs of amino acids and their corresponding $\alpha$-keto acids are involved in these reactions. $\alpha$-Ketoglutarate and glutamate are usually one of the pairs. The reactions, which are readily reversible, use pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. The enzymes are called transaminases or aminotransferases. A. A generalized reaction. B. The aspartate transaminase reaction.

![ma13589491dc](ma13589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 36.4 Summary of the sources of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$for the urea cycle. All of the reactions are irreversible except that of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Only the dehydratase reactions, which produce $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$from serine and threonine, require pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. The reactions that are not shown occurring in the muscle or the gut can all occur in the liver, where the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$generated can be converted to urea. The purine nucleotide cycle of the brain and muscle is described further in Chapter 39. NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

Glutamate is oxidatively deaminated by a reaction catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase that produces ammonium ion and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate (Fig. 36.5). Either nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$or $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$can serve as the cofactor. This reaction, which occurs in the mitochondria of most cells, is readily reversible; it can incorporate ammonia into glutamate or release ammonia from glutamate. Glutamate can collect nitrogen from other amino acids as a consequence of transamination reactions and then release ammonia through the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction. This process provides one source of the ammonia that enters the
![ma14589491dc](ma14589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 36.5 Reaction catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. This reaction is readily reversible and can use either nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$or $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$as a cofactor. The oxygen on $\alpha$-ketoglutarate is derived from $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

urea cycle. Glutamate dehydrogenase is one of three mammalian enzymes that can "fix" ammonia into organic molecules. The other two are glutamine synthetase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI).

In addition to glutamate, several amino acids release their nitrogen as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$ (see Fig. 36.4). Histidine may be directly deaminated to form $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and urocanate. The deaminations of serine and threonine are dehydration reactions that require PLP and are catalyzed by serine dehydratase. Serine forms pyruvate, and threonine forms $\alpha$-ketobutyrate. In both cases, $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$is released.

Glutamine and asparagine contain R-group amides that may be released as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$by deamidation. Asparagine is deamidated by asparaginase, yielding aspartate and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$. Glutaminase acts on glutamine, forming glutamate and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$. The glutaminase reaction is particularly important in the kidney, where the ammonium ion produced is excreted directly into the urine, where it forms salts with metabolic acids, facilitating their removal in the urine.

In muscle and brain, but not in liver, the purine nucleotide cycle allows $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$ to be released from amino acids (see Fig. 36.4). Nitrogen is collected by glutamate from other amino acids by means of transamination reactions. Glutamate then transfers its amino group to oxaloacetate to form aspartate, which supplies nitrogen to the purine nucleotide cycle (see Chapter 39). The reactions of the cycle release fumarate and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$. The ammonium ion formed can leave the muscle in the form of glutamine.

In summary, $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$that enters the urea cycle is produced in the body by deamination or deamidation of amino acids (see Fig. 36.4). A significant amount of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$ is also produced by bacteria that live in the lumen of the intestinal tract. This ammonium ion enters the hepatic portal vein and travels to the liver.

## C. Role of Glutamate in the Metabolism of Amino Acid Nitrogen

Glutamate plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of amino acids. It is involved in both synthesis and degradation.

Glutamate provides nitrogen for amino acid synthesis (Fig. 36.6). In this process, glutamate obtains its nitrogen either from other amino acids by transamination reactions or from $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$by the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction. Transamination reactions then serve to transfer amino groups from glutamate to $\alpha$-keto acids to produce their corresponding amino acids.

When amino acids are degraded and urea is formed, glutamate collects nitrogen from other amino acids by transamination reactions. Some of this nitrogen
![ma15589491dc](ma15589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 36.6 Role of glutamate in amino acid synthesis. Glutamate transfers nitrogen by means of transamination reactions to $\alpha$-keto acids to form amino acids. This nitrogen is either obtained by glutamate from transamination of other amino acids or from $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$by means of the glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) reaction. PLP, pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ (pyridoxine).

(1)Percy V. 5 laboratory studies showed that his serum alanine transaminase (ALT) level was 675 U/L (reference range, 5 to 30 U/L), and his serum aspartate transaminase (AST) level was 601 U/L (reference range, 10 to 30 U/L). His serum alkaline phosphatase level was 284 U/L (reference range, adult male $=40$ to 125 U/L), and his serum total bilirubin was $9.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range, 0.2 to $1.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Bilirubin is a degradation product of heme, as described in Chapter 42.

Cellular enzymes such as AST,ALT, and alkaline phosphatase leak into the blood through the membranes of hepatic cells that have been damaged as a result of the inflammatory process. In acute viral hepatitis, the serum ALT level is often elevated to a greater extent than the serum AST level. Alkaline phosphatase, which is present on membranes between liver cells and the bile duct, is also elevated in the blood in acute viral hepatitis.

The rise in serum total bilirubin occurs as a result of the inability of the infected liver to conjugate bilirubin and of a partial or complete occlusion of the hepatic biliary drainage ducts caused by inflammatory swelling within the liver. In fulminant hepatic failure, the serum bilirubin level may exceed $20 \mathrm{mg} /$ dL, a poor prognostic sign.

(2)Vitamin $B_{6}$ deficiency symptoms include dermatitis; a microcytic, hypochromic anemia; weakness; irritability; and, in some cases, seizures. Xanthurenic acid (a degradation product of tryptophan) and other compounds appear in the urine because of an inability to completely metabolize amino acids. A decreased ability to synthesize heme from glycine may cause the microcytic anemia (see Chapter 42), and decreased decarboxylation of amino acids to form neurotransmitters (see Chapter 46) may explain the convulsions. Although vitamin $B_{6}$ is required for a large number of reactions involved in amino acid metabolism, it is also required for the glycogen phosphorylase reaction (see Chapter 27).

FIGURE 36.7 Role of glutamate in urea production. Glutamate collects nitrogen from other amino acids by transamination reactions. This nitrogen can be released as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$is also produced by other reactions (see Fig. 36.4). $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$provides one of the nitrogens for urea synthesis. The other nitrogen comes from aspartate and is obtained from glutamate by transamination of oxaloacetate.
is released as ammonia by the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction, but much larger amounts of ammonia are produced from the other sources shown in Figure 36.4. $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$is one of the two forms in which nitrogen enters the urea cycle (Fig. 36.7).

The second form of nitrogen for urea synthesis is provided by aspartate (see Fig. 36.7). Glutamate can be the source of the nitrogen. Glutamate transfers its amino group to oxaloacetate, and aspartate and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate are formed.

# D. Role of Alanine and Glutamine in Transporting Amino Acid Nitrogen to the Liver 

Protein turnover and amino acid degradation occur in all tissues; however, the urea-cycle enzymes are active primarily in the liver (the intestine expresses low levels of activity of these enzymes; see Chapter 40). Thus, a mechanism needs to be in place to transport amino acid nitrogen to the liver. Alanine and glutamine are the major carriers of nitrogen in the blood. Alanine is primarily exported by muscle. Because the muscle is metabolizing glucose through glycolysis, pyruvate is available in the muscle. The pyruvate is transaminated by glutamate to form alanine, which travels to the liver (Fig. 36.8). The glutamate is formed by transamination of an amino acid that is being degraded. Upon arriving at the liver, alanine is transaminated to pyruvate, and the nitrogen is used for urea synthesis. The pyruvate formed is used for gluconeogenesis and the
![ma17589491dc](ma17589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 36.8 The glucose-alanine cycle. Within the muscle, amino acid degradation leads to the transfer of nitrogens to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate ( $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$ ) and pyruvate. The alanine formed travels to the liver, where the carbons of alanine are used for gluconeogenesis and the alanine nitrogen is used for urea biosynthesis. This could occur during exercise, when the muscle uses bloodborne glucose (see Chapter 45).

![ma18589491dc](ma18589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 36.9 Synthesis of glutamine in peripheral tissues and its transport to the liver. Within the liver, glutaminase converts glutamine to glutamate. Note how $\alpha$-ketoglutarate ( $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$ ) can accept two molecules of ammonia to form glutamine. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.
glucose exported to the muscle for use as energy. This cycle of moving carbons and nitrogen between the muscle and liver is known as the glucose-alanine cycle.

Glutamine is synthesized from glutamate by the fixation of ammonia, requiring energy (ATP) and the enzyme glutamine synthetase (Fig. 36.9), which is a cytoplasmic enzyme found in all cells. In the liver, glutamine synthetase is located in cells surrounding the portal vein. Its major role is to convert any ammonia that has escaped from urea production into glutamine, so that free ammonia does not leave the liver and enter the circulation.

Under conditions of rapid amino acid degradation within a tissue, so that ammonia levels increase, the glutamate that has been formed from transamination reactions accepts another nitrogen molecule to form glutamine. The glutamine travels to the liver, kidney, or intestines, where glutaminase (see Fig. 36.9) will remove the amide nitrogen to form glutamate plus ammonia. In the kidney, the release of ammonia, and the formation of ammonium ion, serves to form salts with metabolic acids in the urine. In the intestine, the glutamine is used as a fuel (see Chapter 40). In the liver, the ammonia is used for urea biosynthesis.

## II. Urea Cycle

The normal human adult is in nitrogen balance; that is, the amount of nitrogen ingested each day, mainly in the form of dietary protein, is equal to the amount of nitrogen excreted. The major nitrogenous excretory product is urea, which exits from the body in the urine. This innocuous compound, produced mainly in the liver by the urea cycle, serves as the disposal form of ammonia, which is toxic, particularly to the brain and central nervous system (CNS). Normally, little ammonia (or $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$) is present in the blood. The concentration ranges between 30 and $60 \mu \mathrm{M}$. Ammonia is rapidly removed from the blood and converted to urea by the liver. Nitrogen travels in the blood mainly in amino acids, particularly alanine and glutamine. The urea cycle was proposed in 1932 by Hans Krebs and a medical student, Kurt Henseleit, based on their laboratory observations. It was originally called the Krebs-Henseleit cycle. Subsequently, Krebs used this concept of metabolic cycling to explain a second process that also bears his name, the Krebs (or tricarboxylic acid [TCA]) cycle.

## A. Reactions of the Urea Cycle

Nitrogen enters the urea cycle as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$and aspartate (Fig. 36.10). $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$forms carbamoyl phosphate, which reacts with ornithine to form citrulline. Ornithine is the compound that both initiates and is regenerated by the cycle (similar to oxaloacetate in the TCA cycle). Aspartate reacts with citrulline, eventually donating its nitrogen

(1)Percy V: symptoms and laboratory abnormalities did not slowly subside over the next 6 weeks, as they usually do in uncomplicated viral hepatitis A infections. Instead, his serum total bilirubin, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels increased further. His vomiting became intractable, and his friend noted jerking motions of his arms (asterixis), facial grimacing, restlessness, slowed mentation, and slight disorientation. He was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of hepatic failure with incipient hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction caused by accumulation of various toxins in the blood), a rare complication of acute type A viral hepatitis alone. The possibility of a superimposed acute hepatic toxicity caused by the use of acetaminophen was considered.

for urea formation. Arginine is formed in two successive steps. Cleavage of arginine by arginase releases urea and regenerates ornithine.

# I. Synthesis of Carbamoyl Phosphate 

In the first step of the urea cycle, $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, bicarbonate, and ATP react to form carbamoyl phosphate (see Fig. 36.10). The cleavage of two molecules of ATP is required to form the high-energy phosphate bond of carbamoyl phosphate. CPSI, the enzyme that catalyzes this first step of the urea cycle, is found mainly in mitochondria of the liver and intestine. The Roman numeral suggests that another carbamoyl phosphate synthetase exists, and indeed, CPSII, located in the cytosol, produces carbamoyl phosphate for pyrimidine biosynthesis, using nitrogen from glutamine (see Chapter 39).

## 2. Production of Arginine by the Urea Cycle

Carbamoyl phosphate reacts with ornithine to form citrulline (see Fig. 36.10). The high-energy phosphate bond of carbamoyl phosphate provides the energy required

for this reaction, which occurs in mitochondria and is catalyzed by ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC). The product citrulline is transported across the mitochondrial membranes in exchange for cytoplasmic ornithine and enters the cytosol. The carrier for this transport reaction catalyzes an electroneutral exchange of the two compounds.

In the cytosol, citrulline reacts with aspartate, the second source of nitrogen for urea synthesis, to produce argininosuccinate (see Fig. 36.10). This reaction, catalyzed by argininosuccinate synthetase, is driven by the hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate. Aspartate is produced by transamination of oxaloacetate.

Argininosuccinate is cleaved by argininosuccinate lyase to form fumarate and arginine (see Fig. 36.10). Fumarate is produced from the carbons of argininosuccinate provided by aspartate. Fumarate is converted to malate (using cytoplasmic fumarase), which is used either for the synthesis of glucose by the gluconeogenic pathway or for the regeneration of oxaloacetate by cytoplasmic reactions similar to those observed in the TCA cycle (Fig. 36.11). The oxaloacetate that is formed is transaminated to generate the aspartate that carries nitrogen into the urea cycle. Thus, the carbons of fumarate can be recycled to aspartate.

## 3. Cleavage of Arginine to Produce Urea

Arginine, which contains nitrogens derived from $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and aspartate, is cleaved by arginase, producing urea and regenerating ornithine (see Fig. 36.10). Urea is produced from the guanidinium group on the side chain of arginine. The portion of arginine originally derived from ornithine is reconverted to ornithine.

The reactions by which citrulline is converted to arginine and arginine is cleaved to produce urea occur in the cytosol. Ornithine, the other product of the arginase reaction, is transported into the mitochondrion in exchange for citrulline, where it can react with carbamoyl phosphate, initiating another round of the cycle.

## B. Origin of Ornithine

Ornithine is an amino acid. However, it is not incorporated into proteins during the process of protein synthesis because no genetic codon exists for this amino acid. Although ornithine is normally regenerated by the urea cycle (as one of the products of the arginase reaction), ornithine also can be synthesized de novo if needed. The reaction is an unusual transamination reaction catalyzed by ornithine aminotransferase under specific conditions in the intestine (Fig. 36.12). The usual direction of this reaction is the formation of glutamate semialdehyde, which is the first step of the degradation pathway for ornithine.
![ma20589491dc](ma20589491dc.jpg)

0When OTC is deficient, the carbamoyl phosphate that normally would enter the urea cycle accumulates and floods the pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis. Carbamoyl phosphate, produced by a cytoplasmic enzyme (CPSII), is the precursor for pyrimidine synthesis. Under these conditions, excess orotic acid (orotate), an intermediate in pyrimidine biosynthesis, is excreted in the urine. It produces no ill effects but is indicative of a problem in the urea cycle.

![ma22589491dc](ma22589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 36.12 The ornithine aminotransferase reaction. This is a reversible reaction that requires pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), which normally favors ornithine degradation.

The precise pathogenesis of the CNS signs and symptoms that accompany liver failure (hepatic encephalopathy) in patients such as PercyV, is not completely understood. These changes are, however, attributable in part to toxic materials that are derived from the metabolism of nitrogenous substrates by bacteria in the gut that circulate to the liver in the portal vein. These materials bypass their normal metabolism by the liver cells, however, because the acute inflammatory process of viral hepatitis severely limits the ability of liver cells to degrade these compounds to harmless metabolites. As a result, these toxins are shunted into the hepatic veins unaltered and eventually reach the brain through the systemic circulation ("portal-systemic encephalopathy").

NH4 ${ }^{+}$is one of the toxins that results from the degradation of urea or proteins by intestinal bacteria and is not metabolized by the infected liver. The subsequent elevation of ammonia concentrations in the fluid bathing the brain causes depletion of TCA-cycle intermediates and ATP in the CNS. $\alpha$-Ketoglutarate, a TCA-cycle intermediate, combines with ammonia to form glutamate in a reaction catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. Glutamate subsequently reacts with ammonia to form glutamine. This effectively reduces $\alpha$-ketoglutarate levels in the mitochondria, thereby reducing the rate at which the TCA cycle can operate.

The absolute level of ammonia and its metabolites, such as glutamine, in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid in patients with hepatic encephalopathy correlates only roughly with the presence or severity of the neurologic signs and symptoms. $\gamma$-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), an important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, is also produced in the gut lumen and is shunted into the systemic circulation in increased amounts in patients with hepatic failure. In addition, other compounds (such as aromatic amino acids, false neurotransmitters, and certain short-chain fatty acids) bypass liver metabolism and accumulate in the systemic circulation, adversely affecting CNS function. Their relative importance in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy remains to be determined.

## C. Regulation of the Urea Cycle

The human liver has a vast capacity to convert amino acid nitrogen to urea, thereby preventing toxic effects from ammonia, which would otherwise accumulate. In general, the urea cycle is regulated by substrate availability; the higher the rate of ammonia production, the higher is the rate of urea formation. Regulation by substrate availability is a general characteristic of disposal pathways, such as the urea cycle, which remove toxic compounds from the body. This is a type of feed-forward regulation, in contrast to the feedback regulation characteristic of pathways that produce functional end products.

Two other types of regulation control the urea cycle: allosteric activation of CPSI by N -acetylglutamate (NAG) and induction and repression of the synthesis of urea-cycle enzymes. NAG is formed specifically to activate CPSI; it has no other known function in mammals. The synthesis of NAG from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and glutamate is stimulated by arginine (Fig. 36.13). Thus, as arginine levels increase within the liver, two important reactions are stimulated. The first is the synthesis of NAG, which increases the rate at which carbamoyl phosphate is produced. The second is to produce more ornithine (via the arginase reaction) such that the cycle can operate more rapidly.

The induction of urea-cycle enzymes occurs in response to conditions that require increased protein metabolism, such as a high-protein diet or prolonged fasting. In both of these physiologic states, as amino acid carbon is converted to glucose, amino acid nitrogen is converted to urea. The induction of the synthesis of urea-cycle enzymes under these conditions occurs even though the uninduced enzyme levels are far in excess of the capacity required. The ability of a highprotein diet to increase urea-cycle enzyme levels is another type of feed-forward regulation.

## D. Function of the Urea Cycle during Fasting

During fasting, the liver maintains blood glucose levels. Amino acids from muscle protein are a major carbon source for the production of glucose by the pathway of gluconeogenesis. As amino acid carbons are converted to glucose, the nitrogens are converted to urea. Thus, the urinary excretion of urea is high during fasting (Fig. 36.14).
![ma23589491dc](ma23589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 36.14 Nitrogen excretion during fasting. Human subjects were initially given intravenous (IV) glucose as indicated, then fasted. Total nitrogen excretion was measured as well as the nitrogen in urea (brown area). (Based on Ruderman NB, Aoki TT, Cahill GF Jr. Gluconeogenesis and its disorders in man. In: Hanson RW, Mehlman MA, eds. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. New York, NY: John Wiley \& Sons; 1976:518.)

As fasting progresses, however, the brain begins to use ketone bodies, sparing blood glucose. Less muscle protein is cleaved to provide amino acids for gluconeogenesis, and decreased production of glucose from amino acids is accompanied by decreased production of urea (see Chapter 28).

The major amino acid substrate for gluconeogenesis is alanine, which is synthesized in peripheral tissues to act as a nitrogen carrier (see Fig. 36.8). Glucagon release, which is expected during fasting, stimulates alanine transport into the liver by activating the transcription of transport systems for alanine. Two molecules of alanine are required to generate one molecule of glucose. The nitrogen from the two molecules of alanine is converted to one molecule of urea (Fig. 36.15).

## E. Disorders of the Urea Cycle

Disorders of the urea cycle are dangerous because of the accumulation of ammonia in the circulation. Ammonia is toxic to the nervous system, and its concentration in the body must be carefully controlled. Under normal conditions,
![ma25589491dc](ma25589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 36.15 Conversion of alanine to glucose and urea. (I) Alanine, the key gluconeogenic amino acid, is transaminated to form pyruvate, which is converted to glucose. The nitrogen, now in glutamate, can be released as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$(2) or transferred to oxaloacetate to form aspartate (3). $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and aspartate enter the urea cycle, which produces urea. In summary, the carbons of alanine form glucose and the nitrogens form urea. Two molecules of alanine are required to produce one molecule of glucose and one molecule of urea. NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

0In addition to producing urea, the reactions of the urea cycle also serve as the pathway for the biosynthesis of arginine. Therefore, this amino acid is not required in the diet of the adult; however, it is required in the diet for growth. Urea is not cleaved by human enzymes. However, bacteria, including those in the human digestive tract, can cleave urea to ammonia and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, using the enzyme urease. Urease is not produced by humans.

To some extent, humans excrete urea into the gut and saliva. Intestinal bacteria convert urea to ammonia. This ammonia, as well as ammonia produced by other bacterial reactions in the gut, is absorbed into the hepatic portal vein. It is normally extracted by the liver and converted to urea. Approximately one fourth of the total urea released by the liver each day is recycled by bacteria.

0Blood ammonia levels can be determined in several ways. One is to use an ammonia-specific electrode. Another is to use enzyme-coupled reactions that result in either a color change or an absorbance change. One enzyme-coupled system takes advantage of glutamate dehydrogenase. The unknown sample is incubated with glutamate dehydrogenase, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and NADPH. If ammonia is present, glutamate will be produced as will NADP ${ }^{+}$. As NADPH is converted to NADP ${ }^{+}$, the absorbance of light at 340 nm will decrease, and because one NADP ${ }^{+}$is formed per ammonia molecule used, the concentration of ammonia can be determined.

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a measurement for the urea content of the blood. The key to measuring BUN is to split urea into carbon dioxide and two ammonia molecules by the bacterial enzyme urease. The ammonia levels are then determined as described previously or via a colormetric assay based on pH indicator dyes. As ammonia is generated, it binds protons, forming ammonium ions, which raises the pH . The extent of the pH change will be proportional to the amount of ammonia generated. Once BUN is determined, the urea concentration can be determined (in milligrams per deciliter) by multiplying the nitrogen value by 2.14 .

free ammonia is rapidly fixed into either $\alpha$-ketoglutarate (by glutamate dehydrogenase, to form glutamate) or glutamate (by glutamine synthetase, to form glutamine). The glutamine can be used by many tissues, including the liver; the glutamate donates nitrogens to pyruvate to form alanine, which travels to the liver. Within the liver, as the nitrogens are removed from their carriers, CPSI fixes the ammonia into carbamoyl phosphate to initiate the urea cycle. However, when a urea-cycle enzyme is defective, the cycle is interrupted, which leads to an accumulation of urea-cycle intermediates before the block. Because of the block in the urea cycle, glutamine levels increase in the circulation, and because $\alpha$-ketoglutarate is no longer being regenerated by removal of nitrogen from glutamine, the $\alpha$-ketoglutarate levels are too low to fix more free ammonia, leading to elevated ammonia levels in the blood. Therefore, defects in any urea-cycle enzyme lead to elevated glutamine and ammonia levels in the circulation. However, the extent of the elevation depends on which enzyme is defective; see question 1 at the end of this chapter.

Ammonia toxicity will lead to brain swelling, caused, in part, by an osmotic imbalance owing to high levels of both ammonia and glutamine in the astrocytes. As ammonia levels increase in the astrocytes, more glutamine is produced (via glutamine synthetase), which only exacerbates the osmotic imbalance. The ammonia levels inhibit glutaminase, leading to glutamine elevation. Additionally, high levels of glutamine alter the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, leading to an opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which leads to cell death (see Chapter 24). Another toxic effect of ammonia is a lowering of glutamate levels (owing to the high activity of the glutamine synthetase reaction). Glutamate is a neurotransmitter, and glutamatergic neurotransmission, if impaired, causes brain dysfunction because glutamate is one of the excitatory neurotransmitters, and in the absence of glutamate neurotransmission, lethargy and reduced nervous system activity can result.

The most common urea-cycle defect is OTC deficiency, which is an X-linked disorder. This disorder occurs with a frequency of about 1 in 80,000 people.

The major clinical problem in treating patients with urea-cycle defects is reducing the effects of excessive blood ammonia on the nervous system. High ammonia levels can lead to irreversible neuronal damage and intellectual disability. So, how is hyperammonemia treated?

The key to treating patients with urea-cycle defects is to diagnose the disease early and then treat aggressively with compounds that can aid in nitrogen removal from the patient. Low-protein diets are essential to reduce the potential for excessive amino acid degradation. If the enzyme defect in the urea cycle comes after the synthesis of argininosuccinate, massive arginine supplementation has proved beneficial. Once argininosuccinate has been synthesized, the two nitrogen molecules destined for excretion have been incorporated into the substrate; the problem is that ornithine cannot be regenerated. If ornithine could be replenished to allow the cycle to continue, argininosuccinate could be used as the carrier for nitrogen excretion from the body. Thus, ingesting large levels of arginine leads to ornithine production by the arginase reaction, and nitrogen excretion via argininosuccinate in the urine can be enhanced.

Arginine therapy will not work for enzyme defects that exist in steps before the synthesis of argininosuccinate. For these disorders, drugs are used that form conjugates with amino acids. The conjugated amino acids are excreted, and the body then has to use its nitrogen to resynthesize the excreted amino acid. The two compounds most frequently used are benzoic acid and phenylbutyrate (the active component of phenylbutyrate is phenylacetate, its oxidation product. Phenylacetate has a bad odor, which makes it difficult to take orally). As indicated in Figure 36.16A, benzoic acid, after activation, reacts with glycine to form hippuric acid, which is excreted. As glycine is synthesized from serine, the body now uses nitrogens to synthesize

![ma26589491dc](ma26589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 36.16 The metabolism of benzoic acid (A) and phenylbutyrate (B), two agents used to reduce nitrogen levels in patients with urea-cycle defects. CoA, coenzyme A; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $P P_{i}$, pyrophosphate.
serine, so more glycine can be produced. Phenylacetate (see Fig. 36.16B) forms a conjugate with glutamine, which is excreted. This conjugate removes two nitrogens per molecule and requires the body to resynthesize glutamine from glucose, thereby using another two nitrogen molecules.

Urea-cycle defects are excellent candidates for treatment by gene therapy. This is because the defect has to be repaired in only one cell type (in this case, the hepatocyte), which makes it easier to target the vector carrying the replacement gene. Preliminary gene therapy experiments had been carried out on individuals with OTC deficiency (the most common inherited defect of the urea cycle), but the experi-

ments came to a halt when one of the patients died of a severe immunologic reaction to the vector used to deliver the gene. This incident led to a review and improvements of gene therapy protocols in the United States.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

$\mathscr{H}$Percy V. The two most serious complications of acute viral hepatitis found in patients such as Percy V, are massive hepatic necrosis leading to fulminant liver failure and the eventual development of chronic hepatitis. Both complications are rare in acute viral hepatitis type A, however, suggesting that acetaminophen toxicity may have contributed to Percy's otherwise unexpectedly severe hepatocellular dysfunction and early hepatic encephalopathy.

Fortunately, bed rest, rehydration, parenteral nutrition, and therapy directed at decreasing the production of toxins that result from bacterial degradation of nitrogenous substrates in the gut lumen (e.g., administration of lactulose, which reduces gut ammonia levels by a variety of mechanisms; the use of enemas and certain antibiotics, such as rifaximin, to decrease the intestinal flora; a low-protein diet) prevented Percy from progressing to the later stages of hepatic encephalopathy. As with most patients who survive an episode of fulminant hepatic failure, recovery to his previous state of health occurred over the next 3 months. Percy's liver function studies returned to normal, and a follow-up liver biopsy showed no histologic abnormalities.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

$\mathscr{H}$Pyridoxal Phosphate. PLP is a key coenzyme for amino acid metabolism. This cofactor participates in a wide variety of reactions involving amino acids, such as transamination, deamination, decarboxylation, $\beta$-elimination, racemization, and $\gamma$-elimination. The type of reaction that takes place is dictated by the amino acid substrate and the enzymes that catalyze the reaction.

All amino acid reactions that require PLP occur with the amino group of the amino acid bonded covalently to the aldehyde carbon of the coenzyme (Fig. 36.17). As an example of a mechanism through which PLP aids catalysis, Figure 36.18 indicates how a transamination reaction occurs. The other reaction types that require PLP follow similar mechanisms.

FIGURE 36.18 Function of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) in transamination reactions. The order in which the reactions occur is I to 4. PLP (enzyme-bound) reacts with amino acid ${ }_{1}$, forming a Schiff base (a carbon-nitrogen double bond). After a shift of the double bond, $\alpha$-keto acid ${ }_{1}$ is released through hydrolysis of the Schiff base, and pyridoxamine phosphate is produced. Pyridoxamine phosphate then forms a Schiff base with $\alpha$-keto acid ${ }_{2}$. After the double bond shifts, amino acid ${ }_{2}$ is released through hydrolysis of the Schiff base, and enzyme-bound PLP is regenerated. The net result is that the amino group from amino acid ${ }_{1}$ is transferred to $\alpha$-keto acid ${ }_{2}$.

# REVIEW QUESTIONS-CHAFTER 36 

1. Deficiency diseases have been described that involve each of the five enzymes of the urea cycle. Clinical manifestations may appear in the neonatal period. Infants with defects in the first four enzymes usually appear normal at birth but after 24 hours progressively develop lethargy, hypothermia, and apnea. They have high blood ammonia levels, and the brain becomes swollen. One possible explanation for the swelling is the osmotic effect of the accumulation of glutamine in the brain produced by the reactions of ammonia with $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and glutamate. Arginase deficiency is not as severe as deficiencies of the other urea-cycle enzymes.

Given the following information about five newborn infants (identified as $I$ through $V$ ) who appeared normal at birth but developed hyperammonemia after 24 hours, determine which urea-cycle enzyme might be defective in each case (for each infant, choose from the same five answers, A through E). All infants had low levels of BUN. (Normal citrulline levels are 10 to $20 \mu \mathrm{M}$.)

# ANSWERS 

1. Infant I has a defect in CPSI (answer A), and infant IV has a defect in OTC (answer B). Infants with high ammonia, low arginine, and low citrulline levels must have a defect in a urea-cycle enzyme before the step that produces citrulline; that is, CPSI or OTC. If CPSI is functional and carbamoyl phosphate is produced but cannot be metabolized further, more than the normal
amount is diverted to the pathway for pyrimidine synthesis and the intermediate orotate appears in the urine. Therefore, infant I has a defect in CPSI (citrulline is low, and less than the normal amount of orotate is in the urine). Infant IV has an OTC defect; carbamoyl phosphate is produced, but it cannot be converted to citrulline, so citrulline is low and orotate is present in the urine.

Infants II and V have high levels of citrulline but low levels of arginine. Therefore, they cannot produce arginine from citrulline. Argininosuccinate synthetase or argininosuccinate lyase is defective. The very elevated citrulline levels in infant II suggest that the block is in argininosuccinate synthetase (answer C). In infant V , citrulline levels are more moderately elevated, suggesting that citrulline can be converted to argininosuccinate and that the defect is in argininosuccinate lyase (answer D). Thus, the accumulated intermediates of the urea cycle are distributed between argininosuccinate and citrulline (both of which can be excreted in the urine). The high levels of arginine and more moderate hyperammonemia in infant III suggest that, in this case, the defect is in arginase (answer E).
2. The answer is D. The nitrogens in urea are derived from carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate directly during one turn of the cycle. The nitrogen in the side chain of ornithine is never incorporated into urea because it stays with ornithine (thus, A, B, and C are incorrect). Glutamine does not donate a nitrogen directly during the urea cycle, so E and F are also incorrect.
3. The answer is C. Glutamate dehydrogenase fixes ammonia into $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, generating glutamate, in a reversible reaction that also requires $\mathrm{NAD}(\mathrm{P}) \mathrm{H}$. Alaninepyruvate aminotransferase catalyzes the transfer of nitrogen from alanine to an $\alpha$-keto acid acceptor but does not use ammonia as a substrate. Glutaminase converts glutamine to glutamate and ammonia, but the reaction is not reversible. Arginase splits arginine into urea and ornithine, and argininosuccinate synthetase forms argininosuccinate from citrulline and aspirate. The only other two enzymes that can fix ammonia into an organic compound are CPSI and glutamine synthetase.
4. The answer is A. Glutamine is converted to ammonia and glutamate in the cytoplasm (glutaminase) and then to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondria (glutamate dehydrogenase). The $\alpha$-ketoglutarate goes around the TCA cycle to form malate, which is then exported from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the malate is converted to oxaloacetate by malate dehydrogenase. The oxaloacetate is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and then the standard gluconeogenic pathway is followed to glucose production. Pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, citrate synthase, and pyruvate kinase are not required for these conversions to occur.
5. The answer is C. The activation of fatty acids requires a two-step reaction. In the first, ATP donates AMP to form a covalent bond with the carboxylic acid of the fatty acid, releasing pyrophosphate. In the second step, coenzyme A (CoA) displaces the AMP, forming a fatty acyl CoA. This is the exact same reaction pathway for
the activation of these drugs, and the pathway uses enzymes similar to those for fatty acid activation. Activation of glucose for the glycolytic pathway requires phosphorylation (not addition of CoA). Activation of glucose for glycogen synthesis requires formation of a nucleotide sugar, not involving CoA. Formation of an activated isoprene requires two subsequent phosphorylations to create a pyrophosphate derivative (e.g., isopentenyl pyrophosphate). The formation of acetyl-CoA, via pyruvate dehydrogenase, is an oxidative decarboxylation reaction, which is not similar to the fatty acid activation reactions or to those that activate the drugs used for treatment of urea-cycle disorders.
6. The answer is A. PLP is the required cofactor for transamination reactions and is derived from pyridoxine (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ ) found in chicken, fish, pork, eggs, noncitrus fruits, peanuts, and walnuts. Dairy products contain choline and vitamin D, citrus fruits contain vitamin C, carrots contain vitamin A, and leafy vegetables are rich in folate and vitamin K.
7. The answer is B. Glutamate deamination to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate is readily reversible (via the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase). The other deaminations listed are irreversible reactions (serine deamination requires vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$, and glutamine deamination is a simple hydrolysis reaction). $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ can freely diffuse across membranes, but once $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$is formed, it can no longer do so because of its charge.
8. The answer is C. In the intestine, glutamine is used as fuel. In the liver, glutamate can transaminate oxaloacetate to aspartate or release $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, both of which join the urea cycle. Alanine, not glutamate, is part of the glucose/alanine cycle. In the kidney, the ammonia formed with glutamate from glutamine forms salts with metabolic acids. Urea is formed in the liver and transported to the kidney.
9. The answer is E. Citrulline is synthesized in the mitochondria, and ornithine is regenerated in the cytosol. A transporter exchanges these two amino acids via an electroneutral exchange. Ornithine is the compound that both initiates and is regenerated by the cycle. Four high-energy phosphate bonds are used for one complete cycle-2 ATP to produce carbamoyl phosphate from $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, and two high-energy bonds (ATP to AMP) to form argininosuccinate from citrulline and aspartate.
10. The answer is D. Two molecules of alanine are required to generate one molecule of glucose and one molecule of urea. Glucose contains six carbons, and alanine only three carbons. Urea contains two nitrogen groups, and alanine only contains one nitrogen group. Thus, starting with two molecules of alanine, there are six carbons available for glucose production and two nitrogens available for urea synthesis.

# Synthesis and Degradation of Amino Acids 

Because each of the 20 common amino acids has a unique structure, their metabolic pathways differ. Despite this, some generalities do apply to both the synthesis and the degradation of all amino acids. These are summarized in the following sections. Because several amino acid pathways are clinically relevant, we present most of the diverse pathways that occur in humans. However, we will be as succinct as possible.

Important Coenzymes. Pyridoxal phosphate (derived from vitamin $B_{6}$ ) is the quintessential coenzyme of amino acid metabolism. In degradation, it is involved in the removal of amino groups, principally through transamination reactions and in donation of amino groups for various amino acid biosynthetic pathways. It is also required for certain reactions that involve the carbon skeleton of amino acids. Tetrahydrofolate $\left(\mathbf{F H}_{4}\right)$ is a coenzyme that is used to transfer one-carbon groups at various oxidation states. $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ is used in both amino acid degradation (e.g., serine and histidine) and biosynthesis (e.g., glycine). Tetrahydrobiopterin $\left(\mathbf{B H}_{4}\right)$ is a cofactor that is required for ring hydroxylation reactions (e.g., phenylalanine to tyrosine).

Synthesis of the Amino Acids. Eleven of the 20 common amino acids can be synthesized in the body (Fig. 37.1). The other nine are considered "essential" and must be obtained from the diet. Almost all of the amino acids that can be synthesized by humans are amino acids used for the synthesis of additional nitrogen-containing compounds. Examples include glycine, which is used for porphyrin and purine synthesis; glutamate, which is required for neurotransmitter synthesis; and aspartate, which is required for both purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis.

Nine of the II "nonessential" amino acids can be produced from glucose plus, of course, a source of nitrogen, such as another amino acid or ammonia. The other two nonessential amino acids, tyrosine and cysteine, require an essential amino acid for their synthesis (phenylalanine for tyrosine, methionine for cysteine). The carbons for cysteine synthesis come from glucose; the methionine donates only the sulfur.

The carbon skeletons of the 10 nonessential amino acids derived from glucose are produced from intermediates of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (see Fig. 37.1). Four amino acids (serine, glycine, cysteine, and alanine) are produced from glucose through components of the glycolytic pathway.TCA-cycle intermediates (which can be produced from glucose) provide carbon for synthesis of the six remaining nonessential amino acids. $\alpha$-Ketoglutarate is the precursor for the synthesis of glutamate, glutamine, proline, and arginine. Oxaloacetate provides carbon for the synthesis of aspartate and asparagine.

Regulation of the biosynthesis of individual amino acids can be quite complex, but the overriding feature is that the pathways are feedback-regulated such that as the concentration of free amino acid increases, a key biosynthetic enzyme is allosterically or transcriptionally inhibited. Amino acid levels, however, are always maintained at a level such that the aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases can remain active, and protein synthesis can continue.

![ma29589491dc](ma29589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 37.I Overview of the synthesis of the nonessential amino acids. The carbons of 10 amino acids may be produced from glucose through intermediates of glycolysis or the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The IIth nonessential amino acid, tyrosine, is synthesized by hydroxylation of the essential amino acid phenylalanine. Only the sulfur of cysteine comes from the essential amino acid methionine; its carbons and nitrogen come from serine. Transamination (TA) reactions involve pyridoxal phosphate and another amino acid- $\alpha$-keto acid pair. Acetyl CoA, acetyl coenzyme A;GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase.

Degradation of Amino Acids. The degradation pathways for amino acids are, in general, distinct from biosynthetic pathways. This allows for separate regulation of the anabolic and catabolic pathways. Because protein is a fuel, almost every amino acid has a degradative pathway that can generate NADH, which is used as an electron source for oxidative phosphorylation. However, the energygenerating pathway may involve direct oxidation, oxidation in the TCA cycle, conversion to glucose and then oxidation, or conversion to ketone bodies, which are then oxidized.

The fate of the carbons of the amino acids depends on the physiologic state of the individual and the tissue in which the degradation occurs. For example, in the liver during fasting, the carbon skeletons of the amino acids produce glucose, ketone bodies, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. In the fed state, the liver can convert intermediates of amino acid metabolism to glycogen and triacylglycerols. Thus, the fate of the carbons of the amino acids parallels that of glucose and fatty acids. The liver is the only tissue that has all of the pathways of amino acid synthesis and degradation.

As amino acids are degraded, their carbons are converted to (I) $\mathbf{C O}_{2}$, (2) compounds that produce glucose in the liver (pyruvate and the TCA-cycle intermediates $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, succinyl coenzyme A [succinyl-CoA], fumarate, and oxaloacetate), and (3) ketone bodies or their precursors (acetoacetate and acetyl coenzyme A [acetyl-CoA]) (Fig. 37.2). For simplicity, amino acids are considered to be glucogenic if their carbon skeletons can be converted to a precursor of glucose, and ketogenic if their carbon skeletons can be converted directly to acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate. Some amino acids contain carbons that produce a glucose precursor and other carbons that produce acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate. These amino acids are both glucogenic and ketogenic.

The amino acids that are synthesized from intermediates of glycolysis (serine, alanine, and cysteine) plus certain other amino acids (threonine, glycine,

FIGURE 37.2 Degradation of amino acids. A. Amino acids that produce pyruvate or intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. These amino acids are considered glucogenic because they can produce glucose in the liver. The fumarate group of amino acids produces cytoplasmic fumarate. Potential mechanisms whereby the cytoplasmic fumarate can be oxidized are presented in Section III.C.I. B. Amino acids that produce acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) or ketone bodies. These amino acids are considered ketogenic.

and tryptophan) produce pyruvate when they are degraded. The amino acids synthesized from TCA-cycle intermediates (aspartate, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, proline, and arginine) are reconverted to these intermediates during degradation. Histidine is converted to glutamate and then to the TCA-cycle intermediate $\alpha$-ketoglutarate. Methionine, threonine, valine, and isoleucine form succinyl-CoA, and phenylalanine (after conversion to tyrosine) forms fumarate. Because pyruvate and the TCA-cycle intermediates can produce glucose in the liver; these amino acids are glucogenic.

Some amino acids with carbons that produce glucose also contain other carbons that produce ketone bodies. Tryptophan, isoleucine, and threonine produce acetyl-CoA, and phenylalanine and tyrosine produce acetoacetate. These amino acids are both glucogenic and ketogenic.

Two of the essential amino acids (lysine and leucine) are strictly ketogenic. They do not produce glucose, only acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA.

All states have enacted legislation requiring that newborns be screened for various metabolic abnormalities, of which PKU is one. A common screening procedure is the Guthrie bacterial inhibition assay. In this assay, spores of the organism Bacillus subtilis are plated on an agar plate containing $\beta_{2}$-thienylalanine, an inhibitor of B. subtilis growth. The blood sample obtained from the infant (in the form of a dried blood spot on a filter disk) is placed on the agar plate. If the phenylalanine content of the blood is $>2$ to $4 \mathrm{mg} /$ dL, the phenylalanine will counteract the effects of the $\beta_{2}$-thienylalanine, and bacterial growth will occur. An alternative assay is a microfluorometric determination of phenylalanine, via its incorporation into a ninhydrin-copper complex in the presence of the dipeptide $\downarrow$-leucyl $\downarrow$-alanine. Positive results with either assay then require verification and actual measurement of phenylalanine levels, using either high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation of the components of the blood or enzymatic and fluorometric assays.

## THE WAITING ROOM

Petria Y., a 4-month-old female infant, emigrated from the Ukraine with her French mother and Russian father 1 month ago. She was normal at birth but in the last several weeks was less than normally attentive to her surroundings. Her psychomotor maturation seemed to be delayed, and a tremor of her extremities had recently appeared. When her mother found her having gross twitching movements in her crib, she brought the infant to the hospital emergency department. A pediatrician examined Petria and immediately noted a musty odor to the baby's wet diaper. A drop of her blood was obtained from a heel prick and used to perform a Guthrie bacterial inhibition assay using a special type of filter paper. This screening procedure was positive for the presence of an excess of phenylalanine in Petria's blood.

Horace S., a 14-year-old boy, had a sudden weakness of the muscles of the left side of his face and of his left arm and leg. He was hospitalized with a tentative diagnosis of a cerebrovascular accident involving the right cerebral hemisphere.

Horace's past medical history included a downward partial dislocation of the lenses of both eyes, for which he had had a surgical procedure. He also has a slight intellectual disability requiring placement in a special education group.

Horace's left-sided neurologic deficits cleared within 3 days, but a computerized axial tomogram (CAT scan) showed changes consistent with a small infarct (a damaged area caused by a temporary or permanent loss of adequate arterial blood flow) in the right cerebral hemisphere. A neurologist noted that Horace had a slight waddling gait, which his mother said began several years earlier and was progressing with time. Further studies confirmed the decreased mineralization (decreased density) of the skeleton (called osteopenia if mild and osteoporosis if more severe) and high methionine and homocysteine but low cystine levels in the blood.

All of this information, plus the increased length of the long bones of Horace's extremities and a slight curvature of his spine (scoliosis), caused his physician to suspect that Horace might have an inborn error of metabolism.

## I. The Role of Cofactors in Amino Acid Metabolism

Amino acid metabolism requires the participation of three important cofactors. Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is the quintessential coenzyme of amino acid metabolism (see "Biochemical Comments" in Chapter 36). It is required for the following types of reactions involving amino acids: transamination, deamination, decarboxylation, $\beta$-elimination, racemization, and $\gamma$-elimination. Almost all pathways involving amino acid metabolism will require PLP at one step of the pathway.

The coenzyme $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$, which is derived from the vitamin folate, is required in certain amino acid pathways to either accept or donate a one-carbon group. The carbon can be in various states of oxidation. Chapter 38 describes the reactions of $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ in much more detail.

The coenzyme $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ is required for ring hydroxylations. The reactions involve molecular oxygen, and one atom of oxygen is incorporated into the product. The second is found in water (see Chapter 24). $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ is important for the synthesis of tyrosine and neurotransmitters (see Chapter 46).

## II. Amino Acids Derived from Intermediates of Glycolysis

Four amino acids are synthesized from intermediates of glycolysis: serine, glycine, cysteine, and alanine. Serine, which produces glycine and cysteine, is synthesized from 3-phosphoglycerate, and alanine is formed by transamination of

pyruvate, the product of glycolysis (Fig. 37.3). When these amino acids are degraded, their carbon atoms are converted to pyruvate or to intermediates of the glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathway and, therefore, can produce glucose or be oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

## A. Serine

In the biosynthesis of serine from glucose, 3-phosphoglycerate is first oxidized to a 2-keto compound (3-phosphohydroxypyruvate), which is then transaminated to form phosphoserine (Fig. 37.4). Phosphoserine phosphatase removes the phosphate, forming serine. The major sites of serine synthesis are the liver and kidney.

Serine can be used by many tissues and is generally degraded by transamination to hydroxypyruvate, followed by reduction and phosphorylation to form 2-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate of glycolysis that forms phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and, subsequently, pyruvate. Serine also can undergo $\beta$-elimination of its hydroxyl group, catalyzed by serine dehydratase, to form pyruvate directly.

Regulatory mechanisms maintain serine levels in the body. When serine levels fall, serine synthesis is increased by induction of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and by release of the feedback inhibition of phosphoserine phosphatase (caused by higher levels of serine). When serine levels rise, synthesis of serine decreases because synthesis of the dehydrogenase is repressed and the phosphatase is inhibited (see Fig. 37.4).
![ma31589491dc](ma31589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 37.3 Amino acids derived from intermediates of glycolysis. These amino acids can be synthesized from glucose. Their carbons can be reconverted to glucose in the liver.
![ma32589491dc](ma32589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 37.4 The major pathway for serine synthesis from glucose is on the left and for serine degradation is on the right. Serine levels are maintained because serine causes repression $(\downarrow)$ of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase synthesis. Serine also inhibits ( $\odot$ ) phosphoserine phosphatase. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; $P_{\mathrm{o}}$ inorganic phosphate;PLP, pyridoxal phosphate.

Oxalate, produced from glycine or obtained from the diet, forms precipitates with calcium. Kidney stones (renal calculi) are often composed of calcium oxalate. A lack of the transaminase that can convert glyoxylate to glycine (see Fig. 37.5) leads to the disease primary oxaluria type I (PH I). This disease has a consequence of renal failure attributable to excessive accumulation of calcium oxalate in the kidney.

## B. Glycine

Glycine can be synthesized from serine and, to a minor extent, threonine. The major route from serine is by a reversible reaction that involves $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ and PLP (Fig. 37.5). $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ is a coenzyme that transfers one-carbon groups at different levels of oxidation. It is derived from the vitamin folate and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 38. The minor pathway for glycine production involves threonine degradation (this is an aldolaselike reaction because threonine contains a hydroxyl group located two carbons from the carbonyl group).

The conversion of glycine to glyoxylate by the enzyme D-amino acid oxidase is a degradative pathway of glycine that is clinically relevant. Once glyoxylate is formed, it can be oxidized to oxalate, which is sparingly soluble and tends to precipitate in kidney tubules, leading to formation of kidney stones. Approximately 40\% of oxalate formation in the liver comes from glycine metabolism. Dietary oxalate accumulation has been estimated to be a low contributor to excreted oxalate in the urine because of poor absorption of oxalate in the intestine.

Although glyoxylate can be transaminated back to glycine, this is not really considered a biosynthetic route for "new" glycine because the primary route for glyoxylate formation is from glycine oxidation.

Generation of energy from glycine occurs through a dehydrogenase (glycine cleavage enzyme) that oxidizes glycine to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, ammonia, and a carbon that is donated to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$.

## C. Cysteine

The carbons and nitrogen for cysteine synthesis are provided by serine, and the sulfur is provided by methionine (Fig. 37.6). Serine reacts with homocysteine (which is produced from methionine) to form cystathionine. This reaction is catalyzed by cystathionine $\beta$-synthase. Cleavage of cystathionine by cystathionase produces cysteine and $\alpha$-ketobutyrate, which forms succinyl-CoA via propionyl-CoA. Both cystathionine $\beta$-synthase ( $\beta$-elimination) and cystathionase ( $\gamma$-elimination) require PLP.

Cysteine inhibits cystathionine $\beta$-synthase and, therefore, regulates its own production to adjust for the dietary supply of cysteine. Because cysteine derives its sulfur from the essential amino acid methionine, cysteine becomes essential if the

FIGURE 37.5 Metabolism of glycine. Glycine can be synthesized from serine (major route) or threonine. Glycine forms serine or $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$by reactions that require tetrahydrofolate $\left(\mathrm{FH}_{4}\right)$. Glycine also forms glyoxylate, which is converted to oxalate or to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \cdot \mathrm{N}^{0}, \mathrm{~N}^{10}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{FH}_{4} \cdot \mathrm{~N}^{0}, \mathrm{~N}^{10}$ _ methylene tetrahydrofolate (see Chapter 38); NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate.

FIGURE 37.6 Synthesis and degradation of cysteine. Cysteine is synthesized from the carbons and nitrogen of serine and the sulfur of homocysteine (which is derived from methionine). During the degradation of cysteine, the sulfur is converted to sulfate and either excreted in the urine or converted to $3^{\prime}$-phosphoadenosine $5^{\prime}$-phosphosulfate (PAPS; the universal sulfate donor), and the carbons are converted to pyruvate. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; Methylmalonyl CoA, methylmalonyl coenzyme A; Propionyl CoA, propionyl coenzyme A; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; Succinyl CoA, succinyl coenzyme A.
supply of methionine is inadequate for cysteine synthesis. Conversely, an adequate dietary source of cysteine "spares" methionine; that is, it decreases the amount that must be degraded to produce cysteine.

When cysteine is degraded, the nitrogen is converted to urea, the carbons to pyruvate, and the sulfur to sulfate, which has two potential fates (see Fig. 37.6;

Cystathioninuria, the presence of cystathionine in the urine, is relatively common in premature infants. As they mature, cystathionase levels rise, and the levels of cystathionine in the urine decrease. In adults, a genetic deficiency of cystathionase causes cystathioninuria. Individuals with a genetically normal cystathionase can also develop cystathioninuria from a dietary deficiency of pyridoxine (vitamin $B_{6}$ ) because cystathionase requires the cofactor PLP. No characteristic clinical abnormalities have been observed in individuals with cystathionase deficiency, and it is probably a benign disorder.

Cystinuria and cystinosis are disorders involving two different transport proteins for cystine, the disulfide formed from two molecules of cysteine. Cystinuria is caused by a defect in the transport protein that carries cystine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine into intestinal epithelial cells and that permits resorption of these amino acids by renal tubular cells. Cystine, which is not very soluble in the urine, forms renal calculi (stones). David K. a patient with cystinuria, developed cystine stones (see Chapter 35).

Cystinosis is a rare disorder caused by a defective carrier that normally transports cystine across the lysosomal membrane from lysosomal vesicles to the cytosol. Cystine accumulates in the lysosomes in many tissues and forms crystals, leading to a depletion of intracellular cysteine levels. Children with this disorder develop renal failure by 6 to 12 years of age, through a mechanism that has not yet been fully elucidated.

Homocysteine is oxidized to a disulfide, homocystine. To indicate that both forms are being considered, the term homocyst(e)ine is used.
![ma35589491dc](ma35589491dc.jpg)

Because a colorimetric screening test for urinary homocystine was positive, the doctor ordered several biochemical studies on Horace S.'s serum, which included tests for methionine, homocyst(e)ine (both free and protein-bound), cystine, vitamin $B_{12}$, and folate. The level of homocystine in a 24-hour urine collection was also measured.

The results were as follows: the serum methionine level was $980 \mu \mathrm{M}$ (reference range, $<30 \mu \mathrm{M}$ ); serum homocyst(e)ine (both free and protein-bound) was markedly elevated; cystine was not detected in the serum; the serum $B_{12}$ and folate levels were normal. A 24-hour urine homocystine level was elevated.

Based on these measurements, Horace S.'s doctor concluded that he had homocystinuria caused by an enzyme deficiency. What was the rationale for this conclusion?
see also Chapter 40). Sulfate generation, in an aqueous medium, is essentially generating sulfuric acid, and both the acid and sulfate need to be disposed of in the urine. Sulfate is also used in most cells to generate an activated form of sulfate known as $P A P S$ (3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate), which is used as a sulfate donor in modifying carbohydrates or amino acids in various structures (glycosaminoglycans) and proteins in the body.

The conversion of methionine to homocysteine and homocysteine to cysteine is the major degradative route for these two amino acids. Because this is the only degradative route for homocysteine, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ deficiency or congenital cystathionine $\beta$-synthase deficiency can result in homocystinemia, which is associated with cardiovascular disease.

## D. Alanine

Alanine is produced from pyruvate by a transamination reaction catalyzed by alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) and may be converted back to pyruvate by a reversal of the same reaction (see Fig. 37.3). Alanine is the major gluconeogenic amino acid because it is produced in many tissues for the transport of nitrogen to the liver.

## III. Amino Acids Related to Tricarboxylic Acid-Cycle Intermediates

Two groups of amino acids are synthesized from TCA-cycle intermediates; one group from $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and one from oxaloacetate (see Fig. 37.1). During degradation, four groups of amino acids are converted to the TCA-cycle intermediates $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA), and fumarate (see Fig. 37.2A).

## A. Amino Acids Related through $\alpha$-Ketoglutarate/Glutamate

## I. Glutamate

The five carbons of glutamate are derived from $\alpha$-ketoglutarate either by transamination or by the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction (see Chapter 36). Because $\alpha$-ketoglutarate can be synthesized from glucose, all of the carbons of glutamate can be obtained from glucose (see Fig. 37.1). When glutamate is degraded, it is likewise converted back to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate either by transamination or by glutamate dehydrogenase. In the liver, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate leads to the formation of malate, which produces glucose via gluconeogenesis. Thus, glutamate can be derived from glucose and reconverted to glucose (Fig. 37.7).

Glutamate is used for the synthesis of several other amino acids (glutamine, proline, ornithine, and arginine) (see Fig. 37.7) and for providing the glutamyl moiety of glutathione ( $\gamma$-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine; see "Biochemical Comments" in Chapter 35). Glutathione is an important antioxidant, as has been described previously (see Chapter 27).

## 2. Glutamine

Glutamine is produced from glutamate by glutamine synthetase, which adds $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$to the carboxyl group of the side chain, forming an amide (Fig. 37.8). This is one of only three human enzymes that can fix free ammonia into an organic molecule; the other two are glutamate dehydrogenase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (see Chapter 36). Glutamine is reconverted to glutamate by a different enzyme, glutaminase, which is particularly important in the kidney. The ammonia it produces enters the urine and can be used as an expendable cation to aid in the excretion of metabolic acids $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right)$, as discussed in Chapter 36.

FIGURE 37.7 Amino acids related through glutamate. These amino acids contain carbons that can be reconverted to glutamate, which can be converted to glucose in the liver. All of these amino acids except histidine can be synthesized from glucose.

## 3. Proline

In the synthesis of proline, glutamate is first phosphorylated and then converted to glutamate 5-semialdehyde by reduction of the side-chain carboxyl group to an aldehyde (Fig. 37.9). This semialdehyde spontaneously cyclizes (forming an internal Schiff base between the aldehyde and the $\alpha$-amino group). Reduction of this cyclic compound yields proline. Hydroxyproline is formed only after proline has been incorporated into collagen (see Chapter 47) by the prolyl hydroxylase system, which uses molecular oxygen, iron, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C).

Proline is converted back to glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to form glutamate. The synthesis and degradation of proline use different enzymes even

FIGURE 37.8 Synthesis and degradation of glutamine. Different enzymes catalyze the addition and the removal of the amide nitrogen of glutamine. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate

If the blood levels of methionine and homocysteine are very elevated and cystine is low, cystathionine $\beta$-synthase could be defective, but a cystathionase deficiency is also a possibility. With a deficiency of either of these enzymes, cysteine could not be synthesized and levels of homocysteine would rise. Homocysteine would be converted to methionine by reactions that require vitamin $B_{12}$ and $F H_{4}$ (see Chapter 38). In addition, it would be oxidized to homocystine, which would appear in the urine. The levels of cysteine (measured as its oxidation product cystine) would be low. A measurement of serum cystathionine levels would help to distinguish between a cystathionase or cystathionine $\beta$-synthase deficiency.

FIGURE 37.9 Synthesis and degradation of proline. Reactions 1, 3, and 4 occur in mitochondria. Reaction 2 occurs in the cytosol. Synthesis and degradation involve different enzymes.

FIGURE 37.10 Synthesis and degradation of aspartate and asparagine. Note that the amide nitrogen of asparagine is derived from glutamine. (The amide nitrogen of glutamine comes from $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$; see Fig. 37.8.) AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $P P_{i}$, pyrophosphate.

Certain types of tumor cells, particularly leukemic cells, require asparagine for their growth. Therefore, asparaginase has been used as an antitumor agent. It acts by converting asparagine to aspartate in the blood, decreasing the amount of asparagine available for tumor cell growth. Asparaginase has been used for $>30$ years to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
though the intermediates are the same. Hydroxyproline, however, has an entirely different degradative pathway (not shown). The presence of the hydroxyl group in hydroxyproline allows an aldolaselike reaction to occur once the ring has been hydrolyzed, which is not possible with proline.

## 4. Arginine

Arginine is synthesized from glutamate via glutamate semialdehyde, which is transaminated to form ornithine, an intermediate of the urea cycle (see Fig. 36.12). This activity (ornithine aminotransferase) appears to be greatest in the epithelial cells of the small intestine (see Chapter 40). The reactions of the urea cycle then produce arginine. However, the quantities of arginine generated by the urea cycle are adequate only for the adult and are insufficient to support growth. Therefore, during periods of growth, arginine becomes an essential amino acid. It is important to realize that if arginine is used for protein synthesis, the levels of ornithine will drop, thereby slowing the urea cycle. This will stimulate the formation of ornithine from glutamate.

Arginine is cleaved by arginase to form urea and ornithine. If ornithine is present in amounts in excess of those required for the urea cycle, it is transaminated to glutamate semialdehyde, which is reduced to glutamate. The conversion of an aldehyde to a primary amine is a unique form of a transamination reaction and requires PLP.

## 5. Histidine

Although histidine cannot be synthesized in humans, five of its carbons form glutamate when it is degraded. In a series of steps, histidine is converted to formiminoglutamate (FIGLU). The subsequent reactions transfer one carbon of FIGLU to the $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ pool (see Chapter 38) and release $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and glutamate.

## B. Amino Acids Related to Oxaloacetate (Aspartate and Asparagine)

Aspartate is produced by transamination of oxaloacetate. This reaction is readily reversible, so aspartate can be reconverted to oxaloacetate (Fig. 37.10).

Asparagine is formed from aspartate by a reaction in which glutamine provides the nitrogen for formation of the amide group. Thus, this reaction differs from the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate, in which $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$provides the nitrogen. However, the reaction catalyzed by asparaginase, which hydrolyzes asparagine to $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$ and aspartate, is analogous to the reaction catalyzed by glutaminase.

## C. Amino Acids that Form Fumarate

## I. Aspartate

Although the major route for aspartate degradation involves its conversion to oxaloacetate, carbons from aspartate can form fumarate in the urea cycle (see Chapter 36). This reaction generates cytosolic fumarate, which must be converted to malate (using cytoplasmic fumarase) for transport into the mitochondria for oxidative or anaplerotic purposes. An analogous sequence of reactions occurs in the purine nucleotide cycle. Aspartate reacts with inosine monophosphate (IMP) to form an intermediate (adenylosuccinate) that is then cleaved, forming adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and fumarate (see Chapter 39).

## 2. Phenylalanine and Tyrosine

Phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by a hydroxylation reaction. Tyrosine, produced from phenylalanine or obtained from the diet, is oxidized, ultimately forming acetoacetate and fumarate. The oxidative steps required to reach this point are, surprisingly, not energy-generating. The conversion of fumarate to malate, followed by the action of malic enzyme, allows the carbons to be used for gluconeogenesis. The conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine and the production of acetoacetate are considered further in Section IV of this chapter.

## D. Amino Acids that Form Succinyl Coenzyme A

The essential amino acids methionine, valine, isoleucine, and threonine are degraded to form propionyl coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA). The conversion of propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA is common to their degradative pathways. Propionyl-CoA is also generated from the oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids.

Propionyl-CoA is carboxylated in a reaction that requires biotin and forms Dmethylmalonyl coenzyme A (D-methylmalonyl-CoA). The D-methylmalonyl-CoA is racemized to L-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is rearranged in a vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-requiring reaction to produce succinyl-CoA, a TCA-cycle intermediate (see Fig. 30.11).

## I. Methionine

Methionine is converted to $S$-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which donates its methyl group to other compounds to form $S$-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH is then converted to homocysteine (Fig. 37.11). Methionine can be regenerated from homocysteine by a reaction that requires both $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ (a topic that is considered in more detail in Chapter 38). Alternatively, by reactions that require PLP, homocysteine can provide the sulfur needed for the synthesis of cysteine (see Fig. 37.6). Carbons of homocysteine are then metabolized to $\alpha$-ketobutyrate, which undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to propionyl-CoA. The propionyl-CoA is then converted to succinyl-CoA (see Fig. 37.11).
![ma40589491dc](ma40589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 37.11 Conversion of methionine and other amino acids to succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA). The amino acids methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and valine, all of which form succinyl-CoA via methylmalonyl coenzyme A (methylmalonyl-CoA), are essential in the diet. The carbons of serine are converted to cysteine and do not form succinyl-CoA by this pathway. Acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; Propionyl-CoA, propionyl coenzyme A; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; $B_{12}-C H_{3}$, methylcobalamin; $N^{5}-C H_{2}-F H_{4}$, $N^{5}$-methyltetrahydrofolate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.

$\triangle$A biopsy specimen from Horace S.'s liver was sent to the hospital's biochemistry research laboratory for enzyme assays. Cystathionine $\beta$-synthase activity was reported to be $7 \%$ of that found in normal liver.

$\square$Homocystinuria is caused by deficiencies in the enzymes cystathionine $\beta$-synthase and cystathionase as well as by deficiencies of methyltetrahydrofolate $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{FH}_{4}\right)$ or of methyl- $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. The deficiencies of $\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ or of methyl- $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ are either caused by an inadequate dietary intake of folate or vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or by defective enzymes involved in joining methyl groups to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$, transferring methyl groups from $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ to vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, or passing them from vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ to homocysteine to form methionine (see Chapter 38).

Is Horace S.'s homocystinuria caused by any of these problems?

Horace S.'s methionine levels are elevated, and his vitamin $B_{12}$ and folate levels are normal. Therefore, he does not have a deficiency of dietary folate or vitamin $B_{12}$ or of the enzymes that transfer methyl groups from $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ to homocysteine to form methionine. In these cases, homocysteine levels are elevated but methionine levels are low.

What compounds form succinyl-CoA via propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA?

## 2. Threonine

In humans, threonine is primarily degraded by a PLP-requiring dehydratase to ammonia and $\alpha$-ketobutyrate, which subsequently undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to form propionyl-CoA, just as in the case of methionine (see Fig. 37.11).

## 3. Valine and Isoleucine

The branched-chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, and leucine) are a universal fuel, and the degradation of these amino acids occurs at low levels in the mitochondria of most tissues, but the muscle carries out the highest level of branched-chain amino acid oxidation. The branched-chain amino acids make up almost $25 \%$ of the content of the average protein, so their use as fuel is quite significant. The degradative pathway for valine and isoleucine has two major functions: first, to generate energy; and second, to provide precursors to replenish TCA-cycle intermediates (anaplerosis). Both valine and isoleucine contain carbons that form succinyl-CoA. The initial step in the degradation of the branched-chain amino acids is a transamination reaction. Although the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is present in most tissues, the level of activity varies from tissue to tissue. Its activity is particularly high in muscle, however. In the second step of the degradative pathway, the $\alpha$-keto analogs of these amino acids undergo oxidative decarboxylation by the $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complex in a reaction similar in its mechanism and cofactor requirements to pyruvate dehydrogenase and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (see Chapter 23). As with the first enzyme of the pathway, the highest level of activity for this dehydrogenase is found in muscle tissue. Subsequently, the pathways for degradation of these amino acids follow parallel routes (Fig. 37.12). The steps are analogous to those for $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids, so nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide $(\mathrm{FAD}[2 \mathrm{H}])$ are generated for energy production.
![ma41589491dc](ma41589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 37.12 Degradation of the branched-chain amino acids. Valine forms propionyl coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA). Isoleucine forms propionyl-CoA and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). Leucine forms acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA. HMG CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A; Isobutyryl CoA, isobutyryl coenzyme A; Isovaleryl CoA, isovaleryl coenzyme A; Methylbutyryl CoA, methylbutyryl coenzyme A; Methylmalonyl CoA, methylmalonyl coenzyme A;FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; NADH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; Succinyl CoA, succinyl coenzyme A.

Valine and isoleucine are converted to succinyl-CoA (see Fig. 37.11). Isoleucine also forms acetyl-CoA. Leucine, the third branched-chain amino acid, does not produce succinyl-CoA. It forms acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA and is strictly ketogenic.

## IV. Amino Acids that Form Acetyl Coenzyme A and Acetoacetate

Seven amino acids produce acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate and, therefore, are categorized as ketogenic. Of these, isoleucine, threonine, and the aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) are converted to compounds that produce both glucose and acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate (Fig. 37.13). Leucine and lysine do not produce glucose; they produce acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate.

## A. Phenylalanine and Tyrosine

Phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine, which undergoes oxidative degradation (Fig. 37.14). The last step in the pathway produces both fumarate and the ketone body acetoacetate. Deficiencies of different enzymes in the pathway result in phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia, and alkaptonuria.

Phenylalanine is hydroxylated to form tyrosine by a mixed-function oxidase, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which requires molecular oxygen and $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ (Fig. 37.15). The cofactor $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ is converted to quininoid dihydrobiopterin by this reaction. $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ is not synthesized from a vitamin; it can be synthesized in the body from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). However, as is the case with other cofactors, the body contains limited amounts. Therefore, dihydrobiopterin must be reconverted to $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ for the reaction to continue to produce tyrosine.
![ma42589491dc](ma42589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 37.13 Ketogenic amino acids. Some of these amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) also contain carbons that can form glucose. Leucine and lysine are strictly ketogenic; they do not form glucose. Acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; Succinyl CoA, succinyl coenzyme A; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.

In addition to methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and valine (see Fig. 37.11), the last three carbons at the $\omega$-end of odd-chain fatty acids form succinyl-CoA by this route (see Chapter 30).

Thiamin deficiency will lead to an accumulation of $\alpha$-keto acids in the blood because of an inability of pyruvate dehydrogenase, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase to catalyze their reactions (see Chapter 8). Al M. had a thiamin deficiency resulting from his chronic alcoholism. His ketoacidosis resulted partly from the accumulation of these $\alpha$-keto acids in his blood and partly from the accumulation of ketone bodies used for energy production. Beriberi is the disorder that results from thiamin deficiency.

In maple syrup urine disease, the branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase that oxidatively decarboxylates the branched-chain amino acids is defective. As a result, the branched-chain amino acids and their $\alpha$-keto analogs (produced by transamination) accumulate. They appear in the urine, giving it the odor of maple syrup or burnt sugar. The accumulation of $\alpha$-keto analogs leads to neurologic complications. This condition is difficult to treat by dietary restriction, because abnormalities in the metabolism of three essential amino acids contribute to the disease.

Akaptonuria occurs when homogentisate, an intermediate in tyrosine metabolism, cannot be further oxidized because the next enzyme in the pathway, homogentisate oxidase, is defective. Homogentisate accumulates and autooxidizes, forming a dark pigment, which discolors the urine and stains the diapers of affected infants. Later in life, the chronic accumulation of this pigment in cartilage may cause arthritic joint pain.

Transient tyrosinemia is frequently observed in newborn infants, especially those that are premature. For the most part, the condition appears to be benign and dietary restriction of protein returns plasma tyrosine levels to normal. The biochemical defect is most likely a low level, attributable to immaturity, of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase. Because this enzyme requires ascorbate, ascorbate supplementation also aids in reducing circulating tyrosine levels.

Other types of tyrosinemia are related to specific enzyme defects (see Fig. 37.14). Tyrosinemia II is caused by a genetic deficiency of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and may lead to lesions of the eye and skin as well as neurologic problems. Patients are treated with a low-tyrosine, low-phenylalanine diet.

Tyrosinemia I (also called tyrosinosis) is caused by a genetic deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. The acute form is associated with liver failure, a cabbagelike body odor, and death within the first year of life.

A small subset of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia show an appropriate reduction in plasma phenylalanine levels with dietary restriction of this amino acid; however, these patients can still develop progressive neurologic symptoms and seizures ("malignant" hyperphenylalaninemia). These infants exhibit normal PAH activity but have a deficiency in dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR), an enzyme required for the regeneration of $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$, a cofactor of PAH (see Fig. 37.16). Less frequently, DHPR activity is normal but a defect in the biosynthesis of $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ exists. In either case, dietary therapy with administration of $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ corrects the hyperphenylalaninemia. However, $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ is also a cofactor for two other hydroxylations required in the synthesis of neurotransmitters in the brain: the hydroxylation of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan and of tyrosine to L-DOPA (see Chapter 46). Because $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ does not penetrate the central nervous system as well, patients also need replacement therapy for the neurotransmitters. However, patients will often still have neurologic deficits.

If the dietary levels of niacin and tryptophan are insufficient, the condition known as peligro results. The symptoms of pellagra are dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and, finally, death. In addition, abnormal metabolism of tryptophan occurs in a vitamin $B_{6}$ deficiency. Kynurenine intermediates in tryptophan degradation cannot be cleaved because kynureninase requires PLP derived from vitamin $B_{6}$. Consequently, these intermediates enter a minor pathway for tryptophan metabolism that produces xanthurenic acid, which is excreted in the urine.

FIGURE 37.14 Degradation of phenylalanine and tyrosine. The carboxyl carbon forms $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and the other carbons form fumarate or acetoacetate as indicated. Deficiencies of enzymes (dark bars) result in the indicated diseases. PKU, phenylketonuria; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate.

## B. Tryptophan

Tryptophan is oxidized to produce alanine (from the nonring carbons), formate, and acetyl-CoA. Tryptophan is, therefore, both glucogenic and ketogenic (Fig. 37.16).

NAD ${ }^{+}$and NADP ${ }^{+}$can be produced from the ring structure of tryptophan. Therefore, tryptophan "spares" the dietary requirement for niacin. The higher the dietary levels of tryptophan, the lower are the levels of niacin required to prevent symptoms of deficiency.

## C. Threonine, Isoleucine, Leucine, and Lysine

As discussed previously, the major route of threonine degradation in humans is by threonine dehydratase (see Section III.D.2). In a minor pathway, threonine degradation by threonine aldolase produces glycine and acetyl-CoA in the liver.

Isoleucine produces both succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA (see Section III.D.3).
Leucine is purely ketogenic and produces hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA), which is cleaved to form acetyl-CoA and the ketone body acetoacetate (see Figs. 37.12 and 37.13). Most of the tissues in which it is oxidized can use ketone bodies, with the exception of the liver. As with valine and isoleucine, leucine is a universal fuel, with its primary metabolism occurring in muscle.

FIGURE 37.15 Hydroxylation of phenylalanine. Phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) is a mixed-function oxidase; that is, molecular oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ donates one atom to water and one to the product tyrosine. The cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin $\left(\mathrm{BH}_{4}\right)$ is oxidized to dihydrobiopterin $\left(\mathrm{BH}_{2}\right)$ and must be reduced back to $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ for PAH to continue forming tyrosine. $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ is synthesized in the body from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) results from deficiencies of PAH (the classic form), dihydropteridine reductase, or enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway for $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$.
![ma44589491dc](ma44589491dc.jpg)

Lysine cannot be directly transaminated at either of its two amino groups. Lysine is degraded by a complex pathway in which saccharopine, $\alpha$-ketoadipate, and crotonyl coenzyme A (crotonyl-CoA) are intermediates. During the degradation pathway, NADH and $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ are generated for energy. Ultimately, lysine generates acetyl-CoA (see Fig. 37.13) and is strictly ketogenic.
![ma45589491dc](ma45589491dc.jpg)

On more definitive testing of Petria Y's blood, the plasma level of phenylalanine was elevated at $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, (reference range, $<1.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Several phenyl ketones and other products of phenylalanine metabolism, which give the urine a characteristic odor; were found in significant quantities in the baby's urine.
![ma46589491dc](ma46589491dc.jpg)

Phenylalanine

FIGURE 37.16 Degradation of tryptophan. One of the ring carbons (in red) produces formate. The nonring portion (indicated by the box) forms alanine. Kynurenine is an intermediate, which can be converted to several urinary excretion products (e.g., xanthurenate), degraded to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA), or converted to the nicotinamide moiety of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and NADP, which also can be formed from the vitamin niacin. PLP, pyridoxal phosphate.

A liver biopsy was sent to the special chemistry research laboratory, where it was determined that the level of activity of PAH in Petria's liver was $<1 \%$ of that found in normal infants. A diagnosis of "classic" PKU was made.

Until gene therapy allows substitution of the defective PAH gene with its normal counterpart in vivo, the mainstay of therapy in classic PKU is to maintain levels of phenylalanine in the blood between 3 and $12 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ through dietary restriction of this essential amino acid.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Petria Y. The overall incidence of phenylketonuria (PKU), leading to hyperphenylalaninemia, is approximately 1 per 10,000 births, with a wide geographic and ethnic variation. PKU occurs by autosomal-recessive transmission of a defective PAH gene, causing accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood that is well above the normal concentration in young children and adults ( $<1$ to $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). In the newborn, the upper limit of normal is almost twice this value. Values $>20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ are usually found in patients, such as Petria, with "classic" PKU.

Patients with classic PKU usually appear normal at birth. If the disease is not recognized and treated within the first month of life, the infant gradually develops varying degrees of irreversible intellectual disability (IQ scores frequently $<50$ ), delayed psychomotor maturation, tremors, seizures, eczema, and hyperactivity. The neurologic sequelae may result in part from the competitive interaction of phenylalanine with brain amino acid transport systems and inhibition of neurotransmitter synthesis. A successful dietary therapy for PKU includes a reduction in phenylalanine intake; in adults, this can include supplementation of the diet with large, neutral amino acids (such as tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine, and leucine). These large, neutral amino acids share a transport system (the L system) with phenylalanine and can overcome the high levels of phenylalanine in the blood, allowing the neurotransmitter precursors to enter the nervous system. If the disease is not recognized in time, the biochemical alterations lead to impaired myelin synthesis and delayed neuronal development, which result in the clinical picture in patients such as Petria. Because of the simplicity of the test for PKU (elevated phenylalanine levels in the blood), all newborns in the United States are required to have a PKU test at birth. Early detection of the disease can lead to early treatment, and if followed, the neurologic consequences of the disease can be avoided.

To restrict dietary levels of phenylalanine, special semisynthetic preparations (such as Lofenalac, Periflex, or PhenylAde) are used in the United States. Use of these preparations reduces dietary intake of phenylalanine to 250 to $500 \mathrm{mg} /$ day while maintaining normal intake of all other dietary nutrients. Although it is generally agreed that scrupulous adherence to this regimen is mandatory for the first decade of life, less consensus exists regarding its indefinite use. Evidence suggests, however, that without lifelong compliance with dietary restriction of phenylalanine, even adults will develop at least neurologic sequelae of PKU. A pregnant woman with PKU must be particularly careful to maintain satisfactory plasma levels of phenylalanine throughout gestation to avoid the adverse effects of hyperphenylalaninemia on the fetus. The use of glycomacropeptide from whey is a promising development in PKU treatment. This protein, when pure, contains no phenylalanine but as isolated has a very low phenylalanine content (owing to contaminants) while providing adequate levels of the other amino acids. The use of glycomacropeptide in PKU diet preparation is expanding and provides alternatives to the dietary therapy not previously available.

Petria's parents were given thorough dietary instruction, which they followed carefully. Although her pediatrician was not optimistic, it was hoped that the damage done to her nervous system before dietary therapy was minimal and that her subsequent psychomotor development would allow her to lead a relatively normal life.

Horace S. The most characteristic biochemical features of the disorder that affects Horace S., a cystathionine $\beta$-synthase deficiency, are the presence of an accumulation of both homocyst(e)ine and methionine in the blood. Because renal tubular reabsorption of methionine is highly efficient, this amino acid may not appear in the urine. Homocystine, the disulfide of homocysteine, is less efficiently reabsorbed, and amounts in excess of 1 mmol may be excreted in the urine each day.

In the type of homocystinuria in which the patient is deficient in cystathione $\beta$-synthase, the elevation in serum methionine levels is presumed to be the result of enhanced rates of conversion of homocysteine to methionine, caused by increased availability of homocysteine (see Fig. 37.11). In type II and type III

homocystinuria, in which there is a deficiency in the synthesis of methylcobalamin and of $N^{3}$-methyltetrahydrofolate, respectively (both required for the methylation of homocysteine to form methionine), serum homocysteine levels are elevated but serum methionine levels are low (see Fig. 37.11).

Acute vascular events are common in these patients. Thrombi (blood clots) and emboli (clots that have broken off and traveled to a distant site in the vascular system) have been reported in almost every major artery and vein as well as in smaller vessels. These clots result in infarcts in vital organs such as the liver, the myocardium (heart muscle), the lungs, the kidneys, and many other tissues. Although increased serum levels of homocysteine have been implicated in enhanced platelet aggregation and damage to vascular endothelial cells (leading to clotting and accelerated atherosclerosis), no generally accepted mechanism for these vascular events has yet emerged.

Treatment is directed toward early reduction of the elevated levels of homocysteine and methionine in the blood. In addition to a diet that is low in methionine, very high oral doses of pyridoxine (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ ) have significantly decreased the plasma levels of homocysteine and methionine in some patients with cystathionine $\beta$-synthase deficiency. (Genetically determined "responders" to pyridoxine treatment make up $\sim 50 \%$ of people with type I homocystinuria.) PLP serves as a cofactor for cystathionine $\beta$-synthase; however, the molecular properties of the defective enzyme that confer the responsiveness to vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ therapy are not known.

The terms hypermethioninemia, homocystinuria (or -emia), and cystathioninuria (or -emia) designate biochemical abnormalities and are not specific clinical diseases. Each may be caused by more than one specific genetic defect. For example, at least seven distinct genetic alterations can cause increased excretion of homocystine in the urine. A deficiency of cystathionine $\beta$-synthase is the most common cause of homocystinuria; $>600$ such proven cases have been studied.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

$\Delta$Phenylketonuria. Many enzyme deficiency diseases have been discovered that affect the pathways of amino acid metabolism. These deficiency diseases have helped researchers to elucidate the pathways in humans, in whom experimental manipulation is, at best, unethical. These spontaneous mutations ("experiments" of nature), although devastating to patients, have resulted in an understanding of these diseases that now permit treatment of inborn errors of metabolism that were once considered to be untreatable.

Classic PKU is caused by mutations in the gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes the enzyme PAH. This enzyme normally catalyzes the hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine, the rate-limiting step in the major pathway by which phenylalanine is catabolized.

In early experiments, sequence analysis of mutant clones indicated a single base substitution in the gene, with a G-to-A transition at the canonical $5^{\prime}$ donor splice site of intron 12 and expression of a truncated unstable protein product. This protein lacked the C-terminal region, a structural change that yielded $<1 \%$ of the normal activity of PAH.

Since these initial studies, DNA analysis has shown $>100$ mutations (missense, nonsense, insertions, and deletions) in the $P A H$ gene, associated with PKU and non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia. That PKU is a heterogeneous phenotype is supported by studies measuring PAH activity in needle biopsy samples taken from the livers of a large group of patients with varying degrees of hyperphenylalaninemia. PAH activity varied from $<1 \%$ of normal in patients with classic PKU to up to $35 \%$ of normal in those with a non-PKU form of hyperphenylalaninemia (such as a defect in $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ production; see Chapter 46).

The genetic diseases affecting amino acid degradation that have been discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 37.1. This is just a partial listing of disorders in amino acid metabolism; there are many others that are less common and were not discussed in this chapter.

$\Delta$
The pathologic findings that underlie the clinical features manifested by Horace S. are presumed (but not proved) to be the consequence of chronic elevations of homocysteine (and perhaps other compounds; e.g., methionine) in the blood and tissues. The zonular fibers that normally hold the lens of the eye in place become frayed and break, causing dislocation of the lens. The skeleton reveals a loss of bone density (i.e., osteoporosis), which may explain the curvature of the spine. The elongation of the long bones beyond their normal genetically determined length leads to tall stature.

Animal experiments suggest that increased concentrations of homocysteine and methionine in the brain may trap adenosine as SAH, diminishing adenosine levels. Because adenosine normally acts as a central nervous system depressant, its deficiency may be associated with a lowering of the seizure threshold as well as a reduction in cognitive function.

## KEY CONCEPTS

- Humans can synthesize only 11 of the 20 amino acids required for protein synthesis; the other 9 are considered to be essential amino acids in the diet.
- Amino acid metabolism uses, to a large extent, the cofactors PLP, $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$, and $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$.
- PLP is required primarily for transamination reactions.
- $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ is required for ring hydroxylation reactions.
- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ is required for one-carbon metabolism and is discussed further in Chapter 38.
- The nonessential amino acids can be synthesized from glycolytic intermediates (serine, glycine, cysteine, and alanine), from TCA-cycle intermediates (aspartate, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, proline, arginine, and ornithine), or from existing amino acids (tyrosine from phenylalanine).
- When amino acids are degraded, the nitrogen is converted to urea, and the carbon skeletons are classified as either glucogenic (a precursor of glucose) or ketogenic (a precursor of ketone bodies).
- Defects in amino acid degradation pathways can lead to disease.
- Glycine degradation can lead to oxalate production, which may lead to one class of kidney stone formation.
- Defects in methionine degradation can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia, which has been linked to blood clotting disorders and heart disease.
- A defect in branched-chain amino acid degradation leads to maple syrup urine disease, which has severe neurologic consequences.
- Defects in phenylalanine and tyrosine degradation lead to phenylketonuria (PKU), alkaptonuria, tyrosinemia I and II, and albinism.
- Table 37.2 summarizes, in a slightly different format than Table 37.1, the diseases discussed in this chapter.

TABLE 37.3 Diseases Discussed in Chapter 37

| DISEASE OR DISORDER | ENVIRONMENTAL OR GENETIC | COMMENTS |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Phenylketonuria (PKU) | Genetic | Classic PKU is caused by a defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase, whereas nonclassic PKU is caused by a defect in dihydropteridine reductase (or an inability to synthesize tetrahydrobiopterin). Both forms of PKU will lead to intellectual disability if treatment is not initiated at an early age. |
| Alkaptonuria | Genetic | Alkaptonuria is caused by a defect in homogentisate oxidase, leading to an accumulation of homogentisic acid.Arthritis may develop later in life. |
| Tyrosinemia | Genetic | Tyrosinemia type I is a defect in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, leading to liver failure and early death. Tyrosinemia type 2 is a defect in tyrosine aminotransferase, leading to neurologic defects. |
| Cystathioninuria | Genetic | Defect in cystathionase, leading to an accumulation of cystathionine. No major complications result from this mutation. |
| Homocysteinemia | Genetic | A defect in cystathionine $\beta$-synthase leads to accumulation of homocysteine, which can result in cardiac and neurologic complications in the patient. |
| Primary oxaluria type 1 | Genetic | Defect in glycine transaminase leading to oxalate accumulation, and renal failure caused by stone formation within the kidney. |
| Maple syrup urine disease | Genetic | A defect in the branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase, leading to an accumulation of the $\alpha$-keto acids of the branched-chain amino acids, resulting in intellectual disability. |
| Cystinosis | Genetic | A defect in the transport protein that carries cystine across lysosomal membranes. Cystine accumulates in lysosomes, interfering with and ultimately destroying their function. |
| Thiamin deficiency | Environmental | A thiamin deficiency leads to accumulation of $\alpha$-keto acids since the enzymes that catalyze oxidative decarboxylation reactions will not function in the absence of this vitamin. This will interfere with energy production, and lead to a ketoacidosis. |

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. Tyrosine is derived from phenylalanine, which requires $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ but not vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ is required in the synthesis of serine (transamination), of alanine (another transamination), cysteine ( $\beta$-elimination, $\beta$-addition, $\beta$-elimination), and aspartate (transamination).
2. The answer is $\mathbf{E}$. The other end products are acetoacetate, acetyl-CoA, fumarate, oxaloacetate, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, and pyruvate.
3. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. The classic form of PKU, a deficiency of PAH, results in elevations of phenylalanine and phenylpyruvate. However, this enzyme is not a choice. In the nonclassic variant of PKU, there is a problem in either synthesizing or regenerating $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$. The enzyme that converts $\mathrm{BH}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$ is dihydropteridine reductase.
4. The answer is $\mathbf{B}$. The reaction pathway in which methionine goes to cysteine and $\alpha$-ketobutyrate requires PLP at two steps, the cystathionine $\beta$-synthase reaction and the cystathionase reaction. Phenylalanine to tyrosine requires $\mathrm{BH}_{4}$; propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA requires $\mathrm{B}_{12}$; pyruvate to acetyl-CoA requires thiamin pyrophosphate, lipoic acid, NAD, FAD, and coenzyme A; and glucose to glycogen does not require a cofactor.
5. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Folic acid is required for the conversion of serine to glycine, and the serine is produced from

3-phosphoglycerate and alanine. Folic acid is not needed to synthesize aspartate (from oxaloacetate by transamination), glutamate (from $\alpha$-ketoglutarate by transamination), proline (from glutamate by a series of steps that do not require folic acid), or serine (from 3-phosphoglycerate, with no one-carbon metabolism needed).
6. The answer is A. Maple syrup urine disease is caused by a dysfunctional branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase, such that the $\alpha$-keto acids of all three branched-chain amino acids accumulate in the blood. The fact that lactic acidosis is also present (indicating high pyruvate and lactate levels) suggests that pyruvate dehydrogenase (the enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA) is also defective. The common link between the branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase is the E3 subunit of the enzymes, which are the same. The E3 subunit is the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase subunit, and it is present in all of the enzymes that catalyze oxidative decarboxylation reactions. Such reactions require, as substrates, $\alpha$-keto acids. The reaction does not use as substrates amino acids, monosaccharides, nucleotides, nucleosides, or dicarboxylic acids.
7. The answer is B. A child with classic PKU has a deficiency in PAH, which blocks the conversion of the essential amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine. This leads to phenylalanine accumulation in the blood, and

the high phenylalanine levels saturate the "L" amino acid transport system (for large, neutral amino acids) such that the nervous system is "starved" for tryptophan, leucine, and tyrosine. As tryptophan and tyrosine are precursors for neurotransmitter synthesis (serotonin and the catecholamines, respectively), neuronal dysfunction will occur. By saturating the system with large, neutral amino acids the tryptophan, leucine, and tyrosine can compete with the high phenylalanine levels to get into the nervous system, such that neurotransmitter synthesis can proceed. High levels of tryptophan, leucine, and tyrosine do not alter the activity of PAH, nor do they allosterically stimulate, or inhibit, protein synthesis.
8. The answer is B. The niacin requirement for the synthesis of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$can be "spared" by the presence of tryptophan, which can be degraded and produce the nicotinamide component of these cofactors. In Hartnup disease, the neutral amino acid transporter is defective, leading to reduced uptake of tryptophan from the intestine. With less tryptophan available, the dietary requirement for niacin is increased. None of the other amino acids listed (alanine, glutamine, leucine, and
methionine) as answers can produce the ring component of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$.
9. The answer is A. Pyruvate is not an amino acid. Alanine is produced from pyruvate in a reversible transamination reaction. Alanine is the major gluconeogenic amino acid because it is produced in multiple tissues as a transport mechanism for nitrogen to the liver. Once in the liver, the alanine is transaminated to pyruvate, which enters gluconeogenesis, and the nitrogen (now attached to glutamate) is used by the urea cycle for excretion of the nitrogen. Under conditions of starvation, glutamine is also a major nitrogen carrier in the blood (because of its ability to bind two nitrogen groups), but glutamine was not offered as an answer to this question. Glycine, cysteine, and tryptophan are not used as nitrogen carriers during fasting or any other conditions.
10. The answer is B. Glutathione is a tripeptide consisting of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. The glutamate is linked to the cysteine via a peptide bond using the side-chain carboxylic acid of glutamate and the nitrogen group of cysteine. Glutamate is also used as a precursor for the synthesis of all the other amino acids listed as possible answers.

FIGURE 38.1 Overview of the onecarbon pool. $\mathrm{FH}_{4} \cdot C$ indicates tetrahydrofolate containing a one-carbon unit that is at the formyl, methylene, or methyl level of oxidation (see Fig. 38.3). The origin of the carbons is indicated, as are the final products after a one-carbon transfer. dTMP, deoxythymidine monophosphate.

Groups that contain a single carbon atom can be transferred from one compound to another. These carbon atoms may be in a number of different oxidation states. The most oxidized form, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, is transferred by biotin. One-carbon groups at lower levels of oxidation than $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are transferred by reactions involving tetrahydrofolate $\left(\mathrm{FH}_{4}\right)$, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, and $S$-adenosylmethionine (SAM).

Tetrahydrofolate. $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$, which is produced from the vitamin folate, is the primary one-carbon carrier in the body. This vitamin obtains one-carbon units from serine, glycine, histidine, formaldehyde, and formate (Fig. 38.1). While these carbons are attached to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$, they can be either oxidized or reduced. As a result, folate can exist in a variety of chemical forms. Once a carbon has been reduced to the methyl level (methyl-FH4), however, it cannot be reoxidized. Collectively, these one-carbon groups attached to their carrier $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ are known as the one-carbon pool. The term folate is used to represent a water-soluble B-complex vitamin that functions in transferring single-carbon groups at various stages of oxidation.

The one-carbon groups carried by $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ are used for many biosynthetic reactions. For example, one-carbon units are transferred to the pyrimidine base of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to form deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), to the amino acid glycine to form serine, to precursors of the purine bases to produce carbons C2 and C8 of the purine ring, and to vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{12}$.
Vitamin $B_{12}$. Vitamin $B_{12}$ is involved in two reactions in the body. It participates in the rearrangement of the methyl group of L-methylmalonyl coenzyme A (L-methylmalonylCoA) to form succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA), and it transfers a methyl group, obtained from $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$, to homocysteine, forming methionine.

S-Adenosylmethionine. SAM, produced from methionine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), transfers the methyl group to precursors that form a number of compounds, including creatine, phosphatidylcholine, epinephrine, melatonin, methylated nucleotides, methylated histones, and methylated DNA.

Methionine metabolism is very dependent on both $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. Homocysteine is derived from methionine metabolism and can be converted back into methionine by using both methyl-FH4 and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. This is the only reaction in which methyl-FH4 can donate the methyl group. If the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is defective, or if vitamin $B_{12}$ or $F H_{4}$ levels are insufficient, homocysteine will accumulate. Elevated homocysteine levels have been linked to cardiovascular and neurologic disease. A vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency can be brought about by the lack of intrinsic factor, a gastric protein required for the absorption of dietary $B_{12}$. A consequence of vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency is the accumulation of methyl$\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ and a decrease in other folate derivatives. This is known as the methyl-trap hypothesis, in which, because of the $B_{12}$ deficiency, most of the carbons in the $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ pool are trapped in the methyl-FH4 form, which is the most stable. The carbons cannot be released from the folate, because the one reaction in which they participate cannot occur because of the $B_{12}$ deficiency. This leads to a functional folate deficiency; even though total levels of folate are normal. A folate deficiency (whether

functional or actual) leads to megaloblastic anemia caused by an inability of blood cell precursors to synthesize DNA and, therefore, to divide. This leads to large, partially replicated cells being released into the blood to attempt to replenish the cells that have died. Folate deficiencies also have been linked to an increased incidence of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, in mothers who become pregnant while folate-deficient.

## THE WAITING ROOM

After resection of the cancer in his large intestine and completion of a course of postoperative chemotherapy with 5 -fluorouracil ( $5-\mathrm{FU}$ ) and oxaliplatin, Clark T. returned to his gastroenterologist for a routine follow-up colonoscopy. His colon was completely normal, with excellent healing at the site of the anastomosis. His physician expressed great optimism about a possible cure of Clark's previous malignancy but cautioned him about the need for regular colonoscopic examinations and surveillance computed tomography scans over the next few years.

0Beatrice T., a 75-year-old woman, went to see her physician because of numbness and tingling in her legs. A diet history indicated a normal and healthy diet, but Beatrice was not taking any supplemental vitamin pills. Laboratory results indicated a low level of serum $\mathrm{B}_{12}$.

0The initial laboratory profile, determined when Jean T. first presented to her physician with evidence of early alcohol-induced hepatitis, included a hematologic analysis that showed that Jean was anemic. Her hemoglobin was $11.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range, adult women $=12$ to $16 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). The erythrocyte (red blood cell) count was 3.6 million cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ (reference range, adult woman $=4.0$ to 5.2 million cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ). The average volume of her red blood cells (mean corpuscular volume [MCV]) was 108 fL (reference range, $=80$ to $100 \mathrm{fL} ; 1 \mathrm{fL}=10^{-12} \mathrm{~mL}$ ), and the hematology laboratory reported a striking variation in the size and shape of the red blood cells in a smear of her peripheral blood (see Chapter 42). The nuclei of the circulating granulocytic leukocytes had increased nuclear segmentation (polysegmented neutrophils). Because these findings are suggestive of a macrocytic anemia (in which blood cells are larger than normal), measurements of serum folate and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ (cobalamin) levels were ordered.

## I. Tetrahydrofolate

## A. Structure and Forms of Tetrahydrofolate

Folates exist in many chemical forms. The coenzyme form that functions in accepting one-carbon groups is $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ polyglutamate (Fig. 38.2), generally referred to as just tetrahydrofolate or $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$. It has three major structural components: a bicyclic pteridine ring, para-aminobenzoic acid, and a polyglutamate tail consisting of several glutamate residues joined in amide linkage. The one-carbon group that is accepted by the coenzyme and then transferred to another compound is bound to N5, to N10, or both.

Different forms of folate may differ in the oxidation state of the one-carbon group, in the number of glutamate residues attached, or in the degree of oxidation of the pteridine ring. When the term "folate" or "folic acid" is applied to a specific chemical form, it is the most oxidized form of the pteridine ring (see Fig. 38.2). Folate is reduced to dihydrofolate $\left(\mathrm{FH}_{2}\right)$ and then to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) present in cells. Reduction is the favored direction of the reaction; therefore, most of the folate present in the body is present as the reduced coenzyme form, $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$.

0
The Schilling test, now a historic test, involves the patient ingesting radioactive ${ }^{13} \mathrm{Co}$-labeled crystalline vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, after which a 24 -hour urine sample is collected. The radioactivity in the urine sample is compared with the input radioactivity, and the difference represents the amount of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ absorbed through the digestive tract. Such tests could distinguish whether the problem lies in removing $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ from bound dietary proteins or if the deficiency is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor or other proteins involved in transporting $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ throughout the body. Another method to determine if intrinsic factor activity is reduced is to determine the levels of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies in the blood. Autoantibodies toward intrinsic factor commonly develop in individuals with lack of intrinsic factor activity, and the levels of such antibodies can be determined in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant human intrinsic factor bound to plastic wells as the antigen. The Schilling test has been replaced by a competitive binding luminescent assay. This new test has recently been criticized for being unreliable, particularly if a patient exhibits anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.

0Folate deficiencies occur frequently in chronic alcoholics. Several factors are involved inadequate dietary intake of folate; direct damage to intestinal cells and brush-border enzymes, which interferes with absorption of dietary folate; a defect in the enterohepatic circulation, which reduces the absorption of folate; liver damage that causes decreased hepatic production of plasma proteins; and interference with kidney reabsorption of folate.

Hematopoietic precursor cells, when exposed to too little folate and/or vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, show slowed cell division, but cytoplasmic development occurs at a normal rate. Hence, the megaloblastic cells tend to be large, with an increased ratio of RNA to DNA. Megaloblastic erythroid progenitors are usually destroyed in the bone marrow (although some reach the circulation). Thus, marrow cellularity is often increased, but production of red blood cells is decreased, a condition called ineffective erythropoiesis.

Therefore, Jean has megaloblastic anemia, characteristic of folate or $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency.

Jean T.'s serum folic acid level was $3.1 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ (reference range, 6 to $15 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ ), and her serum $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ level was 210 ng/L (reference range, 180 to 914 ng/L). Her serum iron level was normal. It was clear, therefore, that Jean's megaloblastic anemia was caused by a folate deficiency (although her $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ levels were in the low range of normal). The management of a pure folate deficiency in a patient with alcoholism includes cessation of alcohol intake and a diet that is rich in folate.

Sufa drugs, which are used to treat certain bacterial infections, are analogs of para-aminobenzoic acid. They prevent growth and cell division in bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of folate. Because we cannot synthesize folate, sufa drugs do not affect human cells in this way.

The current US Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for folate equivalents is approximately $400 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ for adult men and women. In addition to being prevalent in green leafy vegetables, other good sources of this vitamin are liver, yeast, legumes, and some fruits. Protracted cooking of these foods, however, can destroy up to $90 \%$ of their folate content. A standard US diet provides 50 to $500 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ of absorbable folate each day. Folate deficiency in pregnant women, especially during the month before conception and the month after, increases the risk of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, in the fetus. To reduce the potential risk of neural tube defects for women capable of becoming pregnant, the recommendation is to take $400 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ of folic acid daily in a multivitamin pill (some organizations recommend 400 to $800 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ daily). If the woman has a history of having a child with a neural tube defect, this amount is increased to $4,000 \mu \mathrm{~g} /$ day for the month before and the month after conception. Flour-containing products in the United States are now supplemented with folate to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in newborns.

FIGURE 38.2 Reduction of folate to tetrahydrofolate $\left(\mathrm{FH}_{4}\right)$. The same enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase, catalyzes both reactions. Multiple glutamate residues are added within cells ( $n \sim 5$ ). Plants can synthesize folate but humans cannot. Therefore, folate is a dietary requirement. $R$ is the portion of the folate molecule shown to the right of NIO. The different precursors of $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ are indicated in the figure. NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; PABA, para-aminobenzoic acid.

## B. The Vitamin Folate

Folates are synthesized in bacteria and higher plants and ingested in green leafy vegetables, fruits, and legumes in the diet. The vitamin was named for its presence in green leafy vegetables (foliage). Most of the dietary folate derived from natural food sources is present in the reduced coenzyme form. However, vitamin supplements and fortified foods contain principally the oxidized form of the pteridine ring.

As dietary folates pass into the proximal third of the small intestine, folate conjugases in the brush border of the lumen cleave off glutamate residues to produce the monoglutamate form of folate, which is then absorbed (see Fig. 38.2, upper structure, when $n=1$ ). Within the intestinal cells, folate is converted principally to $N^{5}$-methyl-FH4, which enters the portal vein and goes to the liver. Smaller amounts of other forms of folate also follow this route.

The liver, which stores half of the body's folate, takes up much of the folate from the portal circulation; uptake may be through active transport or receptor-mediated endocytosis. Within the liver, $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ is reconjugated to the polyglutamate form before being used in reactions. A small amount of the folate is partially degraded, and the components enter the urine. A relatively large portion of the folate enters the bile and is subsequently reabsorbed (very similar to the fate of bile salts in the enterohepatic circulation).
$N^{5}$-Methyl-FH4, the major form of folate in the blood, is loosely bound to plasma proteins, particularly serum albumin.

## C. Oxidation and Reduction of the One-Carbon Groups of Tetrahydrofolate

One-carbon groups transferred by $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ are attached to either N 5 or N 10 , or they form a bridge between N5 and N10. The collection of one-carbon groups attached to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ is known as the one-carbon pool. While they are attached to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$, these one-carbon units can be oxidized and reduced (Fig. 38.3). Thus, reactions that require a carbon
![ma48589491dc](ma48589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 38.3 One-carbon units attached to tetrahydrofolate $\left(\mathrm{FH}_{4}\right)$. A. The active form of $\mathrm{FH}_{4} . R$ is the portion of the folate molecule shown to the right of NIO. B. Interconversions of one-carbon units of $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$. Only the portion of $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ from NS to NIO is shown, which is indicated by the green box in $\mathbf{A}$. After a formyl group forms a bridge between NS and NIO, two reductions can occur. Note that $N^{5}$-methyl-FH4 cannot be reoxidized. The most oxidized form of $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ is at the top of the figure, whereas the most reduced form is at the bottom. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; $A T P$, adenosine triphosphate; $N A D$, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.

Hereditary folate malabsorption is a rare disease caused by a mutation in a proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT; gene SLC46A1). Loss of PCFT activity in the intestinal proximal jejunum and duodenum lead to systemic folate deficiency. Newborns begin to exhibit symptoms of folate deficiency after a few months of life, after the folate obtained from the mother has been excreted. The children develop anemia, diarrhea, and become immunocompromised (owing to the reduction in blood cell differentiation). High-dose oral folate can be used to treat the patients, because another folate transporter (the reduced folate carrier, gene SLC19A1) can absorb sufficient folate when folate is present at high concentrations.

A deficiency of folate results in the accumulation of FIGLU, which is excreted in the urine. A histidine load test can be used to detect folate deficiency. Patients are given a test dose of histidine (a histidine load), and the amount of FIGLU that appears in the urine is measured and compared to normal values. Values greater than normal indicate folate deficiency.

The concentration of folate in serum can also be determined by a microbiologic test. Certain strains of bacteria require folate for growth, and if these bacteria are plated on a medium that lacks folate, they will not grow. Folate levels can be quantitated by preparing a standard curve using plates containing different levels of folate and determining the level of growth of the bacteria at that folate level. The unknown sample is then tested for bacterial growth and the extent of growth compared to the standard curve in order to determine the amount of folate in the unknown sample. Other tests for folate include measuring the binding of folate to certain proteins, and use of immunologic reagents that specifically bind to and identify folate.

FH $_{4}$ is required for the synthesis of dTMP and the purine bases used to produce the precursors for DNA replication. Therefore, $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ is required for cell division. Blockage of the synthesis of thymine and the purine bases, either by a dietary deficiency of folate or by drugs that interfere with folate metabolism, results in a decreased rate of cell division and growth.
in a particular oxidation state may use carbon from the one-carbon pool that was donated in a different oxidation state.

The individual steps for reduction of the one-carbon group are shown in Figure 38.3. The most oxidized form is $N^{10}$-formyl-FH ${ }_{4}$. The most reduced form is $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$. Once the methyl group is formed, it is not readily reoxidized back to $N^{5}, N^{10}$-methylene- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$, and thus, $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ tends to accumulate in the cell.

## D. Sources of One-Carbon Groups Carried by Tetrahydrofolate

Carbon sources for the one-carbon pool include serine, glycine, formaldehyde, histidine, and formate (Fig. 38.4). These donors transfer the carbons to folate in different oxidation states. Serine is the major carbon source of one-carbon groups in the human. Its hydroxymethyl group is transferred to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ in a reversible reaction, catalyzed by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase. This reaction produces glycine and $N^{5}, N^{10}$-methylene- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$. Because serine can be synthesized from 3-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate of glycolysis, dietary carbohydrate can serve as a source of carbon for the one-carbon pool. The glycine that is produced may be further degraded by donation of a carbon to folate. Additional donors that form $N^{5}, N^{10}$-methylene- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ are listed in Table 38.1.

Histidine and formate provide examples of compounds that donate carbon in different oxidation levels (see Fig. 38.4). Degradation of histidine produces formiminoglutamate (FIGLU), which reacts with $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ to donate a carbon and nitrogen (generating $N^{5}$-formimino- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ ), thereby releasing glutamate. Formate, produced from tryptophan oxidation, can react with $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ and generate $N^{10}$-formyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$, the most oxidized folate derivative.

## E. Recipients of One-Carbon Groups

The one-carbon groups on $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ may be oxidized or reduced (see Fig. 38.3) and then transferred to other compounds (see Fig. 38.4 and Table 38.1). Transfers of this sort are involved in the synthesis of glycine from serine, the synthesis of the base thymine required for DNA synthesis, the purine bases required for both DNA and RNA synthesis, and the transfer of methyl groups to vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$.

Because the conversion of serine to glycine is readily reversible, glycine can be converted to serine by drawing carbon from the one-carbon pool.

${ }^{a}$ The major source of carbon is serine.
${ }^{b}$ The carbon unit attached to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ can be oxidized and reduced (see Fig. 38.3). At the methyl level, reoxidation does not occur.

The nucleotide dTMP is produced from dUMP by a reaction in which dUMP is methylated to form dTMP (Fig. 38.5). The source of carbon is $N^{5}, N^{10}$-methylene$\mathrm{FH}_{4}$. Two hydrogen atoms from $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ are used to reduce the donated carbon to the methyl level. Consequently, $\mathrm{FH}_{2}$ is produced. Reduction of $\mathrm{FH}_{2}$ by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in a reaction catalyzed by DHFR regenerates $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$. This is the only reaction involving $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ in which the folate group is oxidized as the one-carbon group is donated to the recipient. Recall that DHFR is also required to reduce the oxidized form of the vitamin, which is obtained from the diet (see Fig. 38.2). Thus, DHFR is essential for regenerating $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ both in the tissues and from the diet. These reactions contribute to the effect of folate deficiency on DNA synthesis because dTMP is required only for the synthesis of DNA.

Tetrahydrofolate $\left(\mathrm{FH}_{4}\right)$ is oxidized to dihydrofolate $\left(\mathrm{FH}_{2}\right)$ in this reaction. $\mathrm{FH}_{2}$ is reduced to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ is converted to $N^{5}, N^{10}$-methylene-FH4 using serine as a carbon donor.

![ma51589491dc](ma51589491dc.jpg)

What compound does methotrexate resemble?

Methotrexate has the same structure as folate except that it has an amino group on C 4 and a methyl group on NIO. Anticancer drugs such as methotrexate are folate analogs that act by inhibiting DHFR, thereby preventing the conversion of $\mathrm{TH}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ (see Fig. 38.5). Thus, the cellular pools of $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ are not replenished, and reactions that require $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ cannot proceed.

A better understanding of the structure and function of the purine and pyrimidine bases and of folate metabolism led to the development of compounds having antimetabolic and antifolate action useful for treatment of neoplastic disease. For example, Clark T. was successfully treated for colon cancer with a combination of chemotherapy including 5-FU (see Chapter 12 and Fig. 38.5). 5-FU is a pyrimidine analog, which is converted in cells to the nucleotide fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP). FdUMP causes a "thymineless death," especially for tumor cells that have a rapid turnover rate. It prevents the growth of cancer cells by blocking the thymidylate synthase reaction; that is, the conversion of dUMP to dTMP.

Jean T.'s megaloblastic anemia was treated in part with folate supplements (see Clinical Comments). Within 48 hours of the initiation of folate therapy, megaloblastic or "ineffective" erythropoiesis usually subsides, and effective erythropoiesis begins.

Megaloblastic anemia is caused by a decrease in the synthesis of thymine and the purine bases. These deficiencies lead to an inability of hematopoietic (and other) cells to synthesize DNA and, therefore, to divide. Their persistently thwarted attempts at normal DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell division produce abnormally large cells (called megaloblasts) with abundant cytoplasm capable of protein synthesis but with clumping and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin (see Chapter 42). Some of these large cells, although immature, are released early from the marrow in an attempt to compensate for the anemia. Thus, peripheral blood smears also contain megaloblasts. Many of the large immature cells, however, are destroyed in the marrow and never reach the circulation.

During the synthesis of the purine bases, carbons 2 and 8 are obtained from the one-carbon pool (see Chapter 39). $N^{10}$-Formyl-FH4 provides both carbons. Folate deficiency would also hinder these reactions, contributing to an inability to replicate DNA because of the lack of precursors.

After the carbon group carried by $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ is reduced to the methyl level, it is transferred to vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. This is the only reaction through which the methyl group can leave $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ (recall that the reaction that creates $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ is not reversible).

## II. Vitamin $B_{12}$

## A. Structure and Forms of Vitamin $B_{12}$

The structure of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ (also known as cobalamin) is complex (Fig. 38.6). It contains a corrin ring, which is similar to the porphyrin ring found in heme. The corrin ring differs from heme, however, in that two of the four pyrrole rings are joined directly rather than by a methylene bridge. Its most unusual feature is the presence of cobalt, coordinated with the corrin ring (similar to the iron coordinated with the porphyrin ring). This cobalt can form a bond with a carbon atom. In the body, it reacts with the carbon of a methyl group, forming methylcobalamin, or with
![ma52589491dc](ma52589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 38.6 Vitamin $B_{12}$. When $X$ is $5^{\prime}$-deoxyadenosine, the vitamin is deoxyadenosylcobalamin; when $X$ is a methyl group, the vitamin is methylcobalamin; and when $X$ is CN , the vitamin is cyanocobalamin (the commercial form found in vitamin tablets).

the $5^{\prime}$-carbon of $5^{\prime}$-deoxyadenosine, forming $5^{\prime}$-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (note that in this case the deoxy designation refers to the $5^{\prime}$-carbon, not the $2^{\prime}$-carbon as is the case in the sugar found in DNA). The form of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ found in vitamin supplements is cyanocobalamin, in which a CN group is linked to the cobalt.

## B. Absorption and Transport of Vitamin $B_{12}$

Although vitamin $B_{12}$ is produced by bacteria, it cannot be synthesized by higher plants or animals. The major source of vitamin $B_{12}$ is dietary meat, eggs, dairy products, fish, poultry, and seafood. The animals that serve as the source of these foods obtain $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ mainly from the bacteria in their food supply. The absorption of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ from the diet is a complex process (Fig. 38.7).

Ingested $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ can exist in two forms, either free or bound to dietary proteins. If free, the $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ binds to proteins known as $R$-binders (haptocorrins, also known as transcobalamin $I$ ), which are secreted by the salivary glands and the gastric mucosa in either the saliva or the stomach. If the ingested $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is bound to proteins, it must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. Once the $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is released from its bound protein, it binds to the haptocorrins. In the small intestine, the pancreatic proteases digest the haptocorrins, and the released $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ then binds to intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach when food enters the stomach. The intrinsic factor- $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ complex attaches to specific receptors in the terminal segment of the small intestine known as the ileum, after which the complex is internalized.
![ma53589491dc](ma53589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 38.7 Absorption, transport, and storage of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. Dietary $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ binds to R -binders (haptocorrins) in the stomach and travels to the intestine, where the R -binders are destroyed by pancreatic proteases. The freed $B_{12}$ then binds to intrinsic factor. $B_{12}$ is absorbed in the ileum and carried by proteins named transcobalamins to the liver, where $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is stored.

The average daily diet in Western countries contains 5 to $30 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ of vitamin $B_{12}$, of which I to $5 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ is absorbed into the blood. (The RDA is $2.4 \mu \mathrm{~g} /$ day.) Total body content of this vitamin in an adult is approximately 2 to 5 mg , of which 1 mg is present in the liver. As a result, a dietary deficiency of $B_{12}$ is uncommon and is observed only after a number of years on a diet that is deficient in this vitamin.

Despite Jean T's relatively malnourished state because of her chronic alcoholism, her serum cobalamin level was still within the low-to-normal range. If her undernourished state had continued, a cobalamin deficiency would eventually have developed.

4Pernicious anemia, a deficiency of intrinsic factor, is a relatively common problem that is caused by malabsorption of dietary cobalamin. It may result from an inherited defect that leads to decreased ability of gastric parietal cells to synthesize intrinsic factor or from partial resection of the stomach or of the ileum. Production of intrinsic factor often declines with age and may be low in elderly individuals. An alternative circumstance that leads to the development of a vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency is pancreatic insufficiency or a high intestinal pH , which results from too little acid being produced by the stomach. Both of these conditions prevent the degradation of the R -binder- $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ complex as a result, $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is not released from the R -binder protein and, therefore, cannot bind to intrinsic factor. The protein receptor for the $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-intrinsic factor complex is named cubilin, and the internalization of the $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-intrinsic factor-cubilin complex requires the activity of a transmembrane protein named amnionless. Congenital malabsorption of $B_{12}$ can also arise from inherited mutations in either cubilin or amnionless.

How should vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ be administered to a patient with pernicious anemia?
![ma54589491dc](ma54589491dc.jpg)

The $B_{12}$ within the enterocyte complexes with transcobalamin II before it is released into the circulation. The transcobalamin II- $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ complex delivers $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ to the tissues, which contain specific receptors for this complex. The liver takes up approximately $50 \%$ of the vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, and the remainder is transported to other tissues. The amount of the vitamin stored in the liver is large enough that 3 to 6 years pass before symptoms of a dietary deficiency occur.

## C. Functions of Vitamin $B_{12}$

Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is involved in two reactions in the body: the transfer of a methyl group from $N^{5}$-methyl-FH4 to homocysteine to form methionine and the rearrangement of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to form succinyl-CoA (Fig. 38.8).
$\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ receives a one-carbon group from serine or from other sources. This carbon is reduced to the methyl level and transferred to vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, forming methyl- $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ (or methylcobalamin). Methylcobalamin transfers the methyl group to homocysteine, which is converted to methionine by the enzyme methionine synthase. Methionine can then be activated to SAM to transfer the methyl group to other compounds (Fig. 38.9).

Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ also participates in the conversion of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinylCoA. In this case, the active form of the coenzyme is $5^{\prime}$-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. This reaction is part of the metabolic route for the conversion of carbons from valine, isoleucine, threonine, and the last three carbons of odd-chain fatty acids, all of which form propionyl coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA), to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA (see Chapter 37).
![ma55589491dc](ma55589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 38.9 Relationships among tetrahydrofolate $\left(\mathrm{FH}_{4}\right)$, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). A. Overall scheme. B. Some specific reactions that require SAM. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.

## III. $S$-Adenosylmethionine

SAM participates in the synthesis of many compounds that contain methyl groups. It is used in reactions that add methyl groups to either oxygen or nitrogen atoms in the acceptor (contrast that to folate derivatives, which can add one-carbon groups to sulfur or to carbon). As examples, SAM is required for the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine, guanidinoacetate to creatine, norepinephrine to epinephrine, acetylserotonin to melatonin, and nucleotides to methylated nucleotides (see Fig. 38.9B). It is also required for the inactivation of catecholamines and serotonin (see Chapter 46). More than 35 reactions in humans require methyl donation from SAM.

SAM is synthesized from methionine and ATP. As with the activation of vita$\min \mathrm{B}_{12}$, ATP donates the adenosine. With the transfer of its methyl group, SAM forms $S$-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is subsequently hydrolyzed to form homocysteine and adenosine.

Methionine, required for the synthesis of SAM, is obtained from the diet or produced from homocysteine, which accepts a methyl group from vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ (see Fig. 38.9A). Thus, the methyl group of methionine is regenerated. The portion of methionine that is essential in the diet is the homocysteine moiety. If we had an adequate dietary source of homocysteine, methionine would not be required in the diet. However, there is no good dietary source of homocysteine, whereas methionine is plentiful in the diet.

Homocysteine provides the sulfur atom for the synthesis of cysteine (see Chapter 37). In this case, homocysteine reacts with serine to form cystathionine, which is cleaved, yielding cysteine and $\alpha$-ketobutyrate. The first reaction in this sequence is inhibited by cysteine. Thus, methionine, via homocysteine, is not used for cysteine synthesis unless the levels of cysteine in the body are lower than required for its metabolic functions. An adequate dietary supply of cysteine, therefore, can "spare" (or reduce) the dietary requirement for methionine.

## IV. Relationships among Folate, Vitamin $B_{12}$, and $S$-Adenosylmethionine

## A. The Methyl-Trap Hypothesis

If one analyzes the flow of carbon in the folate cycle, the equilibrium lies in the direction of the $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ form. This appears to be the most stable form of carbon attached to the vitamin. However, in only one reaction can the methyl group be removed from $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$, and that is the methionine synthase reaction, which requires vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. Thus, if vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is deficient, or if the methionine synthase enzyme is defective, $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ accumulates. Eventually, most folate forms in the body become "trapped" in the $N^{5}$-methyl form. A functional folate deficiency results because the carbons cannot be removed from the folate. The appearance of a functional folate deficiency caused by a lack of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is known as the methyl-trap hypothesis, and its clinical implications are discussed in following sections.

## B. Hyperhomocysteinemia

Elevated homocysteine levels have been linked to cardiovascular and neurologic disease. Homocysteine levels can accumulate in a number of ways, which are related to both folic acid and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ metabolism. Homocysteine is derived from SAH, which arises when SAM donates a methyl group (Fig. 38.10). Because SAM is frequently donating methyl groups, there is constant production of SAH, which leads to constant production of homocysteine. Recall from Chapter 37 that homocysteine has two biochemical fates. The homocysteine produced can be either remethylated to methionine or condensed with serine to form cystathionine. There are two routes to methionine production. The major one is methylation by $N^{5}$-methyl-FH4, which requires vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$.

Because the problem in pernicious anemia is a lack of intrinsic factor, which results in an inability to absorb vitamin $B_{12}$ from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, $B_{12}$ can be administered by injection. More recently, studies have shown that $B_{12}$ deficiency can be effectively treated with very high doses of oral $B_{12}$ because of another transport system lower in the GI tract that does not require intrinsic factor.

There are two major clinical manifestations of cobalamin (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ ) deficiency. One such presentation is hematopoietic (caused by the adverse effects of a $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency on folate metabolism) and the other is neurologic (caused by hypomethylation and myelin destabilization in the nervous system). The hemopoietic problems associated with a $B_{12}$ deficiency are identical to those observed in a folate deficiency and, in fact, result from a folate deficiency secondary to (i.e., caused by) the $B_{12}$ deficiency (i.e., the methyl-trap hypothesis). As the $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ pool is exhausted, deficiencies of the $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ derivatives needed for purine and dTMP biosynthesis develop, leading to the characteristic megaloblastic anemia.

The classical clinical presentation of the neurologic dysfunction associated with a $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency includes symmetric numbness and tingling of the feet (and less so the hands), diminishing vibratory and position sense, and progression to a spastic gait disturbance. The patient may develop dementia and depression. Rarely, they develop psychosis ("megaloblastic madness"). Other rare symptoms include blind spots that develop in the central portions of the visual fields, and alterations in gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell) function. This is thought to be caused by two factors. The first is hypomethylation within the nervous system, brought about by an inability to recycle homocysteine to methionine and from there to SAM. The latter is the required methyl donor in these reactions. The nervous system lacks the betaine pathway of methionine regeneration (see Fig. 38.10) and is dependent on the $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ system for regenerating SAM. With a $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency, this pathway is inoperable in the nervous system, and DNA and histones are hypomethylated. The second factor is the accumulation of methylmalonic acid, which leads to myelin destabilization and loss of protection of the neurons. This occurs because of methylmalonyl-CoA being used in place of malonyl-CoA in fatty acid synthesis. This generates branched-chain fatty acids that are incorporated into phospholipids and eventually the myelin sheath.

![ma56589491dc](ma56589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 38.10 Reaction pathways that involve homocysteine. Defects in numbered enzymes ( $I$, methionine synthase; $2, N^{5}, N^{10}$-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; 3 , cystathionine $\beta$-synthase) lead to elevated homocysteine. Recall that as cysteine accumulates, there is feedback inhibition on cystathionine $\beta$-synthase to stop further cysteine production. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$, tetrahydrofolate; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$, inorganic phosphate; $P P_{4}$ pyrophosphate; $S A M, S$-adenosylmethionine.

Many health food stores now sell SAMe, a stabilized version of SAM. SAMe has been hypothesized to relieve depression because the synthesis of certain neurotransmitters requires methylation by SAM (see Chapter 46). This has led to the hypothesis that by increasing SAM levels in the nervous system, the biosynthesis of these neurotransmitters will be accelerated. This in turn might alleviate the feelings of depression. There have been reports in the literature indicating that this may occur; but its efficacy as an antidepressant must be confirmed. The major questions that must be addressed include the stability of SAMe in the digestive system and the level of uptake of SAMe by cells of the nervous system.

The liver also contains a second pathway in which betaine (derived from choline) can donate a methyl group to homocysteine to form methionine, but this is a minor pathway (see Section II of this chapter). The conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine requires pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). Thus, if an individual is deficient in vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, the conversion of homocysteine to methionine by the major route is inhibited. This directs homocysteine to produce cystathionine, which eventually produces cysteine. As cysteine levels accumulate, the enzyme that makes cystathionine undergoes feedback inhibition, and that pathway is also inhibited (see Fig. 38.10). This, overall, leads to accumulation of homocysteine, which is released into the blood.

Homocysteine also accumulates in the blood if a mutation is present in the enzyme that converts $N^{5}, N^{10}$-methylene- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ to $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$. When this occurs, the levels of $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ are too low to allow homocysteine to be converted to methionine. The loss of this pathway, coupled with the feedback inhibition by cysteine on cystathionine formation, also leads to elevated homocysteine levels in the blood.

A third way in which serum homocysteine levels can be elevated is by a mutated cystathionine $\beta$-synthase or a deficiency in vitamin $B_{6}$, the required cofactor for that enzyme. These defects block the ability of homocysteine to be converted to cystathionine, and the homocysteine that does accumulate cannot all be accommodated by conversion to methionine. Thus, an accumulation of homocysteine results.

## C. Neural Tube Defects

Folate deficiency during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects in the developing fetus. This risk is significantly reduced if women take folic acid supplements periconceptually. The link between folate deficiency and neural tube defects was first observed in women with hyperhomocysteinemia brought about by a thermolabile variant of $N^{5}, N^{10}$-methylene- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ reductase. This form of the enzyme, which results from a single nucleotide change ( C to T ) in position 677 of the gene that encodes the protein, is less active at body temperature than at lower temperatures. This results in a reduced level of $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ being generated and, therefore, an increase in the levels of homocysteine. Along with the elevated homocysteine, the women were also folate-deficient. The folate deficiency and the subsequent inhibition

of DNA synthesis leads to neural tube defects. The elevated homocysteine is one indication that such a deficit is present. These findings have led to the recommendation that women considering getting pregnant begin taking folate supplements before conception occurs and during pregnancy. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has, in fact, mandated that folate be added to flour-containing products in the United States.

# D. Folate Deficiencies and DNA Synthesis 

Folate deficiencies result in decreased availability of the deoxythymidine and purine nucleotides that serve as precursors for DNA synthesis. The decreased concentrations of these precursors affect not only the DNA synthesis that occurs during replication before cell division but also the DNA synthesis that occurs as a step in the processes that repair damaged DNA.

Decreased methylation of dUMP to form dTMP, a reaction that requires $N^{5}, N^{10}$-methylene-FH4 as a coenzyme (see Fig. 38.5), leads to an increase in the intracellular dUTP/deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) ratio. This ratio change causes a significant increase in the incorporation of uracil into DNA. Although much of this uracil can be removed by DNA-repair enzymes, the lack of available dTTP blocks the step of DNA repair that is catalyzed by DNA polymerase. The result is fragmentation of DNA as well as blockade of normal DNA replication.

These abnormal nuclear processes are responsible for the clumping and polysegmentation seen in the nuclei of neutrophilic leukocytes in the bone marrow and in the peripheral blood of patients with megaloblastic anemia caused by a primary folate deficiency or one that is secondary to $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. The abnormalities in DNA synthesis and repair lead to an irreversible loss of the capacity for cell division and eventually to cell death.

## V. Choline and One-Carbon Metabolism

Other compounds involved in one-carbon metabolism are derived from degradation products of choline. Choline, an essential component of certain phospholipids, is oxidized to form betaine aldehyde, which is further oxidized to betaine (trimethylglycine). In the liver, betaine can donate a methyl group to homocysteine to form methionine and dimethylglycine. This allows the liver to have two routes for homocysteine conversion to methionine. This is in contrast to the nervous system, which only expresses the primary $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-requiring pathway. Under conditions in which SAM accumulates, glycine can be methylated to form sarcosine ( $N$-methylglycine). This route of glycine metabolism is used when methionine levels are high and excess methionine needs to be metabolized (Fig. 38.11).

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

Jean T. Jean T. developed a folate deficiency and is on the verge of developing a cobalamin (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ ) deficiency as a consequence of prolonged, moderately severe malnutrition related to chronic alcoholism. Before folate therapy is started, the physician must ascertain that the megaloblastic anemia is not caused by a pure $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency or a combined deficiency of folate and $\mathrm{B}_{12}$.

If folate is given without cobalamin to a $\mathrm{B}_{12}$-deficient patient, the drug only partially corrects the megaloblastic anemia because it will "bypass" the methyl-folate trap and provide adequate $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ coenzyme for the conversion of dUMP to dTMP and for a resurgence of purine synthesis. As a result, normal DNA synthesis, DNA repair, and cell division occur. However, the neurologic syndrome, resulting from hypomethylation in nervous tissue, and accumulation of methylmalonic acid, may progress unless the physician realizes that $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ supplementation is required. In Jean's case, in which the serum $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ concentration was borderline low and in which the dietary history supported the possibility of a $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency, a combination of folate and $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ supplements is required to avoid this potential therapeutic trap.
![ma58589491dc](ma58589491dc.jpg)

Clark T. Clark T. continued to do well and returned faithfully for his regular colonoscopic examinations.

Beatrice T. Beatrice T. was diagnosed with a decreased ability to absorb dietary $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. One of the consequences of aging is a reduced acid production by the gastric mucosa (atrophic gastritis), which limits the ability of pepsin to work on dietary protein. Reduced pepsin efficiency then reduces the amount of bound $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ released from dietary protein, as a result of which the $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is not available for absorption. Her condition can be treated by taking high-dose vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ supplements orally.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

A Potential Mechanism Relating to Folate Deficiencies and Neural Tube Defects. As indicated in Section IV.C of this chapter, neural tube defects in newborns have been associated with folate deficiency during pregnancy. Although the mechanism leading to neural tube defects is vague, new research has indicated that the induction of micro RNAs (miRNAs) may play a role in altering the normal developmental pattern of neural tube closure.

Under conditions of a folate deficiency, hypomethylation occurs in the nervous system, affecting membrane phospholipid biosynthesis (such as phosphatidylcholine), myelin basic protein (see Chapter 46), and neurotransmitter biosynthesis (see Chapter 46). The reduced levels of neurotransmitters may interfere with normal gene expression during embryogenesis. DNA methylation is also reduced, owing to reduced SAM levels when folate is limiting. Hypomethylation is also the result of increased levels of SAH, which accumulates during a folate deficiency. SAH will inhibit DNA methyltransferase enzymes by tightly binding to the enzyme, and preventing the normal substrate, SAM, from binding to the enzyme. The enzymes affinity for SAH is higher than that of SAM, contributing to the hypomethylation observed.
miRNA genes are frequently in close proximity to CpG islands in DNA, and it has been predicted that alterations in cytosine methylation may be a means of regulating miRNA expression. Experimentally, a cell line in which two DNA methyltransferase genes were knocked out (inactivated) resulted in a significant reduction in global genomic methylation and the differential expression of 13 miRNAs (seven of those genes were overexpressed, whereas the other six displayed a reduction in expression). A similar result was obtained with another cell line that was placed in folate-deficient media; global hypomethylation and alterations in miRNA expression were observed.

As an example, miR-222 was identified as a potential miRNA that is upregulated under conditions of folate deprivation. A predicted target of miR-222 is the DNMT-1 gene (a DNA methyltransferase), whose activity is critical for the maintenance of methylation patterns in DNA. Overexpression of miR-222 would reduce DNMT-1 gene expression, thereby altering methylation patterns in the cell. A reduction of DNMT-1 activity has been shown to increase the expression of a number of genes, including $\beta$-catenin (see Chapter 18). This will lead to enhanced cell proliferation and inhibition of differentiation in the nervous system (all leading to a failure to close the neural tube).

Studies such as those described previously are in their infancy but produce a promising start for unraveling the effects of DNA methylation, and miRNA expression, on cell growth and differentiation in the nervous system.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- One-carbon groups at lower oxidation states than carbon dioxide (which is carried by biotin) are transferred by reactions that involve tetrahydrofolate $\left(\mathrm{FH}_{4}\right)$, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, and $S$-adenosylmethionine (SAM).
- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ is produced from the vitamin folate and obtains one-carbon units from serine, glycine, histidine, formaldehyde, and formic acid.
- The carbon attached to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ can be oxidized or reduced, thus producing several different forms of $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$. However, once a carbon has been reduced to the methyl level, it cannot be reoxidized.
- The carbons attached to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ are known collectively as the one-carbon pool.
- The carbons carried by folate are used in a limited number of biochemical reactions, but they are very important in forming deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) and the purine rings.
- Vitamin $B_{12}$ participates in two reactions in the body: conversion of L-methylmalonylCoA to succinyl-CoA and conversion of homocysteine to methionine.
- SAM, formed from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and methionine, transfers the methyl group to precursors of a variety of methylated compounds.
- Both vitamin $B_{12}$ and methyl-FH4 are required in methionine metabolism; a deficiency of vitamin $B_{12}$ leads to overproduction and trapping of folate in the methyl form, leading to a functional folate deficiency. Such deficiencies can lead to
- Megaloblastic anemia
- Neural tube defects in newborns
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 38.2.

## ANSWERS

1. The answer is D. The homocysteine-to-methionine reaction requires $N^{8}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$; serine to glycine requires free $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ and generates $N^{8}, N^{10}$-methylene- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$; betaine donates a methyl group to homocysteine to form methionine without the participation of $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$; and the purine ring requires $N^{10}$-formyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ in its biosynthesis.
2. The answer is B. Propionic acid is derived from an accumulation of propionyl-CoA. The normal pathway
for the degradation of propionyl-CoA is, first, a biotindependent carboxylation to D-methylmalonyl-CoA, racemization to L-methylmalonyl-CoA, and then the $\mathrm{B}_{12^{-}}$ dependent rearrangement to succinyl-CoA.
3. The answer is C. Sulfa drugs are analogs of paraaminobenzoic acid and prevent growth and cell division in bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of folic acid (which is needed to produce $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ ). Humans cannot

synthesize folate de novo and must obtain folate from the diet. Because of this, the sulfa drugs do not affect human metabolism.
4. The answer is B. The only three forms of folate that transfer carbons are the $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ form, the $N^{5}, N^{10}$ -methylene- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ form, and the $N^{10}$-formyl form. None of the other forms participates in reactions in which the carbon is transferred. It is the $N^{5}$-methyl form that transfers the methyl group to form methionine from homocysteine.
5. The answer is E. Choline, derived from phosphatidylcholine, is converted to betaine (trimethylglycine). Betaine can donate a methyl group to homocysteine to form methionine plus dimethylglycine. Sarcosine is N -methylglycine, which is formed when excess SAM methylates glycine, but it is not used as a methyl donor in this reaction.
6. The answer is B. The conversion of homocysteine to methionine, catalyzed by methionine synthase, requires vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ as a cofactor and $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ as a substrate. This is the only mammalian reaction in which $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ can donate its carbon. Once methionine is generated, it is converted to SAM, which acts as a methyl donor for neurotransmitter synthesis, myelin synthesis, phospholipid synthesis, and DNA modifications. Inability to catalyze the methionine synthase reaction, owing to either $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folate deficiency, would lead to a reduction of SAM levels and hypomethylation in the nervous system. The liver does not exhibit hypomethylation because of the betaine pathway, in which betaine can donate a methyl group to homocysteine to form methionine, also forming dimethylglycine once betaine loses a methyl group. Transcobalamin II carries $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ in the circulation and does not interact with folate. Cystathionine $\beta$-synthase catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine and serine to cystathionine and requires vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ but not $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folate. $N^{5}, N^{10}$-Methylene- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ reductase converts $N^{5}, N^{10}$-methylene- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ to $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ and requires NADH but not vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. DNA methyltransferases require SAM to methylate cytosine residues in DNA, but folic acid is not required as a cofactor for that reaction.
7. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The patient is suffering from a vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ can only be obtained from meat and dairy products in the diet, and although the body may have a 2- to 3-year store of the vitamin, given the patient's diet and lack of vitamins, $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ has become deficient. The tiredness and lethargy is owing to the development of megaloblastic anemia, and the tingling is caused by nervous system dysfunction owing to hypomethylation and methylmalonic acid in the nervous system. In the absence of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, folate will be trapped
as $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$, because the methionine synthase reaction will be unable to proceed. Once $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ is formed, it cannot be converted back into the other folate forms. Because this is the most stable folate form, the other variants of folate will slowly be converted to this form and be trapped.
8. The answer is D. The megaloblastic anemia can be caused by a deficiency of either vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folic acid. A $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency will block two reactions, homocysteine to methionine and methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. A $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency, therefore, will lead to elevated methylmalonic acid because the methylmal-onyl-CoA produced cannot be metabolized further to succinyl-CoA. The lack of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ also traps folate as the $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ form (because the methyl group cannot be transferred to homocysteine), leading to a functional folate deficiency. The folate deficiency interferes with purine and thymidine synthesis, leading to an overall cessation of DNA synthesis in rapidly growing cells, such as reticulocytes. This leads to megaloblast development and ineffective erythropoiesis. If the patient had a folate deficiency, FIGLU would accumulate in the urine (a degradation product of histidine). Accumulation of lactate, or pyruvate, does not occur with $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folate deficiencies. Methionine might accumulate (because of high homocysteine levels), but it usually stays fairly level and would not be diagnostic for determining between a $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or a folate deficiency. Histidine also would not accumulate, as FIGLU accumulates in a folate deficiency, and this would be used to distinguish between $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate deficiencies.
9. The answer is D. Lacto-ovo vegetarians eat eggs and dairy products. Eggs are a dietary source of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. Stomach intrinsic factor binds released $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, but stomach gastrin has no role in $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ absorption. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ bound to intrinsic factor is absorbed in the terminal ileum, not the duodenum. The ileum is involved in Crohn's disease, which then interferes with $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ absorption. Biliary duct obstruction would block bile acid release from the gallbladder into the intestine, which would interfere with absorption of dietary fat but not absorption of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, which is a water-soluble vitamin.
10. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. Methotrexate inhibits DHFR, which blocks the conversion of $\mathrm{FH}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$. The reduction of cellular pools of $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ would then indirectly affect reactions that require $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$. 5-FU directly inhibits the conversion of dUMP to dTMP. The conversion of homocysteine to methionine requires vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$. The $N^{5}$-methyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ levels will be low owing to the folate being trapped as $\mathrm{FH}_{2}$ because of the direct inhibition of DHFR by methotrexate.

# Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism 

![ma59589491dc](ma59589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 39.1 Origin of the atoms of the purine base. $F H_{4}$, tetrahydrofolate; $R P$, ribose 5 '-phosphate.

Purines and pyrimidines are required for synthesizing nucleotides and nucleic acids. These molecules can be synthesized from scratch, de novo, or salvaged from existing bases. Dietary uptake of purine and pyrimidine bases is low because most of the ingested nucleic acids are metabolized by the intestinal epithelial cells.

The de novo pathway of purine synthesis is complex, consisting of II steps and requiring six molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for every purine synthesized. The precursors that donate components to produce purine nucleotides include glycine, ribose 5-phosphate, glutamine, aspartate, carbon dioxide, and $\mathbf{N}^{\text {III }}$ formyltetrahydrofolate (Fig. 39.1). Purines are synthesized as ribonucleotides, with the initial purine synthesized being inosine monophosphate (IMP). Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) are each derived from IMP in two-step reaction pathways.

The purine nucleotide salvage pathway allows free purine bases to be converted into nucleotides, nucleotides into nucleosides, and nucleosides into free bases. Enzymes included in this pathway are AMP and adenosine deaminase (ADA), adenosine kinase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). Mutations in several of these enzymes lead to serious diseases. Deficiencies in purine nucleoside phosphorylase and ADA lead to immunodeficiency disorders. A deficiency in HGPRT leads to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The purine nucleotide cycle, in which aspartate carbons are converted to fumarate to replenish tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates in working muscle, and the aspartate nitrogen is released as ammonia, uses components of the purine nucleotide salvage pathway.

Pyrimidine bases are first synthesized as the free base and then converted to a nucleotide. Aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate form all components of the pyrimidine ring. Ribose 5-phosphate, which is converted to 5'-phosphoribosyl I'-pyrophosphate (PRPP), is required to donate the sugar phosphate to form a nucleotide. The first pyrimidine nucleotide produced is orotate monophosphate (OMP). The OMP is converted to uridine monophosphate (UMP), which becomes the precursor for both cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) production.

The formation of deoxyribonucleotides requires ribonucleotide reductase activity, which catalyzes the reduction of ribose on nucleotide diphosphate substrates to 2'-deoxyribose. Substrates for the enzyme include adenosine diphosphate (ADP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP), cytidine diphosphate (CDP), and uridine diphosphate (UDP). Regulation of the enzyme is complex. There are two major allosteric sites. One controls the overall activity of the enzyme, whereas the other determines the substrate specificity of the enzyme. All deoxyribonucleotides are synthesized using this one enzyme.

The regulation of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis occurs at four points in the pathway. The enzymes PRPP synthetase, amidophosphoribosyltransferase, IMP dehydrogenase, and adenylosuccinate synthetase are regulated by allosteric modifiers because they occur at key branch points through the pathway. Pyrimidine synthesis is regulated at the first committed step, which is the synthesis of cytoplasmic carbamoyl phosphate, by the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPSII).

Purines, when degraded, cannot generate energy, nor can the purine ring be substantially modified. The end-product of purine ring degradation is uric acid, which is excreted in the urine. Uric acid has limited solubility, and if it were to accumulate, uric acid crystals would precipitate in tissues of the body that have a reduced temperature (such as the big toe). This condition of acute painful inflammation of specific soft tissues and joints is called gout. Pyrimidines, when degraded, however, give rise to water-soluble compounds such as urea, carbon dioxide, and water and do not lead to a disease state if pyrimidine catabolism is increased.

## THE WAITING ROOM

The initial acute inflammatory process that caused Lotta T. to experience a painful attack of gouty arthritis responded quickly to colchicine therapy (see Chapter 10). Several weeks after the inflammatory signs and symptoms in her right great toe subsided, Lotta was placed on allopurinol (while continuing colchicine), a drug that reduces uric acid synthesis. Her serum uric acid level gradually fell from a pretreatment level of $9.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ into the normal range ( 2.5 to $8.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). She remained free of gouty symptoms when she returned to her physician for a follow-up office visit.

## I. Purines and Pyrimidines

As has been seen in previous chapters, nucleotides serve numerous functions in different reaction pathways. For example, nucleotides are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. Nucleotides form the structural moieties of many coenzymes (examples include nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left[\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right]$, flavin adenine dinucleotide [FAD], and coenzyme A). Nucleotides are critical elements in energy metabolism (ATP, guanosine triphosphate [GTP]). Nucleotide derivatives are frequently activated intermediates in many biosynthetic pathways. For example, UDP-glucose and CDP-diacylglycerol are precursors of glycogen and phosphoglycerides, respectively. $S$-Adenosylmethionine carries an activated methyl group. In addition, nucleotides act as second messengers in intracellular signaling (e.g., cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP], cyclic guanosine monophosphate [cGMP]). Finally, nucleotides and nucleosides act as metabolic allosteric regulators. Think about all of the enzymes that have been studied that are regulated by levels of ATP, ADP, and AMP.

Dietary uptake of purine and pyrimidine bases is minimal. The diet contains nucleic acids, and the exocrine pancreas secretes deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease, along with the proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes. This enables digested nucleic acids to be converted to nucleotides. The intestinal epithelial cells contain alkaline phosphatase activity, which converts nucleotides to nucleosides. Other enzymes within the epithelial cells tend to metabolize the nucleosides to uric acid (which is released into the circulation) or to salvage them for their own needs. Approximately $5 \%$ of ingested nucleotides make it into the circulation, either as the free base or as a nucleoside. Because of the minimal dietary uptake of these important molecules, de novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines is required.

## II. Purine Biosynthesis

The purine bases are produced de novo by pathways that use amino acids as precursors and produce nucleotides. Most de novo synthesis occurs in the liver (Fig. 39.2), and the nitrogenous bases and nucleosides are then transported to other tissues by red blood cells. The brain also synthesizes significant amounts of nucleotides. Because the de novo pathway requires at least six high-energy bonds per purine produced, a salvage pathway, which is used by many cell types, can convert free bases and nucleosides to nucleotides.

## A. De Novo Synthesis of the Purine Nucleotides

## I. Synthesis of Inosine Monophosphate

Because purines are built on a ribose base (see Fig. 39.2), an activated form of ribose is used to initiate the purine biosynthetic pathway. 5-Phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) is the activated source of the ribose moiety. It is synthesized from ATP and ribose 5-phosphate (Fig. 39.3), which is produced from glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway (see Chapter 27). The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction, PRPP synthetase, is a regulated enzyme (see Section II.A.5); however, this step is not the
![ma62589491dc](ma62589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 39.4 The first step in purine biosynthesis. The purine base is built on the ribose moiety. The availability of the substrate 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) is a major determinant of the rate of this reaction. $P P_{0}$ pyrophosphate.
committed step of purine biosynthesis. PRPP has many other uses, which are described as the chapter progresses.

In the first committed step of the purine biosynthetic pathway, PRPP reacts with glutamine to form 5'-phosphoribosyl 1'-amine (Fig. 39.4). This reaction, which produces nitrogen 9 of the purine ring, is catalyzed by glutamine phosphoribosylamidotransferase, a highly regulated enzyme.

In the next step of the pathway, the entire glycine molecule is added to the growing precursor. Glycine provides carbons 4 and 5 and nitrogen 7 of the purine ring (Fig. 39.5). This step requires energy in the form of ATP.

Subsequently, carbon 8 is provided by $N^{10}$-formyltetrahydrofolate ( $N^{10}$-formyl-FH4), nitrogen 3 by glutamine, carbon 6 by $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, nitrogen 1 by aspartate, and carbon 2 by $N^{10}$ formyl-FH4 (see Fig. 39.1). Note that six high-energy bonds of ATP are required (starting with ribose 5-phosphate) to synthesize the first purine nucleotide, IMP. This nucleotide contains the base hypoxanthine joined by an N -glycosidic bond from nitrogen 9 of the purine ring to carbon 1 of the ribose (Fig. 39.6). Hypoxanthine is not found in DNA, but it is the precursor for the other purine bases. However, hypoxanthine is found in the anticodon of transfer RNA molecules (see Chapter 15) and is a critical component for allowing wobble base pairs to form.

## 2. Synthesis of Adenosine Monophosphate

IMP serves as the branch point from which both adenine and guanine nucleotides can be produced (see Fig. 39.2). AMP is derived from IMP in two steps (Fig. 39.7). In the first step, aspartate is added to IMP to form adenylosuccinate, a reaction similar to the one catalyzed by argininosuccinate synthetase in the urea cycle. Note that this reaction requires a high-energy bond, donated by GTP. Fumarate is then

released from the adenylosuccinate by the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase to form AMP. This is similar to the aspartate-to-fumarate conversion seen in the urea cycle (see Chapter 38). In both cases, aspartate donates a nitrogen to the product, whereas the carbons of aspartate are released as fumarate.

# 3. Synthesis of Guanosine Monophosphate 

GMP is also synthesized from IMP in two steps (Fig. 39.8). In the first step, the hypoxanthine base is oxidized by IMP dehydrogenase to produce the base xanthine and the nucleotide xanthosine monophosphate (XMP). Glutamine then donates the amide nitrogen to XMP to form GMP in a reaction that is catalyzed by GMP synthetase. This second reaction requires energy, in the form of ATP.

NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; $X M P$, xanthosine monophosphate; $A M P$, adenosine monophosphate; $P P$, pyrophosphate; $R S P$, ribose 5-phosphate.

## 4. Phosphorylation of AMP and GMP

AMP and GMP can be phosphorylated to the diphosphate and triphosphate levels. The production of nucleoside diphosphates requires specific nucleoside monophosphate kinases, whereas the production of nucleoside triphosphates requires nucleoside diphosphate kinases, which are active with a wide range of nucleoside diphosphates. The purine nucleoside triphosphates are also used for energy-requiring processes in the cell and also as precursors for RNA synthesis (see Fig. 39.2).

## 5. Regulation of Purine Synthesis

Regulation of purine synthesis occurs at several sites (Fig. 39.9). Four key enzymes are regulated: PRPP synthetase, amidophosphoribosyltransferase, adenylosuccinate synthetase, and IMP dehydrogenase. The first two enzymes regulate IMP synthesis; the last two regulate the production of AMP and GMP, respectively.

A primary site of regulation is the synthesis of PRPP. PRPP synthetase is negatively affected by GDP and, at a distinct allosteric site, by ADP. Thus, the simultaneous binding of an oxypurine (e.g., GDP) and an aminopurine (e.g., ADP) can occur, with the result being a synergistic inhibition of the enzyme. This enzyme is not the committed step of purine biosynthesis; PRPP is also used in pyrimidine synthesis and both the purine and pyrimidine salvage pathways.

The committed step of purine synthesis is the formation of $5^{\prime}$-phosphoribosyl 1 '-amine by glutamine phosphoribosylamidotransferase. This enzyme is strongly
![ma68589491dc](ma68589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 39.9 The regulation of purine synthesis. 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase has two distinct allosteric sites: one for adenosine diphosphate (ADP), the other for guanosine diphosphate (GDP). Glutamine phosphoribosylamidotransferase contains adenine nucleotide- and guanine nucleotide-binding sites; the monophosphates are the most important, although the diphosphates and triphosphates will also bind to and inhibit the enzyme. Adenylosuccinate synthetase is inhibited by adenosine monophosphate (AMP); inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase is inhibited by guanosine monophosphate (GMP). ATP, adenosine triphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; $X M P$, xanthosine monophosphate.

inhibited by GMP and AMP (the end-products of the purine biosynthetic pathway). The enzyme is also inhibited by the corresponding nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates, but under cellular conditions, these compounds probably do not play a central role in regulation. The active enzyme is a monomer of 133,000 Da but is converted to an inactive dimer ( $270,000 \mathrm{Da}$ ) by binding of the end-products. Cellular concentrations of PRPP and glutamine are usually below their $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for glutamine phosphoribosylamidotransferase. Thus, any situation that leads to an increase in their concentration can lead to an increase in de novo purine biosynthesis.

The enzymes that convert IMP to XMP and adenylosuccinate are both regulated. GMP inhibits the activity of IMP dehydrogenase, and AMP inhibits adenylosuccinate synthetase. Note that the synthesis of AMP is dependent on GTP (of which GMP is a precursor), whereas the synthesis of GMP is dependent on ATP (which is made from AMP). This serves as a type of positive regulatory mechanism to balance the pools of these precursors. When the levels of ATP are high, GMP will be made; when the levels of GTP are high, AMP synthesis will take place. GMP and AMP act as negative effectors at these branch points, a classic example of feedback inhibition.

## B. Purine Salvage Pathways

Most of the de novo synthesis of the bases of nucleotides occurs in the liver, and to some extent in the brain, neutrophils, and other cells of the immune system. Within the liver, nucleotides can be converted to nucleosides or free bases, which can be transported to other tissues via the red blood cells in the circulation. In addition, the small amounts of dietary bases or nucleosides that are absorbed also enter cells in this form. Thus, most cells can salvage these bases to generate nucleotides for RNA and DNA synthesis. For certain cell types, such as lymphocytes, the salvage of bases is the major form of nucleotide generation.

The overall picture of salvage is shown in Figure 39.10. The pathways allow free bases, nucleosides, and nucleotides to be easily interconverted. The major enzymes required are purine nucleoside phosphorylase, phosphoribosyltransferases, and deaminases.

Purine nucleoside phosphorylase catalyzes a phosphorolysis reaction of the N -glycosidic bond that attaches the base to the sugar moiety in the nucleosides guanosine and inosine (Fig. 39.11A). Thus, guanosine and inosine are converted to guanine and hypoxanthine, respectively, along with ribose 1-phosphate. The ribose 1-phosphate can be isomerized to ribose 5-phosphate, and the free bases then salvaged or degraded, depending on cellular needs.

The phosphoribosyltransferase enzymes catalyze the addition of a ribose 5-phosphate group from PRPP to a free base, generating a nucleotide and pyrophosphate (see Fig. 39.11B). Two enzymes do this for purine metabolism: APRT and HGPRT. The reactions they catalyze are the same, differing only in their substrate specificity.

Adenosine and AMP can be deaminated by ADA and AMP deaminase, respectively, to form inosine and IMP (see Fig. 39.10). Adenosine is also the only nucleoside to be directly phosphorylated to a nucleotide by adenosine kinase. Guanosine and inosine must be converted to free bases by purine nucleoside phosphorylase before they can be converted to nucleotides by HGPRT.

A portion of the salvage pathway that is important in muscle is the purine nucleotide cycle (Fig. 39.12). The net effect of these reactions is the deamination of aspartate to fumarate (as AMP is synthesized from IMP and then deaminated back to IMP by AMP deaminase). Under conditions in which the muscle must generate energy, the fumarate derived from the purine nucleotide cycle is used anaplerotically to replenish TCA-cycle intermediates and to allow the cycle to operate at high speed. Deficiencies in enzymes of this cycle lead to muscle fatigue during exercise.

0A deficiency in purine nucleoside phosphorylase activity leads to an immune disorder in which T-cell immunity is compromised. B-Cell immunity, conversely, may be only slightly compromised or even normal. Children who lack this activity have recurrent infections, and more than half display neurologic complications. Symptoms of the disorder first appear at between 6 months and 4 years of age. It is an extremely rare autosomal-recessive disorder.

0ADA activity is measured by coupling the deamination of adenosine (to inosine) with purine nucleoside phosphorylase, which will generate hypoxanthine and ribose 1-phosphate from inosine. The hypoxanthine generated then reacts with xanthine oxidase, generating uric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide produced is then measured in the presence of peroxidase and a colorless dye. The oxidation of the colorless dye creates a colored dye, and the intensity of the color (which is directly proportional to the amount of inosine produced) can be determined spectrophotometrically.

0Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by a defective HGPRT (see Fig. 39.11B). In this condition, purine bases cannot be salvaged. Instead, they are degraded, forming excessive amounts of uric acid, leading to gout. Individuals with the severe form of this syndrome suffer from developmental delays and intellectual disabilities. They are also prone to self-injury, including biting and head banging.

The enzyme that catalyzes the reaction is hypo-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT).Adenine forms adenosine monophosphate (AMP) in a reaction that is catalyzed by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT). Nucleotides are converted to nucleosides by 5'-nucleotidase. Free bases are generated from nucleosides by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (although adenosine is not a substrate of this enzyme).

# III. Synthesis of the Pyrimidine Nucleotides 

## A. De Novo Pathways

In the synthesis of the pyrimidine nucleotides, the base is synthesized first, and then it is attached to the ribose $5^{\prime}$-phosphate moiety (Fig. 39.13). The origin of the atoms of the ring (aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate, which is derived from carbon dioxide and glutamine) is shown in Figure 39.14. In the initial reaction of the pathway, glutamine combines with bicarbonate and ATP to form carbamoyl phosphate. This reaction is analogous to the first reaction of the urea cycle, except that it uses glutamine as the source of the nitrogen (rather than ammonia) and it occurs in the cytosol (rather than in mitochondria). The reaction is catalyzed by CPSII, which is the regulated step of the pathway. The analogous reaction in urea synthesis is catalyzed by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI), which is activated by N -acetylglutamate. The similarities and differences between these two carbamoyl phosphate synthetase enzymes are described in Table 39.1.

In the next step of pyrimidine biosynthesis, the entire aspartate molecule adds to carbamoyl phosphate in a reaction that is catalyzed by aspartate transcarbamoylase (Fig. 39.15). The molecule subsequently closes to produce a ring (catalyzed by dihydroorotase), which is oxidized to form orotic acid (or its anion, orotate) through the actions of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of ribose 5-phosphate from PRPP to orotate, producing orotidine $5^{\prime}$-phosphate, which is decarboxylated by orotidylic acid decarboxylase to form UMP (see Fig. 39.15). In mammals, the first three enzymes of the pathway (CPSII, aspartate transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotase) are located on the same polypeptide, designated as CAD. The last two enzymes of the pathway are similarly located on a polypeptide known as UMP synthase (the orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidylic acid decarboxylase activities).

UMP is phosphorylated to uridine triphosphate (UTP). An amino group, derived from the amide of glutamine, is added to carbon 4 to produce CTP by the enzyme CTP synthetase (this reaction cannot occur at the nucleotide monophosphate level). UTP and CTP are precursors for the synthesis of RNA (see Fig. 39.13). The synthesis of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) is described in Section IV.

## B. Salvage of Pyrimidine Bases

Pyrimidine bases are normally salvaged by a two-step route. First, a relatively nonspecific pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase converts the pyrimidine bases to

their respective nucleosides (Fig. 39.16). Notice that the preferred direction for this reaction is the reverse phosphorylase reaction, in which phosphate is released and is not being used as a nucleophile to release the pyrimidine base from the nucleoside. The more specific nucleoside kinases then react with the nucleosides, forming nucleotides (Table 39.2). As with purines, further phosphorylation is carried out by increasingly more specific kinases.

In hereditary orotic aciduria, an extremely rare disorder; orotic acid is excreted in the urine because the enzymes that convert it to UMP; orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine $5^{\prime}$-phosphate decarboxylase, are defective (see Fig. 39.16). Pyrimidines cannot be synthesized and, therefore, normal growth does not occur. Oral administration of uridine is used to treat this condition. Uridine, which is converted to UMP, bypasses the metabolic block and provides the body with a source of pyrimidines because both CTP and dTMP can be produced from UMP.

kinase route for synthesis of pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphates is relatively inefficient for salvage of pyrimidine bases because of the very low concentration of the bases in plasma and tissues.

Pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase can use all of the pyrimidines but has a preference for uracil and is sometimes called uridine phosphorylase. The phosphorylase uses cytosine fairly well but has an extremely low affinity for thymine; therefore, a ribonucleoside containing thymine is almost never made in vivo. A second phosphorylase, thymine phosphorylase, has a much higher affinity for thymine and adds a deoxyribose residue (see Fig. 39.16).

Of the various ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleoside kinases, one that merits special mention is thymidine kinase (TK). This enzyme is allosterically inhibited by dTTP. Activity of TK in a given cell is closely related to the proliferative state of that cell. During the cell cycle, the activity of TK rises dramatically as cells enter S-phase, and in general, rapidly dividing cells have high levels of this enzyme. Radiolabeled thymidine is widely used for isotopic labeling of DNA; for example, in radioautographic investigations or to estimate rates of intracellular DNA synthesis.

## C. Regulation of De Novo Pyrimidine Synthesis

The regulated step of pyrimidine synthesis in humans is CPSII. The enzyme is inhibited by UTP and activated by PRPP (see Fig. 39.13). Thus, as pyrimidines decrease in concentration (as indicated by UTP levels), CPSII is activated and pyrimidines are synthesized. The activity is also regulated by the cell cycle. As cells approach S-phase, CPSII becomes more sensitive to PRPP activation and less sensitive to UTP inhibition. At the end of S-phase, the inhibition by UTP is more pronounced and the activation by PRPP is reduced. These changes in the allosteric properties of CPSII are related to its phosphorylation state. Phosphorylation of the enzyme at a specific site by a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase leads to a more easily activated enzyme. Phosphorylation at a second site by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase leads to a more easily inhibited enzyme.

## IV. The Production of Deoxyribonucleotides

For DNA synthesis to occur, the ribose moiety must be reduced to deoxyribose (Fig. 39.17). This reduction occurs at the diphosphate level and is catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase, which requires the protein thioredoxin. The deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates can be phosphorylated to the triphosphate level and used as precursors for DNA synthesis (see Figs. 39.2 and 39.13).

The regulation of ribonucleotide reductase is quite complex. The enzyme contains two allosteric sites, one controlling the activity of the enzyme and the other controlling the substrate specificity of the enzyme. ATP bound to the activity site activates the enzyme; deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) bound to this site inhibits the enzyme. Substrate specificity is more complex. ATP bound to the substrate specificity site activates the reduction of pyrimidines (CDP and UDP), to form deoxycytidine diphosphate (dCDP) and deoxyuridine diphosphate (dUDP). The dUDP is

| PREFERRED <br> SUBSTRATE | EFFECTOR BOUND TO <br> OVERALL ACTIVITY SITE | EFFECTOR BOUND TO <br> SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITY SITE |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| None | dATP | Any nucleotide |

| ADP | ATP | dGTP |

not used for DNA synthesis; rather, it is used to produce dTMP (see the following text). Once dTMP is produced, it is phosphorylated to dTTP, which then binds to the substrate specificity site and induces the reduction of GDP. As deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) accumulates, it replaces dTTP in the substrate specificity site and allows ADP to be reduced to deoxyadenosine diphosphate (dADP). This leads to the accumulation of dATP, which inhibits the overall activity of the enzyme. These allosteric changes are summarized in Table 39.3.
dUDP can be dephosphorylated to form deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP), or, alternatively, deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) can be deaminated to form dUMP. Methylene-FH 4 transfers a methyl group to dUMP to form dTMP (see Fig. 38.5). Phosphorylation reactions produce dTTP, a precursor for DNA synthesis and a regulator of ribonucleotide reductase.

## V. Degradation of Purine and Pyrimidine Bases

## A. Purine Bases

The degradation of the purine nucleotides (AMP and GMP) occurs mainly in the liver (Fig. 39.18). Salvage enzymes are used for most of these reactions. AMP is first deaminated to produce IMP (AMP deaminase). Then IMP and GMP are dephosphorylated ( $5^{\prime}$-nucleotidase), and the ribose is cleaved from the base by purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Hypoxanthine, the base produced by cleavage of IMP, is converted by xanthine oxidase to xanthine, and guanine is deaminated by the enzyme guanase to produce xanthine. The pathways for the degradation of adenine and guanine merge at this point. Xanthine is converted by xanthine oxidase to uric acid, which is excreted in the urine. Xanthine oxidase is a molybdenum-requiring enzyme that uses molecular oxygen and produces hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$. Another form of xanthine oxidase uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$as the electron acceptor (see Chapter 25).

Note how little energy is derived from the degradation of the purine ring. Thus, it is to the cell's advantage to recycle and salvage the ring, because it costs energy to produce and not much is obtained in return.

## B. Pyrimidine Bases

The pyrimidine nucleotides are dephosphorylated, and the nucleosides are cleaved to produce ribose 1-phosphate and the free pyrimidine bases cytosine, uracil, and thymine. Cytosine is deaminated, forming uracil, which is converted to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, \mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, and $\beta$-alanine. Thymine is converted to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, \mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, and $\beta$-aminoisobutyrate. These products of pyrimidine degradation are excreted in the urine or converted to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$(which forms urea). They do not cause any problems for the body, in contrast to urate, which is produced from the purines and can precipitate, causing gout. As with the purine degradation pathway, little energy can be generated by pyrimidine degradation.

When ornithine transcarbamoylase is deficient (urea-cycle disorder), excess carbamoyl phosphate from the mitochondria leaks into the cytoplasm. The elevated levels of cytoplasmic carbamoyl phosphate lead to pyrimidine production, as the regulated step of the pathway, the reaction catalyzed by carbamoyl synthetase $R$, is being bypassed. Thus, orotic aciduria results.

0Gout is caused by excessive uric acid levels in the blood and tissues. In studies to determine whether a person with gout has developed this problem because of overproduction of purine nucleotides or because of a decreased ability to excrete uric acid, an oral dose of a ${ }^{15} \mathrm{~N}$-labeled amino acid is sometimes used. Which amino acid would be most appropriate to use for this purpose?

0Uric acid has a pK of 5.4. It is ionized in the body to form urate. Urate is not very soluble in an aqueous environment. The concentration of urate in normal human blood is very close to the solubility constant.

The entire glycine molecule is incorporated into the precursor of the purine nucleotides. The nitrogen of this glycine also appears in uric acid, the product of purine degradation. ${ }^{15} \mathrm{~N}$-labeled glycine could be used, therefore, to determine whether purines are being overproduced.

Normally, as cells die, their purine nucleotides are degraded to hypoxanthine and xanthine, which are converted to uric acid by xanthine oxidase (see Fig. 39.18). Allopurinol (a structural analog of hypoxanthine) is a substrate for xanthine oxidase. It is converted to oxypurinol (also called alloxanthine), which remains tightly bound to the enzyme, preventing further catalytic activity (see Fig. 8.15). Thus, allopurinol is a suicide inhibitor. It reduces the production of uric acid and hence its concentration in the blood and tissues (e.g., the synovial lining of the joints in Lotta T.'s great toe). Xanthine and hypoxanthine accumulate, and urate levels decrease. Overall, the amount of purine being degraded is spread over three products rather than appearing in only one. Therefore, none of the compounds exceeds its solubility constant, precipitation does not occur, and the symptoms of gout gradually subside.

FIGURE 39.18 Degradation of the purine bases. The reactions inhibited by allopurinol are indicated. A second form of xanthine oxidase exists that uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$instead of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as the electron acceptor.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

Lotta T. Hyperuricemia in Lotta T.'s case arose as a consequence of overproduction of uric acid. Treatment with allopurinol not only inhibits xanthine oxidase, lowering the formation of uric acid with an increase in the excretion of hypoxanthine and xanthine, but also decreases the overall synthesis of purine nucleotides. Hypoxanthine and xanthine produced by purine degradation are of ten salvaged (i.e., converted to nucleotides) by reactions that require the consumption of PRPP. PRPP is a substrate for the glutamine phosphoribosylamidotransferase reaction that initiates purine biosynthesis. Because the normal cellular levels of PRPP and glutamine are below the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the enzyme, changes in the level of either substrate can accelerate or reduce the rate of the reaction. Therefore, decreased levels of PRPP cause decreased synthesis of purine nucleotides.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency. A deficiency in ADA activity leads to severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). In the severe form of combined immunodeficiency, T-cells (which provide cell-based immunity; see Chapter 42) and B-cells (which produce antibodies) are both deficient, leaving the individual without a functional immune system. Children born with this disorder do not develop a mature thymus gland and suffer from many opportunistic infections because of their lack of a functional immune system. In order to avoid infection, which can be lethal, affected children must avoid exposure to infectious agents. Treatment with hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or gene therapy is recommended. If neither is possible, administration of polyethylene glycol--modified ADA has been successful in treating the disorder. The question that remains, however, is that even though all the cells of the body lack ADA activity, why are the immune cells specifically targeted for destruction?

The specific immune disorder is not caused by any defect in purine salvage pathways because children with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome have a functional immune system, although there are other major problems in those children. This suggests that perhaps the accumulation of precursors to ADA lead to toxic effects. Three hypotheses have been proposed and are outlined below.

In the absence of ADA activity, both adenosine and deoxyadenosine accumulate. When deoxyadenosine accumulates, adenosine kinase can convert it to deoxyadenosine monophosphate. Other kinases then allow dATP to accumulate in the lymphocytes. Why specifically the lymphocytes? The other cells of the body secrete the deoxyadenosine they cannot use, and it accumulates in the circulation. Because the lymphocytes are present in the circulation, they tend to accumulate this compound more so than cells that are not constantly present in the blood. As dATP accumulates, ribonucleotide reductase becomes inhibited, and the cells can no longer produce deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis. Thus, when cells are supposed to grow and differentiate in response to cytokines, they cannot, and they die.

A second hypothesis suggests that the accumulation of deoxyadenosine in lymphocytes leads to an inhibition of $S$-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase, the enzyme that converts SAH to homocysteine and adenosine. This leads to hypomethylation in the cell and to an accumulation of SAH. SAH accumulation has been linked to the triggering of apoptosis.

The third hypothesis suggested is that elevated adenosine levels lead to inappropriate activation of adenosine receptors. Adenosine is also a signaling molecule, and stimulation of the adenosine receptors results in activation of protein kinase A and elevated cAMP levels in thymocytes. Elevated levels of cAMP in these cells trigger both apoptosis and developmental arrest of the cell.

Although it is still not clear which potential mechanism best explains the arrested development of immune cells, it is clear that elevated levels of adenosine and deoxyadenosine are toxic.

Purine and pyrimidine nucleotides can both be synthesized from scratch (de novo) or salvaged from existing bases.
De novo purine synthesis is complex, requiring 11 steps and six molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for every purine synthesized. Purines are initially synthesized in the ribonucleotide form.
The precursors for de novo purine synthesis are glycine, ribose 5-phosphate, glutamine, aspartate, carbon dioxide, and $N^{10}$-formyl-tetrahydrofolate $\left(\mathrm{FH}_{4}\right)$. The initial purine ribonucleotide synthesized is inosine monophosphate (IMP). Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) are each derived from IMP.

Once nucleotide biosynthesis and salvage was understood at the pathway level, it was quickly realized that one way to inhibit cell proliferation would be to block purine or pyrimidine synthesis. Thus, drugs were developed that would interfere with a cell's ability to generate precursors for DNA synthesis, thereby inhibiting cell growth. This is particularly important for cancer cells, which have lost their normal growth-regulatory properties. Such drugs have been introduced previously with several different patients. Clark T. was treated with 5 -fluorouracil, which inhibits thymidylate synthase (dUMP-to-TMP synthesis). Charles F. was treated with a combination of drugs (R-CHOP) for his leukemia. These drugs all interfere with DNA synthesis via a variety of mechanisms. Development of these drugs would not have been possible without an understanding of the biochemistry of both purine and pyrimidine salvage and synthesis and DNA replication. Such drugs also affect rapidly dividing normal cells, which brings about several of the side effects of chemotherapeutic regimens.

Because de novo purine synthesis requires a large amount of energy, purine nucleotide salvage pathways exist such that free purine bases can be converted to nucleotides.
Mutations in purine salvage enzymes are associated with severe diseases, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID).
Pyrimidine bases are initially synthesized as the free base and then converted to nucleotides.
Aspartate and cytoplasmic carbamoyl phosphate are the precursors for pyrimidine ring synthesis.
The initial pyrimidine nucleotide synthesized is orotate monophosphate, which is converted to uridine monophosphate (UMP). The other pyrimidine nucleotides are derived from a uracil-containing intermediate.
Deoxyribonucleotides are derived by reduction of ribonucleotides, as catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase. The regulation of ribonucleotide reductase is complex. Degradation of purine-containing nucleotides results in production of uric acid, which is eliminated in the urine. Elevated uric acid levels in the blood lead to gout. Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 39.4.

D. Purines degrade to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water.
E. An excess of urea leads to gout.
10. Allopurinol is used to treat gout. The drug is a suicide inhibitor that leads to a reduction in the amount of uric acid produced. Instead of accumulating uric acid, which other compound would accumulate in the presence of allopurinol?
A. Hypoxanthine
B. Ribose 1-phosphate
C. IMP
D. Guanine
E. Adenine

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is A. Both CPSI and CPSII use carbon dioxide as the carbon source in the production of carbamoyl phosphate. CPSI is located in the mitochondria, whereas CPSII is in the cytoplasm (thus, B is incorrect). CPSI can fix ammonia; CPSII requires glutamine as the nitrogen source (thus, C is incorrect). N -Acetylglutamate activates CPSI; CSPII is activated by PRPP (thus, D is incorrect). UMP inhibits CPSII but has no effect on CPSI (thus, E is also incorrect).
2. The answer is B. A lack of HGPRT activity (LeschNyhan syndrome) leads to an accumulation of PRPP levels, which induces increased purine synthesis, leading to excessive levels of purines in the cells. The degradation of the extra purines leads to uric acid production and gout.

A loss of either PRPP synthetase activity or glutamine phosphoribosylamidotransferase activity would lead to reduced purine synthesis and hypouricemia (thus, A and D are incorrect). A lack of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase would hinder ribose 5-phosphate production and thus would not lead to excessive purine synthesis. A lack of purine nucleoside phosphorylase would hinder the salvage pathway, leading to an accumulation of nucleosides. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase activity is required to synthesize uric acid, so in the absence of this enzyme, less uric acid would be produced (thus, E is incorrect).
3. The answer is E. The child has Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a deficiency of HGPRT activity. As such, hypoxanthine cannot be converted to IMP, and guanine cannot be converted

to GMP. One consequence of this is elevated uric acid levels, owing to an accumulation of hypoxanthine and guanine. Pyrimidine metabolism is not altered in LeschNyhan patients, so thymine and uracil metabolism is normal. Adenine is converted to AMP by APRT, so a loss of HGPRT activity does not alter adenine metabolism.
4. The answer is B. Allopurinol inhibits the conversion of both hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. This occurs because both of those reactions are catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, the target of allopurinol. Answer A is incorrect because AMP is not converted directly to XMP (AMP, when degraded, is deaminated to form IMP, which loses its phosphate to become inosine, which undergoes phosphorolysis to generate hypoxanthine and ribose 1-phosphate). Answer C is incorrect because the inosine-to-hypoxanthine conversion, catalyzed by nucleoside phosphorylase, is not inhibited by allopurinol. Answer D is incorrect because the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine occurs at the free-base level, not at the nucleotide level. Answer E is incorrect because GMP is converted first to guanosine (loss of phosphate), the guanosine is converted to guanine and ribose 1-phosphate, and the guanine is then converted to xanthine by guanase.
5. The answer is B. If dGTP were to accumulate in cells, the dGTP would bind to the substrate specificity site of ribonucleotide reductase and direct the synthesis of dADP. This would lead to elevations of dATP levels, which would inhibit the activity of ribonucleotide reductase. The inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase leads to a cessation of cell proliferation, as the supply of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis becomes limiting. Answer A is incorrect because ATP would need to bind to the substrate specificity site to direct the synthesis of dCDP. That would not occur under these conditions of elevated dGTP levels. Answer C is incorrect because the enzyme works only on diphosphates; AMP would never be a substrate for this enzyme. Answer D is incorrect because the thioredoxin is always regenerated and does not become rate-limiting for the reductase reaction. Answer E is incorrect because dGTP does not bind to the activity site of the reductase; only ATP (activator) or dATP (inhibitor) is capable of binding to the activity site.
6. The answer is A. A patient with von Gierke's disease is lacking glucose 6-phosphatase activity, and glucose 6-phosphate cannot be converted to free glucose. Under conditions of gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis, in the liver glucose 6-phosphate will accumulate. The high glucose 6-phosphate levels will drive the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt pathway to produce additional ribose 5-phosphate, which will stimulate PRPP synthetase to produce more PRPP. The elevated PRPP leads to increased activity of amidophosphoribosyltransferase, producing more AMP and GMP. As the AMP and

GMP are not required by the cell, they are degraded and produce uric acid, which accumulates, precipitates, and leads to the symptoms of a gout attack. Elevated levels of NADPH may occur owing to an increase in the oxidative steps of the HMP shunt, but this will not lead to an increase in uric acid production. Glucose levels will not increase because of the defect in glucose 6-phosphatase. UDP-glucose levels may increase, but if they do, glycogen synthesis will be stimulated and this will not affect uric acid production. Aspartate levels may increase (owing to increased protein turnover to provide substrates for gluconeogenesis) in patients with von Gierke's disease, but higher aspartate will not lead to uric acid production (because aspartate will not stimulate purine ring synthesis).
7. The answer is B. The regulated step of de novo pyrimidine synthesis is the CPSII step (CPSII uses the amide nitrogen of glutamine, the carbon and oxygen of carbon dioxide, and two high-energy bonds to produce carbamoyl phosphate). UTP will inhibit the activity of this enzyme, signifying high levels of pyrimidines in the cell. A patient with a lack of ornithine transcarbamolyase activity will accumulate carbamoyl phosphate in the mitochondria (as produced by CPSI). As the concentration of carbamoyl phosphate in the mitochondria increases, the molecule will escape from the mitochondria and enter the cytoplasm and be used for de novo pyrimidine synthesis. This is bypassing the regulated step of pyrimidine biosynthesis. It is not an activation of the regulated step or an inhibition of the regulated step of pyrimidine biosynthesis. CAD is not a regulated enzyme and neither is UMP synthase.
8. The answer is D. Aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate (generated from carbon dioxide and glutamine) form all of the components of the pyrimidine ring, whereas aspartate, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, glycine, glutamine, and $N^{\mathrm{III}}$-formyl- $\mathrm{FH}_{4}$ all donate atoms to form the purine base. The direct donor of a carbon and nitrogen to pyrimidine ring biosynthesis is carbamoyl phosphate, not the glutamine and carbon dioxide required to synthesize the carbamoyl phosphate.
9. The answer is C. Purine degradation leads to uric acid formation and does not generate any energy. An excess of uric acid leads to gout (precipitation of the uric acid in joints). Pyrimidines are degraded to water-soluble compounds such as urea, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and water, although not much energy is obtained from pyrimidine degradation as well.
10. The answer is A. Allopurinol is a structural analog of hypoxanthine which reduces production of uric acid (by inhibition of the enzyme xanthine oxidase), allowing xanthine and hypoxanthine to accumulate as uric acid levels decrease. None of the other breakdown products will accumulate in the presence of allopurinol because the end-products are water-soluble and are removed from the body in the urine.

# Intertissue Relationships in the Metabolism of Amino Acids 

The body maintains a relatively large free amino acid pool in the blood, even during fasting. As a result, tissues have continuous access to individual amino acids for the synthesis of proteins and essential amino acid derivatives, such as neurotransmitters. The amino acid pool also provides the liver with amino acid substrates for gluconeogenesis and provides several other cell types with a source of fuel. The free amino acid pool is derived from dietary amino acids and the turnover of proteins in the body. During an overnight fast and during hypercatabolic states, degradation of labile protein, particularly that in skeletal muscle, is the major source of free amino acids.

The liver is the major site of amino acid metabolism in the body and the major site of urea synthesis. The liver is also the major site of amino acid degradation. Hepatocytes partially oxidize most amino acids, converting the carbon skeleton to glucose, ketone bodies, or $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Because ammonia is toxic, the liver converts most of the nitrogen from amino acid degradation to urea, which is excreted in the urine. The nitrogen derived from amino acid catabolism in other tissues is transported to the liver as alanine or glutamine and converted to urea.

The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; valine, isoleucine, and leucine) are oxidized principally in skeletal muscle and other tissues and not in the liver. In skeletal muscle, the carbon skeletons and some of the nitrogen are converted to glutamine, which is released into the blood. The remainder of the nitrogen is incorporated into alanine, which is taken up by the liver and converted to urea and glucose.

The formation and release of glutamine from skeletal muscle and other tissues serves several functions. In the kidney, the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$carried by glutamine is excreted into the urine. This process removes protons formed during fuel oxidation and helps to maintain the body's pH , especially during metabolic acidosis. Glutamine also provides a fuel for the kidney and gut. In rapidly dividing cells (e.g., lymphocytes and macrophages), glutamine is required as a fuel, as a nitrogen donor for biosynthetic reactions, and as a substrate for protein synthesis.

During conditions of sepsis (the presence of various pathogenic organisms, or their toxins, in the blood or tissues), trauma, injury, or burns, the body enters a catabolic state characterized by a negative nitrogen balance (Fig. 40.1). Increased net protein degradation in skeletal muscle increases the availability of glutamine and other amino acids for cell division and protein synthesis in cells involved in the immune response and wound healing. In these conditions, increased release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex stimulates proteolysis.

# THE WAITING ROOM 

(1)Katherine B., a 62-year-old homeless woman, was found by a neighborhood child who heard Katherine's moans coming from an abandoned building. The child's mother called the police, who took Katherine to the hospital emergency department. The patient was semicomatose, incontinent of urine, and her clothes were stained with vomitus. She had a fever of $103^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, was trembling uncontrollably, appeared to be severely dehydrated, and had marked muscle wasting. Her heart rate was very rapid, and her blood pressure was low ( $85 / 46 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ). Her abdomen was distended and without bowel sounds. She responded to moderate pressure on her abdomen with moaning and grimacing.

Blood was sent for a broad laboratory profile, and cultures of her urine and blood were taken. Intravenous saline with thiamine and folate, glucose, and parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics were begun. Radiography performed after her vital signs were stabilized suggested a bowel perforation. These findings were compatible with a diagnosis of a ruptured viscus (e.g., an infected colonic diverticulum that perforated, allowing colonic bacteria to infect the tissues of the peritoneal cavity, causing peritonitis). Further studies confirmed that a diverticulum had ruptured, and appropriate surgery was performed. All of the blood cultures grew out Escherichia coli, indicating that Katherine also had a gram-negative infection of her blood (septicemia) that had been seeded by the proliferating organisms in her peritoneal cavity. Intensive fluid and electrolyte therapy and antibiotic coverage were continued. The medical team (surgeons, internists, and nutritionists) began developing a complex therapeutic plan to reverse Katherine's severely catabolic state.

## I. Maintenance of the Free Amino Acid Pool in Blood

The body maintains a relatively large free amino acid pool in the blood, even in the absence of an intake of dietary protein. The large free amino acid pool ensures the continuous availability of individual amino acids to tissues for the synthesis of proteins, neurotransmitters, and other nitrogen-containing compounds (Fig. 40.2). In a normal, well-fed, healthy individual, approximately 300 to 600 g of body protein is degraded per day. At the same time, roughly 100 g of protein is consumed in the diet per day, which adds additional amino acids. From this pool, tissues use amino acids for the continuous synthesis of new proteins ( 300 to 600 g ) to replace those degraded. The continuous turnover of proteins in the body makes the complete complement of amino acids available for the synthesis of new and different proteins, such as antibodies. Protein turnover allows shifts in the quantities of different proteins produced in tissues in response to changes in physiologic state and continuously removes modified or damaged proteins. It also provides a complete pool of specific amino acids that can be used as oxidizable substrates; precursors for gluconeogenesis and for heme, creatine phosphate, purine, pyrimidine, and neurotransmitter synthesis; for ammoniagenesis to maintain blood pH levels; and for numerous other functions.

The concentration of free amino acids in the blood is not nearly as rigidly controlled as blood glucose levels. The free amino acid pool in the blood is only a small part $(0.5 \%)$ of the total amino acid pool in whole-body protein. Because of the large skeletal muscle mass, approximately $80 \%$ of the body's total protein is in skeletal muscle. Consequently, the concentration of individual amino acids in the blood is strongly affected by the rates of protein synthesis and degradation in skeletal muscle as well as the rate of uptake and use of individual amino acids for metabolism in liver and other tissues. For the most part, changes in the rate of protein synthesis and degradation take place over a span of hours.

FIGURE 40.2 Maintenance of the blood amino acid pool. Dietary protein (1) and degradation of endogenous protein (2) provide a source of essential amino acids (those that cannot be synthesized in the human). (3) The synthesis of new protein is the major use of amino acids from the free amino acid pool. (4) Compounds synthesized from amino acid precursors are essential for physiologic functions. Many of these compounds are degraded to nitrogen-containing urinary metabolites and do not return to the free amino acid pool. (5) In tissues, the nitrogen is removed from amino acids by transamination and deamination reactions. (6) The nitrogen from amino acid degradation appears in the urine primarily as urea or $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, the ammonium ion. Ammonia excretion is necessary to maintain the pH of the blood.

# A. Interorgan Flux of Amino Acids in the Postabsorptive State 

The fasting state provides an example of the interorgan flux of amino acids necessary to maintain the free amino acid pool in the blood and supply tissues with their required amino acids (Fig. 40.3). During an overnight fast, protein synthesis in the liver and other tissues continues but at a diminished rate compared with the postprandial state. Net degradation of labile protein occurs in skeletal muscle (which contains the body's largest protein mass) and other tissues.

## I. Release of Amino Acids from Skeletal Muscle during Fasting

The efflux of amino acids from skeletal muscle supports the essential amino acid pool in the blood (see Fig. 40.3). Skeletal muscle oxidizes the BCAAs (valine, leucine, isoleucine) to produce energy and glutamine. The amino groups of the BCAAs, and of aspartate and glutamate, are transferred out of skeletal muscle in alanine and glutamine. Alanine and glutamine account for approximately $50 \%$ of the total $\alpha$-amino nitrogen released by skeletal muscle.

The release of amino acids from skeletal muscle is stimulated during an overnight fast by the decrease of insulin and increase of glucocorticoid (such as cortisol) levels in the blood (see Chapters 28 and 41). Insulin promotes the uptake of amino acids and the general synthesis of proteins. The mechanisms for the stimulation of protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle are not all known, but they probably include an activation of the A system for amino acid transport (a modest effect), a general effect on initiation of translation, and an inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis. The fall of blood insulin levels during an overnight fast results in net proteolysis and release of amino acids. As glucocorticoid release from the adrenal cortex increases, an induction of ubiquitin synthesis and increase of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis also occur.

![ma79589491dc](ma79589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 40.3 Interorgan amino acid exchange after an overnight fast.After an overnight fast (the postabsorptive state), the use of amino acids for protein synthesis, for fuels, and for the synthesis of essential functional compounds continues. The free amino acid pool is supported largely by net degradation of skeletal muscle protein. Glutamine and alanine serve as amino group carriers from skeletal muscle to other tissues. Glutamine brings $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$to the kidney for the excretion of protons and serves as a fuel for the kidney, gut, and cells of the immune system. Alanine transfers amino groups from skeletal muscle, the kidney, and the gut to the liver, where they are converted to urea for excretion. The brain continues to use amino acids for neurotransmitter synthesis.

$\oplus$
The hormonal changes that occur during an overnight fast include a decrease of blood insulin levels and an increase of glucagon relative to levels after a high-carbohydrate meal. Glucocorticoid levels also increase in the blood. These hormones coordinate the changes of fat, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism. Fatty acids are released from adipose triacylglycerols and are used as the major fuel by heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and other tissues. The liver converts some of the fatty acids to ketone bodies. Liver glycogen stores and gluconeogenesis maintain blood glucose levels for glucose-dependent tissues. The major precursors of gluconeogenesis include amino acids released from skeletal muscle, lactate, and glycerol.

## 2. Amino Acid Metabolism in Liver during Fasting

The major site of alanine uptake is the liver, which disposes of the amino nitrogen by incorporating it into urea (see Fig. 40.3). The liver also extracts free amino acids, $\alpha$-keto acids, and some glutamine from the blood. Alanine and other amino acids are oxidized and their carbon skeletons are converted principally to glucose. Glucagon and glucocorticoids stimulate the uptake of amino acids into liver and increase gluconeogenesis and ureagenesis (Fig. 40.4). Alanine transport into the liver, in particular,

FIGURE 40.4 Hormonal regulation of hepatic amino acid metabolism in the postabsorptive state. Induction of urea cycle enzymes occurs both during fasting and after a high-protein meal. Because many individuals in the United States normally have a high-protein diet, the levels of urea-cycle enzymes may not fluctuate to any great extent. $\oplus$, glucagon-mediated activation of enzymes or proteins; $\bigcirc$, induction of enzyme synthesis mediated by glucagon and glucocorticoids.

is enhanced by glucagon. The induction of the synthesis of gluconeogenic enzymes by glucagon and glucocorticoids during the overnight fast correlates with an induction of many of the enzymes of amino acid degradation (e.g., tyrosine aminotransferase) and an induction of urea-cycle enzymes (see Chapter 36). Urea synthesis also increases because of the increased supply of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$from amino acid degradation in the liver.

## 3. Metabolism of Amino Acids in Other Tissues during Fasting

Glucose, produced by the liver, is used for energy by the brain and other glucosedependent tissues, such as erythrocytes. The muscle, under conditions of exercise, when the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase is active, also oxidizes some of this glucose to pyruvate, which is used for the carbon skeleton of alanine (the glucose-alanine cycle; see Chapter 36).

Glutamine is generated in skeletal muscle from the oxidation of BCAAs and by the lungs and brain for the removal of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$formed from amino acid catabolism or entering from the blood. The kidney, the gut, and cells with rapid turnover rates, such as those of the immune system, are the major sites of glutamine uptake (see Fig. 40.3). Glutamine serves as a fuel for these tissues, as a nitrogen donor for purine synthesis, and as a substrate for ammoniagenesis in the kidney. Much of the unused nitrogen from glutamine is transferred to pyruvate to form alanine in these tissues. Alanine then carries the unused nitrogen back to the liver.

The brain is glucose-dependent but, like many cells in the body, can use BCAAs for energy. The BCAAs also provide a source of nitrogen for neurotransmitter synthesis during fasting. Other amino acids released from skeletal muscle protein degradation also serve as precursors of neurotransmitters.

## B. Principles Governing Amino Acid Flux between Tissues

The pattern of interorgan flux of amino acids is strongly affected by conditions that change the supply of fuels (e.g., the overnight fast, a mixed meal, a high-protein meal) and by conditions that increase the demand for amino acids (metabolic acidosis, surgical stress, traumatic injury, burns, wound healing, and sepsis). The flux of amino acid carbon and nitrogen in these different conditions is dictated by several considerations:

1. Ammonia $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$ is toxic. Consequently, it is transported between tissues as alanine or glutamine. Alanine is the principal carrier of amino acid nitrogen from other tissues back to the liver, where the nitrogen is converted to urea and subsequently excreted into the urine by the kidneys. The amount of urea synthesized is proportional to the amount of aminoacid carbon that is being oxidized as a fuel.

The differences in amino acid metabolism between tissues are dictated by the types and amounts of different enzyme and transport proteins present in each tissue and the ability of each tissue to respond to different regulatory messages (hormones and neural signals).
2. The pool of glutamine in the blood serves several essential metabolic functions (Table 40.1). It provides ammonia for excretion of protons in the urine as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$. It serves as a fuel for the gut, the kidney, and the cells of the immune system. Glutamine is also required by the cells of the immune system and other rapidly dividing cells in which its amide group serves as the source of nitrogen for biosynthetic reactions. In the brain, the formation of glutamine from glutamate and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$provides a means of removing ammonia and of transporting glutamate between different cell types within the brain. The use of the blood glutamine pool is prioritized. During metabolic acidosis, the kidney becomes the predominant site of glutamine uptake at the expense of glutamine use in other tissues. Conversely, during sepsis, in the absence of acidosis, cells involved in the immune response (macrophages, hepatocytes) become the preferential sites of glutamine uptake.
3. The BCAAs (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) form a significant portion of the composition of the average protein and can be converted to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and used as fuels by almost all tissues.

0The body normally produces approximately 1 mmol of protons per kilogram of body weight per day. Nevertheless, the pH of the blood and extracellular fluid is normally maintained between 7.36 and 7.44. The narrow range is maintained principally by the bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$, phosphate $\left(\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{-}\right)$, and hemoglobin buffering systems, and by the excretion of an amount of acid equal to that produced. The excretion of protons by the kidney regenerates bicarbonate, which can be reclaimed from the glomerular filtrate.

The acids are produced from normal fuel metabolism. The major acid is carbonic acid, which is formed from water and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced in the TCA cycle and other oxidative pathways. The oxidation of sulfur-containing amino acids (methionine and cysteine) ultimately produces sulfuric acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)$, which dissociates into $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$, and the protons and sulfate are excreted. The hydrolysis of phosphate esters produces the equivalent of phosphoric acid. What other acids produced during metabolism appear in the blood?

1
Katherine B. was in a severe stage of negative nitrogen balance on admission, which was caused by both her malnourished state and her intraabdominal infection complicated by sepsis. The physiologic response to advanced catabolic status includes a degradation of muscle protein with the release of amino acids into the blood. This release is coupled with an increased uptake of amino acids for acute-phase protein synthesis by the liver (systemic response) and other cells involved in the immune response to general and severe infection.

Lactic acid is produced from glucose and amino acid metabolism. The ketone bodies (acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate) produced during fatty acid oxidation are also acids. Many $\alpha$-keto acids, formed from transamination reactions, are also found in the blood.

Valine and isoleucine are also the major precursors of glutamine. Except for the BCAAs and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate, the catabolism of amino acids occurs principally in the liver.

The ability to convert four-carbon intermediates of the TCA cycle to pyruvate is required for oxidation of both BCAAs and glutamine. This sequence of reactions requires phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase or decarboxylating malate dehydrogenase (malic enzyme). Most tissues have one or both of these enzymes.
4. Amino acids are major gluconeogenic substrates, and most of the energy obtained from their oxidation is derived from oxidation of the glucose formed from their carbon skeletons. A much smaller percentage of amino acid carbon is converted to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) or to ketone bodies and oxidized. The use of amino acids for glucose synthesis for the brain and other glucose-requiring tissues is subject to the hormonal regulatory mechanisms of glucose homeostasis (see Chapters 28 and 34).
5. The relative rates of protein synthesis and degradation (protein turnover) determine the size of the free amino acid pools available for the synthesis of new proteins and for other essential functions. For example, the synthesis of new proteins to mount an immune response is supported by the net degradation of other proteins in the body.

## II. Use of Amino Acids in Individual Tissues

Because tissues differ in their physiologic functions, they have different amino acid requirements and contribute differently to whole-body nitrogen metabolism. However, all tissues share a common requirement for essential amino acids for protein synthesis, and protein turnover is an ongoing process in all cells.

## A. The Kidney

One of the primary roles of amino acid nitrogen is to provide ammonia in the kidney for the excretion of protons in the urine. $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$is released from glutamine by glutaminase and from glutamate by glutamate dehydrogenase, resulting in the formation of $\alpha$-ketoglutarate (Fig. 40.5). $\alpha$-Ketoglutarate is used as a fuel by the kidney and is

oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, converted to glucose for use in cells in the renal medulla, or converted to alanine to return ammonia to the liver for urea synthesis.

The rate of glutamine uptake from the blood and its use by the kidney depends principally on the amount of acid that must be excreted to maintain a normal pH in the blood. In metabolic acidosis, the excretion of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$by the kidney increases severalfold. Because glutamine nitrogen provides approximately two-thirds of the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$excreted by the kidney, glutamine uptake by the kidney also increases. Renal glutamine use for proton excretion takes precedence over the requirements of other tissues for glutamine.

Glutamine is used as a fuel by the kidney in the normal fed state and, to a greater extent, during fasting and metabolic acidosis (Table 40.2). The carbon skeleton forms $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, which is oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, converted to glucose, or released as the carbon skeleton of serine or alanine (Fig. 40.6). $\alpha$-Ketoglutarate can be converted to oxaloacetate by TCA-cycle reactions, and oxaloacetate is converted to PEP by PEP carboxykinase. PEP can then be converted to pyruvate and subsequently to acetyl-CoA, alanine, serine, or glucose. The glucose is used principally by the cells of the renal medulla, which have a relatively high dependence on anaerobic glycolysis because of their lower oxygen supply and mitochondrial capacity. The lactate released from anaerobic glycolysis in these cells is taken up and oxidized in the renal cortical cells, which have a higher mitochondrial capacity and a greater blood supply.
![ma81589491dc](ma81589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 40.6 Metabolism of glutamine and other fuels in the kidney. To completely oxidize glutamate carbon to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, it must enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). Carbon entering the TCA cycle as $\alpha$-ketoglutarate ( $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$ ) exits as oxaloacetate and is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by PEP carboxykinase. PEP is converted to pyruvate, which may be oxidized to acetyl-CoA. PEP also can be converted to serine, glucose, or alanine. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; OAA, oxaloacetate; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; TA, transaminase.

When the carbon skeleton of alanine is derived from glucose, the efflux of alanine from skeletal muscle and its uptake by liver provide no net transfer of amino acid carbon to the liver for gluconeogenesis. However, some of the alanine carbon is derived from sources other than glucose. Which amino acids can provide carbon for alanine formation? (Hint: See Fig. 40.7.)

The purine nucleotide cycle is found in skeletal muscle and brain but is absent in liver and many other tissues. One of its functions in skeletal muscle is to respond to the rapid use of ATP during exercise. During exercise, the rapid hydrolysis of ATP increases AMP levels, resulting in an activation of AMP deaminase (see Fig. 40.9). As a consequence, the cellular concentration of IMP increases and ammonia is generated. IMP, like AMP, activates muscle glycogen phosphorylase during exercise (see Chapter 26). The ammonia that is generated may help to buffer the increased lactic acid production that occurs in skeletal muscles during strenuous exercise.

## B. Skeletal Muscle

Skeletal muscle, because of its large mass, is a major site of protein synthesis and degradation in humans. After a high-protein meal, insulin promotes the uptake of certain amino acids and stimulates net protein synthesis. The insulin stimulation of protein synthesis is dependent on an adequate supply of amino acids to undergo protein synthesis. During fasting and other catabolic states, a net degradation of skeletal muscle protein and release of amino acids occur (see Fig. 40.3). The net degradation of protein affects functional proteins, such as myosin, which are sacrificed to meet more urgent demands for amino acids in other tissues. During sepsis, degradation of skeletal muscle protein is stimulated by the glucocorticoid cortisol. The effect of cortisol is exerted through the activation of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. During fasting, the decrease of blood insulin levels and the increase of blood cortisol levels increase net protein degradation.

Skeletal muscle is a major site of glutamine synthesis, thereby satisfying the demand for glutamine during the postabsorptive state, during metabolic acidosis, and during septic stress and trauma. The carbon skeleton and nitrogen of glutamine are derived principally from the metabolism of BCAAs. Amino acid degradation in skeletal muscle is also accompanied by the formation of alanine, which transfers amino groups from skeletal muscle to the liver in the glucose-alanine cycle.

## I. Oxidation of Branched-Chain Amino Acids in Skeletal Muscle

The BCAAs play a special role in muscle and most other tissues because they are the major amino acids that can be oxidized in tissues other than the liver. However, all tissues can interconvert amino acids and TCA-cycle intermediates through transaminase reactions; that is, alanine $\leftrightarrow$ pyruvate, aspartate $\leftrightarrow$ oxaloacetate, and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate $\leftrightarrow$ glutamate. The first step of the pathway, transamination of the BCAAs to $\alpha$-keto acids, occurs principally in brain, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscles. These tissues have a high content of BCAA transaminase relative to the low levels in liver. The $\alpha$-keto acids of the BCAAs are then either released into the blood and taken up by liver, or oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or glutamine within the muscle or other tissue (Fig. 40.7). They can be oxidized by all tissues that contain mitochondria.

The oxidative pathways of the BCAAs convert the carbon skeleton to either succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) or acetyl-CoA (see Chapter 37 and Fig. 40.7). The pathways generate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD[2H]) for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis before the conversion of carbon into intermediates of the TCA cycle, thus providing the muscle with energy without loss of carbon as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Leucine is "ketogenic" in that it is converted to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate. Skeletal muscle, adipocytes, and most other tissues are able to use these products and, therefore, oxidize leucine directly to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The portion of isoleucine that is converted to acetyl-CoA is also oxidized directly to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. For the portion of valine and isoleucine that enters the TCA cycle as succinyl-CoA to be completely oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, it must first be converted to acetyl-CoA. To form acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA is oxidized to malate in the TCA cycle, and malate is then converted to pyruvate by malic enzyme (malate $+\mathrm{NADP}^{+} \rightarrow$ pyruvate $+\mathrm{NADPH}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$) (see Fig. 40.7). Pyruvate can then be oxidized to acetyl-CoA. Alternatively, pyruvate can form alanine or lactate.

## 2. Conversion of Branched-Chain Amino Acids to Glutamine

The major route of valine and isoleucine catabolism in skeletal muscle is to enter the TCA cycle as succinyl-CoA and exit as $\alpha$-ketoglutarate to provide the carbon skeleton for glutamine formation (see Fig. 40.7). Some of the glutamine and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that is formed from net protein degradation in skeletal muscle may also arise from the carbon skeletons of aspartate and glutamate. These amino acids are transaminated and become part of the pool of four-carbon intermediates of the TCA cycle.

Glutamine nitrogen is derived principally from the BCAAs (Fig. 40.8). The $\alpha$-amino group arises from transamination reactions that form glutamate from $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, and the amide nitrogen is formed from the addition of free ammonia to glutamate by glutamine synthetase. Free ammonia in skeletal muscle

(2) Carbon from valine and isoleucine enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as succinyl coenzymeA (Succinyl CoA) and is converted to pyruvate by decarboxylating malate dehydrogenase (malic enzyme). (3) The oxidative pathways generate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD[2H]) even before the carbon skeleton enters the TCA cycle. The rate-limiting enzyme in the oxidative pathways is the $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. The carbon skeleton also can be converted to glutamate and alanine, shown in red. $\alpha-K G, \alpha$-ketoglutarate; HMG CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A; OAA, oxaloacetate.
![ma83589491dc](ma83589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 40.8 Formation of glutamine from the amino groups of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). The BCAAs are first transaminated with $\alpha$-ketoglutarate to form glutamate and the branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acids. The glutamate nitrogen can then follow either of two paths leading to glutamine formation. $\alpha-K G, \alpha$-ketoglutarate; $O A A$, oxaloacetate; $T A$, transamination.

$\Delta$Some of the alanine released from skeletal muscle is derived directly from protein degradation. The carbon skeletons of valine, isoleucine, aspartate, and glutamate, which are converted to malate and oxaloacetate in the TCA cycle, can be converted to pyruvate and subsequently transaminated to alanine. The extent to which these amino acids contribute carbon to alanine efflux differs between different types of muscles in the human. These amino acids also may contribute to alanine efflux from the gut.

![ma84589491dc](ma84589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 40.9 Purine nucleotide cycle. In skeletal muscle, the purine nucleotide cycle can convert the amino groups of the branchedchain amino acids (BCAAs) to $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, which is incorporated into glutamine. Compare this to Figure 39.12, in which the fumarate generated is used in an anaplerotic role in the muscle. $A D P$, adenosine diphosphate; $A M P$, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; IMP, inosine monophosphate; Pi, inorganic phosphate.

FIGURE 40.10 Glucose-alanine cycle. The pathway for transfer of the amino groups from branched-chain amino acids in skeletal muscle to urea in the liver is shown in red.
arises principally from the deamination of glutamate by glutamate dehydrogenase or from the purine nucleotide cycle.

In the purine nucleotide cycle (Fig. 40.9), the deamination of AMP to inosine monophosphate (IMP) releases $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$. AMP is resynthesized with amino groups provided from aspartate. The aspartate amino groups can arise from the BCAAs through transamination reactions. The fumarate can be used to replenish TCA-cycle intermediates (see Fig. 39.12).

## 3. The Glucose-Alanine Cycle

The nitrogen arising from the oxidation of BCAAs in skeletal muscle can also be transferred back to the liver as alanine in the glucose-alanine cycle (Fig. 40.10; see also Fig. 36.8). The amino group of the BCAAs is first transferred to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate to form glutamate and then transferred to pyruvate to form alanine by sequential transamination reactions. The pyruvate arises principally from glucose via the glycolytic pathway. The alanine released from skeletal muscle is taken up principally by the liver, where the amino group is incorporated into urea, and the carbon skeleton can be converted back to glucose through gluconeogenesis. Although the amount of alanine formed varies with dietary intake and physiologic state, the transport of nitrogen from skeletal muscle to liver as alanine occurs almost continuously throughout our daily fasting-feeding cycle.

## C. The Gut

Amino acids are an important fuel for the intestinal mucosal cells after a proteincontaining meal and in catabolic states such as fasting or surgical trauma (Fig. 40.11). During fasting, glutamine is one of the major amino acids used by the gut. The principal fates of glutamine carbon in the gut are oxidation to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and conversion to the carbon skeletons of lactate, citrulline, and ornithine. The gut also oxidizes BCAAs. Nitrogen derived from amino acid degradation is converted to citrulline, alanine, $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$, and other compounds that are released into the blood and taken up by the liver. Although most of the carbon in this alanine is derived from glucose, the oxidation of glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is not a major fuel pathway for the gut. Fatty acids are also not a significant source of fuel for the intestinal mucosal cells, although they do use ketone bodies.

Even though the liver is the organ that generates urea, the intestine also contains the enzymes for the urea cycle (including carbamoyl synthetase I). However, within the intestine, the $V_{\max }$ values for argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase are very low, suggesting that the primary role of the urea-cycle enzymes in the

![ma86589491dc](ma86589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 40.II Amino acid metabolism in the gut. The pathways of glutamine metabolism in the gut are the same whether it is supplied by the diet (postprandial state) or from the blood (postabsorptive state). Cells of the gut also metabolize aspartate, glutamate, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Glucose is converted principally to the carbon skeleton of alanine. Acetyl CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; $\alpha-K G, \alpha$-ketoglutarate; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; $T A$, transaminase; $T C A$, tricarboxylic acid.
gut is to produce citrulline from the carbons of glutamine (glutamine $\rightarrow$ glutamate $\rightarrow$ glutamate semialdehyde $\rightarrow$ ornithine $\rightarrow$ citrulline). The citrulline is released in the circulation for use by the liver.

After a protein meal, dietary glutamine is a major fuel for the gut, and the products of glutamine metabolism are similar to those seen in the postabsorptive state. The gut also uses dietary aspartate and glutamate, which enter the TCA cycle. Colonocytes (the cells of the colon) also use short-chain fatty acids derived from bacterial action in the lumen.

The importance of the gut in whole-body nitrogen metabolism arises from the high rate of division and death of intestinal mucosal cells and the need to continuously provide these cells with amino acids to sustain the high rates of protein synthesis needed for cellular division. Not only are these cells important for the uptake of nutrients, they maintain a barrier against invading bacteria from the gut lumen and are, therefore, part of our passive defense system. As a result of these important functions, the intestinal mucosal cells are supplied with the amino acids required for protein synthesis and fuel oxidation at the expense of the more expendable skeletal muscle protein. However, glutamine use by the gut is diminished by metabolic acidosis compared with the postabsorptive or postprandial state. During metabolic acidosis, the uptake of glutamine by the kidney is increased and blood glutamine levels decrease. As a consequence, the gut takes up less glutamine.

# D. The Liver 

The liver is the major site of amino acid metabolism. It is the major site of amino acid catabolism and converts most of the carbon in amino acids to intermediates of the TCA cycle or the glycolytic pathway (which can be converted to glucose or oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ), or to acetyl-CoA and ketone bodies. The liver is also the major site for urea synthesis. It can take up both glutamine and alanine and convert the nitrogen to urea for disposal (see Chapter 36). Other pathways in the liver give it an unusually high amino acid requirement. The liver synthesizes plasma proteins, such as serum albumin,

During hyperammonemia, ammonia $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$ can diffuse into the brain from the blood. The ammonia is able to inhibit the neural isozyme of glutaminase, thereby decreasing additional ammonia formation in the brain and inhibiting the formation of glutamate and its subsequent metabolism to GABA. This effect of ammonia might contribute to the lethargy associated with the hyperammonemia found in patients with hepatic disease.
transferrin, and the proteins of the blood-coagulation cascade. It is a major site for the synthesis of nonessential amino acids, the conjugation of xenobiotic compounds with glycine, the synthesis of heme and purine nucleotides, and the synthesis of glutathione.

## E. Brain and Nervous Tissue

## I. The Amino Acid Pool and Neurotransmitter Synthesis

A major function of amino acid metabolism in neural tissue is the synthesis of neurotransmitters. More than 40 compounds are believed to function as neurotransmitters, and all of these contain nitrogen derived from precursor amino acids. They include amino acids, which are themselves neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate, glycine); the catecholamines derived from tyrosine (dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine); serotonin (derived from tryptophan); $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA; derived from glutamate); acetylcholine (derived from choline synthesized in the liver and acetyl-CoA); and many peptides. In general, neurotransmitters are formed in the presynaptic terminals of axons and stored in vesicles until they are released by a transient change in electrochemical potential along the axon. Subsequent catabolism of some of the neurotransmitters results in the formation of a urinary excretion product. The rapid metabolism of neurotransmitters requires the continuous availability of a precursor pool of amino acids for de novo neurotransmitter synthesis (see Chapter 46).

## 2. Metabolism of Glutamine in the Brain

The brain is a net glutamine producer owing principally to the presence of glutamine synthetase in astroglial cells, a supporting cell type of the brain (see Chapter 46). Glutamate and aspartate are synthesized in these cells, using amino groups donated by the BCAAs (principally valine) and TCA-cycle intermediates formed from glucose and from the carbon skeletons of BCAAs (Fig. 40.12). The glutamate is converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase, which incorporates $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$released from deamination of amino acids and deamination of AMP in the purine nucleotide cycle in the brain. This glutamine may efflux from the brain, carrying excess $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$ into the blood, or serve as a precursor of glutamate in neuronal cells.

Glutamine synthesized in the astroglial cells is a precursor of glutamate (an excitatory neurotransmitter) and GABA (an inhibitory neurotransmitter) in the neuronal cells (see Fig. 40.12). It is converted to glutamate by a neuronal glutaminase isozyme. In GABAergic neurons, glutamate is then decarboxylated to GABA, which is released during excitation of the neuron. GABA is one of the neurotransmitters that is recycled; a transaminase converts it to succinaldehyde, which is then oxidized to succinate. Succinate enters the TCA cycle.

FIGURE 40.12 Role of glutamine in the brain. Glutamine serves as a nitrogen transporter in the brain for the synthesis of many different neurotransmitters. Different neurons convert glutamine to $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or to glutamate. Glutamine also transports excess $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$from the brain into the blood. $\alpha-K G, \alpha$-ketoglutarate; $B C A A s$, branchedchain amino acids; $B C K A$, branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acids.

## III. Changes in Amino Acid Metabolism with Dietary and Physiologic State

The rate and pattern of amino acid use by different tissues change with dietary and physiologic state. Two such states, the postprandial period following a high-protein meal and the hypercatabolic state produced by sepsis or surgical trauma, differ from the postabsorptive state with respect to the availability of amino acids and other fuels and the levels of different hormones in the blood. As a result, the pattern of amino acid use is somewhat different.

## A. High-Protein Meal

After the ingestion of a high-protein meal, the gut and the liver use most of the absorbed amino acids (Fig. 40.13). Glutamate and aspartate are used as fuels by the gut, and very little enters the portal vein. The gut also may use some BCAAs. The liver takes up $60 \%$ to $70 \%$ of the amino acids present in the portal vein. These amino acids, for the most part, are converted to glucose in the gluconeogenic pathway.

After a pure protein meal, the increased levels of dietary amino acids reaching the pancreas stimulate the release of glucagon above fasting levels, thereby increasing amino acid uptake into the liver and stimulating gluconeogenesis. Insulin release is also stimulated but not nearly to the levels found after a high-carbohydrate meal. In general, the insulin released after a high-protein meal is sufficiently high that the uptake of BCAAs into skeletal muscle and net protein synthesis is stimulated, but gluconeogenesis in the liver is not inhibited. The higher the carbohydrate content of the meal, the higher is the insulin/glucagon ratio and the greater the shift of amino acids away from gluconeogenesis into biosynthetic pathways in the liver, such as the synthesis of plasma proteins.

Most of the amino acid nitrogen entering the peripheral circulation after a highprotein meal or a mixed meal is present as BCAAs. Because the liver has low levels of transaminases for these amino acids, it cannot oxidize them to a significant extent, and they enter the systemic circulation. The BCAAs are slowly taken up by

![ma88589491dc](ma88589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 40.13 Flux of amino acids after a high-protein meal. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; BCAAs, branched-chain amino acids; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.

![ma89589491dc](ma89589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 40.13 Flux of amino acids after a high-protein meal. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; BCAAs, branched-chain amino acids; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.

Both of these dietary states are characterized by an elevation of glucagon. Glucagon stimulates amino acid transport into the liver, stimulates gluconeogenesis through decreasing levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and induces the synthesis of enzymes in the urea cycle, the gluconeogenic pathway, and the pathways for degradation of some of the amino acids.

The degree of the body's hypercatabolic response depends on the severity and duration of the trauma or stress. After an uncomplicated surgical procedure in an otherwise healthy patient, the net negative nitrogen balance may be limited to about I week. The mild nitrogen losses are usually reversed by dietary protein supplementation as the patient recovers. With more severe traumatic injury or septic stress, the body may catabolize body protein and adipose tissue lipids for a prolonged period, and the negative nitrogen balance may not be corrected for weeks.

Katherine B.'s severe negative nitrogen balance was caused by both her malnourished state and her intraabdominal infection complicated by sepsis. The systemic and diverse responses the body makes to insults such as an acute febrile illness are termed the acute-phase response. An early event in this response is the stimulation of phagocytic activity (see Fig. 40.14). Stimulated macrophages release cytokines, which are regulatory proteins that stimulate the release of cortisol, insulin, and growth hormone. Cytokines also directly mediate the acute-phase response of the liver and skeletal muscle to sepsis.
skeletal muscle and other tissues. These peripheral nonhepatic tissues use the amino acids derived from the diet principally for net protein synthesis.

High-protein, low-carbohydrate diets are based on the premise that ingesting highprotein, low-carbohydrate meals will keep circulating insulin levels low, so that energy storage is not induced, and glucagon release will point the insulin/glucagon ratio to energy mobilization, particularly fatty acid release from the adipocyte and oxidation by the tissues. The lack of energy storage, coupled with the loss of fat, leads to weight loss.

## B. Hypercatabolic States

Surgery, trauma, burns, and septic stress are examples of hypercatabolic states characterized by increased fuel use and a negative nitrogen balance. The mobilization of body protein, fat, and carbohydrate stores serves to maintain normal tissue function in the presence of a limited dietary intake as well as to support the energy and amino acid requirements for the immune response and wound healing. The negative nitrogen balance that occurs in these hypercatabolic states results from accelerated protein turnover and an increased rate of net protein degradation, primarily in skeletal muscle.

The catabolic state of sepsis (acute, generalized, febrile infection) is one of enhanced mobilization of fuels and amino acids to provide the energy and precursors required by cells of the immune system, host defense mechanisms, and wound healing. The amino acids must provide the substrates for new protein synthesis and cell division. Glucose synthesis and release are enhanced to provide fuel for these cells, and the patient may become mildly hyperglycemic.

In these hypercatabolic states, skeletal muscle protein synthesis decreases and protein degradation increases. Oxidation of BCAAs is increased and glutamine production enhanced. Amino acid uptake is diminished. Cortisol is the major hormonal mediator of these responses, although certain cytokines may also have direct effects on skeletal muscle metabolism. As occurs during fasting and metabolic acidosis, increased levels of cortisol stimulate ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, induce the synthesis of glutamine synthetase, and enhance release of amino acids and glutamine from the muscle cells.

The amino acids released from skeletal muscle during periods of hypercatabolic stress are used in a prioritized manner, with the cellular components of the immune system receiving top priority. For example, the uptake of amino acids by the liver for the synthesis of acute-phase proteins, which are part of the immune system, is greatly increased. Conversely, during the early phase of the acute response, the synthesis of other plasma proteins (e.g., albumin) is decreased. The increased availability of amino acids and the increased cortisol levels also stimulate gluconeogenesis, thereby providing fuel for the glucose-dependent cells of the immune system (e.g., lymphocytes). An increase of urea synthesis accompanies the acceleration of amino acid degradation.

The increased efflux of glutamine from skeletal muscle during sepsis serves several functions (see Fig. 40.1). It provides the rapidly dividing cells of the immune system with an energy source. Glutamine is available as a nitrogen donor for purine synthesis, for $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$synthesis (to convert nicotinic acid to nicotinamide), and for other biosynthetic functions that are essential to growth and division of the cells. Increased production of metabolic acids may accompany stress such as sepsis, so there is increased use of glutamine by the kidney.

Under the influence of elevated levels of glucocorticoids, epinephrine, and glucagon, fatty acids are mobilized from adipose tissue to provide alternate fuels for other tissues and spare glucose. Under these conditions, fatty acids are the major energy source for skeletal muscle, and glucose uptake is decreased. These changes may lead to a mild hyperglycemia.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Katherine B. The clinician can determine whether a patient such as Katherine B. is mounting an acute-phase response to some insult, however subtle, by determining whether several unique acute-phase proteins

are being secreted by the liver. One such protein is C-reactive protein, so named because of its ability to interact with the C-polysaccharide of pneumococci. It is presently the most commonly used acute-phase protein used to show signs of an acute-phase response. Another, serum amyloid A protein, a precursor of the amyloid fibril found in secondary amyloidosis, is also elevated in patients undergoing the acute-phase response as compared with healthy individuals, although not used in practice. Other proteins normally found in the blood of healthy individuals are present in increased concentrations in patients undergoing an acute-phase response. These include haptoglobin, certain protease inhibitors, complement components, ceruloplasmin, and fibrinogen. The elevated concentration of these proteins in the blood increases the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), another laboratory measure used to show the presence of an acute-phase response.

To determine the ESR, the patient's blood is placed vertically in a small-bore glass tube. The speed with which the red blood cells sediment toward the bottom of the tube depends on what percentage of the red blood cells clump together and thereby become more dense. The degree of clumping is directly correlated with the presence of one or more of the acute-phase proteins listed previously. These proteins interfere with what is known as the zeta-potential of the red blood cells, which normally prevents the red blood cells from clumping. Because many different proteins can individually alter the zeta-potential, the ESR is a nonspecific test for the presence of acute inflammation.

The weight loss often noted in patients in sepsis is caused primarily by a loss of appetite resulting from the effect of certain cytokines on the medullary appetite center. Other causes include increased energy expenditure caused by fever, and enhanced muscle proteolysis.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Amino Acid Metabolism in Trauma and Sepsis. After a catabolic insult such as injury, trauma, infection, or cancer, the interorgan flow of glutamine and fuels is altered dramatically. Teleologically, the changes in metabolism that occur give first priority to cells that are part of the immune system. Evidence suggests that the changes in glutamine and fuel metabolism are mediated by the insulin counterregulatory hormones, such as cortisol and epinephrine, and several different cytokines (see Chapter 11 for a review of cytokines). Cytokines appear to play a more important role than hormones during sepsis, although they exert their effects, in part, through hormones (Fig. 40.14). Although cytokines can be released from a variety of cells, macrophages are the principal source during trauma and sepsis.

Two cytokines that are important in sepsis are interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). IL-1 and TNF affect amino acid metabolism both through regulation of the release of glucocorticoids and through direct effects on tissues. Although cytokines are generally considered to be paracrine, with their effects being exerted over cells in the immediate vicinity, TNF and IL-1 increase in the blood during sepsis. Other cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), also may be involved.

During sepsis, TNF, IL-1, and possibly other cytokines, bacterial products, or mediators act on the brain to stimulate the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex (a process mediated by adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]), epinephrine from the adrenal medulla, and both insulin and glucagon from the pancreas. Although insulin is elevated during sepsis, the tissues exhibit an insulin resistance that is similar to that of the patient with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, possibly resulting from the elevated levels of the insulin counterregulatory hormones (glucocorticoids, epinephrine, and glucagon). Changes in the rate of acutephase protein synthesis are mediated, at least in part, by effects of TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 on the synthesis of groups of proteins in the liver.

The molecular mechanism whereby sepsis/trauma leads to reduced muscle protein synthesis involves, in part, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin; see

Hypercatabolic states may be accompanied by varying degrees of insulin resistance caused, in part, by the release of counterregulatory hormones into the blood. Thus, patients with diabetes mellitus may require higher levels of exogenous insulin during sepsis.

![ma90589491dc](ma90589491dc.jpg)

FIGURE 40.14 Cytokines and hormones mediate amino acid flux during sepsis. Bacterial products act on macrophages to stimulate the release of cytokines and on the brain to stimulate the sympathoadrenal response. The result is a stimulation of the release of the insulin counterregulatory hormones, epinephrine, glucagon, and glucocorticoids. The glucocorticoid cortisol may be the principal mediator of net muscle protein degradation during sepsis. Hepatic protein synthesis, particularly that of acute-phase proteins, is stimulated by both cortisol and cytokines. Amino acid metabolism in the gut is also probably affected by glucocorticoids and cytokines. Because of the release of the counterregulatory hormones, muscle and other tissues become resistant to insulin action, as indicated by the bar on the figure.

Chapter 34, Fig. 34.9). Sepsis reduces translational efficiency, primarily at the translation initiation step. Initiation is regulated by, and requires, specific eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs; see Chapter 15). eIF4E is a multifactor complex required to assemble the charged initiator transfer $\mathrm{RNA}^{\mathrm{Met}}-40 \mathrm{~S}$ small ribosomal subunit complex onto the capped messenger RNA. The activity of eIF4E is regulated by the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-BP1. When eIF4E is bound to 4E-BP1, translation initiation is reduced. mTOR, when active, will phosphorylate 4E-BP1, causing the binding protein to dissociate from the eIF4E complex, thereby stimulating translation initiation. Sepsis and/or release of TNF- $\alpha$ leads to the inactivation of mTOR and reduced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, resulting in a decrease in translation. The reduced translation, coupled with enhanced protein turnover, allows the muscle to export amino acids for use by other tissues.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- The body maintains a large free amino acid pool in the blood, even during fasting, allowing tissues continuous access to these building blocks.
- Amino acids are used for gluconeogenesis by the liver, as a fuel source for the gut, and as neurotransmitter precursors in the nervous system. They are also required by all organs for protein synthesis.

During an overnight fast, and during hypercatabolic states, degradation of labile protein (primarily from skeletal muscle) is the major source of free amino acids. The liver is the major site for urea synthesis. Nitrogen from other tissues travels to the liver in the form of glutamine and alanine.
Branched-chain amino acids are oxidized primarily in the skeletal muscle.
Glutamine in the blood serves several roles:
The kidney uses the ammonium ion carried by glutamine for excretion in the urine to act as a buffer against acidotic conditions.
The kidney and the gut use glutamine as a fuel source.
All tissues use glutamine for protein synthesis.
The body can enter a catabolic state, characterized by negative nitrogen balance, under the following conditions:

Sepsis (the presence of various pathogenic organisms, or their toxins, in the blood or tissues)
Trauma
Injury
Burns
The negative nitrogen balance results from increased net protein degradation in skeletal muscle, brought about by release of glucocorticoids. The released amino acids are used for protein synthesis and cell division in cells involved in the immune response and wound healing.

## COMMENTS

The body adapts to a catabolic state by degrading proteins to enhance survival. This change in metabolism is initiated through the stress response, as mediated by cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, among other signaling molecules.

Hyperammonemia can result from mutations in urea-cycle enzymes or from a failing liver as caused by a variety of conditions (one of which is alcohol abuse over many years).

A. Approximately $80 \%$ of the body's total protein is in the amino acid pool.
B. Dietary proteins constitute most of the amino acid pool.
C. The concentration of free amino acids is as rigidly controlled as blood glucose levels.
D. The synthesis of new protein is the major use of amino acids in the amino acid pool.
E. Changes in the rate of protein synthesis and degradation occur within seconds to minutes.
10. Which hormone(s) and action(s) are paired correctly regarding protein metabolism/catabolism? Choose the one best answer.
A. Insulin stimulates uptake of amino acids into the liver.
B. Glucocorticoid induces ubiquitin synthesis.
C. Insulin induces ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.
D. Glucocorticoid and insulin induce gluconeogenesis.
E. Glucagon suppresses alanine transport to the liver.
11. The answer is D. Cortisol is released during fasting and times of stress, and signals muscle cells to initiate ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. The other hormones listed do not have this effect on muscle protein metabolism. Insulin stimulates protein synthesis; glucagon has no effect on muscle because muscle has no glucagon receptors. Epinephrine initiates glycogen degradation but not protein degradation, and glucose is not a signaling molecule for muscle as it can be for the pancreas.
12. The answer is D. Glutamine is derived from glutamate, which is formed from $\alpha$-ketoglutarate. Only isoleucine and valine can give rise to glutamine because leucine is strictly ketogenic. These amino acids give rise to succinyl-CoA, which goes around the TCA cycle to

form citrate (after condensing with acetyl-CoA), which then forms isocitrate (the correct answer), and the isocitrate is converted to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate. Urea, pyruvate, PEP, and lactate are not required intermediates in the conversion of BCAA carbons to glutamine carbons.
5. The answer is B. An individual in sepsis will be catabolic; protein degradation exceeds protein intake (leading to negative nitrogen balance; thus, $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and E are incorrect). The liver is synthesizing glucose from amino acid precursors to raise blood glucose levels for the immune cells and the nervous system (thus, gluconeogenesis is active, and E and F must be incorrect). Fatty acid release and oxidation has also been stimulated to provide an energy source for the liver and skeletal muscle (indicating that C, D, and F are incorrect).
6. The answer is A. Elevated levels of ammonia in the nervous system inhibits the production of more ammonia by both glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase. This leads to high glutamine levels and low glutamate levels (because the glutamate has been converted to glutamine owing to the high ammonia levels). The high glutamine leads to an osmotic imbalance across the astrocyte membrane, leading to brain edema (swelling), and also leads to the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. The opening of this pore will lead to cell death. The low glutamate levels also interfere with glutamate acting as a neurotransmitter, as well as the synthesis of GABA, and brain signaling goes awry. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I and ornithine transcarbamoylase are not present in cells of the nervous system. High ammonia promotes the synthesis of glutamine and does not affect transaminase activity.
7. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. The purine nucleotide cycle is found in the brain and skeletal muscle but is absent in the liver and other tissues. It responds to the rapid use of ATP
during exercise, which generates AMP. The AMP is deaminated to form IMP, which then reacts with aspartate (with the release of fumarate) to regenerate AMP. The fumarate can be used anaplerotically to allow the TCA cycle to operate more rapidly.
8. The answer is $\mathbf{F}$. The liver is the major site of amino acid metabolism and degradation, urea synthesis (from the major nitrogen carriers alanine and glutamine released from muscle), and gluconeogenesis from amino acid substrates, but BCAAs are oxidized primarily in skeletal muscle and not in the liver.
9. The answer is D. The major use of the amino acid pool is to produce new proteins. Every day, 300 to 600 g of new proteins are produced, with only about 100 g originating from the diet. The rest are derived from the turnover of existing proteins, the majority of which are found in skeletal muscle ( $\sim 80 \%$ of body's total protein is in skeletal muscle). The concentration of free amino acids is not as tightly controlled as blood glucose levels because changes in protein synthesis and degradation occur over a time span of hours, not minutes. Because the amino acid pool consists of free amino acids, the amino acids within proteins do not count as an amino acid pool.
10. The answer is B. Glucocorticoids induce ubiquitin synthesis and increase ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in order to provide substrates for liver gluconeogenesis. Alanine transport into the liver is particularly enhanced by glucagon (again, to bring in carbons for gluconeogenesis). Glucagon and glucocorticoid stimulate amino acid uptake into the liver, gluconeogenesis, and ureagenesis. Insulin has the opposite effects of glucagon and glucocorticoids, which are considered insulin counterregulatory hormones. Insulin does not stimulate amino acid uptake into the liver (but it does in the muscle).




# Tissue Metabolism 

Although many of the pathways described previously are present in all tissues of the body, many tissues also carry out specialized functions and contain unique biochemical pathways. This section describes several such tissues and, in some cases, how the tissues interact with the rest of the body to coordinate their functions. Previous chapters have focused primarily on insulin and glucagon as the major mediators for regulating metabolic pathways; however, a large number of other hormones also regulate the storage and use of metabolic fuels (see Chapter 41). These hormones primarily counteract the effects of insulin and are called counterregulatory hormones. They include growth hormone; thyroid hormone; glucocorticoids, such as cortisol; small peptides, such as the somatostatins; and small molecules, such as the catecholamines. Growth hormone works, in part, by inducing the synthesis of the insulinlike growth factors. These hormones can exert their effects rapidly (through covalent modification of selected enzymes) or long-term (through alterations in the rate of synthesis of selected enzymes). The interplay of these hormones with insulin and glucagon is discussed, as are the synthesis, secretion, and conditions leading to secretion of each hormone.

The proteins and cells in the blood form their own tissue system (see Chapter 42). All blood cells are derived from a common precursor, the stem cell, in the bone marrow. Different cytokine signals trigger differentiation of a particular blood cell lineage. For example, when oxygen supply to the tissues is decreased, the kidney responds by releasing erythropoietin. This hormone specifically stimulates the production of red blood cells.

Red blood cells have limited metabolic functions, owing to their lack of internal organelles. Their main function is to deliver oxygen to the tissues through the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin. When the number of red blood cells is decreased, that, by definition, represents anemia. This can be attributable to many causes, including nutritional deficiencies or mutations (hereditary anemias). The morphology of the red blood cell can sometimes aid in distinguishing the various types of anemia.

Red blood cell metabolism is geared toward preserving the ability of these cells to transport oxygen, as well as to regulate oxygen binding to hemoglobin. Glycolysis provides energy and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to protect the oxidation state of the heme-bound iron. The hexose monophosphate shunt pathway generates NADPH to protect red blood cell membranes from oxidation. Heme synthesis, which uses succinyl coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) and glycine for all of the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the structure, occurs in the precursors of red blood cells. Inherited defects in heme synthesis lead to a class of diseases known as the porphyrias. Because red blood cells normally pass through the very narrow capillaries, their membranes must be easily deformable. This deformability is, in part, attributable to the complex cytoskeletal structure that surrounds the erythrocyte. Mutations in these structural proteins can lead to less deformable cells, which are more easily lysed as they circulate in the bloodstream. This, in turn, can result in hemolytic anemia.

Among other functions, the hematologic system is responsible for hemostasis as well as for maintaining a constant blood volume (see Chapter 43). A tear in the wall of a vessel can lead to blood loss, which, when extensive, can be fatal. Repairing vessel damage, whether internal or external, is accomplished by a complicated series of zymogen activations of circulating blood proteins resulting in the formation of a fibrin clot (the coagulation cascade). Platelets play a critical role in hemostasis not
