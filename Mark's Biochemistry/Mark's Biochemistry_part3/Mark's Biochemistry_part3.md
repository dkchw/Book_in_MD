# Chemical and Biologic Foundations of Biochemistry 

The discipline of biochemistry developed as chemists began to study the molecules of cells, tissues, and body fluids and physicians began to look for the molecular basis of various diseases. Today, the practice of medicine depends on understanding the roles and interactions of the enormous number of different chemicals that enable our bodies to function. The task is less overwhelming if one knows the properties, nomenclature, and functions of classes of compounds, such as carbohydrates and enzymes. The intent of this section is to review some of this information in a context relevant to medicine. Students enter medical school with different scientific backgrounds, and some of the information in this section will therefore be familiar to many students.

We begin by discussing the relationship of metabolic acids and buffers to blood pH in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 focuses on the nomenclature, structure, and some of the properties of the major classes of compounds found in the human body. The structure of a molecule determines its function and its fate, and the common name of a compound can often tell you something about its structure.

Proteins are linear chains of amino acids that fold into complex threedimensional structures. They function in the maintenance of cellular and tissue structure and the transport and movement of molecules. Some proteins are enzymes, which are catalysts that enormously increase the rate of chemical reactions in the body. Chapters 6 and 7 describe the amino acids and their interactions within proteins that provide proteins with a flexible and functional three-dimensional structure. Chapters 8 and 9 describe the properties, functions, and regulation of enzymes.

Our proteins and other compounds function within a specialized environment defined by their location in cells or body fluids. Their ability to function is partially dependent on membranes that restrict the free movement of molecules. Chapter 10 includes a brief review of the components of cells, their organization into subcellular organelles, and the manner in which various types of molecules move into cells and between compartments within a cell.

In a complex organism such as a human, different cell types carry out different functions. This specialization of function requires cells to communicate with each other. One of the ways they communicate is through secretion of chemical messengers that carry a signal to another cell. In Chapter 11, we consider some of the principles of cell signaling and describe some of the chemical messenger systems.

Both in this book and in medical practice, you will need to interconvert different units used for the weight and size of compounds and for their concentration in blood and other fluids. Table II. 1 provides definitions of some of the units used for these interconversions.

The nomenclature used to describe patients may include the name of a class of compounds. For example, a patient with diabetes mellitus who has hyperglycemia has hyper (h:gh) concentrations of carbohydrates (glyc) in her blood (emia).

(1)From a biochemist's point of view, most metabolic diseases are caused by enzymes and other proteins that malfunction, and the pharmacologic drugs used to treat these diseases correct that malfunction. For example, individuals with atherosclerosis, who have elevated blood cholesterol levels, are treated with a drug that inhibits an enzyme in the pathway for cholesterol synthesis. Even a bacterial infection can be considered a disease of protein function, if one considers the bacterial toxins that are proteins, the enzymes in our cells affected by these toxins, and the proteins involved in the immune response when we try to destroy these bacteria.

(1)Dianne A. had an elevated blood glucose level of $684 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. What is the molar concentration of glucose in Dianne's blood? (Hint: The molecular weight of glucose $\left[\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6}\right]$ is $180 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$.)

Magrams per deciliter ( $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) is the common way clinicians in the United States express blood glucose concentration. A concentration of $684 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ is 684 mg per 100 mL of blood, or $6,480 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$, or $6,48 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$. If $6.84 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ is divided by 180 g/mol, one obtains a value of $0,038 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$, which is 0.038 M , or 38 mM .

# Water, Acids, Bases, and Buffers 

Approximately $60 \%$ of our body is water. It acts as a solvent for the substances we need, such as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, glucose, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and proteins. It is important for the transport of molecules and heat. Many of the compounds produced in the body and dissolved in water contain chemical groups that act as acids or bases, releasing or accepting hydrogen ions. The hydrogen ion content and the amount of body water are controlled to maintain a constant environment for the cells called homeostasis (same state) (Fig. 4.I). Significant deviations from a constant environment, such as acidosis or dehydration, may be life threatening. This chapter describes the role of water in the body and the buffer systems used by the body to protect itself from acids and bases produced from metabolism.

Water. Water is distributed between intracellular and extracellular compartments, the latter comprising interstitial fluids, blood, and lymph. Because water is a dipolar molecule with an uneven distribution of electrons between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms, it forms hydrogen bonds with other polar molecules and acts as a solvent.

The pH of Water. Water dissociates to a slight extent to form hydrogen $\left(\mathbf{H}^{+}\right)$ and hydroxyl $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)$ions. The concentration of hydrogen ions determines the acidity of the solution, which is expressed in terms of $\mathbf{p H}$. The pH of a solution is the negative log of its hydrogen ion concentration.

Acids and Bases. An acid is a substance that can release hydrogen ions (protons), and a base is a substance that can accept hydrogen ions. When dissolved in water, almost all the molecules of a strong acid dissociate and release their hydrogen ions, but only a small percentage of the total molecules of a weak acid dissociate. A weak acid has a characteristic dissociation constant. $K_{\mathrm{a}}$. The relationship between the pH of a solution, the $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of an acid, and the extent of its dissociation are given by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Buffers. A buffer is a mixture of an undissociated acid and its conjugate base (the form of the acid that has lost its proton). It causes a solution to resist changes in pH when either $\mathrm{H}^{+}$or $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$is added. A buffer has its greatest buffering capacity in the pH range near its $\mathbf{p} K_{\mathbf{a}}$ (the negative log of its $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ ). Two factors determine the effectiveness of a buffer: its $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ relative to the pH of the solution and its concentration.

Metabolic Acids and Bases. Normal metabolism generates $\mathbf{C O}_{2}$, metabolic acids (e.g., lactic acid and ketone bodies), and inorganic acids (e.g., sulfuric acid). The major source of acid is $\mathbf{C O}_{2}$, which reacts with water to produce carbonic acid. To maintain the pH of body fluids in a range compatible with life, the body has buffers such as bicarbonate, phosphate, and hemoglobin (see Fig. 4.I). Ultimately, respiratory mechanisms remove carbonic acid through the expiration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and the kidneys excrete acid as ammonium ion $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}\right)$ and other ions.

FIGURE 4.I Maintenance of body pH . The body produces approximately 13 to 22 mol/day of acid from normal metabolism. The body protects itself against this acidity by buffers that maintain a neutral pH and by the expiration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ through the lungs and the excretion of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and other ions through the kidneys.

![ma0250024193](ma0250024193.jpg)

Dianne A. has a ketoacidosis. When the amount of insulin she injects is inadequate, she remains in a condition similar to a fasting state even though she ingests food (see Chapters 2 and 3). Her liver continues to metabolize fatty acids to the ketone bodies acetoacetic acid and $\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid. These compounds are weak acids that dissociate to produce anions (acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, respectively) and hydrogen ions, thereby lowering her blood and cellular pH below the normal range. Because the dissociation of the ketone bodies is causing the acidosis, it is classified as a ketoacidosis.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Dianne (Di) A. is a 26-year-old woman who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus at the age of 12 years. She has an absolute insulin deficiency resulting from autoimmune destruction of the $\beta$-cells of her pancreas. As a result, she depends on daily injections of insulin to prevent severe elevations of glucose and ketone bodies in her blood. When Dianne A. could not be aroused from an afternoon nap, her roommate called an ambulance and Di was brought to the emergency department of the hospital in a coma. Her roommate reported that Di had been feeling nauseated and drowsy and had been vomiting for 24 hours. Di is clinically dehydrated, and her blood pressure is low. Her respirations are deep and rapid and her pulse rate is rapid. Her breath has the "fruity" odor of acetone.

Blood samples are drawn for measurement of her arterial blood pH , arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}\right)$, serum glucose, and serum bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}\right)$. In addition, serum and urine are tested for the presence of ketone bodies, and Di is treated with intravenous normal saline and insulin. The laboratory reports that her blood pH is 7.08 (reference range $=7.36$ to 7.44 ) and that ketone bodies are present in both blood and urine. Her blood glucose level is $648 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range $=80$ to $110 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ after an overnight fast, and no higher than $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in a casual glucose sample taken without regard to the time of a last meal).

Dennis V., age 3 years, was brought to the emergency department by his grandfather, Percy V. While Dennis was visiting his grandfather, he climbed up on a chair and took a half-full 500-tablet bottle of $325-\mathrm{mg}$ aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) tablets from the kitchen counter. Mr. V. discovered Dennis with a mouthful of aspirin, which he removed, but he could not tell how many tablets Dennis had already swallowed. When they arrived at the emergency department, the child appeared bright and alert, but Mr. V. was hyperventilating.

## I. Water

Water is the solvent of life. It bathes our cells, dissolves and transports compounds in the blood, provides a medium for movement of molecules into and throughout cellular compartments, separates charged molecules, dissipates heat, and participates in chemical reactions. Most compounds in the body, including proteins, must interact with an aqueous medium in order to function. In spite of the variation in the amount of water we ingest each day and produce from metabolism, our body maintains a nearly constant amount of water that is approximately $60 \%$ of our body weight (Fig. 4.2).

## A. Fluid Compartments in the Body

Total body water is roughly $50 \%$ to $60 \%$ of body weight in adults and $75 \%$ of body weight in children. Because fat has relatively little water associated with it, obese people tend to have a lower percentage of body water than thin people, women tend to have a lower percentage than men, and older people have a lower percentage than younger people.

Approximately $60 \%$ of the total body water is intracellular and $40 \%$ extracellular (see Fig. 4.2). The extracellular water includes the fluid in plasma (blood after the cells have been removed) and interstitial water (the fluid in the tissue spaces, lying between cells). Transcellular water is a small, specialized portion of extracellular water that includes gastrointestinal secretions, urine, sweat, and fluid that has leaked through capillary walls because of such processes as increased hydrostatic pressure or inflammation.

## B. Hydrogen Bonds in Water

The dipolar nature of the water $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$ molecule allows it to form hydrogen bonds, a property that is responsible for the role of water as a solvent. In $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, the oxygen

atom has two unshared electrons that form an electron-dense cloud around it. This cloud lies above and below the plane formed by the water molecule (Fig. 4.3). In the covalent bond formed between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms, the shared electrons are attracted toward the oxygen atom, thus giving the oxygen atom a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atom a partial positive charge. As a result, the oxygen side of the molecule is much more electronegative than the hydrogen side, and the molecule is dipolar.

Both the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of the water molecule form hydrogen bonds and participate in hydration shells. A hydrogen bond is a weak noncovalent interaction between the hydrogen of one molecule and the more electronegative atom of an acceptor molecule. The oxygen of water can form hydrogen bonds with two other water molecules, so that each water molecule is hydrogen-bonded to approximately four close neighboring water molecules in a fluid three-dimensional lattice (see Fig. 4.3).

## I. Water as a Solvent

Polar organic molecules and inorganic salts can readily dissolve in water because water also forms hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with these molecules. Organic molecules containing a high proportion of electronegative atoms (generally oxygen or nitrogen) are soluble in water because these atoms participate in hydrogen bonding with water molecules (Fig. 4.4A). Chloride ( $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$), bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}\right)$, and other anions are surrounded by a hydration shell of water molecules arranged with their hydrogen atoms closest to the anion. In a similar fashion, the oxygen atom of water molecules interacts with inorganic cations such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$to surround them with a hydration shell (see Fig. 4.4B).

Although hydrogen bonds are strong enough to dissolve polar molecules in water and to separate charges, they are weak enough to allow movement of water and solutes. The strength of the hydrogen bond between two water molecules is only approximately 4 kcal , roughly $1 / 20$ th of the strength of the covalent $\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{H}$ bond in the water molecule. Thus, the extensive water lattice is dynamic and has many strained bonds that are continuously breaking and re-forming. The average hydrogen bond between water molecules lasts only about 10 picoseconds ( 1 picosecond is $10^{-12}$ second), and each water molecule in the hydration shell of an ion stays only 2.4 nanoseconds ( 1 nanosecond $=10^{-9}$ second). As a result, hydrogen bonds between water molecules and polar solutes continuously dissociate and re-form, thereby permitting solutes to move through water and water to pass through channels in cellular membranes.

## 2. Water and Thermal Regulation

The structure of water also allows it to resist temperature change. Its heat of fusion is high, so a large drop in temperature is needed to convert liquid water to the solid state of ice. The thermal conductivity of water is also high, thereby facilitating heat dissipation from high energy-using areas such as the brain into the blood and the total body water pool. Its heat capacity and heat of vaporization are remarkably high; as liquid water is converted to a gas and evaporates from the skin, we feel a cooling effect. Water responds to the input of heat by decreasing the extent of hydrogen bonding and to cooling by increasing the bonding between water molecules.

## C. Electrolytes

Both extracellular fluid (ECF) and intracellular fluid (ICF) contain electrolytes, a general term applied to bicarbonate and inorganic anions and cations. The electrolytes are unevenly distributed between compartments; $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$are the major electrolytes in the ECF (plasma and interstitial fluid), and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and phosphates such as $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$ are the major electrolytes in cells (Table 4.1). This distribution is maintained principally by energy-requiring transporters that pump $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$out of cells in exchange for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(see Chapter 10).

In the emergency department, Dianne A. was rehydrated with intravenous saline, which is a solution of $0.9 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$.
Why was saline used instead of water?

Dianne A. has an osmotic diuresis. Because her blood levels of glucose and ketone bodes are so high, these compounds are passing from the blood into the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys and then into the urine. As a consequence of the high osmolality of the glomerular filtrate, much more water than usual is being excreted in the urine. Thus, Di has polyuria (increased urine volume). As a result of water lost from the blood into the urine, water passes from inside cells into the interstitial space and into the blood, resulting in intracellular dehydration. The dehydrated cells in the brain are unable to carry out their normal functions. As a result, Di is in a coma.

## D. Osmolality and Water Movement

Water distributes between the different fluid compartments according to the concentration of solutes, or osmolality, of each compartment. The osmolality of a fluid is proportional to the total concentration of all dissolved molecules, including ions, organic metabolites, and proteins, and is usually expressed as milliosmoles (mOsm)/kg water. The semipermeable cellular membrane that separates the extracellular and intracellular compartments contains a number of ion channels through which water can move freely, but other molecules cannot. Likewise, water can move freely through the capillaries separating the interstitial fluid and the plasma. As a result, water will move from a compartment with a low concentration of solutes (lower osmolality) to one with a higher concentration to achieve an equal osmolality on both sides of the membrane. The force it would take to keep the same amount of water on both sides of the membrane is called the osmotic pressure.

As water is lost from one fluid compartment, it is replaced with water from another compartment to maintain a nearly constant osmolality. The blood contains a high content of dissolved negatively charged proteins and the electrolytes needed to balance these charges. As water is passed from the blood into the urine to balance the excretion of ions, the blood volume is repleted with water from interstitial fluid. When the osmolality of the blood and interstitial fluid is too high, water moves out of the cells. The loss of cellular water also can occur in hyperglycemia because the high concentration of glucose increases the osmolality of the blood.

## II. Acids and Bases

Acids are compounds that donate a hydrogen ion $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$to a solution, and bases are compounds (such as the $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ion) that accept hydrogen ions. Water itself dissociates to a slight extent, generating $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, which are also called protons, and hydroxide ions $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)$(Fig. 4.5). The hydrogen ions are extensively hydrated in water to form species such as $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$but nevertheless are usually represented as simply $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Water itself is neutral, neither acidic nor basic.

## A. The pH of Water

The extent of dissociation by water molecules into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$is very slight, and the hydrogen ion concentration of pure water is only $0.0000001 \mathrm{M}$, or $10^{-7} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$. The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is usually denoted by the term $p H$, which is the negative $\log _{10}$ of the hydrogen ion concentration expressed in moles per liter (mol/L) (Equation 4.1). Therefore, the pH of pure water is 7 .

$$
\mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]
$$

Equation 4.1. Definition of $\mathbf{p H}$.
The dissociation constant for water, $K_{\mathrm{d}}$, expresses the relationship between the hydrogen ion concentration $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$, the hydroxide ion concentration $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$, and the

concentration of water $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]$ at equilibrium (Equation 4.2). Because water dissociates to such a small extent, $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]$ is essentially constant at 55.5 M . Multiplication of the $K_{\mathrm{d}}$ for water $\left(\sim 1.8 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{M}\right)$ by 55.5 M gives a value of approximately $10^{-14}$ $(\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L})^{2}$, which is called the ion product of water $\left(K_{\mathrm{w}}\right)$ (Equation 4.3). Because $K_{\mathrm{w}}$, the product of $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$and $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$, is always constant, a decrease of $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$must be accompanied by a proportionate increase of $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& K_{\mathrm{d}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]} \\
& K_{\mathrm{w}}=\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=1 \times 10^{-14}
\end{aligned}
$$

Equation 4.2. Dissociation of water.
Equation 4.3. Ion product of water.
A pH of 7 is termed neutral because $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$and $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$are equal. Acidic solutions have a greater hydrogen ion concentration and a lower hydroxide ion concentration than pure water $(\mathrm{pH}<7.0)$, and basic solutions have a lower hydrogen ion concentration and a greater hydroxide ion concentration $(\mathrm{pH}>7.0)$.

## B. Strong and Weak Acids

During metabolism, the body produces a number of acids that increase the hydrogen ion concentration of the blood or other body fluids and tend to lower the pH (Table 4.2). These metabolically important acids can be classified as weak acids or strong acids by their degree of dissociation into a hydrogen ion and a base (the anion component). Inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)$ and hydrochloric acid $(\mathrm{HCl})$ are strong acids that dissociate completely in solution (Fig. 4.6). Organic acids containing carboxylic acid groups (e.g., the ketone bodies acetoacetic acid and $\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid) are weak acids that dissociate to only a limited extent in water. In general, a weak acid (HA), called the conjugate acid, dissociates into a hydrogen ion and an anionic component $\left(\mathrm{A}^{-}\right)$, called the conjugate base. The name of an undissociated acid usually ends in "ic acid" (e.g., acetoacetic acid), and the name of the dissociated anionic component ends in "ate" (e.g., acetoacetate).

The tendency of the acid (HA) to dissociate and donate a hydrogen ion to solution is denoted by its $K_{\mathrm{a}}$, the equilibrium constant for dissociation of a weak acid (Equation 4.4). The higher the $K_{\mathrm{a}}$, the greater is the tendency to dissociate a proton.

For the reaction
Equation 4.4. The $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of an acid.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{HA} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{~A}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \\
& K_{\mathrm{a}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HA}]}
\end{aligned}
$$

A solution of $0.9 \% \mathrm{NaCl} \& 0.9 \mathrm{~g}$ $\mathrm{NaCl} / 100 \mathrm{~mL}$, equivalent to $9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L} . \mathrm{NaCl}$ has a molecular weight of $58 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$, so the concentration of NaCl in isotonic saline is 0.155 M , or 155 mM . If all of the NaCl were dissociated into $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions, the osmolality would be 310 mOsm/kg water. Because NaCl is not completely dissociated and some of the hydration shells surround undissociated NaCl molecules, the osmolality of isotonic saline is approximately $290 \mathrm{mOsm} /$ $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.The osmolality of plasma, interstitial fluids, and ICF is also approximately $290 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$ water, so no large shifts of water or swelling occurs when isotonic saline is given intravenously. In some cases, glucose is added to this at a $5 \%$ concentration ( $5 \mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{~mL}$ ). The glucose provides fuel for the individual. If this is done, the saline solution has the designation of $D S$, for $5 \%$ dextrose.

Dennis V. has ingested an unknown number of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) tablets. Acetylsalicylic acid is rapidly converted to salicylic acid in the body. The initial effect of aspirin is to produce a respiratory alkalosis caused by a stimulation of the "metabolic" central respiratory control center in the medulla. This increases the rate of breathing and the expiration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. This $\&$ followed by a complex metabolic acidosis caused partly by the dissociation of salicylic acid (salicylic acid $\leftrightarrow$ salicylate ${ }^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}=\sim 3.5$ ).
![ma0650024193](ma0650024193.jpg)

Acetylsalicylate

Salicylate also interferes with mitochondrial ATP production (acting as an uncoupler; see Chapter 24), resulting in increased generation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and accumulation of lactate (caused by stimulation of glycolysis; see Chapter 22) and other organic acids in the blood. Subsequently, salicylate may impair renal function, resulting in the accumulation of strong acids of metabolic origin, such as sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid. Usually, children who ingest toxic amounts of aspirin are acidotic by the time they arrive in the emergency department.

FIGURE 4.6 Dissociation of acids. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid that dissociates into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ ions and sulfate. The ketone bodies acetoacetic acid and $\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid are weak acids that partially dissociate into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and their conjugate bases.

In the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the formula for the dissociation constant of a weak acid is converted to a convenient logarithmic equation (Equation 4.5). The term $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ represents the negative $\log$ of $K_{\mathrm{a}}$. If the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ for a weak acid is known, this equation can be used to calculate the ratio of the unprotonated to the protonated form at any pH . From this equation, you can see that a weak acid is $50 \%$ dissociated at a pH equal to its $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$.

For the weak acid HA,

$$
\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HA}]}
$$

Equation 4.5. The HendersonHasselbalch equation.

Most of the metabolic carboxylic acids have a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ between 2 and 5 , depending on the other groups on the molecule (see Table 4.2). The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ reflects the strength of an acid. Acids with a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of 2 are stronger acids than those with a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of 5 because, at any pH , a greater proportion is dissociated.

## III. Buffers

Buffers consist of a weak acid and its conjugate base. Buffers allow a solution to resist changes in pH when hydrogen ions or hydroxide ions are added. In Figure 4.7, the pH of a solution of the weak acid acetic acid is graphed as a function of the amount of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$that has been added. $\mathrm{The} \mathrm{OH}^{-}$is expressed as equivalents of total acetic acid present in the dissociated and undissociated forms. At the midpoint of this curve, 0.5 equivalents of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$have been added and half of the conjugate acid has dissociated, so $\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]$equals $[\mathrm{HA}]$. This midpoint is expressed in the HendersonHasselbalch equation as the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$, defined as the pH at which $50 \%$ dissociation occurs. As you add more $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions and move to the right on the curve, more of the conjugate acid molecules (HA) dissociate to generate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions, which combine with the added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions to form water. Consequently, only a small increase in pH results. If you add hydrogen ions to the buffer at its $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ (moving to the left of the midpoint in Fig. 4.7), conjugate base molecules $\left(\mathrm{A}^{-}\right)$combine with the added hydrogen ions to form HA, and there is almost no fall in pH .

As can be seen from Figure 4.7, a buffer can only compensate for an influx or removal of hydrogen ions within approximately 1 pH unit of its $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$. As the pH of a buffered solution changes from the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ to 1 pH unit below the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$, the ratio of $\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]$to HA changes from 1:1 to 1:10. If more hydrogen ions were added, the

FIGURE 4.7 Titration curve for acetic acid. $H A$, weak acid; $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$, the pH at which $50 \%$ dissociation occurs.
pH would fall rapidly because relatively little conjugate base remains. Likewise, at 1 pH unit above the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of a buffer, relatively little undissociated acid remains. More concentrated buffers are more effective simply because they contain a greater total number of buffer molecules per unit volume that can dissociate or recombine with hydrogen ions.

## IV. Metabolic Acids and Buffers

An average rate of metabolic activity produces roughly $22,000 \mathrm{mEq}$ of acid per day. If all of this acid were dissolved at one time in unbuffered body fluids, their pH would be $<1$. However, the pH of the blood is normally maintained between 7.36 and 7.44 and intracellular pH at approximately 7.1 (between 6.9 and 7.4). The widest range of extracellular pH over which the metabolic functions of the liver, the beating of the heart, and conduction of neural impulses can be maintained is 6.8 to 7.8 . Thus, until the acid produced from metabolism can be excreted as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in expired air and as ions in the urine, it needs to be buffered in the body fluids. The major buffer systems in the body are the bicarbonate-carbonic acid buffer system, which operates principally in ECF; the hemoglobin buffer system in red blood cells; the phosphate buffer system in all types of cells; and the protein buffer system of cells and plasma.

## A. The Bicarbonate Buffer System

The major source of metabolic acid in the body is the gas $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, produced principally from fuel oxidation in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Under normal metabolic conditions, the body generates $>13 \mathrm{~mol}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ per day ( $\sim 0.5$ to 1 kg ). $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissolves in water and reacts with water to produce carbonic acid, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, a reaction that is accelerated by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (Fig. 4.8). Carbonic acid is a weak acid that partially dissociates into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and bicarbonate anion, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$.

Carbonic acid is both the major acid produced by the body and its own buffer. The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of carbonic acid itself is only 3.8 , so at the blood pH of 7.4 , it is almost completely dissociated and theoretically unable to buffer and generate bicarbonate. However, carbonic acid can be replenished from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in body fluids and air because the concentration of dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in body fluids is approximately 400 times greater than that of carbonic acid. As base is added and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is

From inspection, you can tell that her $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is greater than normal, but it is $<10$ times higher. A 10 -fold change in $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$ changes the pH by I unit. For Di, the pH of $7.08=$ $-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$, and therefore her $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is $\mid \times 10^{-0.08}$. To calculate her $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$, express $-7.08$ as $-8+0.92$. The antilog to the base 10 of 0.92 is 8.3 . Thus, her $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$ is $8.3 \times 10^{-8}$ compared to $4.0 \times 10^{-8}$ at pH 7.4 , or slightly more than double the normal value.
![ma0950024193](ma0950024193.jpg)

FIGURE 4.8 The bicarbonate buffer system. $\mathrm{CO}_{2(\mathrm{~d})}$ refers to carbon dioxide dissolved in water and not in the gaseous state.

$\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ in Dianne A.'s arterial blood was 28 mm Hg (reference range $=37$ to 43 mm Hg ) and her serum bicarbonate level was $8 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ (reference range $=24$ to $28 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ ). Elevated levels of ketone bodies had produced a ketoacidosis, and Di was exhaling increased amounts of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by breathing deeply and frequently (Kussmaul breathing) to compensate. Why does this occur? Ketone bodies are weak acids that partially dissociate, increasing $\mathrm{H}^{+}$levels in the blood and the interstitial fluid surrounding the "metabolic" respiratory center in the hypothalamus that controls the rate of breathing. A drop in pH elicits an increase in the rate of breathing. Bicarbonate combines with protons, forming $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, thereby lowering bicarbonate levels. The $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is converted to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, which increase the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration, which is exhaled. The increase in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration leads to an increase in the respiratory rate, causing a fall in the $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$. As shown by Di's low arterial blood pH of 7.08 , the Kussmaul breathing was unable to fully compensate for the high rate of acidic ketone body production.
removed, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions, and dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reacts with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to replenish the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ (see Fig. 4.8). Dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is in equilibrium with the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in air in the alveoli of the lungs, and thus, the availability of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can be increased or decreased by an adjustment in the rate of breathing and the amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ expired. The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ for the bicarbonate buffer system in the body thus combines $K_{\mathrm{h}}$ (the hydration constant for the reaction of water and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ) with the chemical $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ to obtain a modified version of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (Equation 4.6). To use the terms for blood components measured in the emergency department, the dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is expressed as a fraction of $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$. The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ for dissociation of bicarbonate anion $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}\right)$ into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{3}{ }^{2+}\right)$ is 9.8 ; therefore, only trace amounts of carbonate exist in body fluids.

$$
\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]}
$$

Equation 4.6. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the bicarbonate buffer system.

The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}=3.5$, so
$\mathrm{pH}=3.5+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]}$
$\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]$ is best estimated as $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{d}} / 400$, where $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{d}}$ is the concentration of dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, so substituting this value for $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]$ we get
$\mathrm{pH}=3.5+\log 400+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{d}}$
or
$\mathrm{pH}=6.1+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{d}}$
Because only $3 \%$ of the gaseous $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is dissolved, $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{d}}=0.03 \mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$, so
$\mathrm{pH}=6.1+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{0.03 \mathrm{PaCO}_{2}}$
The concentration of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is expressed as milliequivalents per milliliter $(\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{mL})$ and $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ as millimeters of mercury ( mm Hg ).

## B. Bicarbonate and Hemoglobin in Red Blood Cells

The bicarbonate buffer system and hemoglobin in red blood cells cooperate in buffering the blood and transporting $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to the lungs. Most of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced from tissue metabolism in the TCA cycle diffuses into the interstitial fluid and the blood plasma and then into red blood cells (Fig. 4.9, circle 1). Although no carbonic anhydrase can be found in blood plasma or interstitial fluid, the red blood cells contain high amounts of this enzyme, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is rapidly converted to carbonic acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)$ within these cells (Fig. 4.9, circle 2). As the carbonic acid dissociates (Fig. 4.9, circle 3), the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$released is also buffered by combination with hemoglobin (Hb; Fig. 4.9, circle 4). The side chain of the amino acid histidine in hemoglobin has a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of 6.7 and is thus able to accept a proton. The bicarbonate anion is transported out of the red blood cells into the blood in exchange for chloride anions, and thus, bicarbonate is relatively high in the plasma (Fig. 4.9, circle 5) (see Table 4.1).

As the red blood cells approach the lungs, the direction of the equilibrium reverses. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is released from the red blood cells, causing more carbonic acid to dissociate into $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water and more hydrogen ions to combine with bicarbonate. Hemoglobin loses some it of its hydrogen ions, a feature that allows it to bind oxygen more readily (see Chapter 7). Thus, the bicarbonate buffer system is intimately linked to the delivery of oxygen to tissues.

![ma1050024193](ma1050024193.jpg)

FIGURE 4.9 Buffering systems of the body. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced from cellular metabolism is converted to bicarbonate and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the red blood cells. Within the red blood cells, the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is buffered by hemoglobin ( Hb ) and phosphate $\left(\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{2-}\right)$ (circles 4 and 6 ). The bicarbonate is transported into the blood to buffer $\mathrm{H}^{+}$generated by the production of other metabolic acids such as the ketone body acetoacetic acid (circle 5). Other proteins (Pr) also serve as intracellular buffers. Numbers refer to the text discussion. TCA, tricarboxylic acid.

Bicarbonate and carbonic acid, which diffuse through the capillary wall from the blood into interstitial fluid, provide a major buffer for both plasma and interstitial fluid. However, blood differs from interstitial fluid in that the blood contains a high content of extracellular proteins, such as albumin, which contribute to its buffering capacity through amino acid side chains that are able to accept and release protons. The protein content of interstitial fluid is too low to serve as an effective buffer.

## C. Intracellular pH

Phosphate anions and proteins are the major buffers involved in maintaining a constant pH of ICF. The inorganic phosphate anion $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{-}$dissociates to generate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and the conjugate base $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$ with a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of 7.2 (see Fig. 4.9, circle 6). Thus, phosphate anions play a major role as an intracellular buffer in the red blood cell and in other types of cells, where their concentration is much higher than in blood and interstitial fluid (see Table 4.1, extracellular fluid). Organic phosphate anions, such as glucose-6-phosphate and ATP, also act as buffers. ICF contains a high content of proteins that contain histidine and other amino acids that can accept protons in a fashion similar to hemoglobin (see Fig. 4.9, circle 7).

The transport of hydrogen ions out of the cell is also important for maintenance of a constant intracellular pH . Metabolism produces a number of other acids in addition to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. For example, the metabolic acids acetoacetic acid and $\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid are produced from fatty acid oxidation to ketone bodies in the liver, and lactic acid is produced by glycolysis in muscle and other tissues. The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ for most metabolic carboxylic acids is $<5$, so these acids are completely dissociated at the pH of blood and cellular fluid. Metabolic anions are transported out of the cell together with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(see Fig. 4.9, circle 8). If the cell becomes too acidic, more $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is transported out in exchange for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions by a different transporter. If the cell becomes too alkaline, more bicarbonate is transported out in exchange for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions.

## D. Urinary Hydrogen, Ammonium, and Phosphate Ions

The nonvolatile acid that is produced from body metabolism cannot be excreted as expired $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and is excreted in the urine. Most nonvolatile acid hydrogen ion is excreted as undissociated acid that generally buffers the urinary pH between 5.5 and 7.0. A pH of 5.0 is the minimum urinary pH . The acid secretion includes inorganic acids such as phosphate and ammonium ions, as well as uric acid, dicarboxylic acids, and TCAs such as citric acid (see Table 4.2). One of the major sources of nonvolatile acid in the body is sulfuric acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)$. Sulfuric acid is generated from the sulfate-containing compounds ingested in foods and from metabolism of

Both Dianne A. and Percy V. were hyperventilating when they arrived at the emergency department: Ms. A. in response to her primary metabolic acidosis and $\mathrm{Mr} \mathrm{V}$. in response to anxiety. Hyperventilation raised blood pH in both cases: In Ms. A.'s case, it partially countered the acidosis, and in Mr. V.'s case, it produced a respiratory alkalosis (abnormally high arterial blood pH ).

Ammonium ions are acids that dissociate to form the conjugate base $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ and hydrogen ions. What is the form present in blood? In urine?

Diabetes mellitus is diagnosed by the concentration of plasma glucose (plasma is blood from which the red blood cells have been removed by centrifugation). Because plasma glucose normally increases after a meal, the normal reference ranges and the diagnostic level are defined relative to the time of consumption of food or to consumption of a specified amount of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. After an overnight fast, values for the fasting plasma glucose $<100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ are considered normal, a level $>126 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ defines diabetes mellitus. Fasting plasma glucose values $\geq 100$ and $<126 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ define an intermediate condition termed impoired fasting glucose or prediabetes. Normal random plasma glucose levels (random is defined as any time of day without regard to the time since a last meal) should not be $>200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Normal subjects generally do not increase their blood sugar $>140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, even after a meal. Thus, a 2-hour postprandial (after a meal or after an oral glucose load) plasma glucose level between 140 and $199 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ defines a condition known as impoired glucose tolerance, or prediabetes, where a level $>200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ defines overt diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is also diagnosed by measuring the hemoglobin $\mathrm{A}_{1 C}\left(\mathrm{HbA}_{1 C}\right)$ value, which is a measure of glycosylated hemoglobin in the red blood cells. This is a nonenzymatic reaction that is dependent upon glucose concentration; thus, as the glucose concentration increases, the levels of $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 C}$ increase. Normal levels of $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 C}$ are $4 \%$ to $6 \%$ of total hemoglobin, and a value of $>6.5 \% \mathrm{HbA}_{1 C}$ defines diabetes mellitus.
the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine. It is a strong acid that is dissociated into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and sulfate anion $\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{-}\right)$in the blood and urine (see Fig. 4.6). Urinary excretion of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$helps to remove acid. To maintain metabolic homeostasis, we must excrete the same amount of phosphate in the urine that we ingest with food as phosphate anions or organic phosphates such as phospholipids. Whether the phosphate is present in the urine as $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$or $\mathrm{HPO} 4^{-}$depends on the urinary pH and the pH of the blood.

Ammonium ions are major contributors to buffering urinary pH but not blood pH . Ammonia $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$ is a base that combines with protons to produce ammonium $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}\right)$ions $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}\right)$, a reaction that occurs with a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of $9.25 . \mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is produced from amino acid catabolism or absorbed through the intestine and is kept at very low concentrations in the blood because it is toxic to neural tissues. Cells in the kidney generate $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$and excrete it into the urine in proportion to the acidity (proton concentration) of the blood. As the renal tubular cells transport $\mathrm{H}^{+}$into the urine, they return bicarbonate anions to the blood.

## E. Hydrochloric Acid

HCl , also called gastric acid, is secreted by parietal cells of the stomach into the stomach lumen, where the strong acidity denatures ingested proteins so they can be degraded by digestive enzymes. When the stomach contents are released into the lumen of the small intestine, gastric acid is neutralized by bicarbonate secreted from pancreatic cells and by cells in the intestinal lining.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Dianne A. Dianne A. has type 1 diabetes mellitus. Because the $\beta$-cells of her pancreas have a very limited ability to synthesize and secrete insulin, she maintains her insulin level by giving herself several subcutaneous (under the skin) injections of insulin every day. If her blood insulin levels fall too low, she remains in a condition similar to a fasting state even though she ingests food (see Chapters 2 and 3). Free fatty acids leave her adipocytes (fat cells) and are converted by the liver to the ketone bodies acetoacetic acid and $\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid. These compounds are weak acids that dissociate to produce anions (acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, respectively) and hydrogen ions, thereby lowering her blood and cellular pH below the normal range. As these acids accumulate in the blood, a metabolic acidosis known as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) develops.

Once DKA develops, until insulin is administered to reverse this trend, several compensatory mechanisms operate to minimize the extent of the acidosis. One of these mechanisms is a stimulation of the respiratory center in the hypothalamus induced by the acidosis, which leads to deeper and more frequent respiration (Kussmaul breathing). $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is expired more rapidly than normal, and the blood pH rises toward normal. The results of the laboratory studies performed on Dianne A. in the emergency department were consistent with a moderately severe DKA. Her arterial blood pH and serum bicarbonate were low, and ketone bodies were present in her blood and urine (normally, ketone bodies are not present in the urine). In addition, her serum glucose level was $648 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range $=80$ to $110 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ fasting and no higher than $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in a random glucose sample). Her hyperglycemia, which induces an osmotic diuresis, contributed to her dehydration and the hyperosmolality of her body fluids.

Treatment was initiated with intravenous saline solutions to replace fluids lost with the osmotic diuresis and hyperventilation. The osmotic diuresis resulted from increased urinary water volume required to dilute the large amounts of glucose and ketone bodies excreted in the urine. Hyperventilation increased the water of respiration lost with expired air. A loading dose of regular insulin was given as an intravenous bolus followed by an insulin drip, giving her continuous insulin. The patient's metabolic response to the treatment was monitored closely.

Dennis V. Dennis remained alert in the emergency department. While awaiting the report of his initial serum salicylate level, his stomach was lavaged, and several white tablets were found in the stomach aspirate. He was examined repeatedly and showed none of the early symptoms of salicylate toxicity, such as respiratory stimulation, upper abdominal distress, nausea, or headache.

His serum salicylate level was reported as $92 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$ (usual level in an adult on a therapeutic dosage of 4 to $5 \mathrm{~g} /$ day is 120 to $350 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$, and a level of $800 \mu \mathrm{~g} /$ mL is considered potentially lethal). He was admitted for overnight observation and continued to do well. A serum salicylate level the following morning was $24 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$. He was discharged later that day.

Percy V. At the emergency department, Mr. V. complained of light-headedness and "pins and needles" (paresthesias) in his hands and around his lips. These symptoms resulted from an increase in respiratory drive mediated in this case through the "behavioral" rather than the "metabolic" central respiratory control system (as seen in Dianne A. when she was in DKA). The behavioral system was activated in Mr. V.'s case by his anxiety over his grandson's potential poisoning. His alveolar hyperventilation caused Mr. V.'s $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ to decrease below the normal range of 37 to 43 mm Hg . The alkalemia caused his neurologic symptoms. After being reassured that his grandson would be fine, Mr. V. was asked to breathe slowly into a small paper bag placed around his nose and mouth, allowing him to reinhale the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ being exhaled through hyperventilation. Within 20 minutes, his symptoms disappeared.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

Body Water and Dehydration. Dehydration, or loss of water, occurs when salt and water intake is less than the combined rates of renal plus extrarenal volume loss (Fig. 4.10). In a true hypovolemic state, total body water, functional ECF volume, and ICF volume are decreased. One of the causes of hypovolemia is an intake of water that is inadequate to resupply the daily excretion volume (maintenance of fluid homeostasis). The amount of water lost by the kidneys is determined by the amount of water necessary to dilute the ions, acids, and other solutes excreted. Both urinary solute excretion and water loss in expired air, which amount to almost $400 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day, occur during fasting as well as during periods of normal food intake. Thus, people who are lost in the desert or shipwrecked continue to lose water in air and urine, in addition to their water loss through the skin and sweat glands. Comatose patients and patients who are debilitated and unable to swallow also continue to lose water and become dehydrated. Anorexia (loss of appetite), such as Percy V, experienced during his depression (see Chapters 1 and 3), can result in dehydration because food intake is normally a source of fluid. Cerebral injuries that cause a loss of thirst response also can lead to dehydration.

Dehydration also can occur secondary to excessive water loss through the kidneys, lungs, and skin. Excessive renal loss could be the result of impaired kidney function or impaired response to the hormones that regulate water balance (e.g., antidiuretic hormone [ADH] and aldosterone). However, in individuals who have normal kidney function, such as Dianne A., dehydration can occur as a response to water dilution of the high concentrations of ketone bodies, glucose, and other solutes excreted in the urine (osmotic diuresis). If the urinary water loss is associated with an acidosis, hyperventilation occurs, increasing the amount of water lost in expired air. Water loss in expired air (pulmonary water loss) could occur also as a result of a tracheotomy or cerebral injury. An excessive loss of water and electrolytes through the skin can result from extensive burns.

Gastrointestinal water losses also can result in dehydration. We secrete approximately 8 to 10 L of fluid per day into our intestinal lumen. Normally, $>90 \%$ of this fluid is reabsorbed in the intestines. The percentage reabsorbed can be decreased by vomiting, diarrhea, tube drainage of gastric contents, or loss of water into tissues around the gut via bowel fistulas.

The $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ for dissociation of ammonium ions is 9.25. Thus, the undissociated conjugate acid form $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$predominates at the physiologic pH of 7.4 and urinary pH of 5.5 to $70 . \mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is an unusual conjugate base because it is not an anion.

FIGURE 4.10 Body fluid homeostasis (constant body water balance). Intake is influenced by availability of fluids and food, thirst, hunger, and the ability to swallow. The rates of breathing and evaporation and urinary volume influence water loss. The body adjusts the volume of urinary excretion to compensate for variations in other types of water loss and for variations in intake. The hormones aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) help to monitor blood volume and osmolality through mechanisms that regulate thirst as well as sodium and water balance.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Approximately $60 \%$ of our body weight is water.
- Water is distributed between intracellular and extracellular (interstitial fluids, blood, lymph) compartments.
- Because water is a dipolar molecule with an uneven distribution of electrons between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms, it forms hydrogen bonds with other polar molecules and acts as a solvent.
- Many of the compounds produced in the body and dissolved in water contain chemical groups that act as acids or bases, releasing or accepting hydrogen ions.
- The hydrogen ion content and the amount of body water are controlled to maintain homeostasis, a constant environment for our cells.
- The pH of a solution is the negative log of its hydrogen ion concentration.
- Acids release hydrogen ions; bases accept hydrogen ions.
- Strong acids dissociate completely in water, whereas only a small percentage of the total molecules of a weak acid dissociate.
- The dissociation constant of a weak acid is designated as $K_{\mathrm{d}}$.
- The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation defines the relationship between the pH of a solution, the $K_{\mathrm{d}}$ of the acid, and the extent of acid dissociation.
- A buffer, a mixture of an undissociated acid and its conjugate base, resists changes in pH when either $\mathrm{H}^{+}$or $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$is added.
- Buffers work best within a range of 1 pH unit either above or below the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{d}}$ of the buffer, where the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{d}}$ is the negative $\log$ of the $K_{\mathrm{d}}$.
- Normal metabolism generates metabolic acids (lactate, ketone bodies), inorganic acids (sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid), and carbon dioxide.
- Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which will dissociate to form bicarbonate and a proton.
- Physiologic buffers include bicarbonate, phosphate, and the protein hemoglobin.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are described in Table 4.3.

B. The total amount of carbonic anhydrase in blood plasma is increased in anemia.
C. The total amount of carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells is decreased in anemia.

E. The total amount of carbonic anhydrase in interstitial fluid is decreased.
F. The total amount of carbonic anhydrase in interstitial fluid is increased.

1. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The pH is the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration, $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$. Thus, at a pH of 7.5 , $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is $10^{-7.5}$, and at pH 6.5 , it is $10^{-6.5}$. The $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$has changed by a factor of $10^{-6.5} / 10^{-7.5}$, which is $10^{1}$, or 10 . Any decrease of 1 pH unit is a 10 -fold increase of $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$, or a 10 -fold decrease of $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$. A shift in the concentration of buffer anions has definitely occurred, but the change in pH reflects the increase in hydrogen ion concentration in excess of that absorbed by buffers. A drop of 1 pH unit in a metabolic acidosis is a very severe condition.
2. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. In order to solve this problem, one first needs to calculate the concentration of the conjugate base and acid of the buffer at pH 7.4 . Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, one can calculate that the concentration of the conjugate base is 0.061 M and that of the acid is 0.039 M . At this point, the reaction occurs, generating 0.01 M protons ( $10 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{mL}$ is a concentration of 10 mM , or 0.01 M ). As the protons are generated, they will combine with the conjugate base, producing the acid. This will change the concentration of conjugate base to 0.051 M and the concentration of the acid to 0.049 M . Plugging those values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation leads to a pH value of 7.22. Recall that if the concentration of the conjugate base equaled the concentration of the acid, the pH would be the $\mathrm{p} K$ value (in this case, 7.2). Because protons are being generated, the pH will drop, not rise, so answer A cannot be correct.
3. The answer is $\mathbf{B} . \mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is a weak base that associates with a proton to produce the ammonium ion $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}+\right.$ $\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$), which has a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of 9.5 . Thus, at pH 7.4 , most of the $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ will be present as ammonium ion. The absorption of hydrogen ions will tend to increase, not decrease, the pH of the blood (thus, A is incorrect). With the decrease of hydrogen ions, carbonic acid will dissociate to produce more bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}\right.$ $+\mathrm{H}^{+}$), and more $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ will go toward carbonic acid (thus, C is incorrect). Kussmaul respiration, an increased expiration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, occurs under an acidosis, the opposite condition.
4. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Vomiting expels the strong acid gastric acid $(\mathrm{HCl})$. As cells in the stomach secrete more HCl , they draw on $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions in interstitial fluid and blood, thereby tending to increase blood pH and cause an alkalosis. The other conditions tend to produce an acidosis (thus, A, B, D, and E are incorrect). Lactic acid is a weak acid secreted into the blood by muscles during exercise. A patient with increased ketone body production can exhibit a fall of pH because the ketone bodies acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate are dissociated acids. As bicarbonate in the intestinal lumen is lost in the watery diarrhea, more bicarbonate is secreted by intestinal cells. As intestinal cells produce bicarbonate, more
$\mathrm{H}^{+}$is also generated $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$. While the bicarbonate produced by these cells is released into the intestinal lumen, the protons accumulate in blood, resulting in an acidosis. Hypercatabolism (see E), an increased rate of catabolism, generates additional $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which produces more acid $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightarrow\right.$ $\left.\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$.
5. The answer is B. Methylmalonic acid contains two carboxylic acid groups and is, therefore, a weak acid. According to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the carboxylic acid groups are $50 \%$ dissociated at their $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ (thus, C is incorrect). Carboxylic acid groups usually have a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ between 2 and 5 , so this acid would be nearly fully dissociated at a blood pH of 7.4 and cannot buffer intracellularly at neutral pH (thus, D and E are incorrect). (Although you do not need to know anything about methylmalonate to answer this question, methylmalonate is an organic acid generated in patients with a problem in metabolism of methylmalonyl coenzyme A, such as a deficiency in vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. Its acidity may contribute to the development of symptoms involving the nervous system. Its appearance in the urine can be classified as an organic aciduria.)
6. The answer is A. Water has high thermal conductivity and is the main transporter of molecules and heat in the body. It is a dipolar molecule $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$. It has a neutral pH with the same amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions so it is neither a weak acid nor a weak base. Water is neither a protein nor a carbohydrate, although water can transport both proteins and carbohydrates.
7. The answer is B. Electrolyte is a general term applied to bicarbonate and inorganic anions and cations. Water is not an electrolyte. The major extracellular electrolytes are $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$. The major intracellular electrolytes are $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and inorganic phosphate.
8. The answer is B. A buffer has its greatest buffering capacity in the pH ranges near its $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$. Normal blood pH is 7.4. The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of dihydrogen phosphate $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{-}\right)$is 6.80 . The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of carbonic acid is 3.80 . The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of ammonium ion $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}\right)$is 9.25 , whereas that of acetoacetic acid (a ketone body) is 3.62 . Acetic acid has a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of 4.76 . The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of dihydrogen phosphate is thus the closest to normal blood $\mathrm{pH}(7.4)$ and of the buffers listed would exhibit the greatest buffering ability at that pH . This is because of the other acids and ammonium ion exhibiting a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}>1 \mathrm{pH}$ unit from normal blood and thereby containing relatively little undissociated acid or conjugate base, at that pH , to be an effective buffer.
9. The answer is B. Because of the high concentration of ketone bodies (acid) in the blood, the patient would have a lower blood pH and a metabolic acidosis. To help compensate for this acidosis, the respiratory rate would increase to "blow off $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$." The decrease of blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ would increase the formation of carbonic

acid from bicarbonate and a proton, thereby reducing the proton concentration and raising the blood pH . Decreasing respiration would do the opposite and actually increase the proton concentration to further decrease pH and worsen the acidosis. A patient with DKA has abnormally high blood glucose and ketone body levels, which greatly increase blood osmolality; this leads to water leaving the tissues and entering the blood to help balance the increased osmolality, which results in intracellular dehydration. The kidney normally would decrease urine output in dehydration, but the high osmolality of the glomerular filtrate increases the water content of the filtrate in order to
dilute these ions. This movement of water increases urine output, leading to the patient becoming even more dehydrated.
10. The answer is C. Carbonic anhydrase is not normally found in blood plasma or interstitial fluid, but the red blood cells contain high amounts of this enzyme, which helps to rapidly convert $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to carbonic acid within the red blood cells. In a person with severe anemia, the number of red blood cells is greatly decreased so that the total amount of carbonic anhydrase available would be decreased and the bicarbonate buffer system, as well as the hemoglobin buffer system, would be less effective than in someone who was not anemic.

## Structures of the Major Compounds of the Body

The body contains compounds of great structural diversity, ranging from relatively simple sugars and amino acids to enormously complex polymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. Many of these compounds have common structural features related to their names, their solubility in water, the pathways in which they participate, or their physiologic function. Thus, learning the terminology used to describe individual compounds and classes of compounds can greatly facilitate learning biochemistry.

In this chapter, we describe the major classes of carbohydrates and lipids and some of the classes of nitrogen-containing compounds. The structures of amino acids, proteins, the nucleic acids, and vitamins are covered in more detail in subsequent chapters.

Functional Groups on Molecules. Organic molecules are composed principally of carbon and hydrogen. However, their unique characteristics are related to structures termed functional groups, which involve oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur.

Carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, commonly known as sugars, can be classified by their carbonyl group (aldo- or ketosugars), the number of carbons they contain (e.g., pentoses, hexoses), or the positions of the hydroxyl groups on their asymmetric carbon atoms (D- or L-sugars, stereoisomers, or epimers). They also can be categorized according to their substituents (e.g., amino sugars) or the number of monosaccharides (such as glucose) joined through glycosidic bonds (disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides). Glycoproteins and proteoglycans have sugars attached to their protein components.

Lipids. Lipids are a group of structurally diverse compounds defined by their hydrophobicity; they are not very soluble in water. The major lipids of the human body are the fatty acids, which are esterified to glycerol to form triacylglycerols (triglycerides) or phosphoacylglycerols (phosphoglycerides). In the sphingolipids, a fatty acid is attached to sphingosine, which is derived from the amino acid serine and another fatty acid. Glycolipids contain lipids attached to a sugar hydroxyl group. Specific polyunsaturated fatty acids are precursors of eicosanoids. The lipid cholesterol is a component of membranes and the precursor of other compounds that contain the steroid nucleus, such as the bile salts and steroid hormones. Cholesterol is one of the compounds synthesized from a five-carbon precursor called the isoprene unit.

Nitrogen-Containing Compounds. Nitrogen in amino groups or heterocyclic ring structures often carries a positive charge at neutral pH. Amino acids contain a carboxyl group, an amino group, and one or more additional carbons. Purines, pyrimidines, and pyridines have heterocyclic nitrogencontaining ring structures. Nucleosides comprise one of these ring structures attached to a sugar. The addition of a phosphate to a nucleoside produces a nucleotide.

## THE WAITING ROOM

Dianne A. recovered from her bout of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and was discharged from the hospital (see Chapter 4). She has returned for a follow-up visit as an outpatient. She reports that she has been compliant with her recommended diet and that she faithfully gives herself insulin by subcutaneous injection several times daily. She self-monitors her blood glucose levels at least four times a day and reports the results to her physician.

Lotta T. is a 54-year-old woman who came to her physician's office complaining of a severe throbbing pain in the right great toe that began 8 hours earlier. The toe has suffered no trauma but appears red and swollen. It is warmer than the surrounding tissue and is exquisitely tender to even light pressure. Ms. T. is unable to voluntarily flex or extend the joints of the digit, and passive motion of the joints causes great pain.

## I. Functional Groups on Biologic Compounds

## A. Biologic Compounds

The organic molecules of the body consist principally of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus joined by covalent bonds. The key element is carbon, which forms four covalent bonds with other atoms. Carbon atoms are joined through double or single bonds to form the carbon backbone for structures of varying size and complexity (Fig. 5.1). Groups containing one, two, three, four, and five carbons plus hydrogen are referred to as methyl, ethyl, propionyl, butyl, and pentanyl groups, respectively. If the carbon chain is branched, the prefix "iso-" is used. If the compound contains a double bond, "ene" is sometimes incorporated into the name. Carbon structures that are straight or branched with single or double bonds, but do not contain a ring, are called aliphatic.

Carbon-containing rings are found in several biologic compounds. One of the most common is the six-membered carbon-containing benzene ring, sometimes called a phenyl group (see Fig. 5.1B). This ring has three double bonds, but the electrons are shared equally by all six carbons and delocalized in planes above and below the ring. Compounds containing the benzene ring, or a similar ring structure with benzene-like properties, are called aromatic.

## B. Functional Groups

Biochemical molecules are defined both by their carbon skeleton and by structures called functional groups that usually involve bonds between carbon and oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, carbon and sulfur, or carbon and phosphate groups (Fig. 5.2). In carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, the electrons are shared equally between atoms, and the bonds are nonpolar and relatively unreactive. In carbon-oxygen and carbon-nitrogen bonds, the electrons are shared unequally, and the bonds are polar and more reactive. Thus, the properties of the functional groups usually determine the types of reactions that occur and the physiologic role of the molecule.

Functional group names are often incorporated into the common name of a compound. For example, a ketone might have a name that ends in "-one," such as acetone, and the name of a compound that contains a hydroxyl (alcohol or OH group) might end in "-ol" (e.g., ethanol). The acyl group is the portion of the molecule that provides the carbonyl $(-\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O})$ group in an ester or amide linkage. It is denoted in a name by an "-yl" ending. For example, the fat stores of the body are triacylglycerols. Three acyl (fatty acid) groups are esterified to glycerol, a compound that contains three alcohol groups. In the remainder of this chapter, the portions of names of compounds that refer to a class of compounds or a structural feature are shown in bold type.

Dianne A. had a metabolic acidosis resulting from increased hepatic production of ketone bodies. Her initial workup included screening tests for ketone bodies in her urine that employed a paper strip containing nitroprusside, a compound that reacts with keto groups. Her blood glucose was measured with an enzymatic assay that is specific for the sugar D-glucose and will not react with other sugars.

The ketone bodies synthesized in the liver are $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. A third ketone body, acetone, is formed by the nonenzymatic decarboxylation of acetoacetate (see Figure 3.3). Acetone is volatile and accounts for the sweet mousy odor in the breath of patients such as Dianne A. when they have a ketoacidosis. What functional groups are present in each of these ketone bodies?

![ma1550024193](ma1550024193.jpg)

FIGURE 5.2 Major types of functional groups found in biochemical compounds of the human body.

$\beta$-Hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate are carboxylates (dissociated carboxylic acids). Acetoacetate and acetone contain ketonketone groups. Because $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate contains an alcohol (hydroxyl) group and not a keto group, the general name of ketone bodies for these compounds is really a misnomer.

fundging from the structures of the ketone bodies shown in Figure 3.3, which compound is more oxidized, $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate! Which is more reduced!

## I. Oxidized and Reduced Groups

The carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen groups are described as "oxidized" or "reduced" according to the number of electrons around the carbon atom. Oxidation is the loss of electrons and results in the loss of hydrogen atoms together with one or two electrons, or the gain of an oxygen atom or hydroxyl group. Reduction is the gain of electrons and results in the gain of hydrogen atoms or loss of an oxygen atom. Thus, the carbon becomes progressively more oxidized (and less reduced) as we go from an alcohol to an aldehyde or a ketone to a carboxyl group (see Fig. 5.2). Carbon-carbon double bonds are more oxidized (and less reduced) than carboncarbon single bonds.

## 2. Groups that Carry a Charge

Acidic groups contain a proton that can dissociate, usually leaving the remainder of the molecule as an anion with a negative charge (see Chapter 4). In biomolecules, the major anionic substituents are carboxylate groups, phosphate groups, or sulfate groups (the "-ate" suffix denotes a negative charge) (Fig. 5.3). Phosphate groups attached to metabolites are often abbreviated as P with a circle around it, or just as "P," as in glucose 6-P.

Compounds that contain nitrogen are usually basic and can acquire a positive charge (Fig. 5.4). Nitrogen has five electrons in its valence shell. If only three of these electrons form covalent bonds with other atoms, the nitrogen has no charge. If the remaining two electrons form a bond with a hydrogen ion or a carbon atom, the nitrogen carries a positive charge. Amines consist of nitrogen attached through single bonds to hydrogen atoms and to one or more carbon atoms. Primary amines, such as dopamine, have one carbon-nitrogen bond. These amines are weak acids with a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ value of approximately 9 , so that at pH 7.4 they carry a positive charge. Secondary, tertiary, and quaternary amines have two, three, and four nitrogen-carbon bonds, respectively (see Fig. 5.4).

## C. Polarity of Bonds and Partial Charges

Polar bonds are covalent bonds in which the electron cloud is more dense around one atom (the atom with the greater electronegativity) than the other. Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, and a carbon-oxygen bond is therefore polar, with the oxygen atom carrying a partial negative charge and the carbon atom carrying a partial positive charge (Fig. 5.5). In nonpolar carbon-carbon bonds and carbon-hydrogen bonds, the two electrons in the covalent bond are shared almost equally. Nitrogen, when it has only three covalent bonds, also carries a partial negative charge relative to carbon, and the carbon-nitrogen bond is polarized. Sulfur can carry a slight partial negative charge.

## I. Solubility

Water is a dipolar molecule in which the oxygen atom carries a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atoms carry partial positive charges (see Chapter 4). For molecules to be soluble in water, they must contain charged or polar groups that can associate with the partial positive and negative charges of water. Thus, the solubility of organic molecules in water is determined by both the proportion of polar to nonpolar groups attached to the carbon-hydrogen skeleton and to their relative positions in the molecule. Polar groups or molecules are called hydrophilic (water-loving), and nonpolar groups or molecules are hydrophobic (wa-ter-fearing). Sugars such as glucose 6-phosphate, for example, contain so many polar groups (many hydroxyl and one phosphate) that they are very hydrophilic and almost infinitely water-soluble (Fig. 5.6). The water molecules interacting with a polar or ionic compound form a hydration shell around the compound, which includes hydrogen bonds and/or ionic interactions between water and the compound.

Compounds that have large nonpolar regions are relatively water-insoluble. They tend to cluster together in an aqueous environment and form weak associations through van der Waals interactions and hydrophobic interactions. Hydrophobic compounds are essentially pushed together (the hydrophobic effect) as the water molecules maximize the number of energetically favorable hydrogen bonds they can form with each other in the water lattice. Thus, lipids form droplets or separate layers in an aqueous environment (e.g., vegetable oils in a salad dressing).

## 2. Reactivity

Another consequence of bond polarity is that atoms that carry a partial (or full) negative charge are attracted to atoms that carry a partial (or full) positive charge and vice versa. These partial or full charges dictate the course of biochemical reactions, which follow the same principles of electrophilic and nucleophilic attack that are characteristic of organic reactions in general. The partial positive charge on the carboxyl carbon attracts more negatively charged groups and accounts for many of the reactions of carboxylic acids. An ester is formed when a carboxylic acid and an alcohol combine, releasing water (Fig. 5.7). Similarly, a thioester is formed when an acid combines with a sulfhydryl group, and an amide is formed when an acid combines with an amine. Similar reactions result in the formation of a phosphoester from phosphoric acid and an alcohol and in the formation of an anhydride from two acids.

## D. Nomenclature

Biochemists use two systems for the identification of the carbons in a chain. In the first system, the carbons in a compound are numbered, starting with the carbon in the most oxidized group (e.g., the carboxyl group). In the second system, the carbons are given Greek letters, starting with the carbon next to the most oxidized group. Hence, the compound shown in Figure 5.8 is known as 3-hydroxybutyrate or $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate.

Compound A contains three alcohol groups and is called glyceraldehyde.

Acetoacetate is more oxidized than $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate. The carbon in the keto group contains one less hydrogen than the carbon to which the -OH group is attached. It has lost an electron.

## II. Carbohydrates

## A. Monosaccharides

Simple monosaccharides consist of a linear chain of three or more carbon atoms, one of which forms a carbonyl group through a double bond with oxygen (Fig. 5.9). The other carbons of an unmodified monosaccharide contain hydroxyl groups, resulting in the general formula for an unmodified sugar of $\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 \mathrm{~s}} \mathrm{O}_{n}$. The suffix "-ose" is used in the names of sugars. If the carbonyl group is an aldehyde, the sugar is an aldose; if the carbonyl group is a ketone, the sugar is a ketose. Monosaccharides are also classified according to their number of carbons: Sugars containing three, four, five, six, and seven carbons are called trioses, tetroses, pentoses, hexoses, and heptoses, respectively. Fructose is therefore a ketohexose (see Fig. 5.9), and glucose is an aldohexose (see Fig. 5.6).

## I. D- and L-Sugars

A carbon atom that contains four different chemical groups forms an asymmetric (or chiral) center (Fig. 5.10A). The groups attached to the asymmetric carbon atom can be arranged to form two different isomers that are mirror images of each other and not superimposable. Monosaccharide stereoisomers are designated D or L based on whether the position of the hydroxyl group farthest from the carbonyl carbon

matches D- or L-glyceraldehyde (see Fig. 5.10B). Such mirror image compounds are known as enantiomers. Although a more sophisticated system of nomenclature using the designations $(\mathrm{R})$ and $(\mathrm{S})$ is generally used to describe the positions of groups on complex molecules such as drugs, the D and L designations are still used in medicine for describing sugars and amino acids. Because glucose (the major sugar in human blood) and most other sugars in human tissues belong to the D series, sugars are assumed to be D unless L is specifically added to the name.

## 2. Stereoisomers and Epimers

Stereoisomers have the same chemical formula but differ in the position of the hydroxyl group on one or more of their asymmetric carbons (Fig. 5.11). A sugar with n asymmetric centers has $2^{\mathrm{n}}$ stereoisomers unless it has a plane of symmetry. Epimers are stereoisomers that differ in the position of the hydroxyl group at only one of their asymmetric carbons. D-Glucose and D-galactose are epimers of each other, differing only at position 4, and can be interconverted in human cells by enzymes called epimerases. D-Mannose and D-glucose are also epimers of each other, differing only at position 2.

## 3. Ring Structures

Monosaccharides exist in solution mainly as ring structures in which the carbonyl (aldehyde or ketone) group has reacted with a hydroxyl group in the same molecule to form a five- or six-membered ring (Fig. 5.12). The oxygen that was on the hydroxyl group is now part of the ring, and the original carbonyl carbon, which now contains an -OH group, has become the anomeric carbon atom. A hydroxyl group on the anomeric carbon drawn down below the ring is in the $\alpha$-position; drawn up above the ring, it is in the $\beta$ position. In the actual three-dimensional structure, the ring is not planar but usually takes a "chair" conformation in which the hydroxyl groups are located at a maximal distance from each other.

In solution, the hydroxyl group on the anomeric carbon spontaneously (nonenzymatically) changes from the $\alpha$ to the $\beta$ position through a process called $m u$ tarotation. When the ring opens, the straight-chain aldehyde or ketone is formed. When the ring closes, the hydroxyl group may be in either the $\alpha$ or the $\beta$ position (Fig. 5.13). This process occurs more rapidly in the presence of cellular enzymes called mutarotases. However, if the anomeric carbon forms a bond with another molecule, that bond is fixed in the $\alpha$ or $\beta$ position and the sugar cannot mutarotate. Enzymes are specific for $\alpha$ or $\beta$-bonds between sugars and other molecules and react with only one type.

## 4. Substituted Sugars

Sugars frequently contain phosphate groups, amino groups, sulfate groups, or Nacetyl groups. Most of the free monosaccharides within cells are phosphorylated

FIGURE 5.11 Examples of stereoisomers. These compounds have the same chemical formula $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6}\right)$ but differ in the positions of the hydroxyl groups on their asymmetric carbons (in red).

FIGURE 5.10 A. D- and L-Glyceraldehyde. The carbon in the center contains four different substituent groups arranged around it in a tetrahedron. A different arrangement creates an isomer that is a nonsuperimposable mirror image. If you rotate the mirror image structure so that groups 1 and 2 align, group 3 will be in the position of group 4, and group 4 will be in position 3. B. D-Glyceraldehyde and D-glucose. These sugars have the same configuration at the asymmetric carbon atom farthest from the carbonyl group. Both belong to the D series. Asymmetric carbons are shown in red.

Are D-mannose and D-galactose stereoisomers? Are they epimers of each other? (See Fig. 5.11.)

The stereospecificity of D-glucose is still frequently denoted in medicine by the use of its old name, dextrose. A solution used for intravenous infusions in patients is a $5 \%$ $(5 \mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{~mL})$ solution of dextrose.

They are stereoisomers but not epimers of each other. They have the same chemical formula but differ in the position of two hydroxyl groups.

at their terminal carbons, which prevents their transport out of the cell (see glucose 6-phosphate in Fig. 5.6). Amino sugars such as galactosamine and glucosamine contain an amino group instead of a hydroxyl group on one of the carbon atoms, usually carbon 2 (Fig. 5.14). Frequently, this amino group has been acetylated to form an N -acetylated sugar. In complex molecules termed proteoglycans, many of the N -acetylated sugars also contain negatively charged sulfate groups attached to a hydroxyl group on the sugar.

# 5. Oxidized and Reduced Sugars 

Sugars can be oxidized at the aldehyde carbon to form an acid. Technically, the compound is no longer a sugar, and the ending on its name is changed from "-ose" to "-onic acid" or "-onate" (e.g., gluconic acid, Fig. 5.15). If the carbon containing the terminal hydroxyl group is oxidized, the sugar is called a uronic acid (e.g., glucuronic acid).

If the aldehyde of a sugar is reduced, all of the carbon atoms contain alcohol (hydroxyl) groups, and the sugar is a polyol (e.g., sorbitol) (see Fig. 5.15). If one of the hydroxyl groups of a sugar is reduced so that the carbon contains only hydrogen, the sugar is a deoxysugar, such as the deoxyribose in DNA.

N-acetyl- $\beta$-D-glucosamine
FIGURE 5.14 An N -acetylated amino sugar. The " N -" denotes the amino group to which the acetyl group is attached, shown in the shaded box.

Proteoglycans contain many long unbranched polysaccharide chains attached to a core protein. The polysaccharide chains, called glycosaminoglycans, are composed of repeating disaccharide units containing oxidized acid sugars (such as glucuronic acid), sulfated sugars, and N -acetylated amino sugars. The large number of negative charges causes the glycosaminoglycan chains to radiate out from the protein so that the overall structure resembles a bottle brush. The proteoglycans are essential parts of the extracellular matrix, the aqueous humor of the eye, secretions of mucusproducing cells, and cartilage and are described in further detail in Chapter 47.

## B. Glycosides

## I. N- and O-Glycosidic Bonds

The hydroxyl group on the anomeric carbon of a monosaccharide can react with an -OH or an -NH group of another compound to form a glycosidic bond. The linkage may be either $\alpha$ or $\beta$, depending on the position of the atom attached to the anomeric carbon of the sugar. N -Glycosidic bonds are found in nucleosides and nucleotides. For example, in the adenosine moiety of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the nitrogenous base adenine is linked to the sugar ribose through a $\beta-N$-glycosidic bond (Fig. 5.16). In contrast, $O$-glycosidic bonds, such as those found in lactose, join sugars to each other or attach sugars to the hydroxyl group of an amino acid on a protein.

## 2. Disaccharides, Oligosaccharides, and Polysaccharides

A disaccharide contains two monosaccharides joined by an $O$-glycosidic bond. Lactose, which is the sugar in milk, consists of galactose and glucose linked through a $\beta(1 \rightarrow 4)$ bond formed between the $\beta-\mathrm{OH}$ group of the anomeric carbon of galactose and the hydroxyl group on carbon 4 of glucose (see Fig. 5.16). Oligosaccharides contain from 3 to roughly 12 monosaccharides linked together. They are often found attached through $N$ - or $O$-glycosidic bonds to proteins to form glycoproteins (see Chapter 6). Polysaccharides contain tens to thousands of monosaccharides joined by glycosidic bonds to form linear chains or branched structures. Amylopectin (a form of starch) and glycogen (the storage form of glucose in human cells) are branched polymers of glucosyl residues linked through $\alpha(1 \rightarrow 4)$ and $\alpha(1 \rightarrow 6)$ bonds.

## III. Lipids

## A. Fatty Acids

Fatty acids are usually straight aliphatic chains with a methyl group at one end (called the $\omega$-carbon) and a carboxyl group at the other end (Fig. 5.17A). Most fatty acids in the human have an even number of carbon atoms, usually between 16 and 20. Saturated fatty acids have single bonds between the carbons in the chain, and unsaturated fatty acids contain one or more double bonds. The most common saturated fatty acids present in the cell are palmitic acid (C16) and stearic acid (C18). Although these two fatty acids are generally called by their common names, shorter fatty acids are often called by the Latin word for the number of carbons, such as octanoic acid ( 8 carbons) and decanoic acid ( 10 carbons).

The melting point of a fatty acid increases with chain length and decreases with the degree of unsaturation. Thus, fatty acids with many double bonds, such as those in vegetable oils, are liquid at room temperature; and saturated fatty acids, such as those in butterfat, are solids. Lipids with lower melting points are more fluid at body temperature and contribute to the fluidity of our cellular membranes.

Monounsaturated fatty acids contain one double bond, and polyunsaturated fatty acids contain two or more double bonds (see Fig. 5.17). The position of a double bond is designated by the number of the carbon in the double bond that is closest to the carboxyl group. For example, oleic acid, which contains 18 carbons and a double bond between positions 9 and 10 , is designated $18: 1, \Delta^{9}$. The number 18 denotes the number of carbon atoms, 1 (one) denotes the number of

Deoxyribose
FIGURE 5.15 Oxidized and reduced sugars. The affected group is shown in the shaded box. Glucuronic acid is formed by oxidation of the glucose terminal -OH group. Gluconic acid (D-gluconate) is formed by oxidation of the glucose aldehyde carbon. Sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, is formed by reduction of the glucose aldehyde group. Deoxyribose is formed by reduction of ribose.

Palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, and arachidonic acid are the most common unsaturated fatty acids in the cell. Palmitoleic acid is a $16: 1, \Delta^{9}$ fatty acid. How would you name it as an $\omega$ fatty acid?

![ma3450024193](ma3450024193.jpg)

FIGURE 5.16 $N$ - and $O$-Glycosidic bonds. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contains a $\beta$ - $N$-glycosidic bond. Lactose contains an $O$-glycosidic $\beta(1 \rightarrow 4)$ bond. Starch contains $\alpha-1,4$ and $\alpha-1,6$ O-glycosidic bonds. The glycosidic bonds are shown in red.

$\sigma$Palmitoleic acid is an $\omega 7$ fatty acid. It has one double bond between the 9th and 10th carbons. It has 16 carbons, like palmitic acid, so the double bond is at the 7 th carbon from the $\omega$ end.

$\Delta$Frans-fatty acids (partially hydrogenated fat) were used by restaurants as an oil that had a longer shelf life than polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, the presence of trans fats in food has been linked in some studies to an increased risk of heart disease. These findings, however, have been challenged by the food industry. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now mandates the labeling of foods with trans-fatty acid content, and the use of trans-fatty acids in commercial food preparations has been banned in certain localities in the United States.
double bonds, and $\Delta^{9}$ denotes the position of the double bond between the 9th and 10th carbon atoms. Oleic acid can also be designated 18:1(9), without the $\Delta$. Fatty acids are also classified by the distance of the double bond closest to the $\omega$ end (the methyl group at the end farthest from the carboxyl group). Thus, oleic acid is an $\omega 9$ fatty acid, and linolenic acid is an $\omega 3$ fatty acid. Arachidonic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid with 20 carbons and 4 double bonds, is an $\omega 6$ fatty acid that is completely described as $20: 4, \Delta^{5,9,11,14}$. The eicosanoids are a group of hormone-like compounds produced by many cells in the body. They are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid that contain 20 carbons (eicosa) and have 3,4 , or 5 double bonds. The prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes belong to this group of compounds.

The double bonds in most naturally occurring fatty acids are in the cis configuration (Fig. 5.17B). The designation cis means that the hydrogens are on the same side of the double bond and the acyl chains are on the other side. In trans-fatty acids, the acyl chains are on opposite sides of the double bond. Trans-fatty acids are produced by the chemical hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils and are not a natural food product.

## B. Acylglycerols

An acylglycerol comprises glycerol with one or more fatty acids (the acyl group) attached through ester linkages (Fig. 5.18). Monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerols contain one, two, or three fatty acids esterified to glycerol,

![ma3550024193](ma3550024193.jpg)

FIGURE 5.17 A. Saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids. In stearic acid (top), a saturated fatty acid, all the atoms are shown. A more common way of depicting the same structure is shown below the numbered structure. The carbons are either numbered starting with the carboxyl group or given Greek letters starting with the carbon next to the carboxyl group. The methyl (or $\omega$ ) carbon at the end of the chain is always called the $\omega$-carbon, regardless of the chain length. The symbol 18:0 refers to the number of carbon atoms (18) and the number of double bonds ( 0 ). In the unsaturated fatty acids shown, not all of the carbons are numbered, but note that the double bonds are cis and spaced at three-carbon intervals. Both $\omega 3$ and $\omega 6$ fatty acids are required in the diet. B. Cis and trans double bonds in fatty-acid side chains. Note that the cis double bond causes the chain to bend.
respectively. Triacylglycerols rarely contain the same fatty acid at all three positions and are therefore called mixed triacylglycerols. Unsaturated fatty acids, when present, are most often esterified to carbon 2. In the three-dimensional configuration of glycerol, carbons 1 and 3 are not identical, and enzymes are specific for one or the other carbon.

## C. Phosphoacylglycerols

Phosphoacylglycerols contain fatty acids esterified to positions 1 and 2 of glycerol and a phosphate (alone or with a substituent) attached to carbon 3. If only a phosphate group is attached to carbon 3, the compound is phosphatidic acid (Fig. 5.19). Phosphatidic acid is a precursor for the synthesis of the other phosphoacylglycerols.

Phosphatidylcholine is one of the major phosphoacylglycerols found in membranes (see Fig. 5.19). The amine is positively charged at neutral pH , and the phosphate is negatively charged. Thus, the molecule is amphipathic: It contains large polar and nonpolar regions. Phosphatidylcholine is also called lecithin. Removal

FIGURE 5.20 Sphingolipids, derivatives of ceramide. The structure of ceramide is shown at the bottom of the figure. The portion of ceramide shown in red is sphingosine. The NH and -OH were contributed by serine. Different groups are added to the hydroxyl group of ceramide to form sphingomyelin, galactocerebrosides, and gangliosides.

of a fatty acyl group from a phosphoacylglycerol leads to a lysolipid; for example, removing the fatty acyl group from lecithin forms lysolecithin.

## D. Sphingolipids

Sphingolipids do not have a glycerol backbone; they are formed from sphingosine (Fig. 5.20). Sphingosine is derived from serine and a specific fatty acid, palmitate. Ceramides are amides formed from sphingosine by attaching a fatty acid to the amino group. Various sphingolipids are then formed by attaching different groups to the hydroxyl group on ceramide. As reflected in the names for cerebrosides and gangliosides, these sphingolipids contain sugars attached to the hydroxyl group of ceramide through glycosidic bonds. They are glycolipids (more specifically, glycosphingolipids). Sphingomyelin, which contains a phosphorylcholine group attached to ceramide, is a component of cell membranes and the myelin sheath around neurons.

## E. Steroids

Steroids contain a four-ring structure called the steroid nucleus (Fig. 5.21). Cholesterol is the steroid precursor in human cells from which all of the steroid hormones are synthesized by modifications to the ring or C-20 side chain. Although cholesterol is not very water-soluble, it is converted to amphipathic water-soluble bile salts such as cholic acid. Bile salts line the surfaces of lipid droplets called micelles in the lumen of the intestine, where they keep the droplets emulsified in the aqueous environment.

Cholesterol is one of the compounds synthesized in the human from branched five-carbon units with one double bond called an isoprenyl unit (see Fig. 5.1A). Isoprenyl units are combined in long chains to form other structures such as the side chains of coenzyme Q in humans and vitamin A in plants. Isoprene units form polymers to generate geranyl groups ( 10 carbons) and farnesyl groups ( 15 carbons) (see Chapter 32). The geranyl and farnesyl groups, because of their highly hydrophobic nature, are often covalently attached to proteins to allow the proteins to associate with cellular membranes.

## IV. Nitrogen-Containing Compounds

Nitrogen, as described in Section I.B.2, is an electronegative atom with two unshared electrons in its outer valence shell. At neutral pH , the nitrogen in amino groups is usually bonded to four other atoms and carries a positive charge. However, the presence of a nitrogen atom in an organic compound will increase its solubility in water, whether the nitrogen is charged or uncharged.

## A. Amino Acids

Amino acids are compounds that contain an amino group and a carboxylic acid group. In proteins, the amino acids are always L- $\alpha$-amino acids (the amino group

![ma4250024193](ma4250024193.jpg)

FIGURE 5.21 Cholesterol and its derivatives. The steroid nucleus is shown in the green box. The bile salt cholic acid and the steroid hormone $17 \beta$-estradiol are derived from cholesterol and contain the steroid ring structure.
is attached to the $\alpha$-carbon in the L-configuration) (Fig. 5.22). These same amino acids also serve as precursors of nitrogen-containing compounds in the body, such as phosphatidylcholine (see Fig. 5.19) and are the basis of most human amino acid metabolism. However, our metabolic reactions occasionally produce an amino acid that has a $\beta$ - or $\gamma$-amino group, such as the neurotransmitter $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (see Fig. 5.22). However, only L- $\alpha$-amino acids are incorporated into proteins. Although D-amino acids are not usually incorporated into proteins in living organisms, they serve many other functions in bacteria, such as synthesis of cross-links in cell walls.

# B. Nitrogen-Containing Ring Structures 

## I. Purines, Pyrimidines, and Pyridines

Nitrogen is also a component of ring structures referred to as heterocyclic rings or nitrogenous bases. The three most common types of nitrogen-containing rings in the body are purines (e.g., adenine), pyrimidines (e.g., thymine), and pyridines (e.g., the vitamins nicotinic acid, also called niacin, and pyridoxine, also called vitamin $B_{6}$ ) (Fig. 5.23). The suffix "-ine" denotes the presence of nitrogen (amine) in the ring. The pyrimidine uracil is an exception to this general type of nomenclature. The utility of these nitrogen-containing ring structures lies in the ability of the nitrogen to form hydrogen bonds and to accept and donate electrons while still part of the ring. In contrast, the unsubstituted aromatic benzene ring, in which electrons are distributed equally among all six carbons (see Fig. 5.1), is nonpolar, hydrophobic, and relatively unreactive.

## 2. Nucleosides and Nucleotides

Nitrogenous bases form nucleosides and nucleotides. A nucleoside consists of a nitrogenous base joined to a sugar, usually ribose or deoxyribose, through an

FIGURE 5.22 The structure of the $\alpha$-amino acid alanine (both the D- and L-configuration) and the $\gamma$-amino acid $\gamma$-aminobutyrate.

What structural features account for the differences in the solubility of cholesterol, estradiol, and cholic acid in the body? (See Fig. 5.21.)

# Pyridine 

![ma4850024193](ma4850024193.jpg)

Nicotinic acid

Cholesterol is composed almost entirely of $-\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ groups and is therefore watersoluble. Estradiol is likewise relatively water-insoluble. However, cholic acid contains a hydrophilic carboxyl group and three hydroxyl groups. As shown by the dashed lines, the three hydroxyl groups all lie on one side of the molecule, thus creating a hydrophilic surface.

Lotta T. has gouty arthritis (podagra) involving her great right toe. Polarized light microscopy of the fluid aspirated from the joint space showed crystals of monosodium urate phagocytosed by white blood cells. The presence of the relatively insoluble urate crystals within the joint space activates an inflammatory cascade leading to the classic components of joint inflammation (pain, redness, warmth, swelling, and limitation of joint motion). Uric acid is produced from the degradation of purines (adenine and guanine). At a blood pH of 7.4 , all of the uric acid has dissociated a proton to form urate, which is not very water-soluble and forms crystals of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$salt. In the more acidic urine generated by the kidney, the acidic form, uric acid, may precipitate to form kidney stones.
$N$-glycosidic bond (see Fig. 5.16). If phosphate groups are attached to the sugar, the compound becomes a nucleotide. In the name of the nucleotide ATP, the addition of the ribose is indicated by the name change from adenine to adenosine (for the glycosidic bond). Monophosphate, diphosphate, or triphosphate is added to the name to indicate the presence of one, two, or three phosphate groups in the nucleotide. The structures of the nucleotides that serve as precursors of DNA and RNA are discussed in more detail in Section III, Chapter 12.

## 3. Tautomers

In many of the nitrogen-containing rings, the hydrogen can shift to produce a tautomer, a compound in which the hydrogen and double bonds have changed position (i.e., $-\mathrm{N}=\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{OH} \rightarrow-\mathrm{NH}-\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ ) (Fig. 5.24). Tautomers are considered the same compound, and the structure may be represented either way. Generally, one tautomeric form is more reactive than the other. For example, in the two tautomeric forms of uric acid, a proton can dissociate from the enol form to produce urate.

## V. Free Radicals

Radicals are compounds that have a single electron, usually in an outer orbital. Free radicals are radicals that exist independently in solution or in a lipid environment. Although many enzymes generate radicals as intermediates in reactions, these are not usually released into the cell to become free radicals.

Many of the compounds in the body are capable of being converted to free radicals by natural events that remove one of their electrons or by radiation. Radiation, for example, dissociates water into the hydrogen atom and the hydroxyl radical:

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{H} \bullet+\mathrm{OH} \bullet
$$

In contrast, water normally dissociates into a proton and the negatively charged hydroxyl ion. The hydroxyl radical forms organic radicals by taking one electron (as $\mathrm{H} \bullet$ ) from a compound such as an unsaturated membrane lipid, which then has a single unpaired electron and is a new radical.

Compounds that are radicals may be written with, or without, the radical showing. For example, nitrogen dioxide, a potent, reactive, toxic radical present in smog and cigarette smoke, may be designated in medical and lay literature as $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$
![ma4950024193](ma4950024193.jpg)

FIGURE 5.24 Tautomers of uric acid. The tautomeric form affects the reactivity. The enol form dissociates a proton to form urate.

rather than $\mathrm{NO}_{2} \bullet$. Superoxide, a radical produced in the cell and that is the source of much destruction, is correctly written as the superoxide anion, $\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{-}$. However, to emphasize its free radical nature, the same compound is sometimes written as $\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{-} \bullet$. If a compound is designated as a radical in the medical literature, you can be certain that it is a reactive radical and that its radical nature is important for the pathophysiology under discussion. Reactive oxygen- and nitrogen-containing free radicals are discussed in more detail in Chapter 25.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Dianne A. The severity of clinical signs and symptoms in patients with DKA, such as Dianne A., is correlated directly with the concentration of ketone bodies in the blood. Direct quantitative methods for measuring acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate are not routinely available. As a result, clinicians usually rely on semiquantitative reagent strips (Ketostix, Bayer Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA) or tablets (Acetest, Bayer Corporation) to estimate the level of acetoacetate in the blood and the urine. The nitroprusside on the strips and in the tablets reacts with acetoacetate and to a lesser degree with acetone (both of which have ketone groups) but does not react with $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate (which does not have a ketone group). $\beta$-Hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone body present in the blood of a patient in DKA, and its concentration could decline at a disproportionately rapid rate compared with that of acetoacetate and acetone. Therefore, tests employing the nitroprusside reaction to monitor the success of therapy in such a patient may be misleading. As a result, clinicians will follow the "anion gap" in the blood, which in DKA represents the increase in ketone bodies.

In contrast to the difficulty of ketone body measurements, patients with diabetes can self-monitor blood glucose levels at home, thereby markedly decreasing the time and expense of the many blood glucose determinations they need. Capillary blood obtained from a finger prick is placed on the pad of a plastic strip. The strip has been impregnated with an enzyme (usually the bacterial enzyme glucose oxidase) that specifically converts the glucose in the blood to an oxidized sugar (gluconate) and a reduced compound (hydrogen peroxide, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ ). The $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ reacts with a dye to produce a color. The intensity of the color, which is directly proportionate to the concentration of glucose in the patient's blood, is read on an instrument called a blood glucose monitor.

Lotta T. Ms. T. has acute gouty arthritis (podagra) involving her right great toe. Lotta was treated with colchicine (acetyltrimethyl colchinic acid methyl ether) for the acute attack of gout affecting her great right toe. After having two doses of colchicine, the throbbing pain in her toe had abated significantly. The redness and swelling also seemed to have lessened slightly. Colchicine will reduce the effects of the inflammatory response to the urate crystals. Several weeks later, Lotta was started on allopurinol ( 150 mg twice daily), which inhibits the enzyme that produces uric acid. Within several days of starting allopurinol therapy, Lotta's uric acid levels began to decrease.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

Chlorinated Aromatic Hydrocarbon Environmental Toxins. As a result of human endeavor, toxic compounds containing chlorinated benzene rings have been widely distributed in the environment. The pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), the class of chemicals called dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) provide examples of chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons and structurally related compounds that are very hydrophobic and poorly biodegraded (Fig. 5.25). As a consequence of their persistence and lipophilicity, these chemicals are concentrated in the adipose tissue of fish, fish-eating birds, and carnivorous mammals, including humans.

(1)Free radicals are not just esoteric reactants; they are the agents of cell death and destruction. They are involved in many chronic disease states (e.g., coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, emphysema) as well as acute injury (e.g., radiation, strokes, myocardial infarction, spinal cord injury). Through free radical defense mechanisms in our cells, we can often restrict the damage attributed to the "normal" aging process.

(2)The anion gap refers to the difference in concentration between routinely measured anions (chloride and bicarbonate) and cations (sodium and potassium) in the blood. Because these cations are in most cases in greater concentration than the measured anions, the difference in value is known as the anion gap. The normal value for the anion gap is 12 (range $=8-16$ ). If the anion gap is greater than normal, it is indicative of unknown anions being present in excess and, in the case of type I diabetes, most often reflects the production of ketone bodies.

(3)The reducing sugar test. The reducing sugar test was used for detection of sugar in the urine long before specific enzymatic assays for glucose and galactose became available. In this test, the aldehyde group of a sugar is oxidized as it donates electrons to copper; the copper becomes reduced and produces a blue color. In alkaline solution, keto sugars (e.g., fructose) also react in this test because they form tautomers that are aldehydes. Ring structures of sugars also react but only if the ring can open (i.e., it is not attached to another compound through a glycosidic bond). Until a specific test for fructose becomes available, a congenital disease resulting in the presence of fructose in the urine is indicated by a positive reducing sugar test and negative results in the specific enzymatic assays for glucose or galactose.

FIGURE 5.25 Environmental toxins. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a member of a class of aromatic hydrocarbons that contains two chlorinated benzene (phenyl) rings joined by a chlorinated ethane molecule. Chlo-rodibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs) are a related class of more than 75 chlorinated hydrocarbons that all contain a dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD) molecule comprising two benzene rings joined via two oxygen bridges at adjacent carbons on each of the benzene rings. The compound 2,3,7,8-tetra-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is one of the most toxic and the most extensively studied. Chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs) are structurally and toxicologically related. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) consist of two benzene rings linked by a bond with 2 to 10 of the remaining carbons containing a chlorine atom. There are $>200$ different varieties of PCBs.

The accumulation of DDT in adipose tissue may be protective in humans because it decreases the amount of DDT available to pass through nonpolar lipid membranes to reach neurons in the brain or to pass through placental membranes to reach the fetus. Eventually, we convert DDT to more polar metabolites that are excreted in the urine. However, some may pass with lipid into the breast milk of nursing mothers.

Most of what is known about the toxicity of dioxins in humans comes from individuals exposed incidentally or chronically to higher levels (e.g., industrial accidents or presence in areas sprayed with Agent Orange or other herbicides contaminated with dioxins). The lowest dose effects are probably associated with thymic atrophy and decreased immune response, chloracne and related skin lesions, and neoplasia (cancer). Dioxins can cross into the placenta to cause developmental and reproductive effects, decreased prenatal growth, and prenatal mortality.

DDT, a chlorinated biphenyl, was widely used in the United States as a herbicide from the 1940s through the 1960s (see Fig. 5.25). Although it has not been used in this country since 1972, the chlorinated benzene rings are resistant to biodegradation, and US soil and water are still contaminated with small amounts. DDT continues to be used in other parts of the world. Because this highly lipophilic molecule is stored in the fat of animals, organisms accumulate progressively greater amounts of DDT at each successive stage of the food chain. Fish-eating birds, one of the organisms at the top of the food chain, have declined in population because of the effect of DDT on the thickness of their eggshells. DDT is not nearly as toxic in the human, although long-term exposure or exposure to high doses may cause reversible neurologic symptoms, hepatotoxic effects, or cancer.

Dioxins, specifically polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), constitute another class of environmental toxins that are currently of great concern (see Fig. 5.25). They have been measured at what is termed background levels in the blood, adipose tissue, and breast milk of all humans tested. PCDDs are formed as a by-product during the production of other chlorinated compounds and herbicides and from the chlorine bleaching process used by pulp and paper mills. They are released during the incineration of industrial, municipal, and domestic waste and during the combustion of fossil fuels, and they are found in cigarette smoke and the exhaust from engines that burn gasoline and diesel fuels. PCDDs can also be formed from the combustion of organic matter during forest fires. They enter the atmosphere as particulate matter, are vaporized, and can spread large distances to enter soil and water.

PCBs were originally synthesized for use as nonflammable material for cooling and insulating industrial transformers and capacitors. As a result of accidents in the chemical plants producing the PCBs, it became evident that these chemicals can cause adverse health effects in humans. Production of PCBs stopped in the United States in 1979, although they may still be found in enclosed containers for electrical transformers. All of the chlorinated compounds thus far discussed may have as their mechanism of action an alteration of gene expression via binding to the cytoplasmic arylhydrocarbon receptor (see Section III of this text). PCB exposure has been linked to cancer and to disorders of the immune, reproductive, nervous, and endocrine systems.

All of the polychlorinated derivatives are difficult to remove from the environment. One promising approach is to use genetically engineered bacteria that can use these compounds as a food source and safely metabolize the toxins. This approach, however, has the drawback of introducing genetically engineered organisms into the environment, which has its own potential problems (see Chapter 17).

As humans at the top of the food chain, we have acquired our background levels of dioxins principally through the consumption of food—primarily meat, dairy products, and fish. Once in the human body, dioxins are stored in human fat and adipose tissue and have an average half-life of approximately 5 to 15 years. They are unreactive, poorly degraded, and not readily converted to more water-soluble compounds that can be excreted in the urine. They are slowly excreted in the bile and feces and together with lipids enter the breast milk of nursing mothers.

## KEY CONCEPTS

- Carbohydrates, commonly known as sugars, can be classified by several criteria:
- Type of carbonyl group (aldo- or ketosugars)
- Number of carbons (pentoses [five carbons], hexoses [six carbons])
- Positions of hydroxyl groups on asymmetric carbon atoms (D- or L-configuration, stereoisomers, epimers)
- Substituents (amino sugars)

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is C. Triglyceride (triacylglycerol) consists of three fatty acids esterified to the carbohydrate glycerol. Phosphoacylglycerols are similar to triacylglycerol but contain a phosphate in place of a fatty acid. Cholesterol contains a steroid nucleus. Sphingolipids are built on sphingosine, but triglycerides are not.
2. The answer is E. The compound contains an -OH group, which should appear in the name as an "-ol" or a "hydroxyl-" group. All answers fit this criterion. The structure also contains a carboxylate group $\left(-\mathrm{COO}^{-}\right)$, which should appear in the name as an "-ate" or "acid." Only D and E fit this criterion. Counting backward from

the carboxylate group (carbon 1), the second carbon is $\alpha$, the third carbon is $\beta$, and the fourth carbon, containing the hydroxyl group, is $\gamma$. Thus, the compound is $\gamma$-hydroxybutyrate. $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and C can also be eliminated because "meth-" denotes a single carbon, "eth-" denotes two carbons, and the "-ene" in ethylene denotes a double bond.
3. The answer is B. The term "glycosidic bond" refers to a covalent bond formed between the anomeric carbon of one sugar, when it is in a ring form, and a hydroxyl group or nitrogen of another compound (see Fig. 5.16) (thus, A, D, and E are incorrect). Disaccharides can be linked through their anomeric carbons, but polysaccharides cannot because there would be no anomeric carbon left to form a link with the next sugar in the chain (thus, C is incorrect).
4. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. The keto or aldehyde group is necessary for a positive reducing sugar test (a nonspecific test used to identify the presence of sugar in the urine). Because galactitol has had its aldehyde group already reduced to form the alcohol group, it would no longer give a positive result in a reducing sugar test. An "ol" in the name denotes that the compound is an alcohol (has an -OH group) and an "ose" denotes a sugar. Thus, the alcohol that is derived from galactose is galactitol. All sugars have a keto or aldehyde group, which is reduced when the compound becomes an alcohol (a gain of electrons, as indicated by an increase of hydrogen relative to oxygen). Oxidation of the keto or aldehyde group would lead to an acid group being generated, not an alcohol group. Galactose is an aldose sugar, not a keto sugar.
5. The answer is B. Sphingolipids contain a ceramide group, which is sphingosine with an attached fatty acid. They do not contain a glycerol moiety (thus, A is incorrect). However, different sphingolipids have different substituents on the $-\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{OH}$ group of ceramide. For example, sphingomyelin contains phosphorylcholine, and gangliosides contain NANA (thus, C and D are incorrect). No known sphingolipids contain a steroid (thus, E is incorrect).
6. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. None of these ketone bodies contains a benzene or similar ring (aromatic), so they are all defined as aliphatic. Two of these have four carbons (butyl), but acetone has only three carbons (propyl structure). Only $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate contains a hydroxyl group $(-\mathrm{OH})$, and none contains a nitrogen atom or group (amine).
7. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The $\omega$-series of fatty acids refers to counting carbons from the $\omega$-end of the fatty acid (usually the methyl carbon end) until a double bond is
reached. For the cis $\Delta^{9,12,15} \mathrm{C} 18: 3$ fatty acid, the double bonds are between carbons 9 and 10, 12 and 13, and 15 and 16. If one counts backward from carbon 18, one counts three carbons (18, 17, and 16) before the double bond is reached, indicating that this fatty acid belongs to the $\omega-3$ family. The cis $\Delta^{12} \mathrm{C} 18: 2$ fatty acid belongs to the $\omega-6$ group, as does the cis $\Delta^{6,9,12} \mathrm{C} 18: 3$ fatty acid. The cis $\Delta^{9,12,15} \mathrm{C} 20: 3$ fatty acid belongs to the $\omega-5$ group, whereas the cis $\Delta^{6,9} \mathrm{C} 16: 2$ fatty acid belongs to the $\omega-7$ group.
8. The answer is C. Saline $0.9 \%$ is considered "normal" saline (NS) and is isotonic. This is a very common solution in IV fluids used to treat dehydration. D5 refers to $5 \%$ dextrose solution or $50 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ dextrose given as a means of parenteral nutrition because the patient cannot take oral nutrition. Dextrose is another name for Dglucose. L-Glucose is not commonly found in the human body. The glucose is completely metabolized and does not contribute to tonicity. Galactose is not present in this type of solution.
9. The answer is B. Polyunsaturated fatty acids have a lower melting point than more saturated fats. Butter is a highly saturated fat and is a solid around room temperature. Polyunsaturated fats melt at room temperature. Most consumers do not want a butter substitute that melts at room temperature, so such a product would not sell as well as natural butter. Hydrogenation reduces the double bonds in the polyunsaturated fats and makes the product more saturated, which raises the melting point of the oil as well as increasing the shelf life of the product. Hydrogenated oils are less expensive to produce than animal fats, but hydrogenation introduces an extra step in manufacturing and increases costs as compared to not changing the product at all. Unfortunately, commercial hydrogenation creates trans double bonds in the fats, whereas all naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids contain double bonds in the cis-configuration. The presence of trans fats in American diets has been linked to the development of cardiovascular disease. Hydrogenation of fatty acids has nothing to do with cholesterol.
10. The answer is A. In human proteins, the amino acids are always $\mathrm{L}-\alpha$-amino acids (in the L -configuration). D-Amino acids are not used for synthesizing proteins in humans but are used to generate products in bacteria. Inhibiting the use of D-amino acids would inhibit bacterial growth but does not affect human cell growth. Some human products contain $\beta$ - and $\gamma$-amino groups, so drugs inhibiting their production would not be beneficial for human use.

0The genetic code is the sequence of three bases (nucleotides) in DNA that contains the information for the linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain (its primary structure). A gene is the portion of DNA that encodes a functional product, such as a polypeptide chain. Mutations, which are changes in the nucleotides in a gene, result in a change in the products of that gene that may be inherited. The inherited disease sickle cell anemia, for example, is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes one of the subunits of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein present in red blood cells that reversibly binds $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and transports it to tissues. The adult hemoglobin protein comprises four polypeptide chains, $2 \alpha$ and $2 \beta$. The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits differ in primary structure (i.e., they have different sequences of amino acids and are encoded by different genes). Sickle cell anemia is caused by a single nucleotide mutation in DNA that changes just one amino acid in the hemoglobin $\beta$-chains from a glutamic acid to a valine.

## Amino Acids in Proteins

Proteins have many functions in the body. They serve as transporters of hydrophobic compounds in the blood, as cell adhesion molecules that attach cells to each other and to the extracellular matrix, as hormones that carry signals from one group of cells to another, as ion channels through lipid membranes, and as enzymes that increase the rate of biochemical reactions. The unique characteristics of a protein are dictated by its linear sequence of amino acids, termed its primary structure. The primary structure of a protein determines how it can fold and how it interacts with other molecules in the cell to perform its function. The primary structures of all of the diverse human proteins are synthesized from 20 amino acids arranged in a linear sequence determined by the genetic code.

General Properties of Amino Acids. Each of the amino acids used for protein synthesis has the same general structure (Fig. 6.I A). It contains a carboxylic acid group, an amino group attached to the $\alpha$-carbon in an L-configuration, a hydrogen atom, and a chemical group called a side chain that is different for each amino acid. In solution, at physiologic pH , the free amino acids exist as zwitterions: ions in which the amino group is positively charged and the carboxylate group is negatively charged (see Fig. 6.1B). In proteins, these amino acids are joined into linear polymers called polypeptide chains through peptide bonds between the carboxylic acid group of one amino acid and the amino group of the next amino acid.

Classification of Amino Acids according to Chemical Properties of the Side Chains. The chemical properties of the side chain determine the types of bonds and interactions each amino acid in a polypeptide chain can make with other molecules. Thus, amino acids are often grouped by polarity of the side chain (charged, nonpolar hydrophobic, or uncharged polar) or by structural features (aliphatic, cyclic, or aromatic). The side chains of the nonpolar hydrophobic amino acids (alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and methionine) cluster together to exclude water in the hydrophobic effect. The uncharged polar amino acids (serine, threonine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine) participate in hydrogen bonding.

Cysteine, which contains a sulfhydryl group, forms disulfide bonds. The negatively charged acidic amino acids (aspartate and glutamate) form ionic (electrostatic) bonds with positively charged molecules such as the basic amino acids (lysine, arginine, and histidine). The charge on the amino acid at a particular pH is determined by the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ (-log of the acid dissociation constant) of each group that has a dissociable proton.

Amino Acid Substitutions in the Primary Structure. Mutations in the genetic code result in proteins with an altered primary structure. Mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions can affect the functioning of a protein or can confer an advantage specific to a tissue or a set of circumstances. Many proteins, such as hemoglobin, exist in the human population as polymorphisms (genetically determined variations in primary structure).

Within the same individual, the primary structure of many proteins varies with the stage of development and is present in fetal and adult isoforms such as fetal and adult hemoglobin. The primary structure of some proteins, such as

creatine kinase, can also vary between tissues (tissue-specific isozymes) or between intracellular locations in the same tissue. Electrophoretic separation of tissue-specific isozymes has been useful in medicine as a means of identifying the tissue site of injury.

Modified Amino Acids. In addition to the amino acids encoded by DNA that form the primary structure of proteins, many proteins contain specific amino acids that have been modified by phosphorylation, oxidation, carboxylation, or other reactions. When these reactions are catalyzed by enzymes, they are referred to as posttranslational modifications.

## THE WAITING ROOM

![ma5250024193](ma5250024193.jpg)

Will S. is a 17-year-old boy who presented to the hospital emergency department with severe pain in his lower back, abdomen, and legs, which began after a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting caused by gastroenteritis. He was diagnosed as having sickle cell disease at age 3 years and has been admitted to the hospital on numerous occasions for similar vaso-occlusive sickle cell crises.

On admission, the patient's hemoglobin level in peripheral venous blood was $7.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range $=12$ to $16 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). The hematocrit or packed cell volume (the percentage of the total volume of blood made up of red blood cells) was $23.4 \%$ (reference range $=41 \%$ to $53 \%$ ). His serum total bilirubin level (a pigment derived from hemoglobin degradation) was $2.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range $=0.2$ to $1.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). A radiograph of his abdomen showed radiopaque stones in his gallbladder. With chronic hemolysis (red blood cell destruction), the amount of heme degraded to bilirubin is increased. These stones are the result of the chronic excretion of excessive amounts of bilirubin from the liver into the bile, leading to bilirubinate crystal deposition in the gallbladder lumen.

David K. is an 18-year-old boy who was brought to the hospital by his mother because of the sudden onset of severe pain in his left flank, radiating around his left side toward his pubic area. His urine was reddishbrown in color, and a urinalysis showed the presence of many red blood cells. When his urine was acidified with acetic acid, clusters of flat hexagonal transparent crystals of cystine were noted. There was no family history of kidney stone disease.

Dianne A., who has type 1 diabetes mellitus, has to give herself subcutaneous injections of insulin several times a day to try to mimic what her pancreas would do if she could produce insulin. Insulin was initially purified from animals, and then synthetic human insulin was developed. There is now modified synthetic insulin, which allows the onset of action to be adjusted. Dianne A. takes long-acting insulin (glargine) once a day and rapid-acting insulin (lispro) with meals. Her physician will adjust the doses to keep her blood glucose levels controlled.

Anne J. is a 54-year-old woman who is 68 in tall and weighs 198 lb . She has a history of high blood pressure and elevated serum cholesterol levels. Following a heated argument with a neighbor, Mrs. J. experienced a "tight pressure-like band of pain" across her chest, associated with shortness of breath, sweating, and a sense of light-headedness.

After 5 hours of intermittent chest pain, she went to the hospital emergency department, where her electrocardiogram showed changes consistent with an acute infarction of the anterior wall of her heart. She was admitted to the cardiac care unit. Blood was sent to the laboratory for various tests, including a determination of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels.

The term calculus is used to describe any abnormal concretion (concretelike precipitate) of mineral salts. These almost always form within the cavity of a hollow organ, such as the kidney (kidney or renal stones) or the lumen of a duct (e.g., common bile duct stones).

The term angina describes a crushing or compressive pain. The term angina pectoris is used when this pain is located in the center of the chest or pectoral region, often radiating to the neck or arms. The most common mechanism for the latter symptom is a decreased supply of oxygen to the heart muscle caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, which results in obstruction of the vessels that supply arterial blood to cardiac muscle.

Bilirubin is a degradation product of hemoglobin, and its levels are elevated in
Will S. Bilirubin can be present in serum either conjugated to glucuronic acid (which is determined by the direct measurement) or free (which is very hydrophobic and is determined by indirect measurement). Measurement of bilirubin in serum is dependent on the reaction of bilirubin with a diazotized sulfonic acid, which generates, after appropriate treatments, a blue azobilirubin. The intensity of the blue color can be determined spectrophotometrically at 600 nm . Total bilirubin is measured in the presence of caffeine-benzoate, which separates the hydrophobic nonconjugated bilirubin from its binding partners. A second measurement is done in the absence of caffeine-benzoate, which will only determine the conjugated, soluble forms of bilirubin (the direct measurement). Unconjugated bilirubin is then calculated by determining the difference in values obtained in the presence and absence of caffeinebenzoate (the indirect measurement). Recently, a transcutaneous device has been developed to determine bilirubin levels in newborns. The instrument is pressed against the infant's forehead, and light at various wavelengths is transmitted through the forehead, generating a reflective multiwavelength spectrum. Analysis of the spectrum allows the instrument to determine the levels of bilirubin, hemoglobin, and melanin in the infant's skin.

## I. General Structure of the Amino Acids

Twenty different amino acids are commonly found in proteins. They are all $\alpha$-amino acids-amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the $\alpha$-carbon (the carbon atom next to the carboxylate group) (see Fig 6.1A). The $\alpha$-carbon has two additional substituents, a hydrogen atom and an additional chemical group called a side chain (-R). The side chain is different for each amino acid.

At a physiologic pH of 7.4 , the amino group on these amino acids carries a positive charge and the carboxylic acid group is negatively charged (see Fig. 6.1B). The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of the primary carboxylic acid groups for all of the amino acids is approximately 2 ( 1.8 to 2.4 ). At pH values much lower than the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ (higher hydrogen ion concentrations), all of the carboxylic acid groups are protonated. At the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}, 50 \%$ of the molecules are dissociated into carboxylate anions and protons, and at a pH of $7.4,>99 \%$ of the molecules are dissociated (see Chapter 4). The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ for all of the $\alpha$-amino groups is approximately 9.5 ( 8.8 to 11.0 ), so that at the lower pH of 7.4 , most of the amino groups are fully protonated and carry a positive charge. The form of an amino acid that has both a positive and a negative charge is called a zwitterion. Because these charged chemical groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, all of these amino acids are water-soluble at physiologic pH .

In all of the amino acids but glycine (where the side chain is a hydrogen), the $\alpha$-carbon is an asymmetric carbon atom that has four different substituents and can exist in either the D- or L-configuration (Fig. 6.2). The amino acids in mammalian proteins are all L-amino acids represented with the amino group to the left if the carboxyl group is at the top of the structure. These same amino acids serve as precursors of nitrogen-containing compounds that are synthesized in the body, and thus, human amino acid metabolism is also centered on L-amino acids. The amino acid glycine is neither D nor L because the $\alpha$-carbon atom contains two hydrogen atoms and is not an asymmetric carbon.

The chemical properties of the amino acids give each protein its unique characteristics. Proteins are composed of one or more linear polypeptide chains and may contain hundreds of amino acids. The sequence of amino acids, termed the primary structure, is determined by the genetic code for the protein. In the polypeptide chains, amino acids are joined through peptide bonds between the carboxylic acid of one amino acid and
![ma5450024193](ma5450024193.jpg)

FIGURE 6.2 L- and D-Amino acids. The L-forms are the only ones found in human proteins. Bonds coming out of the paper are shown by black arrows; those going in, by shaded arrows. The $\alpha$-amino groups and H atoms come toward the reader, and the $\alpha$-carboxyl and side chains go away from the reader. The L- and D-forms are mirror images that cannot be superimposed by rotating the molecule. The reference for the L- and D-forms is the stereoisomers of glyceraldehyde (see Fig. 5.10A). $R$, side chain.

the amino group of the adjacent amino acid (Fig. 6.3, see also Fig. 1.5). Thus, the amino group, the $\alpha$-carbon, and the carboxyl groups form the peptide backbone, and the side chains of the amino acids extend outward from this backbone. The side chains interact with the peptide backbone of other regions of the chain or with the side chains of other amino acids in the protein to form hydrophobic regions, electrostatic bonds, hydrogen bonds, or disulfide bonds. These interactions dictate the folding pattern of the molecule. The three-dimensional folding of the protein forms distinct regions called binding sites that are lined with amino acid side chains that interact specifically with another molecule termed a ligand (e.g., the heme in hemoglobin). Thus, the chemical properties of the side chains determine how the protein folds, how it binds specific ligands, and how it interacts with its environment (e.g., the aqueous medium of the cytoplasm). Each chain will have a carboxyl terminal and an amino terminal. The amino terminal is the first amino acid in the chain, which contains a free amino group. The carboxyl terminal is the last amino acid in the chain, which contains a free carboxylate group.

## II. Classification of Amino Acid Side Chains

As seen in Figure 6.4, the 20 amino acids used for protein synthesis are grouped into different classifications according to the polarity and structural features of the side chains. These groupings can be helpful in describing common functional roles or metabolic pathways of the amino acids. However, some amino acid side chains fit into several different classifications and are therefore grouped differently in different textbooks. Two of the characteristics of the side chain that are useful for classification are its $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ and its hydropathic index, listed in Table 6.1. The hydropathic index is a scale used to denote the hydrophobicity of the side chain; the more positive the hydropathic index, the greater is the tendency to cluster with other nonpolar molecules and exclude water in the hydrophobic effect. These hydrophobic side chains tend to occur in membranes or in the center of a folded protein, where water is excluded. The more negative the hydropathic index of an amino acid, the more hydrophilic is its side chain.

The names of the different amino acids have been given three-letter and one-letter abbreviations (see Fig. 6.4). The three-letter abbreviations use the first two letters in the name plus the third letter of the name or the letter of a characteristic sound, such as "trp" for tryptophan. The one-letter abbreviations use the first letter of the name of the most frequent amino acid in proteins (e.g., "A" for alanine). If the first letter has already been assigned, the letter of a characteristic sound is used (e.g., "R" for arginine). Single-letter abbreviations are commonly used to denote the amino acids in a polypeptide sequence.

## A. Nonpolar, Aliphatic Amino Acids

Glycine is the simplest amino acid, and it does not fit well into any classification because its side chain is just a hydrogen atom. Because the side chain of glycine is so small compared with that of other amino acids, it causes the least amount of steric hindrance in a protein (i.e., it does not significantly impinge on the space occupied by other atoms or chemical groups). Therefore, glycine often is found in bends or in the tightly packed chains of fibrous proteins.

Alanine and the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) have bulky, nonpolar, aliphatic (open-chain hydrocarbons) side chains and exhibit a high degree of hydrophobicity (see Table 6.1). Electrons are shared equally between the carbon and hydrogen atoms in these side chains, so that they cannot hydrogen bond with water. Within proteins, these amino acid side chains will cluster together to form hydrophobic cores. Their association is also promoted by van der Waals forces between the positively charged nucleus of one atom and the electron cloud of another. This force is effective over short distances when many atoms pack closely together.

The role of proline in amino acid structure differs from those of the nonpolar amino acids. The amino acid proline contains a ring involving its $\alpha$-carbon and its $\alpha$-amino group, which are part of the peptide backbone. It is an imino acid. This

FIGURE 6.4 The side chains of the amino acids. The side chains are highlighted. The amino acids are grouped by the polarity and structural features of their side chains. These groupings are not absolute, however. Tyrosine and tryptophan, often listed with the nonpolar amino acids, are more polar than other aromatic amino acids because of their phenolic and indole rings, respectively. The single-letter and three-letter codes are also indicated for each amino acid.

${ }^{a}$ When these amino acids reside in proteins, the $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ values for the side chains may vary to some extent from the value for the free amino acid, depending on the local environment of the amino acid in the three-dimensional structure of the protein.

rigid ring causes a kink in the peptide backbone that prevents it from forming its usual configuration, and it will restrict the conformation of the protein at that point.

## B. Aromatic Amino Acids

The aromatic amino acids have been grouped together because they all contain ring structures with similar properties, but their polarities differ a great deal. The aromatic ring is a six-membered carbon-hydrogen ring with three conjugated double bonds (the benzene ring or phenyl group). These hydrogen atoms do not participate in hydrogen bonding. The substituents on this ring determine whether the amino acid side chain engages in polar or hydrophobic interactions. In the amino acid phenylalanine, the ring contains no substituents and the electrons are shared equally between the carbons in the ring, resulting in a very nonpolar hydrophobic structure in which the rings can stack on each other (Fig. 6.5). In tyrosine, a hydroxyl group on the phenyl

Chymotrypsin's highest activity is toward peptide bonds formed by the carboxyl groups of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan). The side chains of these amino acids are all large and uncharged. One of the chymotrypsin isozymes also exhibits activity toward leucine and methionine, which are similar in polarity.

Will S. has sickle cell anemia caused by a point mutation in his DNA that changes the sixth amino acid in the $\beta$-globin chain of hemoglobin from glutamate to valine. What difference would you expect to find in the chemical bonds formed by these two amino acids?

FIGURE 6.6 A disulfide bond. Covalent disulfide bonds may be formed between two molecules of cysteine or between two cysteine residues in a protein. The disulfide compound is called cystine. The hydrogens of the cysteine sulfhydryl groups are removed during oxidation.

ring engages in hydrogen bonds, and the side chain is therefore more polar and more hydrophilic. The more complex ring structure in tryptophan is an indole ring with a nitrogen that can engage in hydrogen bonds. Tryptophan is therefore also more polar than phenylalanine.

## C. Aliphatic, Polar, Uncharged Amino Acids

Amino acids with side chains that contain an amide group (asparagine and glutamine) or a hydroxyl group (serine and threonine) can be classified as aliphatic, polar, uncharged amino acids. Asparagine and glutamine are amides of the amino acids aspartate and glutamate. The hydroxyl groups and the amide groups in the side chains allow these amino acids to form hydrogen bonds with water, with each other and the peptide backbone, or with other polar compounds in the binding sites of the proteins (see Fig. 6.5). As a consequence of their hydrophilicity, these amino acids are frequently found on the surface of water-soluble globular proteins. Cysteine, which is sometimes included in this class of amino acids, has been separated into the class of sulfur-containing amino acids.

## D. Sulfur-Containing Amino Acids

Both cysteine and methionine contain sulfur. The side chain of cysteine contains a sulfhydryl group that has a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of approximately 8.4 for dissociation of its hydrogen, so cysteine is predominantly undissociated and uncharged at the physiologic pH of 7.4. The free cysteine molecule in solution can form a covalent disulfide bond with another cysteine molecule through spontaneous (nonenzymatic) oxidation of their sulfhydryl groups. The resultant amino acid, cystine, is present in blood and tissues and is not very water-soluble. In proteins, the formation of a cystine disulfide bond between two appropriately positioned cysteine sulfhydryl groups often plays an important role in holding two polypeptide chains or two different regions of a chain together (Fig. 6.6). Methionine, although it contains a sulfur group, is a nonpolar amino acid with a large, bulky side chain that is hydrophobic. It does not contain a sulfhydryl group and cannot form disulfide bonds. Its important and central role in metabolism is related to its ability, when appropriately activated, to transfer the methyl group attached to the sulfur atom to other compounds.

## E. The Acidic and Basic Amino Acids

The amino acids aspartate and glutamate have carboxylic acid groups that carry a negative charge at physiologic pH (see Fig. 6.4). The basic amino acids histidine, lysine, and arginine have side chains containing nitrogen that can be protonated and positively charged at physiologic and lower pH values. Histidine has a nitrogencontaining imidazole ring for a side chain, lysine has a primary amino group on the $\varepsilon$-carbon (from the sequence $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \varepsilon$ ), and arginine has a guanidinium group.

The positive charges on the basic amino acids enable them to form ionic bonds (electrostatic bonds) with negatively charged groups, such as the side chains of acidic amino acids or the phosphate groups of coenzymes (Fig. 6.7). In addition, lysine and arginine side chains of ten form ionic bonds with negatively charged compounds bound to the protein binding sites, such as the phosphate groups in adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The acidic and basic amino acid side chains also participate in hydrogen bonding and the formation of salt bridges (e.g., the binding of an inorganic ion such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$between two partially or fully negatively charged groups).

The charge on these amino acids at physiologic pH is a function of their $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ for dissociation of protons from the $\alpha$-carboxylic acid groups, the $\alpha$-amino groups, and the side chains. The titration curve of histidine illustrates the changes in amino acid structure that occurs as the pH of the solution is changed from $<1$ to 14 by the addition of hydroxide ions (Fig. 6.8). At low pH , all groups carry protons, amino groups have a positive charge, and carboxylic acid groups have zero charge. As the pH is increased by the addition of alkali $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)$, the proton dissociates from the carboxylic

![ma6250024193](ma6250024193.jpg)

FIGURE 6.8 Titration curve of histidine. The ionic species that predominates in each region is shown below the graph. $p I$ is the isoelectric point (the pH at which there is no net charge on the molecule). $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}-\log$ acid dissociation constant; $R_{i}$ side chain.
acid group and its charge changes from 0 to -1 with a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of approximately 2 , the pH at which $50 \%$ of the protons have dissociated.

The histidine side chain is an imidazole ring with a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of approximately 6 that changes from a predominantly protonated positively charged ring to an uncharged ring at this pH . The amino group on the $\alpha$-carbon titrates at a much higher pH (between 9 and 10), and the charge changes from +1 to 0 as the pH rises. The pH at which the net charge on the molecules in solution is 0 is called the isoelectric point (pI). At this pH , the molecules will not migrate in an electric field toward either a positive pole (cathode) or a negative pole (anode) because the number of negative charges on each molecule is equal to the number of positive charges.

Amino acid side chains change from uncharged to negatively charged, or positively charged to uncharged as they release protons (Fig. 6.9). The acidic amino acids lose a proton from their carboxylic acid side chains at a pH of approximately 4 and are thus negatively charged at pH 7.4 . Cysteine and tyrosine lose protons at their $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ ( $\sim 8.4$ and 10.5 , respectively), so their side chains are uncharged at physiologic pH . Histidine, lysine, and arginine side chains change from positively charged to neutral at their $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$. The side chains of the two basic amino acids arginine and lysine have $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ values $>10$, so that the positively charged form always predominates at physiologic pH . The side chain of histidine $\left(\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}} \sim 6.0\right)$ dissociates near physiologic pH , so only a portion of the histidine side chains carries a positive charge (see Fig. 6.8).

In proteins, only the amino acid side chains, the amino group at the amino terminal, and the carboxyl group at the carboxyl terminal have dissociable protons. All of the other carboxylic acid and amino groups on the $\alpha$-carbons are joined in peptide bonds that have no dissociable protons. The amino acid side chains might have very different $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ values than those of the free amino acids if they are involved in hydrogen or ionic bonds with other amino acid side chains. The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of the imidazole group of histidine, for example, is often shifted to a higher value between 6 and 7 so that it adds and releases a proton in the physiologic pH range.

Glutamate carries a negative charge on its side chain at physiologic pH and thus can engage in ionic bonds or hydrogen bonds with water or other side chains. Valine is a hydrophobic amino acid and therefore tends to interact with other hydrophobic side chains to exclude water.

David K. passed a renal stone shortly after admission, which immediately relieved his pain. Its major component was identified as cystine. Normally, amino acids are filtered by glomerular capillaries into the tubular urine but are almost entirely reabsorbed from this fluid back into the blood via transport proteins in the proximal tubular cells. David K. has cystinuria, an inherited amino acid substitution in the transport protein that reabsorbs cystine, arginine, and lysine. Therefore, his urine contained high amounts of these amino acids. Cystine, which is less soluble than other amino acids, precipitates in the urine to form renal stones (calculi).

![ma6350024193](ma6350024193.jpg)

FIGURE 6.9 Dissociation of the side chains of the amino acids.As the pH increases, the charge on the side chain goes from 0 to negative ( - ) or from positive $(+)$ to 0 . The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ is the pH at which half the molecules of an amino acid in solution have side chains that are charged. Half are uncharged. $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}} \sim \log$ acid dissociation constant.

Is the substitution of a glutamate for a valine in sickle cell hemoglobin a conservative replacement? What about the substitution of an aspartate for a glutamate?

For the most part, human chromosomes occur as homologous pairs, with each member of a pair containing the same genetic information. One member of the pair is inherited from the mother and one from the father. Genes are arranged linearly along each chromosome. A genetic locus is a specific position or location on a chromosome. Alleles are alternative versions of a gene at a given locus. For each locus (site), we have two alleles of each gene, one from our mother and one from our father. If both alleles of a gene are identical, the individual is homozygous for this gene; if the alleles are different, the individual is heterozygous for this gene. Will $\mathbf{S}$. has two identical alleles for the sickle variant of the $\beta$-globin gene that results in substitution of a valine for a glutamate residue at the sixth position of the $\beta$-globin chain. He is therefore homozygous for the sickle cell allele and has sickle cell anemia. Individuals with one normal gene and one sickle cell allele are heterozygous. They are carriers of the disease and have sickle cell trait.

Electrophoresis, a technique used to separate proteins on the basis of charge, has been extremely useful in medicine to identify proteins with different amino acid compositions. The net charge on a protein at a certain pH is a summation of all of the positive and negative charges on all of the ionizable amino acid side chains plus the N -terminal amino and $C$-terminal carboxyl groups. Theoretically, the net charge of a protein at any pH could be determined from its amino acid composition by calculating the concentration of positively and negatively charged groups from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (see Chapter 4). However, hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds between amino acid side chains in the protein, which can alter $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ values, make this calculation unrealistic.

## III. Variations in Primary Structure

The primary structure of a protein is its linear sequence of amino acids. Although almost every amino acid in the primary structure of a protein contributes to its conformation (three-dimensional structure), the primary structure of a protein can vary to some degree between species. Even within the human species, the amino acid sequence of a normal functional protein can vary somewhat among individuals, tissues of the same individual, and the stage of development. These variations in the primary structure of a functional protein are tolerated if they are confined to noncritical regions (called variant regions), if they are conservative substitutions (replace one amino acid with one of similar structure), or if they confer an advantage. If many different amino acid residues are tolerated at a position, the region is called hypervariable. In contrast, the regions that form binding sites or are critical for forming a functional three-dimensional structure are usually invariant regions that have exactly the same amino acid sequence from individual to individual, tissue to tissue, or species to species.

## A. Polymorphism in Protein Structure

Within the human population, the primary structure of a protein may vary slightly among individuals. The variations generally arise from mutations in DNA that are passed to the next generation. The mutations can result from the substitution of one base for another in the DNA sequence of nucleotides (a point mutation), from deletion or insertions of bases into DNA, or from larger changes (see Chapter 14). For many alleles, the variation has a distinct phenotypic consequence that contributes to our individual characteristics, produces an obvious dysfunction (a congenital or inherited disease), or increases susceptibility to certain diseases. A defective protein may differ from the most common allele by as little as a single amino acid that is a nonconservative substitution (replacement of one amino acid with another of a different polarity or very different size) in an invariant region. Such mutations might affect the ability of the protein to carry out its function, catalyze a particular reaction, reach the appropriate site in a cell, or be degraded. For other proteins, the variations appear to have no significance.

Variants of an allele that occur with a significant frequency in the population are referred to as polymorphisms. Thus far in studies of the human genome, almost one-third of the genetic loci appear to be polymorphic. When a particular variation of an allele, or polymorphism, increases in the general population to a frequency of $>1 \%$, it is considered stable. The sickle cell allele is an example of a point mutation that is stable in the human population. Its persistence is probably the result of selective pressure for the heterozygous mutant phenotype, which confers some protection against malaria.

## B. Protein Families and Superfamilies

A homologous family of proteins is composed of proteins related to the same ancestral protein. Groups of proteins with similar, but not identical, structure and function that have evolved from the same gene after the gene was duplicated are called paralogs and are considered members of the same protein family. Once a gene has duplicated, one gene can continue to perform the original function, and the second copy can mutate into a protein with another function or another type of regulation. This process is called divergent evolution. Very large families of homologous proteins are called a superfamily, which is subdivided by name into families of proteins with the most similarity in structure.

The paralogs of a protein family are considered to be different proteins and have different names because they have different functions. They are all present in the same individual. Myoglobin and the different chains of hemoglobin, for example, are paralogs and members of the same globin family that have similar, but not identical, structures and functions. Myoglobin, an intracellular heme protein present in most cells that stores and transports $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to mitochondria, is a single polypeptide chain containing one heme oxygen-binding site. In contrast, hemoglobin is composed of four globin chains, each with a heme oxygen-binding site that is present in red blood cells; hemoglobin transports $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the lungs to tissues. The gene for myoglobin is assumed to have evolved from gene duplication of the $\alpha$-chain for hemoglobin, which evolved from duplication of the $\beta$-chain. Figure 6.10 compares a region of the structure of myoglobin and the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains of hemoglobin. Among these three proteins, only 15 invariant (identical) residues are present, but many of the other amino acid residues are conservative substitutions.

## C. Tissue and Developmental Variations in Protein Structure

Within the same individual, different isoforms or isozymes of a protein may be synthesized during different stages of fetal and embryonic development, may be present in different tissues, or may reside in different intracellular locations. Isoforms of a protein all have the same function. If they are isozymes (isoforms of enzymes), they catalyze the same reactions. However, isoforms have somewhat different properties and amino acid structure.

The substitution of a glutamate for a valine is a nonconservative replacement because a negatively charged amino acid is substituted for a hydrophobic branched-chain aliphatic amino acid. However, the substitution of an aspartate for a glutamate is a conservative replacement because the two amino acids have the same polarity and are nearly the same size.

Will S.'s hemoglobin, HbS , is composed of two normal $\alpha$-chains and two $\beta$-globin chains with the sickle cell variant $\left(\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}{ }^{S}\right)$. The change in amino acid composition from a glutamate to a valine in the $\beta$-chain allows sickle hemoglobin to be separated from normal adult hemoglobin (HbA, or $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}{ }^{S}$ ) by electrophoresis. In electrophoresis, an aliquot of blood or other solution containing proteins is applied to a support, such as paper or a gel. An electrical field is applied and the proteins migrate a distance toward the anode (negative pole) or cathode (positive pole) depending on their net charge. Because $\beta^{S}$ contains one less negative charge than $\beta^{A}$, it will migrate differently in an electric field. Individuals with sickle cell trait are heterozygous and express both HbA and HbS, plus small amounts of HbF (fetal hemoglobin, $\alpha_{1} \gamma_{2}$ ).

In heterozygous individuals with sickle cell trait, the sickle cell allele provides some protection against malaria. Malaria is caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which spends part of its life cycle in red blood cells. The infected red blood cells of individuals with normal hemoglobin (HbA) develop protrusions that attach to the lining of capillaries. This attachment occludes the vessels and prevents oxygen from reaching cells in the affected region, resulting in cell death. In heterozygous individuals, HbS in infected cells aggregates into long fibers that cause the cell to become distorted. These distorted cells containing the malarial parasite are preferentially recognized by the spleen and are rapidly destroyed, thus ending the life of the parasite.

- Will S. and other homozygous individuals with sickle cell anemia, the red blood cells sickle more frequently than in heterozygotes, especially under conditions of low oxygen tension (see Chapter 7). The result is a vaso-occlusive crisis in which the sickled cells clog capillaries and prevent oxygen from reaching cells (ischemia), thereby causing pain. The enhanced destruction of the sickled cells by the spleen results in anemia. Consequently, the sickle cell allele is of little advantage to homozygous individuals.

Because heterozygous individuals occur more frequently in a population than homozygous individuals, a selective advantage in a heterozygous state can outweigh a disadvantage in a homozygous state, causing the mutation to become a stable polymorphism in a population. As a consequence, the frequency of sickle cell anemia in parts of equatorial Africa in which malaria was endemic in the past is I in 25 births. Migration from Africa accounts for the high frequency of sickle cell anemia among African Americans in the United States, which is approximately $1 / 400$ at birth.

FIGURE 6.10 The primary structures of a region in human globin proteins. To compare the primary structure of two homologous polypeptide chains, the sequences are written left to right from the amino terminal to the carboxyl terminal. The sequences are aligned with computer programs that maximize the identity of amino acids and minimize the differences caused by segments that are present in one protein and not in the other. Gaps in the structure, indicated with dashes, are introduced to maximize the alignment between proteins in structure comparisons. They are assumed to coincide with mutations that caused a deletion. Regions of sequence similarity (identity and conservative substitution) are indicated by colored bars. Within these regions are smaller regions of invariant residues that are exactly the same from protein to protein. Myoglobin is a single polypeptide chain. The $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains are part of hemoglobin $A\left(\alpha_{3} \beta_{3}\right)$. The $\zeta$-chain is part of embryonic hemoglobin $\left(\zeta_{3} \varepsilon_{3}\right)$. The $\gamma$-chain is part of fetal hemoglobin $(\mathrm{HbF}), \alpha_{3} \gamma_{3}$.

## I. Developmental Variation

Hemoglobin isoforms provide an example of variation during development. Hemoglobin $(\mathrm{Hb})$ is expressed as the fetal isozyme HbF during the last trimester of pregnancy until after birth, when it is replaced with HbA . HbF is composed of two hemoglobin $\alpha$ and two hemoglobin $\gamma$ polypeptide chains, in contrast to the adult hemoglobin, HbA , which has two $\alpha$ - and two $\beta$-chains. During the embryonic stages of development, chains with a different amino acid composition, the embryonic $\varepsilon$ - and $\zeta$-chains, are produced (see Fig. 6.10). These differences are believed to arise evolutionarily from mutation of a duplicated $\alpha$ gene to produce $\zeta$, and mutation of a duplicate $\alpha$ gene to produce $\varepsilon$. The fetal and embryonic forms of hemoglobin have a much higher affinity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ than the adult forms and thus confer an advantage at the low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ tensions to which the fetus is exposed. At different stages of development, the globin genes specific for that stage are expressed and translated. (This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 42, Section V.)

## 2. Tissue-Specific Isoforms

Proteins that differ somewhat in primary structure and properties from tissue to tissue, but that retain essentially the same function, are called tissue-specific isoforms or isozymes. The enzyme creatine kinase (CK) is an example of a protein that exists as tissue-specific isozymes, each composed of two subunits with $60 \%$ to $72 \%$ sequence homology (similarity between sequences). Of the two CKs that bind to the muscle sarcomere, the M form is produced in skeletal muscle and the B polypeptide chains are produced in the brain. The protein is composed of two subunits; therefore, skeletal muscle produces an MM creatine kinase and the brain produces a BB form. The heart produces both types of chains and thus forms a heterodimer, MB, as well as the homodimers. Two more CK isozymes are found in mitochondria-a heart mitochondrial CK and the "universal" isoform found in other tissues. In general, most proteins that are present in both the mitochondria and cytosol will be present as different isoforms. The advantage conferred on different tissues by having their own isoform of CK is unknown. However, tissue-specific isozymes such as MB creatine kinase are useful in diagnosing sites of tissue injury and cell death.

The structure of proteins involved in the response to hormones has been studied in greater depth than many other types of proteins, and most of these proteins are present as several tissue-specific isoforms that help different tissues respond

![ma6450024193](ma6450024193.jpg)

FIGURE 6.II Invariant regions in the isoforms of adenylyl cyclase. The invariant regions are on the cytosolic side of the membrane in the $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{2}$ loops shown in red. These amino acid residues participate in the catalytic function of the enzyme, synthesis of $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-cyclic adenosine monophosphate. The protein also has several helical regions that span the membrane ( $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ helices), represented as tubes. An oligosaccharide chain is attached to an extracellular domain. $N$ is the amino terminus. (From Taussig R, Gilman AG. Mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases.J Biol Chem. 1995;270:1-4.)
differently to the same hormone. One of these proteins present in cell membranes is adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of intracellular $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (Fig. 6.11). In human tissues, at least nine different isoforms of adenylyl cyclase are coded by different genes in different tissues. Although they have an overall sequence homology of $50 \%$, the two intracellular regions involved in the synthesis of cAMP are an invariant consensus sequence with a $93 \%$ identity. The different isoforms help cells respond differently to the same hormone.

## D. Species Variations in the Primary Structure of Insulin

Species variations in primary structure are also important in medicine, as illustrated by the comparison of human, beef, and pork insulins. Insulin is one of the hormones that are highly conserved between species, with very few amino acid substitutions and none in the regions that affect activity. Insulin is a polypeptide hormone of 51 amino acids that is composed of two polypeptide chains (Fig. 6.12). It is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain but is cleaved in three places before secretion to form the C peptide and the active insulin molecule containing the A and B chains. The folding of the A and B chains into the correct three-dimensional structure is promoted by the presence of one intrachain and two interchain disulfide bonds formed by cysteine residues. The invariant residues consist of the cysteine residues engaged in disulfide bonds and the residues that form the surface of the insulin molecule that binds to the insulin receptor. The amino acid substitutions in bovine and porcine insulins (shown in red in Fig. 6.12) are not in amino acids that affect its activity. Consequently, insulins from beef and pork were used for many years for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. However, even with only a few different amino acids, some patients developed an immune response to these forms of insulin.

## IV. Modified Amino Acids

After synthesis of a protein has been completed, a few amino acid residues in the primary sequence may be further modified in enzyme-catalyzed reactions that add a chemical group, oxidize, or otherwise modify specific amino acids in the protein. Because protein synthesis occurs by a process known as translation, these changes

0A myocardial infarction (heart attack) is caused by an atheromatous obstruction and/or a severe spasm in a coronary artery that prevents the flow of blood to an area of heart muscle distal to the obstruction. Thus, heart cells in this region suffer from a lack of oxygen and blood-borne fuel. Because the cells cannot generate ATP, the membranes become damaged, and enzymes leak from the cells into the blood.

The blood test of choice to determine whether cell damage has occurred is the cTnT level. Creatine kinase (see next paragraph) was originally used for this determination, but the introduction of very sensitive assays for troponin led to the recommendation of using cTnT measurements to follow the course of heart damage.

Creatine kinase (CK or CPK) assays are still performed at some hospitals. The protein is composed of two subunits, which may be either of the muscle (M) or the brain (B) type. The MB form, containing one $M$ and one $B$ subunit, is found primarily in cardiac muscle. It can be separated electrophoretically from other CK isozymes and the amount in the blood used to determine whether a myocardial infarction has occurred. On admission to the hospital, Anne J's total CK was 182 U/L (reference range $=38$ to 174 U/L).

0Although bovine (beef) insulin is identical to human insulin in those amino acid residues essential for activity, the amino acid residues that are in the variable regions can act as antigens and stimulate the formation of antibodies against bovine insulin. Consequently, recombinant DNA techniques have been used for the synthesis of human insulins, such as Humulin (intermediate acting) or Humalog (rapid acting, also known as lispro) (see Chapter 17 for information on recombinant DNA technology.) There are no longer animalsourced insulins manufactured in the United States.

![ma6550024193](ma6550024193.jpg)

FIGURE 6.12 The primary structure of human insulin. The substituted amino acids in bovine (beef) and porcine (pork) insulin are shown in red. Threonine 30 at the carboxyl terminal of the $B$ chain is replaced by alanine in both beef and pork insulin. In beef insulin, threonine 8 on the A chain is also replaced with alanine, and isoleucine 10 with valine. The cysteine residues, which form the disulfide bonds (shown in blue) holding the chains together, are invariant. In the bioengineered insulin Humalog (lispro insulin), the positions of proline at B28 and lysine at B29 are switched. Insulin is synthesized as a longer precursor molecule, proinsulin, which is one polypeptide chain. Proinsulin is converted to insulin by proteolytic cleavage of certain peptide bonds (wavy lines in the figure). The cleavage removes a few amino acids and the 31 -amino acid C-peptide that connects the $A$ and $B$ chains. The active insulin molecule thus has two nonidentical chains.
are called posttranslational modification. More than 100 different posttranslationally modified amino acid residues have been found in human proteins. These modifications change the structure of one or more specific amino acids on a protein in a way that may serve a regulatory function, target or anchor the protein in membranes, enhance a protein's association with other proteins, or target it for degradation (Fig. 6.13). Posttranslational modifications usually occur once the protein has already folded into its three-dimensional conformation.

# A. Glycosylation 

Glycosylation refers to the addition of carbohydrates to a molecule. In $O$-glycosylation, oligosaccharides (small carbohydrate chains) are bound to serine or threonine residues in proteins by $O$-linkages. In $N$-glycosylation, the carbohydrates are bound by $N$-linkage to the amide nitrogen of asparagine (see Fig. 6.13). $N$-Linked oligosaccharides are found attached to cell surface proteins, where they protect the cell from proteolysis or an immune attack. In contrast, an $O$-glycosidic link is a common way of attaching oligosaccharides to the serine or threonine hydroxyl groups in secreted proteins. The intracellular polysaccharide glycogen is attached to a protein through an $O$-glycosidic linkage to a tyrosine. Adenylyl cyclase is an example of an enzyme that is posttranslationally modified (see Fig. 6.11). It has an oligosaccharide chain attached to the external portion of the protein.

## B. Fatty Acylation or Prenylation

The addition of lipids to a molecule is called fatty acylation. Many membrane proteins contain a covalently attached lipid group that interacts hydrophobically with lipids in the membrane. Palmitoyl groups (C16) often are attached to plasma membrane proteins, and the myristoyl group (C14) often is attached to proteins in the lipid membranes of intracellular vesicles (myristoylation; see Fig. 6.13). Prenylation involves the addition of the farnesyl group (C15) or geranylgeranyl groups (C20), which are synthesized from the five-carbon isoprene unit (isopentenyl pyrophosphate; see Fig. 5.1A). These are attached in thioether linkage to a specific cysteine residue of certain membrane proteins, particularly proteins involved in regulation.

FIGURE 6.13 Posttranslational modifications of amino acids in proteins. Some of the common amino acid modifications and the sites of attachment are illustrated. The added group is shown in red. Because these modifications are catalyzed by enzymes, only a specific amino acid in the primary sequence is altered. $R-O-$ represents additional carbohydrates attached to the first carbohydrate. In N -glycosylation, the attached sugar is usually N -acetylglucosamine ( $N$-Ac).

Several pathogenic bacteria produce bacterial toxins that are ADP-ribosyl transferases (NAD ${ }^{+}$-glycohydrolases). These enzymes hydrolyze the N -glycosidic bond of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ and transfer the ADP-ribose portion to a specific amino acid residue on a protein in the affected human cell. Cholera AB toxin, a pertussis toxin, and a diphtheria toxin are all ADP-ribosyl transferases.

## C. Regulatory Modifications

Phosphorylation, acetylation, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation of specific amino acid residues in a polypeptide can alter bonding by that residue and change the activity of the protein (see Fig. 6.13). Phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group on serine, threonine, or tyrosine by a protein kinase (an enzyme that transfers a phosphate group from ATP to a protein) introduces a large, bulky, negatively charged group that can alter the structure and activity of a protein. Some of the isozymes of adenylyl cyclase contain serine residues on the intracellular portion of the protein that can be phosphorylated by a protein kinase. Reversible acetylation occurring on lysine residues of histone proteins in chromatin changes their interaction with the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA. ADP-ribosylation is the transfer of an ADP-ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$to an arginine, glutamine, or cysteine residue on a target protein in the membrane (primarily in leukocytes, skeletal muscles, brain, and testes). This modification may regulate the activity of these proteins.

## D. Other Amino Acid Posttranslational Modifications

Several other posttranslational modifications of amino acid side chains alter the activity of the protein in the cell (see Fig 6.13). Carboxylation of the $\gamma$-carbon of glutamate (carbon 4) in certain blood-clotting proteins is important for attaching the clot to a surface. Calcium ions mediate this attachment by binding to the two negatively charged carboxyl groups of $\gamma$-glutamate and two additional negatively charged groups provided by phospholipids in the cell membrane. Collagen, an abundant fibrous extracellular protein, contains the oxidized amino acid hydroxyproline. The addition of the hydroxyl group (hydroxylation) to the proline side chain provides an extra polar group that can engage in hydrogen bonding between the polypeptide strands of the fibrous protein and stabilize its structure.

## E. Selenocysteine

The unusual amino acid selenocysteine is found in a few enzymes and is required for their activity (Fig. 6.14). Its synthesis is not a posttranslational modification, however, but a modification to serine that occurs while serine is bound to a unique tRNA (transfer RNA; see Chapter 15). A selenium atom replaces the hydroxyl group of serine. The selenocysteine is then inserted into the protein as it is being synthesized.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

![ma7850024193](ma7850024193.jpg)

Will S. Will S. was treated for 3 days with parenteral (not by mouth/ digestion) narcotics, intravenous hydration, and nasal inhalation of oxygen for his vaso-occlusive crisis. The diffuse severe pains of sickle cell crises result from occlusion of small vessels in a variety of tissues, thereby causing damage to cells from ischemia (low blood flow) or hypoxia (low levels of oxygen). Vaso-occlusion occurs when sickle hemoglobin ( HbS ) molecules in red blood cells polymerize in the lumen of capillaries, where the partial pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{pO}_{2}\right)$ is low. This polymerization causes the red blood cells to change from a biconcave disc to a sickle shape that cannot deform to pass through the narrow capillary lumen. The cells aggregate in the capillaries and occlude blood flow. In addition, once he recovered from his sickle cell crisis, Will was treated with hydroxyurea therapy, which increases the production of red blood cells containing HbF . HbF molecules cannot participate in sickling and can decrease the frequency at which sickle crises occur.

Will's acute symptoms gradually subsided. Patients with sickle cell anemia periodically experience sickle cell crises, and Will's physician urged him to seek medical help whenever symptoms reappeared. He also counseled him to try to avoid triggers of sickle cell crisis: overexertion, dehydration, extremely cold weather, and exposure to tobacco.

David K. David has cystinuria, a relatively rare disorder, with a prevalence that ranges between 1 in 2,500 and 1 in 15,000 births, depending on the population studied. It is a genetically determined disease with a complex recessive mode of inheritance resulting from allelic mutations. These mutations lead to a reduction in the activity of renal tubular cell transport proteins that normally carry cystine from the tubular lumen into the renal tubular cells. The transport of the basic amino acids (lysine, arginine, and ornithine, an amino acid found in the urea cycle but not in proteins) also is often compromised, and they appear in the urine.

Because cystine is produced by oxidation of cysteine, conservative treatment of cystinuria includes decreasing the amount of cysteine within the body and, therefore, the amount of cystine eventually filtered by the kidneys. Reduction of cysteine levels is accomplished by restricting dietary methionine, which contributes its sulfur to the pathway for cysteine formation. To increase the amount of cystine that remains in solution, the volume of fluid ingested daily is increased. Crystallization of cystine is further prevented by chronically alkalinizing the urine. Finally, drugs may be administered to enhance the conversion of urinary cystine to more soluble compounds. If these conservative measures fail to prevent continued cystine stone formation, existing stones may be removed by a surgical technique that involves sonic fracture of the stones. The fragmented stones may then pass spontaneously or may be more easily extracted surgically because of their smaller size.

Dianne A. Dianne A.'s treatment was initially changed from beef insulin to Humulin (synthetic human insulin; Lilly USA, LLC, Indianapolis, IN). Humulin is mass-produced by recombinant DNA techniques that insert the human DNA sequences for the insulin A and B chains into the Escherichia coli or yeast genome (see Chapter 17). The insulin chains that are produced are then extracted from the media and treated to form the appropriate disulfide bonds between the chains. As costs have fallen for production of the synthetic human insulins, they have replaced pork insulin and the highly antigenic beef insulin.

Dianne's physician then recommended that she take Humalog (Lilly USA, LLC), an insulin preparation containing lispro, an ultrafast-acting bioengineered insulin analog in which lysine at position B29 has been moved to B28 and proline at B28 has been moved to B29 (hence, lispro) (see Fig. 6.12). With lispro, Dianne will be able to time her injections of this rapidly acting insulin minutes before her consumption of carbohydrate-containing meals rather than having to remember to give herself an insulin injection 1 hour before a meal. Dianne will also take a longacting insulin shot once a day (Lantus; Sanofi US, Bridgewater, NJ), along with her Humalog shots prior to meals each day.

Anne J. Mrs. J. continued to be monitored in the cardiac care unit. The physicians followed the trends of TnT in her blood. Historically, physicians would also follow the total CK and CK-MB levels. Within 2 hours of the onset of an acute myocardial infarction, the MB form of CK begins leaking from heart cells that were injured by the ischemic process. These rising serum levels of the MB fraction (and, therefore, of the total CK) reach their peak 12 to 36 hours later and usually return to normal within 3 to 5 days from the onset of the infarction (Fig. 6.15).

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

Nucleic Acid, Enzyme, and Protein Databases. Large databases of nucleic acid sequences and protein structure have been assembled to collate data from various laboratories around the world. The National Library of Medicine maintains a Web site, PubMed, which catalogs the medical literature, and a search engine allows you to search for reference articles by topic or author (www.ncbi.nlm .nih.gov/pubmed). From the menu, you can enter a nucleic acid, protein, or a structure

FIGURE 6.15 Electrophoretic separation of serum creatine kinase (CK) enzymes from a normal healthy adult and from a patient who had a myocardial infarction 24 hours previously. CK catalyzes the reversible transfer of a phosphate from ATP to creatine to form phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate. The reaction is an important part of energy metabolism in heart muscle, skeletal muscle, and brain. Three different forms of the dimer exist: BB (or CK-1) found in brain, MB (or CK-2) found only in heart (indicated in red), and MM (or CK-3), found only in skeletal and heart muscle. - ve, cathode; + ve, anode.

The switch in position of amino acids in Ispro does not affect the action of this synthetic insulin on cells because it is not in a critical invariant region, but it does affect the ability of insulin to bind zinc. Normally, human insulin is secreted from the pancreas as a zinc hexamer in which six insulin molecules are bound to the zinc atom. When zinc insulin is injected, the binding to zinc slows the absorption from the subcutaneous (under the skin) injection site. Lispro cannot bind zinc to form a hexamer, and thus, it is absorbed much more quickly than other forms of insulin.
database directly. These databases are linked, so you can type in the name of a protein, such as human hemoglobin chain $A$, obtain a list of contributors to sequence data, and retrieve a complete amino acid sequence for many proteins. You can link to PubMed to find recent articles about the protein, or you can link to the structure database. A program called Cn3D can be downloaded from this site that allows you to view threedimensional versions of the protein structures.

These databases are only a few of more than 500 biologic databases that have been assembled to collate and exchange biologic information in the areas of DNA, RNA, genomics, gene mapping, and protein structure. The first issue of the Journal of Nucleic Acid Research each year provides a description of currently available biologic databases. Their goal is to provide information that can relate a particular DNA sequence or mutation to the protein involved, to its function, and to the pathologic consequences of a particular amino acid substitution by comparing proteins that have similar functional elements.

Two of the very useful databases accessible to scientists are GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and the RCSB (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics) protein data bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do). GenBank is a nucleic acid sequence database, which is linked to the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) database. The three databases exchange information every day, so all are current. GenBank allows for submission of new sequences as well as searches for existing sequences. One can also perform a BLAST search (Basic Logical Alignment Search Tool) to compare a nucleic acid sequence of unknown origin with those in the database to detect comparable sequences in existing genes and to garner an understanding of what the gene from which the unknown sequence was obtained may do.

The RCSB protein data bank allows one to search for proteins, to examine the amino acid sequence of the protein (and the nucleic acid sequence which led to the protein sequence; see Section III of this text), and to visualize the protein's structure in a three-dimensional format. One can also search the database with an amino acid sequence from a protein with no known function to determine if other proteins contain similar sequences, which will give clues as to the function of the unknown protein.

The field of bioinformatics is developing new tools for scientists to appropriately mine the large amount of data becoming available through nucleic acid and protein structure databases. Will these databases be of any use to the practicing physician or to the practice-oriented medical student? Very few students will ever want to do protein modeling. However, students and physicians may wish to use the literature search in PubMed as part of their approach to evidence-based medicine. They also may wish to use it to track definitions or fundamental knowledge about particular topics. Thus, biomedical and basic science textbooks are also being linked to PubMed.

## KEY CONCEPTS

- A protein's unique characteristics, including its three-dimensional folded structure, are dictated by its linear sequence of amino acids, termed its primary structure.
- The primary structures of all of the diverse human proteins are synthesized from 20 amino acids arranged in a linear sequence determined by the genetic code.
- Each three-base (nucleotide) sequence within the coding region of a gene (the genetic code) specifies which amino acid should be present in a protein. The genetic code is discussed further in Chapter 12.
- All amino acids contain a central $\alpha$-carbon joined to a carboxylic acid group, an amino group, a hydrogen, and a side chain, which varies among the 20 different amino acids.
- At physiologic pH , the amino acids are zwitterions; the amino group is positively charged, and the carboxylate is negatively charged.

- In proteins, amino acids are joined into linear polymers called polypeptide chains via peptide bonds, which are formed between the carboxylic acid of one amino acid and the amino group of the next amino acid.
- Amino acid side chains can be classified either by polarity (charged, nonpolar hydrophobic, or uncharged polar) or structural features (aliphatic, cyclic, or aromatic).
- Depending on their side-chain characteristics, certain amino acids cluster together to exclude water (hydrophobic effect), whereas others participate in hydrogen bonding. Cysteine can form disulfide bonds, whereas charged amino acids can form ionic bonds.
- Amino acids in proteins can be modified by phosphorylation, carboxylation, or other reactions after the protein is synthesized (posttranslational modifications).
- Alterations in the genetic code may lead to mutations in the protein's primary structure, which can affect the protein's function.
- Proteins with the same function but different primary structures (isoforms and isozymes) can exist in different tissues or during different phases of development.
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 6.2.

# REVIEW QUESTIONS-CHAPTER 6 

I. Sickle cell anemia is caused by a single nucleotide change in DNA that leads to the substitution of one amino acid ( E 6 V ) in the $\beta$-chain.

B. Methionine
C. Arginine
D. Lysine
E. Histidine

1. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. In the sickle version of hemoglobin, a valine has replaced a glutamate in the sixth position of the $\beta$-chain. In the deoxygenated state, the valine forms hydrophobic interactions with a hydrophobic patch on another sickle hemoglobin molecule, leading to polymerization of the hemoglobin molecules. The primary interaction is not the result of ionic interactions or hydrogen bonding; it is the hydrophobic interactions between molecules that initiate the polymerization. The peptide backbone, along with peptide bonds, can participate in hydrogen bonding but does not play a role in polymerization.
2. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Cysteine and methionine are the sulfur-containing amino acids. Isoleucine and alanine are both nonpolar hydrophobic amino acids, and neither contains sulfur.
3. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. Arginine is a basic amino acid that has a positively charged side chain at neutral pH . It can, therefore, form tight electrostatic bonds with negatively charged asp and glu side chains in insulin. The $\alpha$-carboxylic acid groups at the $N$-terminals of proteins are bound through peptide bonds (thus, B is incorrect). The arginine side chain is not hydrophobic, and it cannot form disulfide bonds because it has no sulfhydryl group (thus, C and D are incorrect). Its basic group is a ureido group that cannot form peptide bonds (see E).
4. The answer is B. Only these amino acids-serine, threonine, and tyrosine-have side-chain hydroxyl groups. As a general rule, serine-threonine protein kinases form one group of protein kinases, and tyrosine protein kinases form another.
5. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. Adding a phosphate group to the serine side chain adds negative charges to the side chain, allowing ionic interactions to develop. These new ionic interactions allow the protein to change shape and to alter its activity. Substituting a glutamate for the serine adds a negative charge to this location within the protein, which may participate in ionic interactions and lead to a shape change in the protein. None of the other suggested mutations (serine to either threonine [which adds a hydroxyl group, just as serine has], to tyrosine [again, another hydroxyl containing amino acid sidechain], to lysine [adding a positive charge rather than a negative charge], or to leucine [a totally hydrophobic
side chain]) will lead to the insertion of negative charges at this location in the protein.
6. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The hydropathic index is a scale that denotes the hydrophobicity of the side chains. The more positive the hydropathic index, the greater the hydrophobicity of the side chain. The $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of the primary carboxylic acid group for all the amino acids is around 2 and the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of the $\alpha$-amino groups of all the amino acids is approximately 9.5 , but these elements of the protein do not contribute to the protein's hydrophobic nature.
7. The answer is B. Proteins that differ somewhat in primary structure from tissue to tissue but retain essentially the same function are called tissue-specific isoforms or isozymes. CK is a classic example of this. Muscle produces the M form, brain the B form, and heart both, leading to an MB form (a heterodimer). Because the protein consists of two subunits, muscle produces CKMM, a homodimer. By measuring specific isozymes of CK one can determine if there is skeletal muscle damage (CK-MM) or heart-specific damage (elevated levels of CK-MB).
8. The answer is D. Each of the amino acids used for protein synthesis has the same general structure. Each contains a carboxylic acid group, an amino group attached to the $\alpha$-carbon, a hydrogen atom, and a side chain. When the $\alpha$-carbon is asymmetric, the configuration about that carbon is in the L-configuration. Glycine is excluded because its side chain is a hydrogen atom, and there is no asymmetric carbon atom in glycine.
9. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. The patient described has cystinuria, an inherited amino acid substitution in the transport protein that reabsorbs cysteine, arginine, and lysine from the glomerular filtrate. Therefore, these amino acids cannot be returned to the blood and the urine contains large amounts of these amino acids.
10. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. Cysteine will be oxidized to form cystine (a dimer of cysteine linked by a disulfide bond). Cystine is less soluble than the other amino acids indicated as answers and precipitates in the kidney, forming renal stones (kidney stones or calculi). Cystine also is found in the urine in elevated amounts, leading to cystinuria.

4Diseases can be caused by changes in protein structure that affect the protein's ability to bind other molecules and carry out its function. They also can be caused by conformational changes in proteins that affect their solubility and degradability. In amyloidosis/ AL, immunoglobulin chains form an insoluble protein aggregate called amyloid in organs and tissues. Alzheimer disease and familial amyloid polyneuropathy are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the deposition of amyloid. Prion diseases result from misfolding and aggregation of a normal cellular protein. Even in sickle cell anemia, the mutation in hemoglobin principally affects the quaternary structure of hemoglobin and its solubility and not its ability to bind oxygen.

# Structure-Function Relationships in Proteins 

A multitude of different proteins can be formed from only 20 common amino acids because these amino acids can be linked together in an enormous variety of sequences determined by the genetic code. The sequence of amino acids, its primary structure, determines the way a protein folds into a unique three-dimensional structure, which is its native conformation. Once it is folded, the three-dimensional structure of a protein forms binding sites for other molecules, thereby dictating the function of the protein in the body. In addition to creating binding sites, a protein must fold in such a way that it is flexible, stable, able to function in the correct site in the cell, and capable of being degraded by cellular enzymes.

Levels of Protein Structure. Protein structure is described in terms of four different levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary (Fig. 7.1). The primary structure of a protein is the linear sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. Secondary structure consists of local regions of polypeptide chains formed into structures that are stabilized by a repeating pattern of hydrogen bonds, such as the regular structures called $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets. The rigidity of the peptide backbone determines the types of secondary structure that can occur. The tertiary structure involves folding of the secondary structural elements into an overall threedimensional conformation. In globular proteins such as myoglobin, the tertiary structure generally forms a densely packed hydrophobic core with polar amino acid side chains on the outside. Some proteins exhibit quaternary structure, the combination of two or more subunits, each composed of a polypeptide chain.

Domains and Folds. The tertiary structure of a globular protein can be made up of structural domains, regions of structure that fold independently. Multiple domains can be linked together to form a functional protein. Within a domain, a combination of secondary structural elements forms a fold, such as the nucleotide binding fold or an actin fold. Folds are defined by their similarity in several different proteins.
![ma8150024193](ma8150024193.jpg)

FIGURE 7.I Levels of structure in a protein.

Quaternary Structure. Assembly of globular polypeptide subunits into a multisubunit complex can provide the opportunity for cooperative binding of ligands (e.g., $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binding to hemoglobin), form binding sites for complex molecules (e.g., antigen binding to immunoglobulin), and increase stability of the protein. The polypeptide chains of fibrous proteins such as collagen are aligned along an axis, have repeating elements, and are extensively linked to each other through hydrogen and covalent bonds.

Ligand Binding. Proteins form binding sites for specific molecules, called ligands (e.g., adenosine triphosphate [ATP] or $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ), or for another protein. The affinity of a binding site for its ligand is characterized quantitatively by an association or affinity constant, $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ (or its dissociation constant $\left[K_{\mathrm{d}}\right]$, in which $K_{\mathrm{d}}=1 / K_{\mathrm{a}}$ ).

Folding of Proteins. The primary structure of a protein dictates the way that it folds into its tertiary structure, which is a stable conformation that is identical to the shape of other molecules of the same protein (i.e., its native conformation). Chaperonins act as templates to overcome the kinetic and thermodynamic barrier to reaching a stable conformation. Prion proteins cause neurodegenerative diseases by acting as a template for misfolding. Heat, acid, and other agents cause proteins to denature; that is, to unfold or refold and lose their native three-dimensional conformation.

# THE WAITING ROOM 

Will S., who has sickle cell anemia, was readmitted to the hospital with symptoms indicating that he was experiencing another sickle cell crisis (see Chapter 6). Sickle cell disease is a result of improper aggregation of hemoglobin within red blood cells.

Anne J. is a 54-year-old woman who arrived in the hospital 4 days ago, about 5 hours after she began to feel chest pain (see Chapter 6). In the emergency department, the physician drew blood for the measurement of cardiac troponin T subunit (cTnT), and the muscle-brain fraction (CK-MB) of creatine kinase. The results from these tests had supported the diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction (MI), and Mrs. J. was hospitalized. Subtle differences in the structure of similar proteins in different tissues were used diagnostically to come to this conclusion.

Amy L. is a 62-year-old woman who presented with weakness, fatigue, an enlarged tongue (macroglossia), and edema. She had signs and symptoms of cardiac failure, including electrocardiographic abnormalities. Initial laboratory studies showed a serum creatinine of $1.9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (reference range [females] $=$ 0.5 to $1.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), indicating mild renal failure. A urinalysis indicated the presence of a moderate proteinuria. She was subsequently diagnosed with amyloidosis/AL secondary to a plasma cell dyscrasia. Amyloidosis is a term that encompasses many diseases that share as a common feature the extracellular deposition of pathologic insoluble fibrillar proteins called amyloid in organs and tissues. In Amy L.'s disease, amyloidosis/AL, the amyloid is derived from immunoglobulin light chains (AL-5 amyloidosis, light-chain-related) and is the most common form of amyloidosis.

Dianne A. returned to her physician's office for a routine visit to monitor her treatment (see Chapters 4, 5, and 6). Her physician drew blood for an HbAlc (pronounced "hemoglobin A-1-c") determination. Her HbAlc was $8.5 \%$, which was above the normal level of $<6.0 \%$ for a person without diabetes, and $<7.0 \%$ for a person with controlled diabetes.

## I. General Characteristics of Three-Dimensional Structure

The overall conformation of a protein, the particular position of the amino acid side chains in three-dimensional space, determines the function of the protein.

The simplest test to detect protein in the urine is the use of specific reagent test strips. The strips are coated with tetrabromophenol blue, buffered at pH 3.0 . In the presence of protein, the indicator dye is no longer as responsive to changes in pH as in the absence of protein. A yellow color indicates that protein is not detectable; as protein levels increase, the yellow color changes, going to green and then bluish-green. This is a useful qualitative test (which detects primarily serum albumin), but to be more quantitative, different dyes, which react specifically with particular amino acid side chains, are used. Different tests are required to detect the presence of a specific protein in the urine or sera, and these will be discussed in subsequent chapters.

FIGURE 7.2 The peptide backbone. Because of the resonant nature of the peptide bond, the C and N of the peptide bonds form a series of rigid planes. Rotation within allowed torsion angles can occur around the bonds attached to the $\alpha$-carbon. The side chains are trans to each other and alternate above and below the peptide chain. The actual peptide bond is a hybrid between the resonance forms shown, resulting in a partial negative charge on the carbonyl oxygen, a partial positive charge on the nitrogen, and partial double-bond character for the peptide bond itself.

## A. Descriptions of Protein Structure

Proteins are generally grouped into major structural classifications: globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and transmembrane proteins. Globular proteins are usually soluble in aqueous medium and resemble irregular balls. The fibrous proteins are geometrically linear, arranged around a single axis, and have a repeating unit structure. Another general classification, transmembrane proteins, consists of proteins that have one or more regions aligned to cross the lipid membrane (see Fig. 6.11). DNA-binding proteins, although a member of the globular protein family, are sometimes classified separately and are considered in Chapter 16.

The structure of proteins is often described according to levels called primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure (see Fig. 7.1). The primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acid residues joined through peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure refers to recurring structures (e.g., the regular structure of the $\alpha$-helix) that form in short localized regions of the polypeptide chain. The overall three-dimensional conformation of a protein is its tertiary structure, the summation of its secondary structural elements. The quaternary structure is the association of polypeptide subunits in a geometrically specific manner. The forces involved in a protein folding into its final conformation are primarily noncovalent interactions. These interactions include the attraction between positively and negatively charged molecules (ionic interactions), the hydrophobic effect, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals interactions (the nonspecific attraction between closely packed atoms).

## B. Requirements of the Three-Dimensional Structure

The overall three-dimensional structure of a protein must meet certain requirements to enable the protein to function in the cell or extracellular medium of the body. The first requirement is the creation of a binding site that is specific for just one molecule or a group of molecules with similar structural properties. The specific binding sites of a protein usually define its role. The three-dimensional structure must also exhibit the degrees of flexibility and rigidity appropriate to its specific function. Some rigidity is essential for the creation of binding sites and for a stable structure (i.e., a protein that is excessively flexible would have the potential to be dysfunctional). However, flexibility and mobility in structure enables the protein to fold as it is synthesized and to adapt as it binds other proteins and small molecules. The three-dimensional structure must have an external surface that is appropriate for its environment (e.g., cytoplasmic proteins need to keep polar amino acids on the surface to remain soluble in an aqueous environment). In addition, the conformation must also be stable, with little tendency to undergo refolding into a form that cannot fulfill its function or that precipitates in the cell. Finally, the protein must have a structure that can de degraded when it is damaged or no longer needed in the cell.

## II. The Three-Dimensional Structure of the Peptide Backbone

The amino acids in a polypeptide chain are joined sequentially by peptide bonds between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amide group of the next amino acid in the sequence (Fig. 7.2). Usually, the peptide bond assumes a trans configuration in which successive $\alpha$-carbons and their R groups are located on opposite sides of the peptide bond.

The polypeptide backbone can bend in a very restricted way. The peptide bond itself is a hybrid of two resonance structures, one of which has double-bond character, so that the carboxyl and amide groups that form the bond must remain planar (see Fig. 7.2). However, rotation within certain allowed angles (torsion angles) can occur around the bond between the $\alpha$-carbon and the $\alpha$-amino group and around the bond between the $\alpha$-carbon and the carbonyl group. This rotation is subject to steric

constraints that maximize the distance between atoms in the different amino acid side chains and prohibit torsion (rotation) angles that place the side-chain atoms too close to each other. These folding constraints, which depend on the specific amino acids present, limit the secondary and tertiary structures that can be formed from the polypeptide chain.

## III. Secondary Structure

Regions within polypeptide chains form recurring, localized structures known as secondary structures. The two regular secondary structures called the $\alpha$-helix and the $\beta$-sheet contain repeating elements formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms of the peptide bonds. Other regions of the polypeptide chain form nonregular, nonrepetitive secondary structures such as loops and coils.

## A. The $\alpha$-Helix

The $\alpha$-helix is a common secondary structural element of globular proteins, mem-brane-spanning domains, and DNA-binding proteins. It has a rigid, stable conformation that maximizes hydrogen bonding while staying within the allowed rotation angles of the polypeptide backbone. The peptide backbone of the $\alpha$-helix is formed by hydrogen bonds between each carbonyl oxygen atom and the amide hydrogen $(\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{H})$ of an amino acid residue located four residues farther down the chain (Fig. 7.3). Thus, each peptide bond is connected by hydrogen bonds to the peptide bond four amino acid residues ahead of it and four amino acid residues behind it in the amino acid sequence. The core of the helix is tightly packed, thereby maximizing association energies between atoms. The trans side chains of the amino acids project backward and outward from the helix, thereby avoiding steric hindrance with the polypeptide backbone and with each other (Fig. 7.4). The amino acid proline, because of its ring structure, cannot form the necessary bond angles to fit within an $\alpha$-helix. Thus, proline is known as a "helix breaker" and is not found in $\alpha$-helical regions of proteins.

## B. $\beta$-Sheets

$\beta$-Sheets are a second type of regular secondary structure that maximizes hydrogen bonding between the peptide backbones while maintaining the allowed torsion angles. In $\beta$-sheets, the hydrogen bonding usually occurs between regions of separate neighboring polypeptide strands aligned parallel to each other (Fig. 7.5A). Thus, the carbonyl oxygen of one peptide bond is hydrogen-bonded to the amide hydrogen of a peptide bond on an adjacent strand. This pattern contrasts with the $\alpha$-helix, in which the peptide backbone hydrogen bonds are located within the same strand. Optimal hydrogen bonding occurs when the sheet is bent (pleated) to form $\beta$-pleated sheets.

FIGURE 7.4 A view down the axis of an $\alpha$-helix. The side chains $(R)$ jut out from the helix. Steric hindrance occurs if they come within their van der Waals radii of each other, and a stable helix cannot form.

![ma8450024193](ma8450024193.jpg)

FIGURE 7.3 The $\alpha$-helix. Each oxygen atom of a carbonyl group of a peptide bond forms a hydrogen bond (indicated by the black dots) with the hydrogen atom attached to a nitrogen atom in a peptide bond four amino acids further along the chain. The result is a highly compact and rigid structure.

![ma8550024193](ma8550024193.jpg)

FIGURE 7.5 A. A $\beta$-pleated sheet. In this case, the chains are oriented in opposite directions (antiparallel). The large arrows show the direction of the carboxyl terminus. The amino acid side chains $(R)$ in one strand are trans to each other and alternate above and below the plane of the sheet, which can have a hydrophobic face and a polar face that engages in hydrogen bonding. B. Hydrogen bonding pattern with parallel $\beta$-strands.
![ma8650024193](ma8650024193.jpg)

FIGURE 7.6 $\beta$-Turn. The four amino acid residues that form the $\beta$-turn (also called a hairpin loop) are held together by hydrogen bonds, which make this an extremely stable structure. The $\mathrm{C} \alpha$ carbons of the amino acids are numbered in the figure.

The $\beta$-pleated sheet is described as parallel if the polypeptide strands run in the same direction (as defined by their amino and carboxyl terminals) and antiparallel if they run in opposite directions. Antiparallel strands are of ten the same polypeptide chain folded back on itself, with simple hairpin turns or long runs of polypeptide chain connecting the strands. The amino acid side chains of each polypeptide strand alternate between extending above and below the plane of the $\beta$-sheet (see Fig. 7.5). Parallel sheets tend to have hydrophobic residues on both sides of the sheets; antiparallel sheets usually have a hydrophobic side and a hydrophilic side. Frequently, sheets twist in one direction.

The hydrogen-bonding pattern is slightly different depending on whether one examines a parallel or antiparallel $\beta$-sheet (see Fig. 7.5B). In an antiparallel sheet, the atoms involved in hydrogen bonding are directly opposite each other; in a parallel $\beta$-sheet, the atoms involved in the hydrogen bonding are slightly skewed from one another, such that one amino acid is hydrogen-bonded to two others in the opposite strand.

## C. Nonrepetitive Secondary Structures

$\alpha$-Helices and $\beta$-pleated sheets are patterns of regular structure with a repeating element-the ordered formation of hydrogen bonds. In contrast, bends, loops, and turns are nonregular secondary structures that do not have a repeating element of hydrogen bond formation. They are characterized by an abrupt change of direction and are of ten found on the protein surface. For example, $\beta$-turns are short regions that usually involve four successive amino acid residues. They often connect strands of antiparallel $\beta$-sheets (Fig. 7.6). The surface of large globular proteins usually has at least one omega loop: a structure with a neck like the capital Greek letter omega ( $\Omega$ ).

## D. Patterns of Secondary Structure

Figure 7.7 is a three-dimensional drawing of a globular domain in the soluble enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). It illustrates the combination of secondary structural elements to form patterns. This LDH domain is typical of globular proteins, which average approximately $31 \% \alpha$-helical structure and approximately $28 \%$ $\beta$-pleated sheets (with a wide range of variation). The helices of globular domains have an average span of approximately 12 residues, corresponding to approximately three to four helical turns, although many are much longer. The $\beta$-sheets, represented in diagrams by an arrow for each strand, are an average of six residues long and six strands wide ( 2 to 15 strands). Like the $\beta$-sheet in the LDH domain, they generally twist to the right rather than lie flat (see Fig. 7.7). Most globular domains, such as this LDH domain, also contain motifs. Motifs are relatively small arrangements of secondary structure that are recognized in many different proteins. For example, certain of the $\beta$-strands are connected with $\alpha$-helices to form the $\beta \alpha \beta \alpha$ $\beta$ structural motif.

The remaining polypeptide segments connecting the helices and $\beta$-sheets are said to have a coil or loop conformation (see Fig. 7.7). Although some of the connecting segments recognized in many proteins have been given names (like the $\Omega$-loops), other segments such as those in this LDH domain appear disordered or irregular. These nonregular regions, generally called coils, should never be referred to as "random coils." They are neither truly disordered nor random; they are stabilized through specific hydrogen bonds dictated by the primary sequence of the protein and do not vary from one molecule of the protein to another of the same protein.

The nonregular coils, loops, and other segments are usually more flexible than the relatively rigid helices and $\beta$-pleated sheets. They often form hinge regions that allow segments of the polypeptide chain to move as a compound binds or to move as the protein folds around another molecule.

## IV. Tertiary Structure

The tertiary structure of a protein is the pattern of the secondary structural elements folding into a three-dimensional conformation, as shown for the LDH domain in Figure 7.7. The three-dimensional structure is flexible and dynamic, with rapidly fluctuating movement in the exact positions of amino acid side chains and domains. These fluctuating movements take place without unfolding of the protein. They allow ions and water to diffuse through the structure and provide alternative conformations for ligand binding. As illustrated with examples later in this chapter, this three-dimensional structure is designed to serve all aspects of the protein's function. It creates specific and flexible binding sites for ligands (the compounds that bind), illustrated with actin and myoglobin. The tertiary structure also maintains residues on the surface appropriate for the protein's cellular location, polar residues for cytosolic proteins, and hydrophobic residues for transmembrane proteins (illustrated with the $\beta_{2}$-adrenergic receptor). Flexibility is one of the most important features of protein structure. The forces that maintain tertiary structure are hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, van der Waals interactions, the hydrophobic effect, and disulfide bond formation.

## A. Domains in the Tertiary Structure

The tertiary structure of large complex proteins is often described in terms of physically independent regions called structural domains. You can usually identify domains from visual examination of a three-dimensional figure of a protein, such as the three-dimensional figure of G-actin shown in Figure 7.8. Each domain is formed from a continuous sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain that are folded into a three-dimensional structure independently of the rest of the protein, and two

The individual polypeptide strands in the six-stranded $\beta$-sheet are shown with arrows. Different strands are connected by helices and by nonrepetitive structures (turns, coils, and loops). This domain is the nucleotide binding fold. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD ${ }^{+}$) is bound to a site created by the helices (upper left of figure). (Modified from Richardson JS. The anatomy and taxonomy of protein structure. Adv Protein Chem. 1981;34:167.)

$\Theta$A renal biopsy used in the diagnosis of Amy L.'s disease showed amorphous deposits in the glomeruli. When stained with Congo red dye, these deposits appeared red with ordinary light microscopy and exhibited applegreen fluorescence when viewed in polarized light. This staining is characteristic of the amyloid fibril structure, which is composed of repeated $\beta$-sheets aligned orthogonally (perpendicular) to the axis of the fiber.

Several diseases involve deposition of a characteristic amyloid fiber. However, in each of these diseases, the amyloid is derived from a different protein that has changed its conformation (three-dimensional structure) to that of the amyloid repeated $\beta$-sheet structure. Once amyloid deposition begins, it seems to proceed rapidly, as if the fibri itself were promoting formation and deposition of more fibrils (a phenomenon called "seeding"). The different clinical presentations in each of these diseases result from differences in the function of the native protein and the site of amyloid deposition.

FIGURE 7.8 G-actin. ATP binds in the center of the cleft. The two domains that form the cleft are further subdivided into subdomains I through 4.The overall structure is found in many ATP-binding proteins and is called the actin fold. The arrows represent regions of $\beta$-sheet, whereas the coils represent $\alpha$-helical regions of the protein.
domains are connected through a simpler structure such as a loop (e.g., the hinge region of Fig. 7.8). The structural features of each domain can be discussed independently of another domain in the same protein, and the structural features of one domain may not match that of other domains in the same protein.

# B. Folds in Globular Proteins 

Folds are relatively large patterns of three-dimensional structure that have been recognized in many proteins, including proteins from different branches of the phylogenetic tree. A characteristic activity is associated with each fold, such as ATP binding and hydrolysis (the actin fold) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$binding (the nucleotide binding fold). Examples of these folding patterns are discussed in the following sections.

## I. The Actin Fold

In the three-dimensional drawing of G-actin shown in Figure 7.8, all four subdomains contribute to a folding pattern called the actin fold, named for the first protein in which it was described. ATP is bound into the middle of the cleft of the actin fold by amino acid residues contributed by domains on both sides; thus, ATP binding promotes a conformational change that closes the cleft. Once it is bound, ATP is cleaved to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate.

The actin fold is found in proteins as diverse as actin, which polymerizes to form the cytoskeleton, heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70), which uses ATP energy in changing the conformation of other proteins, and hexokinase, which catalyzes phosphorylation of glucose (see Chapter 8 for further discussion of hexokinase). Although these proteins have very little sequence identity, three-dimensional drawings of their actin folds are almost superimposable. The amount of sequence identity they do have is consistent with their membership in the same fold family and establishes that they are all homologs of the same ancestral protein. In all of these

proteins, ATP binding results in large conformational changes that contribute to the function of the protein.

# 2. The Nucleotide Binding Fold 

A fold also can be formed by one domain. In the example of secondary structures provided by LDH (see Fig. 7.7), domain 1 alone forms the nucleotide binding fold. This fold is a binding site for $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$or, in other proteins, molecules with a generally similar structure (e.g., riboflavin). However, many proteins that bind $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$or $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$phosphate $\left(\mathrm{NADP}^{+}\right)$contain a very different fold from a separate fold family. These two different $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$binding folds arise from different ancestral lines and have different structures, but they have similar properties and function. They are believed to be the product of convergent evolution.

## C. The Solubility of Globular Proteins in an Aqueous Environment

Most globular proteins are soluble in the cell. In general, the core of a globular domain has a high content of amino acids with nonpolar side chains (valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and phenylalanine), out of contact with the aqueous medium (the hydrophobic effect). This hydrophobic core is densely packed to maximize attractive van der Waals forces, which exert themselves over short distances. The charged polar amino acid side chains (arginine, histidine, lysine, aspartate, and glutamic acid) are generally located on the surface of the protein, where they form ion pairs (salt bridges, ionic interactions) or are in contact with aqueous solvent. Charged side chains often bind inorganic ions (e.g., $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{PO}_{4}{ }^{3-}$, or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$) to decrease repulsion between like charges. When charged amino acids are located on the interior, they are generally involved in forming specific binding sites. The polar uncharged amino acid side chains of serine, threonine, asparagine, glutamine, tyrosine, and tryptophan are also usually found on the surface of the protein, but they may occur in the interior, hydrogen-bonded to other side chains. Cystine disulfide bonds (the bond formed by two cysteine sulfhydryl groups) are sometimes involved in the formation of tertiary structure, where they add stability to the protein. However, their formation in soluble globular proteins is infrequent.

## D. Tertiary Structure of Transmembrane Proteins

Transmembrane proteins, such as the $\beta_{2}$-adrenergic receptor, contain membranespanning domains and intra- and extracellular domains on either side of the membrane (Fig. 7.9). Many ion channel proteins, transport proteins, neurotransmitter receptors, and hormone receptors contain similar membrane-spanning segments that are $\alpha$-helices with hydrophobic residues exposed to the lipid bilayer. These rigid helices are connected by loops containing hydrophilic amino acid side chains that extend into the aqueous medium on both sides of the membrane. In the $\beta_{2^{-}}$ adrenergic receptor, the helices clump together so that the extracellular loops form a surface that acts as a binding site for the hormone adrenaline (epinephrine)-our fight-or-flight hormone. The binding site is sometimes referred to as a binding domain (a functional domain), even though it is not formed from a continuous segment of the polypeptide chain. Once adrenaline binds to the receptor, a conformational change in the arrangement of rigid helical structures is transmitted to the intracellular domains that form a binding site for another signaling protein, a heterotrimeric G-protein (a guanosine triphosphate [GTP]-binding protein composed of three different subunits, which is described further in Chapter 11). Thus, receptors require both rigidity and flexibility to transmit signals across the cell membrane.

As discussed in Chapter 6, transmembrane proteins usually have several posttranslational modifications that provide additional chemical groups to fulfill requirements of the three-dimensional structure. As shown in Figure 7.9 (and see Fig. 6.13), the amino terminus of the $\beta_{2}$-adrenergic receptor (residues 1 to 34 ) extends out

![ma8950024193](ma8950024193.jpg)

FIGURE 7.9 $\beta_{2}$-Adrenergic receptor. The receptor has seven $\alpha$-helical domains that span the membrane and is therefore a member of the heptahelical class of receptors. A. The transmembrane domains are drawn in an extended form. The amino terminus (residues I through 34) extends out of the membrane and has branched high-mannose oligosaccharides linked through N -glycosidic bonds to the amide of asparagine. Part of the receptor is anchored in the lipid plasma membrane by a palmitoyl group (shown as a squiggle) that forms a thioester with the -SH residue of a cysteine. The -COOH terminus, which extends into the cytoplasm, has several serine and threonine phosphorylation sites (shown as red circles). B. The seven transmembrane helices (shown as tubes) form a cylindrical structure. Loops connecting helices form the hormonebinding site on the external side of the plasma membrane, and a binding site for a G-protein is on the intracellular side.
of the membrane and has branched high-mannose oligosaccharides linked through N -glycosidic bonds to the amide of asparagine. Part of the receptor is anchored in the lipid plasma membrane by a palmitoyl group that forms a thioester with the -SH residue of a cysteine. The carboxyl terminus, which extends into the cytoplasm, has several serine and threonine phosphorylation sites (shown as red circles in Fig. 7.9) that regulate receptor activity.

# V. Quaternary Structure 

The quaternary structure of a protein refers to the association of individual polypeptide chain subunits in a geometrically and stoichiometrically specific manner. Many proteins function in the cell as dimers, tetramers, or oligomers, proteins in which two, four, or more subunits, respectively, have combined to make one functional protein. The subunits of a particular protein always combine in the same number and in the same way because the binding between the subunits is dictated by the tertiary structure, which is dictated by the primary structure, which in turn is determined by the genetic code.

Several different terms are used to describe subunit structure. The prefixes homoand hetero- are used to describe identical or different subunits, respectively, of two-, three-, or four-subunit proteins (e.g., heterotrimeric G-proteins have three different subunits). A protomer is the unit structure composed of nonidentical subunits. For example, adult hemoglobin consists of two a- and two b-chains and is a tetramer $\left(\mathrm{a}_{2} \mathrm{~b}_{2}\right)$. One a-b pair can be considered a protomer. In contrast, F-actin is an oligomer, a multisubunit protein composed of identical G-actin subunits. Multimer is sometimes used as a more generic term to designate a complex with many subunits of more than one type.

The contact regions between the subunits of globular proteins resemble the interior of a single subunit protein; they contain closely packed nonpolar side chains,

hydrogen bonds involving the polypeptide backbones and their side chains, and occasional ionic bonds or salt bridges. The subunits of globular proteins are very rarely held together by interchain disulfide bonds and never by other covalent bonds. In contrast, fibrous and other structural proteins may be extensively linked to other proteins through covalent bonds.

Assembly into a multisubunit structure increases the stability of a protein. The increase in size increases the number of possible interactions between amino acid residues and therefore makes it more difficult for a protein to unfold and refold. As a result, many soluble proteins are composed of two or four identical or nearly identical subunits with an average size of approximately 200 amino acids. The forming of multisubunit proteins also aids in the function of the protein.

A multisubunit structure has many advantages besides increased stability. It may enable the protein to exhibit cooperativity between subunits in binding ligands (illustrated later with hemoglobin) or to form binding sites with a high affinity for large molecules (illustrated with antigen binding to the immunoglobulin molecule immunoglobulin G [IgG]). An additional advantage of a multisubunit structure is that the different subunits can have different activities and cooperate in a common function. Examples of enzymes that have regulatory subunits or exist as multiprotein complexes are provided in Chapter 9.

## VI. Quantitation of Ligand Binding

In the examples of tertiary structure we have discussed, the folding of a protein created a three-dimensional binding site for a ligand ( $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$for the LDH domain 1, ATP for Gactin, or adrenaline for the $\beta_{2}$-adrenergic receptor). The binding affinity of a protein for a ligand is described quantitatively by its association constant, $K_{a}$, which is the equilibrium constant for the binding reaction of a ligand ( L ) with a protein ( P ) (Equation 7.1).

Equation 7.1. The association constant $\left(K_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$ for a binding site on a protein. Consider a reaction in which a ligand ( L ) binds to a protein ( P ) to form a ligand-protein complex (LP) with a rate constant of $k_{1}$. LP dissociates with a rate constant of $k_{2}$ :

$$
\mathrm{L}+\mathrm{P} \underset{k_{2}}{\stackrel{k_{1}}{\rightleftarrows}} \mathrm{LP}
$$

then,

$$
K_{\mathrm{eq}}=\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}}=\frac{[\mathrm{LP}]}{[\mathrm{L}][\mathrm{P}]}=K_{\mathrm{a}}=\frac{1}{K_{\mathrm{d}}}
$$

The equilibrium constant, $K_{\text {eq }}$, is equal to the association constant $\left(K_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$ or $1 / K_{\mathrm{d}}$, the dissociation constant. Unless otherwise given, the concentrations of $\mathrm{L}, \mathrm{P}$, and LP are expressed as moles per liter ( $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ ), and $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ has the units of $(\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L})^{-1}$.
$K_{\mathrm{a}}$ is equal to the rate constant $\left(k_{1}\right)$ for association of the ligand with its binding site divided by the rate constant $\left(k_{2}\right)$ for dissociation of the ligand-protein complex (LP). $K_{\mathrm{d}}$, the dissociation constant for ligand-protein binding, is the reciprocal of $K_{\mathrm{a}}$. The tighter the binding of the ligand to the protein, the higher the $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ and the lower the $K_{\mathrm{d}}$. The $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ is useful for comparing proteins produced by different alleles or for describing the affinity of a receptor for different drugs.

## VII. Structure-Function Relationships in Myoglobin and Hemoglobin

Myoglobin and hemoglobin are two oxygen-binding proteins with a very similar primary structure (Fig. 7.10). However, myoglobin is a globular protein composed of a single polypeptide chain that has one oxygen-binding site. Hemoglobin is a tetramer composed of two different types of subunits ( $2 \alpha$ - and $2 \beta$-polypeptide chains, referred

0Insulin is composed of two nonidentical polypeptide chains attached to each other through disulfide bonds between the chains (see Chapter 6, Fig. 6.12). The subunits of globular proteins are generally not held together by disulfide bonds, but regions of the same chain may be connected by disulfide bonds that form as the chain folds. Insulin actually fits this generalization because it is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain, which forms the disulfide bonds. Subsequently, a proteolytic enzyme in secretory vesicles clips the polypeptide chain into two nonidentical subunits. Generally, each subunit of most protomers and oligomers is synthesized as a separate polypeptide chain. In fibrous proteins, which have a regular, sometimes repeating sequence of amino acids, inter- and intrachain covalent binding serves different functions. In collagen, for example, extensive interchain binding provides great tensile strength. Collagen is discussed in more detail in Chapter 47.

0Two different ligands (A and B) bind to the same receptor on the cell surface. The $K_{\mathrm{d}}$ for ligand $A$ is $10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$ for ligand B, it is $10^{-9} \mathrm{M}$.Which ligand has the higher affinity for the receptor?

FIGURE 7.10 Myoglobin and hemoglobin. Myoglobin (A) consists of a single polypeptide chain, which is similar in structure to the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits of hemoglobin (B). In all of the subunits, heme is tightly bound in a hydrophobic binding pocket. The proximal histidine extends down from a helix to bind to the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ atom. The oxygen binds between the distal histidine and the heme. (C) displays the quaternary structure of hemoglobin (which consists of two $\alpha$ - and two $\beta$-chains). (From Frescht A.

Ligand B has the higher affinity for the receptor by 100 -fold as compared to ligand A .

FIGURE 7.11 Oxygen saturation curves for myoglobin and hemoglobin. Note that the curve for myoglobin is hyperbolic, whereas that for hemoglobin is sigmoidal. The effect of the tetrameric structure is to inhibit $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binding at low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ concentrations. $\mathrm{P}_{50}$ is the partial pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}\right)$ at which the protein is half-saturated with $\mathrm{O}_{2} . \mathrm{P}_{50}$ for myoglobin is 2.8 torr and that for hemoglobin is 26 torr, where I torr is equal to I mm Hg.
to as two $\alpha \beta$-protomers). Each subunit has a strong sequence homology to myoglobin and contains an oxygen-binding site. A comparison between myoglobin and hemoglobin illustrates some of the advantages of a multisubunit quaternary structure.

The tetrameric structure of hemoglobin facilitates saturation with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the lungs and release of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as it travels through the capillary beds (Fig. 7.11). When the amount of oxygen bound to myoglobin or hemoglobin is plotted against the partial pressure of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{2}\right)$, a hyperbolic curve is obtained for myoglobin, whereas that for hemoglobin is sigmoidal. These curves show that when the $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is high, as in the lungs, both myoglobin and hemoglobin are saturated with oxygen. However, at the lower levels of $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ in oxygen-using tissues, hemoglobin cannot bind oxygen as well as myoglobin (i.e., its percentage saturation is much lower). Myoglobin, which is present in heart and skeletal muscle, can bind the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ released by hemoglobin, which it stores to meet the demands of contraction. As $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is used in the muscle cell for generation of ATP during contraction, it is released from myoglobin and picked up by cytochrome oxidase, a heme-containing enzyme in the electron transport chain that has an even higher affinity for oxygen than myoglobin.

## A. Oxygen Binding and Heme

The tertiary structure of myoglobin consists of eight $\alpha$-helices connected by short coils, a structure that is known as the globin fold (see Fig. 7.10). This structure is unusual for a globular protein in that it has no $\beta$-sheets. The helices create a hydrophobic $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binding pocket containing tightly bound heme with an iron atom (ferrous $\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right]$ ) in its center.

Heme consists of a planar porphyrin ring composed of four pyrrole rings linked by methenyl bridges that lie with their nitrogen atoms in the center, binding a $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ atom (Fig. 7.12). Negatively charged propionate groups on the porphyrin ring interact with arginine and histidine side chains from the hemoglobin, and the hydrophobic methyl and vinyl groups that extend out from the porphyrin ring interact with hydrophobic amino acid side chains from hemoglobin, positioning the heme group within the protein. All together, there are about 16 different interactions between myoglobin amino acids and different groups in the porphyrin ring.

Organic ligands that are tightly bound to proteins, such as the heme of myoglobin, are called prosthetic groups. A protein with its attached prosthetic group is called a holoprotein; without the prosthetic group, it is called an apoprotein. The tightly bound prosthetic group is an intrinsic part of the protein and does not dissociate until the protein is degraded.

FIGURE 7.I2 Heme. The $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ is bound to four nitrogen atoms in the center of the heme porphyrin ring. Methyl $\left(\mathrm{M},-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)$, vinyl $\left(\mathrm{V},-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)$, and propionate $\left(\mathrm{P},-\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}-\right)$ side chains extend out from the four pyrrole rings that comprise the porphyrin ring.

Within the binding pocket of myoglobin and hemoglobin, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds directly to the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ atom on one side of the planar porphyrin ring (Fig. 7.13A). The $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ atom is able to chelate (binds to) six different ligands; four of the ligand positions are in a plane and taken by the central nitrogens in the planar porphyrin ring. There are two ligand positions perpendicular to this plane. One of these positions is taken by the nitrogen atom on a histidine, called the proximal histidine, which extends down from a myoglobin or hemoglobin $\alpha$-helix. The other position is taken by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, by CO (carbon monoxide), or remains empty.

The proximal histidine of myoglobin and hemoglobin is sterically repelled by the heme porphyrin ring. Thus, when the histidine binds to the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ in the middle of the ring, it pulls the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ above the plane of the ring (see Fig. 7.13A). When oxygen binds on the other side of the ring, it pulls the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ back into the plane of the ring (see Fig. 7.13B). The pull of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binding moves the proximal histidine toward the porphyrin ring, which moves the helix containing the proximal histidine. This conformational change has no effect on the function of myoglobin. However, in hemoglobin, the movement of one helix leads to the movement of other helices in that subunit, including one in a corner of the subunit that is in contact with a different subunit through ionic interactions (salt bridges). The loss of these salt bridges then induces conformational changes in all other subunits, and all four subunits may change in a concerted manner from their original conformation to a new conformation (see "Biochemical Comments").

Myoglobin is readily released from skeletal muscle or cardiac tissue when the cell is damaged. It has a low molecular weight, 17,000 Da and is not complexed to other proteins in the cell. (Do is the abbreviation for the dalton, which is a unit of mass approximately equal to one H atom. Thus, a molecular weight of 17,000 Da is equal to approximately $17,000 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$.) Large injuries to skeletal muscle that result from physical crushing or lack of ATP production result in cellular swelling and the release of myoglobin and other proteins into the blood. Myoglobin passes into the urine (myoglobinuria) and turns the urine red because the heme (which is red) remains covalently attached to the protein. During an acute MI, myoglobin is one of the first proteins released into the blood from damaged cardiac tissue; however, the amount released is not high enough to cause myoglobinuria. Laboratory measurements of serum myoglobin were used in the past for early diagnosis in patients such as Anne J. Because myoglobin is not present in skeletal muscle and the heart as tissue-specific isozymes, and the amount released from the heart is much smaller than the amount that can be released from a large skeletal muscle injury, myoglobin measurements are not specific for an MI. Owing to the lack of specificity in myoglobin measurements, the cardiac marker of choice for detection of an MI is the heart isozyme of the troponins (I and/or T).

FIGURE 7.I3 A. Oxygen binding to the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ of heme in hemoglobin. A histidine residue called the proximal histidine binds to the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ on one side of the porphyrin ring and slightly pulls the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ out of the plane of the ring; $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ on the other side. B. $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binding causes a conformational change that pulls the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ back into the plane of the ring. As the proximal histidine moves, it moves the helix (the F-helix) that contains it.

Sickle cell anemia is really a disease caused by an abnormal quaternary structure. The painful vaso-occlusive crises experienced by Will S. are caused by the polymerization of sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) molecules into long fibers that distort the shape of the red blood cells into sickle cells. The substitution of a hydrophobic valine for a glutamate in the $\beta_{2}$-chain of hemoglobin creates a knob on the surface of deoxygenated hemoglobin that fits into a hydrophobic binding pocket on the $\beta_{1}$-subunit of a different hemoglobin molecule. A third hemoglobin molecule, which binds to the first and second hemoglobin molecules through aligned polar interactions, binds a fourth hemoglobin molecule through its valine knob. Thus, the polymerization continues until long fibers are formed.
![ma9450024193](ma9450024193.jpg)

Polymerization of the hemoglobin molecules is highly dependent on the concentration of HbS and is promoted by the conformation of the deoxygenated molecules. At $100 \%$ oxygen saturation, even high concentrations of HbS will not polymerize. A red blood cell spends the longest amount of time at the lower oxygen concentrations of the venous capillary bed, where polymerization is most likely initiated.

## B. Cooperativity of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Binding in Hemoglobin

The cooperativity in oxygen binding in hemoglobin comes from conformational changes in tertiary structure that takes place when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds (Fig. 7.14). The conformational change of hemoglobin is usually described as changing from a $T$ (tense) state with low affinity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to an $R$ (relaxed) state with a high affinity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Breaking the salt bridges in the contacts between subunits is an energy-requiring process, and consequently, the binding rate for the first oxygen is very low. When the next oxygen binds, many of the hemoglobin molecules containing one $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ will already have all four subunits in the R state, and therefore, the rate of binding is much higher. With two $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecules bound, an even higher percentage of the hemoglobin molecules will have all four subunits in the R state. This phenomenon, known as positive cooperativity, is responsible for the sigmoidal oxygen saturation curve of hemoglobin (see Fig. 7.11).

## C. Agents that Affect $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Binding

The major agents that affect $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binding to hemoglobin are shown in Figure 7.15.
![ma9550024193](ma9550024193.jpg)

FIGURE 7.14 Equilibria for binding of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecules to hemoglobin according to the concerted model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux. Hemoglobin exists in two alternate conformations, the $T$ (tense) state with a low affinity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and the $R$ (relaxed) state with a higher affinity. In the $T$ subunits, the binding sites are hindered, and in the $R$ state, the binding sites are open. Each successive addition of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ shifts the equilibrium further toward the R state. Because the conformation of all the subunits can change when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds to one subunit, oxygen binding is said to follow the concerted model. Most of the molecules change to the R state when two $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecules have bound.

## I. 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate

2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) is formed in red blood cells from the glycolytic intermediate 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (see Chapters 22 and 42). 2,3-BPG binds to hemoglobin in the central cavity formed by the four subunits, increasing the energy required for the conformational changes that facilitate the binding of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Thus, 2,3-BPG lowers the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Therefore, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is less readily bound (i.e., is more readily released in tissues) when hemoglobin has bound 2,3-BPG. Red blood cells can modulate $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity for hemoglobin by altering the rate of synthesis or degradation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

## 2. Proton Binding (Bohr Effect)

The binding of protons by hemoglobin lowers its affinity for oxygen (Fig. 7.16), contributing to a phenomenon known as the Bohr effect (Fig. 7.17). The pH of the

FIGURE 7.17 Effect of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$on oxygen binding by hemoglobin (Hb). A. In the tissues, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is released. In the red blood cell, this $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ forms carbonic acid, which releases protons. The protons bind to Hb , causing it to release oxygen to the tissues. B. In the lungs, the reactions are reversed. $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds to protonated Hb , causing the release of protons. They bind to bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}\right)$, forming carbonic acid, which is cleaved to water and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which is exhaled.

![ma9850024193](ma9850024193.jpg)

FIGURE 7.16 Effect of pH on oxygen saturation curves. As the pH decreases, the affinity of hemoglobin ( Hb ) for oxygen decreases, producing the Bohr effect.

Amy L.'s serum protein electrophoresis indicated the presence of a sharp narrow peak or homogeneous "spike" in the characteristic $\gamma$-globulin zone known as an $M$ protein (monoclonal protein) component. A narrow peak or spike in electrophoresis, which separates proteins according to charge distribution of the side chains, suggests an elevation of proteins with a similar or identical structure. Subsequently, it was shown that Amy L's immunoglobulin M component was composed of a single homogeneous type of immunoglobulin (just one amino acid sequence in the N -terminal variable region). Thus, the M protein was produced by a single clone of antibody-secreting cells (cells that all arose from proliferation of one cell) in the bone marrow (called plasma cell dyscrasia).

In amyloidosis/AL, amyloid is formed from degradation products of the $\lambda$ - or $\kappa$-light chains that deposit most frequently in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the kidney and the heart but also may deposit in the tongue. In other types of amyloidosis, the amyloid arises from other proteins and deposits in a characteristic organ. For example, the amyloid associated with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, is derived from the serum protein called serum amyloid A that is produced by the liver in response to inflammation. It deposits most frequently in the kidney.

The treatment of AL is multifactorial and only partially successful. Initially, alkylating agents were used to reduce the synthesis of immunoglobulin light chains by plasma cells but were found to be too toxic for routine use. The most efficacious approach involves the use of stem cell transplantation in concert with melphalan (an antineoplastic agent). If the patient is not a candidate for transplantation, then melphalan (an antineoplastic agent) and dexamethasone (a steroid) can be used.

Renal transplantation and cardiac transplantation have been performed in patients with renal and cardiac amyloidosis, respectively, with some success.

FIGURE 7.18 Binding of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to hemoglobin. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ forms carbamates with the N -terminal amino groups of hemoglobin ( Hb ) chains. Approximately $15 \%$ of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in blood is carried to the lungs bound to Hb . The reaction releases protons, which contribute to the Bohr effect. The overall effect is the stabilization of the deoxy form of hemoglobin.
blood decreases as it enters the tissues (and the proton concentration rises) because the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced by metabolism is converted to carbonic acid by the reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells. Dissociation of carbonic acid produces protons that react with several amino acid residues in hemoglobin, causing conformational changes that promote the release of oxygen.

In the lungs, this process is reversed. Oxygen binds to hemoglobin (because of the high oxygen concentration in the lung), causing a release of protons, which combine with bicarbonate to form carbonic acid. This decrease of protons causes the pH of the blood to rise. Carbonic anhydrase cleaves the carbonic acid to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is exhaled. Thus, in tissues in which the pH of the blood is low because of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced by metabolism, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is released from hemoglobin. In the lungs, where the pH of the blood is higher because $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is being exhaled, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds to hemoglobin.

## C. Carbon Dioxide

Although most of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced by metabolism in the tissues is carried to the lungs as bicarbonate, some of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is covalently bound to hemoglobin (Fig. 7.18). In the tissues, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ forms carbamate adducts with the N -terminal amino groups of deoxyhemoglobin and stabilizes the deoxy conformation. In the lungs, where the $\mathrm{Po}_{2}$ is high, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds to hemoglobin and this bound $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is released.

## VIII. Structure-Function Relationships in Immunoglobulins

The immunoglobulins (or antibodies) are one line of defense against invasion of the body by foreign organisms. In this capacity, they function by binding to ligands called antigens on the invading organisms, thereby initiating the process by which these organisms are inactivated or destroyed.

Immunoglobulins all have a similar structure; each antibody molecule contains two identical small polypeptide chains (the light or L chains) and two identical large polypeptide chains (the heavy or H chains) (Fig. 7.19). The chains are joined to each other by disulfide bonds.

The body has five major classes of immunoglobulins. The most abundant immunoglobulins in human blood are the $\gamma$-globulins, which belong to the IgG class. The $\gamma$-globulins have approximately 220 amino acids in their light chains and 440 in their heavy chains. Like most serum proteins, they have attached oligosaccharides that participate in targeting the protein for clearance from the blood. Both the light and heavy chains consist of domains known as the immunoglobulin fold, which is a collapsed number of $\beta$-sheets, known as a $\beta$-barrel (Fig. 7.20).

![ma10050024193](ma10050024193.jpg)

FIGURE 7.19 Structure of immunoglobulins. A. Each $\lg G$ molecule contains two light (L) and two heavy (H) chains joined by disulfide bonds. Each light chain contains two domains, a variable domain $\left(V_{L}\right)$ and a region of constant amino acid sequence $\left(C_{L}\right)$. Each heavy chain has four domains: one variable domain $\left(V_{H}\right)$ and three constant domains $\left(C_{H}\right)$. The conformation of the constant domain contains the $\beta$-sheets that are called the immunoglobulin fold. The variable domains are specific for the antigen that is bound, whereas the constant regions are the same for all antibody molecules of a given class. Carbohydrate ( $-C H O$ ) is bound as indicated within the constant region of the heavy chains. The hinge region allows flexibility when the molecule binds antigen. B. In the space-filling model, the light chains are light in color and the heavy chains are two different shades of orange. (Modified from Silverton EW, Navia MA, Davies DR, et al.

FIGURE 7.20 Structure of the light chain variable domain $\left(V_{L}\right)$ and constant domain $\left(C_{L}\right)$ of $\lg G$. Layers of antiparallel $\beta$-sheets are stacked in these domains, which have been referred to as collapsed $\beta$-barrels (one can envision a hollow space between the $\beta$-sheets, which define the barrel). The antigen binds between the heavy chain $V_{H}$ and $V_{L}$ immunoglobulin folds and not in the barrel. The $C_{L}$ domain is also called the immunoglobulin fold. (Top modified from Richardson JS.

(1)The tight binding affinity of immunoglobulins for their specific antigen makes them useful for the measurement of small amounts of other compounds in various radioimmunoassays. The principle of the radioimmunoassay is that the immunoglobulin will specifically bind the compound being measured, and an additional component of the system that is labeled with a radioactive or fluorescent chemical will bind the immunoglobulin. The complex is then separated from the solution and the bound radioactivity or fluorescence measured. The different isozymes of CK and TnT used to track Anne J's M are measured with a type of radioimmunoassay by using antibodies specific for each isozyme. This method is much faster than the laborious separation of isozymes by electrophoresis. Radioimmunoassays are also useful for measuring the small amounts of hormones present in the blood for diagnosis of endocrine diseases.

Both the light and heavy chains contain regions termed variable (V) and constant (C) regions. The variable regions of the L and H chains $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}\right.$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{H}}$, respectively) interact to produce a single antigen-binding site at each branch of the Y-shaped molecule. Each population (clone) of B cells produces an antibody with a different amino acid composition in the variable region that is complementary to the structure of the antigen that elicits the response. The $K_{\mathrm{d}}$ of antibodies for their specific antigens is extremely small and varies from approximately $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-11} \mathrm{M}$. The antigen thus binds very tightly with almost no tendency to dissociate and can be removed from circulation as the antigen-antibody complex is ingested by macrophages. The constant domains that form the Fc (fragment, crystallizable) part of the antibody are important for binding of the antigen-antibody complex to phagocytic cells for clearance and for other aspects of the immune response.

## IX. Protein Folding

Although the peptide bonds in a protein are rigid, flexibility around the other bonds in the peptide backbone allows an enormous variety of possible conformations for each protein. However, every molecule of the same protein folds into the same stable three-dimensional structure. This shape is known as the native conformation.

## A. Primary Structure Determines Folding

The primary structure of a protein determines its three-dimensional conformation. More specifically, the sequence of amino acid side chains dictates the fold pattern of the three-dimensional structure and the assembly of subunits into quaternary structure. Proteins become denatured when they lose their overall structure. However, under certain conditions, denatured proteins can refold into their native conformation, regaining their original function. Proteins can be denatured with organic molecules such as urea that disrupt hydrogen bonding patterns (both of the protein and of water) and convert the protein to a soluble random coil. Many simple single-subunit proteins such as ribonuclease that are denatured in this way refold spontaneously into their native conformation if they are carefully brought back to physiologic conditions. Even complex multisubunit proteins containing bound cofactors can sometimes renature spontaneously under the right conditions. Thus, the primary structure essentially specifies the folding pattern. If misfolded proteins do not precipitate into aggregates, they can be degraded in the cell by proteolytic reactions, or even refolded.

In the cell, not all proteins fold into their native conformation on their own. As the protein folds and refolds while it is searching for its native low-energy state, it passes through many high-energy conformations that slow the process (called kinetic barriers). These kinetic barriers can be overcome by heat-shock proteins (some of which are also called chaperonins), which use energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to assist in the folding process (Fig. 7.21). Heat-shock proteins were named for the fact that their synthesis in bacteria increased when the temperature was raised suddenly. They are present in human cells as different families of proteins with different activities. For example, the hsp70 proteins bind to nascent polypeptide chains as their synthesis is being completed to keep the uncompleted chains from folding prematurely. They also unfold proteins before their insertion through the membrane of mitochondria and other organelles. The multisubunit barrel-shaped hsp60 family of proteins are called chaperonins. The unfolded protein fits into the barrel cavity that excludes water and serves as a template for the folding process. The hydrolysis of several ATP molecules is used to overcome the energy barriers to reaching the native conformation.

A cis-trans isomerase and a protein disulfide isomerase also participate in folding. The cis-trans isomerase converts a trans peptide bond preceding a proline into the cis conformation, which is well suited for making hairpin turns. The protein disulfide isomerase breaks and reforms disulfide bonds between the -SH groups of two cysteine residues in transient structures formed during the folding process. After the protein has folded, cysteine-SH groups in close contact in the tertiary structure can react to form the final disulfide bonds.

It is important to note that there is very little difference in the energy state of the native conformation and several other stable conformations that a protein might assume. This enables the protein to have the flexibility to change conformation when modifiers are bound to the protein, which enables a protein's activity to be regulated (similar to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate binding to hemoglobin and stabilizing the deoxy form of hemoglobin).

## B. Fibrous Proteins-Collagen

Collagen, a family of fibrous proteins, is produced by a variety of cell types but principally by fibroblasts (cells found in interstitial connective tissue), muscle cells, and epithelial cells. Type I collagen, or collagen(I), the most abundant protein in mammals, is a fibrous protein that is the major component of connective tissue. It is found in the ECM (see Chapter 47) of loose connective tissue, bone, tendons, skin, blood vessels, and the cornea of the eye. Collagen(I) contains about $33 \%$ glycine and $21 \%$ proline and hydroxyproline. Hydroxyproline is an amino acid produced by posttranslational modification of peptidyl proline residues.

0Treatment of mature insulin (see Fig. 6.I2) with denaturing agents. followed by renaturation, does not restore mature insulin activity (a result distinct from that which occurred when the experiment was done with ribonuclease). Why does renaturation of denatured mature insulin not result in restoration of biologic activity?

B. The hsp60 class of protein has a barrel shape into which the protein fits. It acts as a template, binding and rebinding portions of the unfolded protein until folding is completed. It hydrolyzes many adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bonds (generating adenosine diphosphate [ADP]) to provide energy for the process. Hsp, heatshock proteins.

FIGURE 7.22 The triple helix of collagen. Glycines are present in the three chains where they come into close contact with each other (arrows).

Recall that the primary structure of a protein dictates the folding pattern of the protein. The primary structure of mature insulin is different than that of its precursor, preproinsulin. Proinsulin forms the three-dimensional structure, and then the C-peptide is removed from the protein by proteolytic cleavage, thereby altering the primary structure of the protein. This change in primary structure (the loss of the C-peptide) does not allow the denatured mature insulin to refold into an active conformation.

Procollagen(I), the precursor of collagen(I), is a triple helix composed of three polypeptide (pro- $\alpha$ ) chains that are twisted around each other, forming a ropelike structure (Fig. 7.22). Polymerization of collagen(I) molecules forms collagen fibrils, which provide great tensile strength to connective tissues. The individual polypeptide chains each contain approximately 1,000 amino acid residues. The three polypeptide chains of the triple helix are linked by interchain hydrogen bonds. Each turn of the triple helix contains three amino acid residues, such that every third amino acid is in close contact with the other two strands in the center of the structure. Only glycine, which lacks a side chain, can fit in this position, and indeed, every third amino acid residue of collagen is glycine. Thus, collagen is a polymer of (Gly-X-Y) repeats, where Y is frequently proline or hydroxyproline and X is any other amino acid found in collagen.

Procollagen(I) is an example of a protein that undergoes extensive posttranslational modifications. Hydroxylation reactions produce hydroxyproline residues from proline residues and hydroxylysine from lysine residues. These reactions occur after the protein has been synthesized (Fig. 7.23) and require vitamin C (ascorbic acid) as a cofactor of the enzymes prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. Hydroxyproline residues are involved in hydrogen bond formation that helps to stabilize the triple helix, whereas hydroxylysine residues are the sites of attachment of disaccharide moieties (galactose-glucose). The role of carbohydrates in collagen structure is still controversial. In the absence of vitamin C (scurvy), the melting temperature of collagen drops from $42^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $24^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ because of the loss of interstrand hydrogen bond formation, which is in turn caused by the lack of hydroxyproline residues.

The side chains of lysine residues also may be oxidized to form the aldehyde allysine. These aldehyde residues produce covalent cross-links between collagen molecules to further stabilize the collagen fibril (Fig. 7.24). An allysine residue on one collagen molecule reacts with the amino group of a lysine residue on another molecule, forming a covalent Schiff base (a nitrogen-carbon double bond) that is converted to more stable covalent cross-links. Aldol condensation also may occur between two allysine residues, which form the structure lysinonorleucine.

The synthesis and secretion of collagen, as well as its multiple types, is discussed further in Chapter 47.

FIGURE 7.23 Hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen. Proline and lysine residues within the collagen chains are hydroxylated by reactions that require vitamin C.

## C. Protein Denaturation

A protein's quaternary, tertiary, and secondary structures can be destroyed by several processes, and when this occurs, the protein is considered to be denatured. Denaturation can occur by a variety of means.

## I. Denaturation through Nonenzymatic Modification of Proteins

Amino acids on proteins can undergo a wide range of chemical modifications that are not catalyzed by enzymes, such as nonenzymatic glycosylation or oxidation. Such modifications may lead to a loss of function and denaturation of the protein, sometimes to a form that cannot be degraded in the cell. In nonenzymatic glycosylation, glucose that is present in blood, or in interstitial or intracellular fluid, binds to an exposed amino group on a protein (Fig. 7.25). The two-step process forms an irreversibly glycosylated protein. Proteins that turn over very slowly in the body, such as collagen or hemoglobin, exist with a significant fraction present in the glycosylated form. Because the reaction is nonenzymatic, the rate of glycosylation is proportionate to the concentration of glucose present, and individuals with hyperglycemia have much higher levels of glycosylated proteins than individuals with normal blood glucose levels. Collagen and other glycosylated proteins in tissues are further modified by nonenzymatic oxidation and form additional cross-links. The net result is the formation of large protein aggregates referred to as advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs). AGE is a particularly meaningful acronym because AGEs accumulate with age, even in individuals with normal blood glucose levels.

## 2. Protein Denaturation by Temperature, pH, and Solvent

Proteins can be denatured by changes of pH , temperature, or solvent that disrupt ionic, hydrogen, and hydrophobic bonds. At a low pH , ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds formed by carboxylate groups would be disrupted; at a very alkaline pH , hydrogen and ionic bonds formed by the basic amino acids would be disrupted. Thus, the pH of the body must be maintained within a range compatible with threedimensional structure.

Physiologically, proteins are denatured by the gastric juice of the stomach, which has a pH of 1 to 2 . Although this pH cannot break peptide bonds, disruption of the native conformation makes the protein a better substrate for digestive enzymes. Temperature increases vibrational and rotational energies in the bonds, thereby affecting the energy balance that goes into making a stable three-dimensional conformation. Thermal denaturation is often illustrated by the process of cooking an egg. With heat, the protein albumin converts from its native translucent state to a denatured white precipitate. Protein precipitates can sometimes be dissolved by amphipathic agents such as urea, guanidine hydrochloride $(\mathrm{HCl})$, or sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) that form extensive hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with the protein.

Hydrophobic molecules can also denature proteins by disturbing hydrophobic interactions in the protein. For example, long-chain fatty acids can inhibit many enzyme-catalyzed reactions by binding nonspecifically to hydrophobic pockets in proteins and disrupting hydrophobic interactions. Thus, long-chain fatty acids and other highly hydrophobic molecules have their own binding proteins in the cell.

## 3. Protein Misfolding and Prions

Prion proteins are believed to cause a neurodegenerative disease by acting as a template to misfold other cellular prion proteins into a form that cannot be degraded. The word prion stands for "proteinaceous infectious agent." The prion diseases may be acquired either through infection (e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [CJD], also called "mad cow disease") or from sporadic (majority of cases) or inherited mutations (e.g., familial CJD [fCJD]). Although the infectious prion diseases represent $<1 \%$ of human cases, their link to mad cow disease in the United Kingdom (new variant CJD), to cadaveric human growth hormone use in the United States and

FIGURE 7.24 Formation of cross-links in collagen. A. Lysine residues are oxidized to allysine (an aldehyde). Allysine may react with an unmodified lysine residue to form a Schiff base (B), or two allysine residues may undergo an aldol condensation (C) to form lysinonorleucine.

Dianne A.'s physician used her glycosylated hemoglobin levels, specifically the HbAlc fraction, to determine the control of her blood glucose and whether she had sustained hyperglycemia over a long period of time. The rate of irreversible nonenzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin and other proteins is directly proportional to the glucose concentration to which they are exposed over the last 4 months (the life span of the red blood cell). The danger of sustained hyperglycemia is that, over time, many proteins become glycosylated and subsequently oxidized, affecting their solubility and ability to function. The glycosylation of collagen in the heart, for example, is believed to result in a cardiomyopathy in patients with chronic uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. In contrast, glycosylation of hemoglobin has little effect on its function.

Prion diseases are categorized as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by spongiform degeneration and astrocytic gliosis in the central nervous system. Frequently, protein aggregates and amyloid plaques are seen. These aggregates are resistant to proteolytic degradation.

FIGURE 7.25 Nonenzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin (Hb). Glucose forms a Schiff base with the N -terminal amino group of the protein, which rearranges to form a stable glycosylated product. Similar nonenzymatic glycosylation reactions occur on other proteins. Four minor components of adult hemoglobin (HbA) result from posttranslational, nonenzymatic glycosylation of different amino acid residues (HbAlal, HbAlal, HbAlbl, and HbAlc). In HbAlc , the fraction that is usually measured, the glycosylation occurs on an N -terminal valine.

France (iatrogenic or "doctor-induced" CJD), and to ritualistic cannibalism in the Fore tribespeople of Papua New Guinea (Kuru) have received the most publicity.

The prion protein is normally found in the brain and is encoded by a gene that is a normal component of the human genome. The disease-causing form of the prion protein has the same amino acid composition but is folded into a different conformation that aggregates into multimeric protein complexes resistant to proteolytic degradation (Fig. 7.26). The normal conformation of the prion protein has been designated $\operatorname{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ and the disease-causing form as $\operatorname{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ ( $S c$ for the prion disease known as scrapie in sheep). Although $\operatorname{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ and $\operatorname{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ have the same amino acid composition, the $\operatorname{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ conformer is substantially enriched in $\beta$-sheet structure compared with the normal $\operatorname{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ conformer, which has little or no $\beta$-sheet structure and is approximately $40 \% \alpha$-helix. This difference favors the aggregation of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ into multimeric complexes. These two conformations presumably have similar energy levels. Fortunately, spontaneous refolding of PrP proteins into the $\operatorname{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ conformation is prevented by a large activation energy barrier that makes this conversion extremely slow. Thus, very few molecules of $\operatorname{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ are normally formed during a lifetime.

The infectious disease occurs with the ingestion of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ dimers in which the prion protein is already folded into the high $\beta$-structure. These $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ proteins are thought to act as a template to lower the activation energy barrier for the conformational change, causing native proteins to refold into the $\operatorname{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ conformation much more rapidly (much like the role of chaperonins). The refolding initiates a cascade as each new $\operatorname{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ formed acts as a template for the refolding of other molecules. As the

The prion proteins have two domains, an $N$-terminal region that binds four $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ per chain, and a C-terminal region. B. In PrP ${ }^{\circ}$, the C-terminal regions contain three substantial helices and two three-residue $\beta$-strands joined by two to three hydrogen bonds ( $\sim 40 \% \alpha$-helix and almost no $\beta$-sheet structure). It exists as a monomer. In PrP ${ }^{\text {Sc }}$, the $C$-terminal region is folded into an extensive $\beta$-sheet. The overall structure is approximately $40 \%$ to $50 \% \beta$-sheet and $20 \%$ to $30 \% \alpha$-helices. This conformation promotes aggregation.
number of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\text {Sc }}$ molecules increases in the cell, they aggregate into a multimeric assembly that is resistant to proteolytic digestion. Once an aggregate begins to form, the concentration of free $\operatorname{PrP}^{\text {Sc }}$ decreases, thereby shifting the equilibrium between PrP and $\operatorname{PrP}^{\text {Sc }}$ to produce more $\operatorname{PrP}^{\text {Sc }}$. This leads to further aggregate formation through the shift in equilibrium.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

Will S. Will S. continues to experience severe low back and lower extremity pain for many hours after admission. The diffuse pains of sickle cell crises are believed to result from occlusion of small vessels in a variety of tissues, thereby depriving cells of oxygen and cause ischemic or anoxic damage to the tissues. In a sickle cell crisis, long hemoglobin polymers form, causing the red blood cells to become distorted and change from a biconcave disc to an irregular shape, such as a sickle (for which the disease was named) or a stellate structure (Fig. 7.27). The aggregating Hb polymers damage the red blood cell membrane and promote aggregation of membrane proteins, leading to increased permeability of the red blood cell and dehydration. Surface charge and antigens of red blood cells are carried on the transmembrane proteins glycophorin and band 3 (the erythrocyte anion exchange channel, see Chapter 10). Hemoglobin S binds tightly to the cytoplasmic portion of band 3, contributing to further polymer aggregation and uneven distribution of negative charge on the sickle cell surface. As a result, the affected cells adhere to endothelial cells in capillaries, occluding the vessel and decreasing blood flow to the distal tissues. The subsequent hypoxia in these tissues causes cellular damage, severe ischemic pain, and even death.

The sickled cells are sequestered and destroyed mainly by phagocytic cells, particularly those in the spleen. An anemia results as the number of circulating red blood cells decreases and bilirubin levels rise in the blood as hemoglobin is degraded.

After a few days of treatment, Will's crisis was resolved. In the future, should Will S. suffer a cerebrovascular accident (stroke) as a consequence of sickle cell disease causing damage to one of the large cerebral arteries, or have recurrent lifethreatening episodes of generalized vaso-occlusion in microvessels, a course of long-term maintenance blood transfusions to prevent cerebrovascular accidents may

(1)Familial prion diseases are caused by point mutations in the gene encoding the Pr protein (point mutations are changes in one base in the DNA nucleotide sequence). The diseases have a various names related to the different mutations and the clinical syndrome (e.g., Gerstmann-Straüssler-Scheinker disease and fCJD). fCJD arises from an inherited mutation and has an autosomal dominant pedigree. It typically presents in the fourth decade of life. The mutation lowers the energy required for the protein to fold into the $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ conformation; thus, the conversion occurs more readily. It is estimated that the rate of generating prion disease by refolding of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\circ}$ in the normal cell is about 3,000 to 4,000 years. Lowering of the activation energy for refolding by mutation presumably decreases this time to the observed 30 - to 40 -year prodromal period. Sporadic CJD may arise from somatic cell mutation or rare spontaneous refoldings that initiate a cascade of refolding into the $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ conformation. The sporadic form of the disease accounts for $85 \%$ of all cases of CJD.

Troponin is a heterotrimeric protein involved in the regulation of striated and cardiac muscle contraction. Most troponin in the cell is bound to the actin-tropomyosin complex in the muscle. fibril. The three subunits of troponin consist of TnC, TnT, and TnI, each with a specific function in the regulatory process. TnT and TnI exist as different isoforms in cardiac and skeletal muscle (sequences with a different amino acid composition), thus allowing the development of specific antibodies against each form. As a consequence, either cTnT or cTnI may be rapidly measured in blood samples by immunoassay with a high degree of specificity.
be indicated. Iron chelation would likely have to accompany such a program to prevent or delay the development of iron overload. Although a few individuals with this disease have survived into the sixth decade, mean survival is probably into the fourth decade. Death usually results from infection, renal failure, and/or cardiopulmonary disease.

Anne J. Mrs. J.'s diagnosis of an acute MI was partly based on measurements of cTnT (the cardiac isozyme of TnT, a subunit of the regulatory protein troponin). Early diagnosis is critical for a decision on the type of therapeutic intervention to be used. Serum cTnT is a highly specific marker of myocardial injury. It is typically detected in an acute MI within 3 to 5 hours after onset of symptoms, is positive in most cases within 8 hours, and approaches $100 \%$ sensitivity at 10 to 12 hours. It remains elevated for 5 to 10 days.

Mrs. J. stayed in the hospital until she had recovered from her catheterization and was stable on her medication. She was discharged on a low-fat diet and medications for her heart disease and was asked to participate in the hospital's cardiac rehabilitation program for patients recovering from a recent heart attack. Her physician scheduled regular examinations for her.

Amy L. Amy L. has amyloidosis/AL, which is characterized by deposition of amyloid fibers derived principally from the variable region of $\lambda$ - or $\kappa$-immunoglobulin light chains. Increased amounts of the fragments of the light chains called Bence-Jones proteins appeared in her urine. Fibril deposition in the ECM of her kidney glomeruli has resulted in mild renal failure. Deposition of amyloid in the ECM of her heart muscle resulted in thickened heart muscle seen on an echocardiogram. In addition to other signs of right-sided heart failure, she had peripheral edema. The loss of weight may have been caused by infiltrations of amyloid in the gastrointestinal tract or by constipation and diarrhea resulting from involvement of the autonomic nervous system. Treatment may be directed against the plasma cell proliferation and against the symptomatic results of organ dysfunction and is only partially successful. The most effective approach involves the use of stem cell transplantation in concert with melphalan (an antineoplastic agent). If the patient is not a candidate for transplantation, then melphalan with dexamethasone (a steroid) can be used. Renal transplantation and cardiac transplantation have been performed in patients with renal and cardiac amyloidosis, respectively, with some success.

During Amy's evaluation, she developed a cardiac arrhythmia that was refractory to treatment. The extensive amyloid deposits in her heart had disrupted the flow of electrical impulses in the conduction system of the heart, ultimately resulting in cardiac arrest. On autopsy, amyloid deposits were found within the heart, tongue, liver, adipose tissue, and every organ examined except the central nervous system, which had been protected by the blood-brain barrier.

Dianne A. Dianne A.'s HbA1c of $8.5 \%$ was above the normal level of $<6.0 \%$ of total hemoglobin. Glycosylation is a nonenzymatic reaction that occurs with a rate directly proportionate to the concentration of glucose in the blood. In the normal range of blood glucose concentrations ( $\sim 80$ to $140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, depending on time after a meal), up to $6 \%$ of the hemoglobin is glycosylated to form HbA1c. Hemoglobin turns over in the blood as red blood cells are phagocytosed and their hemoglobin degraded and new red blood cells enter the blood from the bone marrow. The average lifespan of a red blood cell is 120 days. Thus, the extent of hemoglobin glycosylation is a direct reflection of the average serum glucose concentration to which the cell has been exposed over its 120-day lifespan. Dianne A.'s elevated HbA1c indicates that her average blood glucose level has been elevated over the preceding 3 to 4 months. An increase of Dianne A.'s insulin dosage would decrease her hyperglycemia and, over time, decrease her HbA1c level.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

The Basics of Hemoglobin Cooperativity. Using X-ray diffraction to study both the oxygenated and deoxygenated forms of hemoglobin, it is now possible to describe the change in conformation at the molecular level when oxygen binds to hemoglobin. We will present a simplistic approach here, looking at interactions that the $\beta$-subunit experiences and having oxygen bind initially to one of the two $\beta$-subunits in the hemoglobin tetramer. All of the subunits of hemoglobin contain eight helices, labeled A through H , with A representing the helix at the amino-terminal end. The deoxygenated form of hemoglobin is stabilized by the following interactions, which are also depicted in Figure 7.28:

1. Asp94 (of the F helix of the $\beta$-chain), through its carboxylate side chain, forms a salt bridge (ionic interaction) with the charged imidazole group of His146, which is the carboxy-terminal amino acid in the $\beta$-chain. Part of the Bohr effect is realized through this interaction because as the pH is reduced, the possibility that His146 is protonated is increased.
2. The carbonyl carbon of Val98 forms a hydrogen bond with the tyrosine hydroxyl group at position 145 (the next-to-last amino acid in the $\beta$-chain). The effect of these first two interactions is to position helices F and H in close proximity to each other.
3. The free carboxylate group of His146 (of the $\beta$-chain) forms a salt bridge with the $\varepsilon$-amino group of the side chain of Lys 40 of the corresponding $\alpha$-chain. This salt bridge allows communication between these two subunits and places the $\beta$-chain H helix close to the $\alpha$-subunit.
![ma11150024193](ma11150024193.jpg)

FIGURE 7.28 Molecular changes that occur when oxygen binds to hemoglobin. See the text for details. A. Interactions in the absence of oxygen. B. The loss of stabilizing interactions when oxygen binds.

In the $\beta$-chain, the proximal His92 (the eighth amino acid of the F helix [F8]) forms a coordinate covalent bond with the iron in heme and, in so doing, pulls the iron slightly out of the plane of the heme ring. These interactions are all occurring in the deoxygenated state.

So what happens when oxygen binds to a $\beta$-subunit? Oxygen binds to the iron in a bent conformation. The binding event triggers the movement of the iron into the plane of the heme ring. Because the iron is also covalently linked to histidine F8, the entire F helix, and the FG corner (where the F and G helices meet), also move.

1. Asp94 is in the F helix. As it is moved (because of the movement of the F helix), it can no longer form a salt bridge with the imidazole of His146, which weakens the interactions between the F and H helices.
2. Valine 98 is in the FG corner of the $\beta$-subunit, so as that moves, the hydrogen bond formed between Val98 and Tyr145 (at the end of the H helix) is also broken.
3. Due in part to the loss of interactions between the F and H helices, the H helix moves and, in so doing, breaks the ionic interaction between His146 and Lys40 of the $\alpha$-subunit. This, along with the steric hindrance of the heme ring and His 92 , leads to a rotation of one $\alpha \beta$-dimer relative to the other $\alpha \beta$-dimer and will allow oxygen to bind more readily to the other subunits. The rotation of dimers also forces 2,3-BPG to leave its binding site on hemoglobin, which will favor oxygen binding.
The disruption of the bonds listed previously has to occur for oxygen to bind. This is why it takes a high concentration of oxygen to get the first oxygen bound to hemoglobin. At low oxygen levels, the oxygen can dissociate from the iron, which allows the T form to re-form and allow the salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which stabilize the deoxygenated form, to re-form. If the oxygen concentration is high, such that the iron is continuously occupied with oxygen, the events described earlier are more likely to occur, and the oxygenation of hemoglobin will occur.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- There are four levels of protein structure:
- The primary structure (linear sequence of amino acids within the protein)
- The secondary structure (a regular, repeating pattern of hydrogen bonds that stabilize a particular structure)
- The tertiary structure (the folding of the secondary structure elements into a three-dimensional conformation)
- The quaternary structure (the association of subunits within a protein)
- The primary structure of a protein determines the way a protein folds into a unique three-dimensional structure, called its native conformation.
- When globular proteins fold, the tertiary structure generally forms a densely packed hydrophobic core with polar amino acid side chains on the outside, facing the aqueous environment.
- The tertiary structure of a protein consists of structural domains, which may be similar between different proteins, and performs similar functions for the different proteins.
- Certain structural domains are binding sites for specific molecules, called a ligand, or for other proteins.
- The affinity of a binding site for its ligand is quantitatively characterized by an association or affinity constant, $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ (or dissociation constant, $K_{\mathrm{d}}$ ).
- Protein denaturation is the loss of tertiary (and/or secondary) structure within a protein, which can be caused by heat, acid, or other agents that interfere with hydrogen bonding and usually causes a decrease in solubility (precipitation).
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 7.1.

| TABLE 7 I- Diseases Discussed in Chapter 7 |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| DISORDER OR CONDITION | GENETIC OR ENVIRONMENTAL | COMMENTS |
| Myocardial infarction | Both | Specific heart proteins analyzed include creatine kinase MB (heart-specific isozyme) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT, cardiacspecific isozyme). Myoglobin release is also elevated after a heart attack, but it is the least specific marker, whereas cTnT is the most specific marker for evidence of heart muscle damage. |
| Amyloidosis | Both | A generic name for the extracellular deposition of pathologic insoluble proteins, called amyloid, which are located in organs and tissues. In this chapter, the amyloid is derived from the immunoglobulin light chain. In this disorder, the amyloid will accumulate in the kidney and heart, leading to renal and cardiac related symptoms. |
| Sickle cell disease | Genetic | Hemoglobin $S$ polymerization under deoxygenated conditions, owing to hydrophobic interactions caused by the valine in position 6 of the $\beta$-chain, instead of glutamic acid. This leads to alterations in red blood cell shape, which causes occluded capillaries. The lack of blood flow through the capillaries will lead to hypoxia and tissue damage, which generates some of the pain endured during a sickle-cell crisis. |
| Diabetes, types I and 2 | Both | The use of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) to determine glycemic control in the diabetic patient. HbAlc is generated by the non-enzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin. The extent of this reaction is dependent on the glucose levels in the circulation. The higher the blood glucose levels, the greater the extent of glycosylation. |
| Prion diseases | Both | Protein aggregation diseases due to altered tertiary structure for proteins with the same, or slightly altered, primary structure; the aggregates which form precipitate in the brain, leading to eventual neural degeneration and loss of function |

D. They are formed by hydrogen bonding between two adjacent amino acids in the primary sequence.
E. They require a high content of proline and glycine.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is C. In the $\alpha$-helix, the oxygen atom of a carbonyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom four amino acids farther along the chain. Because proline's nitrogen is part of its cyclic structure, when proline is in a peptide bond, its nitrogen group lacks a proton and cannot form a hydrogen bond with the appropriate carbonyl oxygen atom. The bond angles within the proline ring are also incompatible with $\alpha$-helix formation, such that proline is known as a "helix breaker." None of the other amino acids listed has its nitrogen in a cyclic structure, so all can form the bond angles and hydrogen bonds necessary for an $\alpha$-helix.

2. The answer is B. Arginine is a charged polar amino acid and is water-soluble, whereas the others listed are nonpolar and hydrophobic and are not expected to be on the surface of a protein exposed to an aqueous environment.
3. The answer is B. The $\beta_{2}$-adrenergic receptor is a transmembrane protein that contains seven membranespanning domains and has intracellular and extracellular domains on either side of the membrane. It is composed primarily of $\alpha$-helices but not $\beta$-sheets. It does not contain an actin fold and is neither a globular protein nor a protein containing a nucleotide binding fold. The receptor is coupled to a GTP-binding protein (a G-protein), which does bind GTP or guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The receptor itself, however, does not bind nucleotides.
4. The answer is A. The characteristic staining of amyloid arises from fibrils of $\beta$-pleated sheet structure perpendicular to the axis of the fiber (thus, B, C, and D are incorrect). The native conformation of a protein is generally the most stable and lowest energy conformation, and the lower its energy state, the more readily a protein folds into its native conformation and the less likely it will assume the insoluble $\beta$-pleated sheet structure of amyloid (thus, E is incorrect).
5. The answer is A. The protein hydrolyzes ATP, which is a characteristic of the actin fold. None of the other folds described will hydrolyze ATP.
6. The answer is A. The binding affinity is described quantitatively by its association constant, $K_{a}$. The higher the $K_{m}$ the higher the affinity. Because $K_{A}$ is the reciprocal of $K_{\mathrm{a}}\left(1 / K_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$, the higher the affinity, the lower the $K_{B}$. Because the $\beta$-agonist has a higher affinity than adrenaline, its $K_{a}$ would be higher and its $K_{\mathrm{A}}$ would be lower than that of adrenaline.
7. The answer is E. The variable regions of the light and heavy chains interact to produce a single antigenspecific binding site (in this case, for the hepatitis A virus) at each branch of the Y-shaped immunoglobulin. The constant regions are not involved with specific immunity. The variable regions are physically separated such that they are not able to interact with each other (variable L with variable L or variable H with variable H). The variable region of a light chain is immediately adjacent to the variable region of a heavy chain, and they interact to form a single binding site.
8. The answer is B. Each IgG molecule contains two light and two heavy chains joined by disulfide bonds. Reduction of the disulfide bonds will lead to the separation of the light and heavy chains.
9. The answer is D. In nonenzymatic glycosylation, glucose present in blood binds to amino acids on hemoglobin forming an irreversible glycosylated protein through the lifetime of that red blood cell. Because the reaction is nonenzymatic, the rate of glycosylation is proportional to the concentration of the glucose present. Patients with consistently high blood glucose will have a high HbAlc , a marker of poor diabetic control. Oxidation and/or reduction is not involved with the formation of HbAlc .
10. The answer is B. The regular repeating structure of an $\alpha$-helix is possible because it is formed by hydrogen bonds within the peptide backbone of a single strand. Thus, $\alpha$-helices can be formed from a variety of primary structures. However, proline cannot accommodate the bends for an $\alpha$-helix because the atoms involved in the peptide backbone are part of a ring structure and glycine cannot provide the space-filling required for a stable structure.

FIGURE 8.1 Catalytic power of enzymes. Many enzymes increase the rate of a chemical reaction by a factor of $10^{11}$ or higher. To appreciate an increase in reaction rate by this order of magnitude, consider a room-sized box of golf balls that "react" by releasing energy and turning brown. The $12 \mathrm{ft} \times 12 \mathrm{ft} \times 8 \mathrm{ft}$ box contains 380,000 golf balls. If the rate of the reaction in the absence of enzyme were 100 golf balls per year, the presence of I molecule of enzyme would turn the entire box of golf balls brown in I second (assuming a $10^{11}$ increase in reaction rate).

Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts, which are compounds that increase the rate of chemical reactions (Fig. 8.1). Enzyme catalysts bind reactants (substrates), convert them to products, and release the products. Although enzymes may be modified during their participation in this reaction sequence, they return to their original form at the end. In addition to increasing the speed of reactions, enzymes provide a means for regulating the rate of metabolic pathways in the body. This chapter describes the properties of enzymes that allow them to function as catalysts. The next chapter explains the mechanisms of enzyme regulation.

Enzyme-Binding Sites. An enzyme binds the substrates of the reaction and converts them to products. The substrates are bound to specific substrate-binding sites on the enzyme through interactions with the amino acid residues of the enzyme. The spatial geometry required for all the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme makes each enzyme selective for its substrates and ensures that only specific products are formed.

Active Catalytic Sites. The substrate-binding sites overlap in the active catalytic site of the enzyme, the region of the enzyme where the reaction occurs. Within the catalytic site, functional groups provided by coenzymes, tightly bound metals, and, of course, amino acid residues of the enzyme, participate in catalysis.

Activation Energy and the Transition State. The functional groups in the catalytic site of the enzyme activate the substrate and decrease the energy needed to form the high-energy intermediate stage of the reaction known as the transitionstate complex. Some of the catalytic strategies employed by enzymes, such as general acid-base catalysis, formation of covalent intermediates, and stabilization of the transition state, are illustrated by chymotrypsin.
pH and Temperature Profiles. Enzymes have a functional pH range determined by the $\mathbf{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of the functional groups in the active site and the interactions required for three-dimensional structure. Increases of temperature, which do not lead to protein denaturation, increase the reaction rate.

Mechanism-Based Inhibitors. The effectiveness of many drugs and toxins depends on their ability to inhibit an enzyme. The strongest inhibitors are covalent inhibitors, compounds that form covalent bonds with a reactive group in the enzyme active site, or transition-state analogs that mimic the transition-state complex.

Enzyme Names. Most enzyme names end in "-ase." Enzymes usually have both a common name and a systematic classification that includes a name and an Enzyme Commission (EC) number.

## THE WAITING ROOM

A year after recovering from salicylate poisoning (see Chapter 4), Dennis V. was playing in his grandfather's basement. Dennis drank an unknown amount of the insecticide malathion, which is sometimes used for killing fruit flies and other insects (Fig. 8.2). Sometime later, when he was not feeling well, Dennis told his grandfather what he had done. Mr. V. retrieved the bottle and rushed Dennis to the emergency department of the local hospital. On the way, Dennis vomited repeatedly and complained of abdominal cramps. At the hospital, he began salivating and had an uncontrollable defecation.

In the emergency department, physicians passed a nasogastric tube for stomach lavage, started intravenous fluids, and recorded vital signs. Dennis's pulse rate was 48 beats/minute (slow), and his blood pressure was $78 / 48 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (low). The physicians noted involuntary twitching of the muscles in his extremities.

(1)Lotta T. was diagnosed with acute gouty arthritis involving her right great toe (see Chapter 5). The presence of insoluble urate crystals within the joint space confirmed the diagnosis. Several weeks after her acute gout attack subsided, Ms. T. was started on allopurinol therapy in an oral dose of 150 mg twice per day. Allopurinol therapy is effective because the drug inhibits the activity of a specific enzyme.

2Al M., a 44-year-old man who has been an alcoholic for the past 5 years, has a markedly diminished appetite for food. One weekend, he became unusually irritable and confused after drinking two $750-\mathrm{mL}$ bottles of scotch and eating very little. His landlady convinced him to visit his doctor. Physical examination indicated a heart rate of 104 beats/minute. His blood pressure was slightly low, and he was in early congestive heart failure. He was poorly oriented to time, place, and person.

## I. The Enzyme-Catalyzed Reaction

Enzymes, in general, provide speed, specificity, and regulatory control to reactions in the body. Enzymes are usually proteins that act as catalysts, compounds that increase the rate of chemical reactions. Enzyme-catalyzed reactions have three basic steps:

1. Binding of substrate (a reactant): $\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{S} \leftrightarrow \mathbf{E S}$
2. Conversion of bound substrate to bound product: $\mathbf{E S} \leftrightarrow \mathbf{E P}$
3. Release of product: $\mathbf{E P} \leftrightarrow \mathbf{E}+\mathbf{P}$

An enzyme binds the substrates of the reaction it catalyzes and brings them together at the right orientation to react. The enzyme then participates in the making and breaking of bonds required for product formation, releases the products, and returns to its original state once the reaction is completed.

Enzymes do not invent new reactions; they simply make reactions occur faster. The catalytic power of an enzyme (the rate of the catalyzed reaction divided by the rate of the uncatalyzed reaction) is usually in the range of $10^{8}$ to $10^{14}$. Without the catalytic power of enzymes, reactions such as those involved in nerve conduction, heart contraction, and digestion of food would occur too slowly for life to exist.

Each enzyme usually catalyzes a specific biochemical reaction. The ability of an enzyme to select just one substrate and distinguish this substrate from a group of very similar compounds is referred to as specificity (Fig. 8.3). The enzyme converts this substrate to just one product. The specificity as well as the speed of enzymecatalyzed reactions result from the unique sequence of specific amino acids that form the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme.

## A. The Active Site

To catalyze a chemical reaction, the enzyme forms an enzyme-substrate complex in its active catalytic site (Fig. 8.4). The active site is usually a cleft or crevice in the

FIGURE 8.2 Organophosphorus compounds. Malathion and parathion are organophosphorus insecticides. Nausea, coma, convulsions, respiratory failure, and death have resulted from the use of parathion by farmers who have gotten it on their skin. Malathion is similar in structure to parathion but is not nearly as toxic. The nerve gas sarin, another organophosphorus compound, was used in a terrorist attack in a subway in Japan.

Most, if not all of the tissues and organs in the body are adversely affected by chronic ingestion of excessive amounts of alcohol, including the liver, pancreas, heart, reproductive organs, central nervous system, and the fetus. Some of the effects of alcohol ingestion, such as the psychotropic effects on the brain or inhibition of vitamin transport, are direct effects caused by ethanol itself. However, many of the acute and chronic pathophysiologic effects of alcohol relate to the pathways of ethanol metabolism (see Chapter 33).

FIGURE 8.3 Reaction catalyzed by glucokinase, an example of enzyme reaction specificity. Glucokinase catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate $(P)$ from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to carbon 6 of glucose. It cannot rapidly transfer a phosphate from other nucleotides to glucose, or from ATP to closely related sugars such as galactose, or from ATP to any other carbon on glucose. The only products formed are glucose 6-phosphate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP).
enzyme formed by one or more regions of the polypeptide chain. Within the active site, cofactors and functional groups from the polypeptide chain participate in transforming the bound substrate molecules into products.

Initially, the substrate molecules bind to their substrate-binding sites, also called the substrate-recognition sites (see Fig. 8.4B). The three-dimensional arrangement of binding sites in a crevice of the enzyme allows the reacting portions of the substrates to approach each other from the appropriate angles. The proximity of the bound substrate molecules and their precise orientation toward each other contribute to the catalytic power of the enzyme.

The active site also contains functional groups that participate directly in the reaction (see Fig. 8.4C). The functional groups are donated by the polypeptide chain, or by bound cofactors (metals or complex organic molecules called coenzymes). As the substrate binds, it induces conformational changes in the enzyme that promote further interactions between the substrate molecules and the enzyme functional groups. (For example, a coenzyme might form a covalent intermediate with the substrate, or an amino acid side chain might abstract a proton from the reacting substrate.) The activated substrates and the enzyme form a transition-state complex, an unstable high-energy complex with a strained electronic configuration that is intermediate between substrate and product. Additional bonds with the enzyme stabilize the transition-state complex and decrease the energy required for its formation.

The transition-state complex decomposes to products, which dissociate from the enzyme (see Fig. 8.4D). The enzyme generally returns to its original form. The free enzyme then binds another set of substrates and repeats the process.

## B. Substrate-Binding Sites

Enzyme specificity (the enzyme's ability to react with just one substrate) results from the three-dimensional arrangement of specific amino acid residues in the enzyme that form binding sites for the substrates and activate the substrates during the course of the reaction. The "lock-and-key" and the "induced-fit" models for substrate binding describe two aspects of the binding interaction between the enzyme and substrate.

Functional groups of amino acid residues and cofactors in the active site participate in forming the transitionstate complex, which is stabilized by additional noncovalent bonds with the enzyme, shown in red.

# I. Lock-and-Key Model for Substrate Binding 

The substrate-binding site contains amino acid residues arranged in a complementary three-dimensional surface that "recognizes" the substrate and binds it through multiple hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, or hydrogen bonds. The amino acid residues that bind the substrate can come from very different parts of the linear amino acid sequence of the enzyme, as seen in glucokinase. The binding of compounds with a structure that differs from the substrate even to a small degree may be prevented by steric hindrance and charge repulsion. In the lock-and-key model, the complementarity between the substrate and its binding site is compared to that of a key fitting into a rigid lock.

## 2. Induced-Fit Model for Substrate Binding

Complementarity between the substrate and the binding site is only part of the picture. As the substrate binds, enzymes undergo a conformational change ("induced fit") that repositions the side chains of the amino acids in the active site and increases the number of binding interactions (see Fig. 8.4). The induced-fit model for substrate binding recognizes that the substrate-binding site is not a rigid "lock" but rather a dynamic surface created by the flexible overall three-dimensional structure of the enzyme.

The function of the conformational change induced by substrate binding, the induced fit, is usually to reposition functional groups in the active site in a way that promotes the reaction, improves the binding site of a cosubstrate, or activates an adjacent subunit through cooperativity. For example, consider the large conformational changes that occur in the actin fold of glucokinase when glucose binds. First, the substrate glucose binds in a manner resembling a lock and key (Fig. 8.5). As glucose binds, the induced fit results. The induced fit involves changes in the conformation of the whole enzyme that close the cleft of the fold, thereby improving the binding site for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and excluding water (which
![ma11950024193](ma11950024193.jpg)

FIGURE 8.5 Glucose-binding site in glucokinase. A. Glucose, shown in red, is held in its binding site by multiple hydrogen bonds between each hydroxyl group and polar amino acids from different regions of the enzyme amino acid sequence in the actin fold (see Chapter 7). The position of the amino acid residue in the linear sequence is given by its number. The multiple interactions enable glucose to induce large conformational changes in the enzyme (induced fit). (Modified from Pilkis SJ, Weber IT, Harrison RW, Bell GI. Glucokinase: structural analysis of a protein involved in susceptibility to diabetes. J Biol Chem. 1994;269:21925-21928.) B. Enzyme specificity is illustrated by the comparison of galactose and glucose. Galactose differs from glucose only in the position of the -OH group shown in red. However, it is not phosphorylated at a significant rate by the enzyme. Cells therefore require a separate galactokinase for the metabolism of galactose.

FIGURE 8.6 Conformational change resulting from the binding of glucose to hexokinase. (The figure is actually yeast hexokinase, which is more similar to human glucokinase than it is to the other human hexokinase isozymes.) The shaded and unshaded areas show the two domains (four subdomains) that form the actin fold with its adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cleft. A. Free enzyme. B. With glucose bound, the cleft closes, forming the ATP-binding site. The closure of the cleft when glucose binds to hexokinase (or human glucokinase) is one of the largest "induced fits" known. The combination of secondary structures in the actin fold that give hexokinase the flexibility required for this shift are discussed in Chapter 7, Section IV.B.I. "The Actin Fold." (From Bennett WS, Steitz TA. Structure of a complex between yeast hexokinase A and glucose II.

might interfere with the reaction) from the active site (Fig. 8.6). Thus, the multiple interactions between the substrate and the enzyme in the catalytic site serve both for substrate recognition and for initiating the next stage of the reaction, formation of the transition-state complex.

## C. The Transition-State Complex

In order for a reaction to occur, the substrates undergoing the reaction need to be activated. If the energy levels of a substrate are plotted as the substrate is progressively converted to product, the curve will show a maximum energy level that is higher than that of either the substrate or the product (Fig. 8.7). This high energy level occurs at the transition state. For some enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the transition state is a condition in which bonds in the substrate are maximally strained. For other enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the electronic configuration of the substrate becomes very strained and unstable as it enters the transition state. The highest energy level corresponds to the most unstable substrate configuration and the condition in which the changing substrate molecule is most tightly bound to participating functional groups in the enzyme. The difference in energy between the substrate and the transition-state complex is called the activation energy.

According to transition-state theory, the overall rate of the reaction is determined by the number of molecules acquiring the activation energy necessary to form the transition-state complex. Enzymes increase the rate of the reaction by decreasing this activation energy. They use various catalytic strategies, such as electronic stabilization of the transition-state complex or acid-base catalysis, to obtain this decrease.

Once the transition-state complex is formed, it can collapse back to substrates or decompose to form products. The enzyme does not change the initial energy level of the substrates or the final energy level of the products.

Because the transition-state complex binds more tightly to the enzyme than does the substrate, compounds that resemble its electronic and three-dimensional surface (transition-state analogs) are more potent inhibitors of an enzyme than are substrate analogs. Consequently, a drug developed as a transition-state analog would be highly specific for the enzyme it is designed to inhibit. However, transition-state analogs are highly unstable when they are not bound to the enzyme and would have great difficulty making it from the digestive tract or injection site to the site of action. Some of the approaches in drug design that are being used to deal with the
![ma12150024193](ma12150024193.jpg)

FIGURE 8.7 Energy diagram showing the energy levels of the substrates as they progress toward products in the absence of enzyme. The substrates must pass through the highenergy transition state during the reaction. Although a favorable loss of energy occurs during the reaction, the rate of the reaction is slowed by the energy barrier to forming the transition state. The energy barrier is referred to as the activation energy.

instability problem include designing drugs that are almost transition-state analogs but have a stable modification, designing a prodrug that is converted to a transitionstate analog at the site of action, and using the transition-state analog to design a complementary antibody.

If the structure of a transition state can be modeled, it can be used as an antigen for the production of abzymes (catalytic antibodies). These antibodies have an arrangement of amino acid side chains in their variable regions that is similar to the active site of the enzyme in the transition state. Consequently, they can act as artificial enzymes. For example, abzymes have been developed against analogs of the transition-state complex of cocaine esterase, the enzyme that degrades cocaine in the body. These abzymes have esterase activity, and monthly injections of the abzyme drug can be used to rapidly destroy cocaine in the blood, thereby decreasing the dependence of addicted individuals. (See Chapter 7 for antibody structure.)

# II. Strategies for Catalysis 

There are five major strategies used by enzymes to enable catalysis: general acidbase catalysis, covalent catalysis, metal-ion catalysis, catalysis by approximation, and cofactor catalysis. Some enzymes will use a combination of these strategies.

## A. General Acid-Base Catalysis

In general acid-base catalysis, a functional group on the protein either donates a proton (acid catalysis) or accepts a proton (general base catalysis) during the course of the reaction. An example of general acid-base catalysis is seen in the mechanism of chymotrypsin (see the chymotrypsin online module). During the course of this reaction, histidine 57 acts as a general base catalyst and accepts a proton from serine 195, activating the serine to act as a nucleophile. Later on in the reaction sequence, the protonated histidine 57 acts as a general acid catalyst and donates a proton to a product leaving the reaction.

## B. Covalent Catalysis

In covalent catalysis, the substrate is covalently linked during the course of the reaction to an amino acid side chain at the active site of the enzyme. Chymotrypsin (a protease, an enzyme that breaks peptide bonds) also exhibits covalent catalysis. Once histidine 57 activates serine 195 by removing its proton from the hydroxyl group on the side chain, the negatively charged oxyanion attacks the carbonyl group of the peptide bond to be cleaved by the enzyme, forming a covalent bond and tetrahedral intermediate. The substrate stays covalently linked to the enzyme through the course of the reaction.

## C. Metal-Ion Catalysis

Many enzymes contain required metal ions to allow catalysis to occur. In the case of carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme-bound zinc at the active site binds and orients water appropriately so it can participate in the reaction. In the absence of the active site zinc, the reaction occurs very slowly, if at all.

## D. Catalysis by Approximation

Catalysis by approximation refers to the enzyme forcing (through the formation of hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions between the enzyme and substrate) substrates to bind in a manner that places reactive groups in the appropriate orientation so a reaction can take place. Nucleoside monophosphate kinases use this type of mechanism to transfer a phosphate from a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside monophosphate, producing two nucleoside diphosphates.

In the stomach, gastric acid decreases the pH to I to 2 to denature proteins through disruption of hydrogen bonding. The protease in the stomach, pepsin, is a member of the aspartate protease superfamily, enzymes that use two aspartate residues in the active site for acidbase catalysis of the peptide bond. Why can they not use histidine like chymotrypsin?

Because most vitamins function as coenzymes, the symptoms of vitamin deficiencies reflect the loss of specific enzyme activities that depend on the coenzyme form of the vitamin. Thus, drugs and toxins that inhibit proteins required for coenzyme synthesis (e.g., vitamin transport proteins or biosynthetic enzymes) can cause the symptoms of a vitamin deficiency. This type of deficiency is called a functional deficiency, whereas an inadequate intake is called a dietary deficiency.

Most coenzymes are tightly bound to their enzymes and do not dissociate during the course of the reaction. However, a functional or dietary vitamin deficiency that decreases the level of a coenzyme will result in the presence of the apoenzyme in cells (an enzyme devoid of cofactor).

Ethanol is an "antivitamin" that decreases the cellular content of almost every coenzyme. For example, ethanol inhibits the absorption of thiamine, and acetaldehyde produced from ethanol oxidation displaces pyridoxal phosphate from its proteinbinding sites, thereby accelerating its degradation.

(1)Although coenzymes look as though they should be able to catalyze reactions autonomously (on their own), they have almost no catalytic power when not bound to the enzyme. Why?

## E. Cofactor Catalysis

In cofactor catalysis, a required cofactor for an enzyme usually forms a covalent bond with the substrate during the course of the reaction. Enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism use pyridoxal phosphate (derived from vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ ) to form a covalent bond during the course of the reaction.

## III. Functional Groups in Catalysis

The catalytic strategies as described in the previous section to increase the reaction rate are common to many enzymes. A variety of functional groups are used by different enzymes to carry out these catalytic strategies. Some enzymes, such as chymotrypsin, rely on amino acid residues within the active site. Other enzymes increase their repertoire by employing cofactors (nonprotein compounds that participate in the catalytic process) to provide a functional group with the right size, shape, and properties. They are generally divided into three categories: coenzymes (e.g., pyridoxal phosphate), metal ions (e.g., $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}, \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, or $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ), and metallocoenzymes (similar to the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$-heme in hemoglobin; see Chapter 7).

## A. Functional Groups on Amino Acid Side Chains

Almost all of the polar amino acids participate directly in catalysis in one or more enzymes (Table 8.1). Serine, cysteine, lysine, and histidine can participate in covalent catalysis. Histidine, because it has a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ that can donate and accept a proton at neutral pH , often participates in acid-base catalysis. Most of the polar amino acid side chains are nucleophilic and participate in nucleophilic catalysis by stabilizing more positively charged groups that develop during the reaction.

## B. Coenzymes in Catalysis

Coenzymes (cofactors) are complex nonprotein organic molecules that participate in catalysis by providing functional groups, much like the amino acid side chains. In humans, they are usually (but not always) synthesized from vitamins. Each coenzyme is involved in catalyzing a specific type of reaction for a class of substrates with certain structural features. Coenzymes can be divided into two general classes: activation-transfer coenzymes and oxidation-reduction coenzymes.

| Serine-OH | Alcohol dehydrogenase |

## I. Activation-Transfer Coenzymes

Activation-transfer coenzymes usually participate directly in catalysis by forming a covalent bond with a portion of the substrate; the tightly held substrate moiety is then activated for transfer, addition of water, or some other reaction. The portion of the coenzyme that forms a covalent bond with the substrate is its functional group. A separate portion of the coenzyme binds tightly to the enzyme. In general, coenzymes are nonprotein organic cofactors that participate in reactions. They may be covalently bound to enzymes (e.g., biotin), noncovalently bound such that they dissociate from the enzyme under cofactor deficiency conditions (e.g., thiamin), or become incorporated into a product of the reaction (e.g., coenzyme A [CoA], which is derived from pantothenic acid). Cofactors that are covalently or very tightly bound to nonenzyme proteins are usually called prosthetic groups. A prosthetic group, such as the heme in hemoglobin, usually does not dissociate from a protein until the protein is degraded.

Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) provides a good illustration of the manner in which coenzymes participate in catalysis (Fig. 8.8). It is synthesized in human cells from the vitamin thiamine by the addition of a pyrophosphate. This pyrophosphate provides negatively charged oxygen atoms that chelate $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, which then binds

## Resonance forms of ionized hydroxyethyl-TPP

FIGURE 8.8 The role of the functional group of thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP; the reactive carbon shown in red) in formation of a covalent intermediate. A. A base on the enzyme (enzB) abstracts a proton from thiamine, creating a carbanion (general acid-base catalysis). B. The carbanion is a strong nucleophile and attacks the partially positively charged keto group on the substrate. C. A covalent intermediate is formed, which, after decarboxylation, is stabilized by resonance forms. The uncharged intermediate is the stabilized transition-state complex.

$\Delta$To participate in general acid-base catalysis, the amino acid side chain must be able to extract a proton at one stage of the reaction and donate it back at another. Histidine ( $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}=6.0$ ) would be protorated at this low pH and could not extract a proton from a potential nucleophile. However, aspartic acid, with a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of $\sim 2$ can release protons at a $\mathrm{pH}=2$. The two aspartates work together to activate water through the removal of a proton to form the hydroxyl nucleophile.

$\Delta$In order for a substrate to react with a coenzyme, it must colide with a coenzyme at exactly the right angle. The probability of the substrate and coenzyme in free solution colliding in exactly the right place at the exactly right angle is very small. In addition to providing this proximity and orientation, enzymes contribute in other ways, such as activating the coenzyme by extracting a proton (e.g., TPP and CoA ) or polarizing the substrate to make it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.

Many people with alcoholism, like Al M., develop thiamin deficiency because alcohol inhibits the transport of thiamine through the intestinal mucosal cells. In the body, thiamine is converted to TPP. TPP acts as a coenzyme in the decarboxylation of $\alpha$-keto acids such as pyruvate and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate (see Fig. 8.9) and in the use of pentose phosphates in the pentose phosphate pathway. As a result of thiamin deficiency, the oxidation of $\alpha$-keto acids is impaired. Dysfunction occurs in the central and peripheral nervous system, the cardiovascular system, and other organs, which require a large amount of energy. tightly to the enzyme. The functional group that extends into the active site is the reactive carbon atom with a dissociable proton (see Fig. 8.8). In all of the enzymes that use thiamin pyrophosphate, this reactive thiamin carbon forms a covalent bond with a substrate keto group while cleaving the adjacent carbon-carbon bond. However, each thiamin-containing enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of a different substrate (or group of substrates with very closely related structures).

Coenzymes have very little activity in the absence of the enzyme and very little specificity. The enzyme provides specificity, proximity, and orientation in the substrate-recognition site, as well as other functional groups for stabilization of the transition state, acid-base catalysis, and so forth. For example, thiamin is made into a better nucleophilic attacking group by a basic amino acid residue in the enzyme that removes the dissociable proton ( $E n z B$ in Fig. 8.8), thereby generating a negatively charged thiamin carbon anion. Later in the reaction, the enzyme returns the proton.

CoA, biotin, and pyridoxal phosphate are also activation-transfer coenzymes synthesized from vitamins. CoA (CoASH), which is synthesized from the vita$\min$ pantothenate, contains an adenosine $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-bisphosphate that binds reversibly, but tightly, to a site on an enzyme (Fig. 8.9A). Its functional group, a sulfhydryl group at the other end of the molecule, is a nucleophile that always attacks carbonyl groups and forms acyl thioesters (in fact, the "A" in CoA stands for the acyl group that becomes attached). Most coenzymes, such as functional groups on the enzyme amino acids, are regenerated during the course of the reaction. However, CoASH and a few of the oxidation-reduction coenzymes are transformed during the reaction into products that dissociate from the enzyme at the end of the reaction (e.g., CoASH is converted to an acyl-CoA derivative, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left[\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right]$is reduced to NADH). These dissociating coenzymes are nonetheless classified as coenzymes rather than substrates because they are common to so many reactions, the original form is regenerated by subsequent reactions in a metabolic pathway, they are synthesized from vitamins, and the amount of coenzyme in the cell is nearly constant.

Biotin, which does not contain a phosphate group, is covalently bonded to a lysine in enzymes called carboxylases (see Fig. 8.9B). Its functional group is a nitrogen atom that covalently binds a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ group in an energy-requiring reaction. This bound $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ group is activated for addition to another molecule. In humans, biotin functions only in carboxylation reactions.

Pyridoxal phosphate is synthesized from the vitamin pyridoxine, which is also called vitamin $B_{6}$ (see Fig. 8.9C). The reactive aldehyde group usually functions in enzyme-catalyzed reactions by forming a covalent bond with the amino groups on amino acids. The positively charged ring nitrogen withdraws electrons from a bond in the bound amino acid, resulting in cleavage of that bond. The enzyme participates by removing protons from the substrate and by keeping the amino acid and the pyridoxal group in a single plane to facilitate shuttling of electrons.

These coenzymes illustrate three features all activation-transfer coenzymes have in common: (1) a specific chemical group involved in binding to the enzyme, (2) a separate and different functional or reactive group that participates directly in the catalysis of one type of reaction by forming a covalent bond with the substrate, and (3) dependence on the enzyme for additional specificity of substrate and additional catalytic power.

## 2. Oxidation-Reduction Coenzymes

Oxidation-reduction coenzymes are involved in oxidation-reduction reactions catalyzed by enzymes categorized as oxidoreductases. When a compound is oxidized, it loses electrons. As a result, the oxidized carbon has fewer H atoms or gains an O atom. The reduction of a compound is the gain of electrons, which shows in its structure as the gain of H , or loss of O . Some coenzymes, such as $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), can transfer electrons together with hydrogen and have unique roles in the generation of ATP from the oxidation of fuels.

FIGURE 8.9 Activation-transfer coenzymes. A. Coenzyme A (CoA or CoASH) and phosphopantetheine are synthesized from the vitamin pantothenate (pantothenic acid). The active sulfhydryl group, shown in red, binds to acyl groups (e.g., acetyl, succinyl, or fatty acyl) to form thioesters. B. Biotin activates and transfers $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to compounds in carboxylation reactions. The reactive $N$ is shown in red. Biotin is covalently attached to a lysine residue in the carboxylase enzyme. C. Reactive sites of pyridoxal phosphate. The functional group of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is a reactive aldehyde (shown in the yellow box) that forms a covalent intermediate with amino groups of amino acids (a Schiff base). The positively charged pyridine ring is a strong electron-withdrawing group that can pull electrons into it (electrophilic catalysis).

Other oxidation-reduction coenzymes work with metals to transfer single electrons to oxygen. Vitamin E and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) are oxidation-reduction coenzymes that can act as antioxidants and protect against oxygen free radical injury. The different functions of oxidation-reduction coenzymes in metabolic pathways are explained in Chapters 20 through 24. A subclass of oxidoreductases is given the name dehydrogenases because they transfer hydrogen (hydrogen atoms or hydride ions) from the substrate to an electron-accepting coenzyme such as $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$.

Oxidation-reduction coenzymes follow the same principles as activationtransfer coenzymes, except that they do not form covalent bonds with the substrate. Each coenzyme has a unique functional group that accepts and donates electrons and is specific for the form of electrons it transfers (e.g., hydride ions, hydrogen atoms, oxygen). A different portion of the coenzyme binds the enzyme. Like activationtransfer coenzymes, oxidation-reduction coenzymes are not good catalysts without participation from amino acid side chains on the enzyme.

The enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the transfer of electrons from lactate to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, illustrates these principles (Fig. 8.10). In the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate, lactate loses two electrons as a hydride ion, and a proton $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$is released. $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, which accepts the hydride ion, is reduced to NADH. The carbon atom with the keto group in pyruvate is not at a higher oxidation state than in lactate because both of the electrons in bonds between carbon and oxygen are counted as
![ma12850024193](ma12850024193.jpg)

FIGURE 8.10 The coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right)$accepting a hydride ion, shown in red, from lactate. $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$-dependent dehydrogenases catalyze the transfer of a hydride ion $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$from a carbon to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$in oxidation reactions such as the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes to acids. The positively charged pyridine ring nitrogen of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$increases the electrophilicity of the carbon opposite it in the ring. This carbon then accepts the negatively charged hydride ion. The proton from the alcohol group is released into water. NADP ${ }^{+}$functions by the same mechanism, but it is usually involved in pathways of reductive synthesis.

belonging to oxygen, whereas the two electrons in the carbon-hydrogen bond are shared equally between carbon and hydrogen.

The coenzyme $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$is synthesized from the vitamin niacin (which forms the nicotinamide ring), and from ATP (which contributes an adenosine monophosphate [AMP]). The adenosine diphosphate (ADP) portion of the molecule binds tightly to the enzyme and causes conformational changes in the enzyme. The functional group of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$is the carbon on the nicotinamide ring opposite the positively charged nitrogen. This carbon atom accepts the hydride ion (a hydrogen atom that has two electrons) transferred from a specific carbon atom on the substrate. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the substrate alcohol $(-\mathrm{OH})$ group then dissociates, and a keto group $(\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O})$ is formed. One of the roles of the enzyme is to contribute a histidine nitrogen that can bind the dissociable proton on lactate, thereby making it easier for $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to pull off the other hydrogen with both electrons. Finally, NADH dissociates.

## C. Metal lons in Catalysis (see also Section II.C)

Metal ions, which have a positive charge, contribute to the catalytic process by acting as electrophiles (electron-attracting groups). They assist in binding of the substrate, or they stabilize developing anions in the reaction. They can also accept and donate electrons in oxidation-reduction reactions.

The ability of certain metals to bind multiple ligands in their coordination sphere enables them to participate in binding substrates or coenzymes to enzymes. For example, $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ plays a role in the binding of the negatively charged phosphate groups of TPP to anionic or basic amino acids in the enzyme (see Fig. 8.8). The phosphate groups of ATP are usually bound to enzymes through $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ chelation.

The metals of some enzymes bind anionic substrates or intermediates of the reaction to alter their charge distribution, thereby contributing to catalytic power. The enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase ( ADH ), which transfers electrons from ethanol to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ to generate acetaldehyde and NADH, illustrates this role (Fig. 8.11). In the active site of ADH , an activated serine pulls a proton off the ethanol -OH group, leaving a negative charge on the oxygen that is stabilized by zinc. This electronic configuration allows the transfer of a hydride ion to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. Zinc is essentially fulfilling the same function in ADH that histidine fulfills in lactate dehydrogenase.

## D. Noncatalytic Roles of Cofactors

Cofactors sometimes play a noncatalytic structural role in certain enzymes, binding different regions of the enzyme together to form the tertiary structure. They also can serve as substrates that are cleaved during the reaction.

## IV. Optimal pH and Temperature

If the activity of most enzymes is plotted as a function of the pH of the reaction, an increase of reaction rate is usually observed as the pH goes from a very acidic level to the physiologic range; a decrease of reaction rate occurs as the pH goes from the physiologic range to a very basic range (Fig. 8.12). The reason for the increased activity as the pH is raised to physiologic levels usually reflects the ionization of specific functional groups in the active site (or in the substrate) by the increase of pH , and the more general formation of hydrogen bonds important for the overall conformation of the enzyme. The loss of activity on the basic side usually reflects the inappropriate ionization of amino acid residues in the enzyme.

Most human enzymes function optimally at a temperature of around $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. An increase of temperature from $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ increases the rate of the reaction by increasing the vibrational energy of the substrates. The maximum activity for most human enzymes occurs near $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ because denaturation (loss of secondary and tertiary structure) occurs at higher temperatures.

In humans, most of ingested ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde in the liver by ADH:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Ethanol }+ & \mathrm{NAD}^{+} \leftrightarrow \text { acetaldehyde } \\
& +\mathrm{NADH}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

ADH is active as a dimer, with an active site containing zinc present in each subunit. The human has at least seven genes that encode isozymes of ADH, each with a slightly different range of specificities for the alcohols it oxidizes.

The acetaldehyde produced from ethanol is highly reactive, toxic, and immunogenic. In Al M. and other patients with chronic alcoholism, acetaldehyde is responsible for much of the liver injury associated with this addiction.

0In the clinical laboratory, ethanol (in serum) is usually analyzed by coupling its oxidation to the formation of NADH using the enzyme ADH. $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$has a low extinction coefficient at 340 nm ; NADH has a much higher one. Thus, the increase in absorbance at 340 nm that occurs during the reaction indicates how much NADH was produced, which is directly proportional to the ethanol concentration in the serum. These reactions have been fully automated for the clinical lab.

FIGURE 8.II Liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol (shown in red) to acetaldehyde. The active site of liver ADH contains a bound zinc atom, and a serine side chain -OH , and a histidine nitrogen that participate in the reaction. The histidine pulls an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$off the active site serine, which pulls the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$off of the substrate -OH group, leaving the oxygen with a negative charge that is stabilized by zinc.

![ma13050024193](ma13050024193.jpg)

FIGURE 8.12 pH profile of an enzyme. The rate of the reaction increases as the pH increases from 6 to 7.4. The exact shape of the curve depends on the protonation state of active-site amino acid residues or on the hydrogen bonding required for maintenance of threedimensional structure in the enzyme. For the enzyme shown in the figure, the increase of reaction rate corresponds to deprotonation of the active-site histidine. At $\mathrm{pH}>8.5$, deprotonation of an amino-terminal $-\mathrm{NH}_{3}{ }^{+}$alters the conformation at the active site and the activity decreases. Other enzymes might have a lower pH maximum, a broader peak, or retain their activity in the basic side of the curve.

The symptoms experienced by Dennis V, resulted from inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholinesterase cleaves the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to acetate and choline in the postsynaptic terminal, thereby terminating the transmission of the neural signal (see Fig. 8.13). Malathion is metabolized in the liver to a toxic derivative (malaoxon) that binds to the active-site serine in acetylcholinesterase and other enzymes, an action similar to that of DFP. As a result, acetylcholine accumulates and overstimulates the autonomic nervous system (the involuntary nervous system, including the heart, blood vessels, and glands), thereby accounting for Dennis's vomiting, abdominal cramps, salivation, and sweating. Acetylcholine is also a neurotransmitter for the somatic motor nervous system, where its accumulation resulted in Dennis's involuntary muscle twitching (muscle fasciculations).

## V. Mechanism-Based Inhibitors

Inhibitors are compounds that decrease the rate of an enzymatic reaction. Mechanism-based inhibitors mimic or participate in an intermediate step of the catalytic reaction. The term includes transition-state analogs (see Section I.C) and compounds that can react irreversibly with functional groups in the active site.

## A. Covalent Inhibitors

Covalent inhibitors form covalent or extremely tight bonds with functional groups in the active catalytic site. These functional groups are activated by their interactions with other amino acid residues and are therefore far more likely to be targeted by drugs and toxins than amino acid residues outside the active site.

The lethal compound diisopropylphosphofluoridate (diisopropylfluorophosphate [DFP]) is an organophosphorus compound that served as a prototype for the development of the nerve gas Sarin and other organophosphorus toxins, such as the insecticides malathion and parathion (Fig. 8.13). DFP exerts its toxic effect by forming a covalent intermediate in the active site of acetylcholinesterase, thereby preventing the enzyme from degrading the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Once the covalent bond is formed, the inhibition by DFP is essentially irreversible and activity can only be recovered as new enzyme is synthesized. DFP also inhibits many other enzymes that use serine for hydrolytic cleavage, but the inhibition is not as lethal.

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) provides an example of a pharmacologic drug that exerts its effect through the covalent acetylation of an active site serine in the enzyme prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (cyclooxygenase). Aspirin resembles a portion of the prostaglandin precursor that is a physiologic substrate for the enzyme.

## B. Transition-State Analogs and Compounds that Resemble Intermediate Stages of the Reaction

Transition-state analogs are extremely potent and specific inhibitors of enzymes because they bind so much more tightly to the enzyme than do substrates or products. Drugs cannot be designed that precisely mimic the transition state because of its highly unstable structure. However, substrates undergo progressive changes in their overall electrostatic structure during the formation of a transition-state complex, and effective drugs of ten resemble an intermediate stage of the reaction more closely than they resemble the substrate. Medical literature of ten refers to such compounds as substrate analogs, even though they bind more tightly than substrates.

## I. Penicillin

The antibiotic penicillin is a transition-state analog that binds very tightly to glycopeptidyl transferase, an enzyme required by bacteria for synthesis of the cell wall (Fig. 8.14). Glycopeptidyl transferase catalyzes a partial reaction with penicillin that covalently attaches penicillin to its own active-site serine. The reaction is favored by the strong resemblance between the peptide bond in the $\beta$-lactam ring of penicillin and the transition-state complex of the natural transpeptidation reaction. Active-site inhibitors like penicillin that undergo partial reaction to form irreversible inhibitors in the active site are sometimes termed suicide inhibitors.

## 2. Allopurinol

Allopurinol, a drug used to treat gout, decreases urate production by inhibiting xanthine oxidase. This inhibition provides an example of an enzyme that commits suicide by converting a drug to a transition-state analog. The normal physiologic

FIGURE 8.13 A. Acetylcholinesterase normally catalyzes inactivation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in a hydrolysis reaction. The active-site serine forms a covalent intermediate with a portion of the substrate during the course of the reaction. B. Diisopropyl phosphofluoridate (DFP), the ancestor of current organophosphorus nerve gases and pesticides, inactivates acetylcholinesterase by forming a covalent complex with the active-site serine that cannot be hydrolyzed by water. The result is that the enzyme (Enz) cannot carry out its normal reaction, and acetylcholine accumulates.
![ma13350024193](ma13350024193.jpg)

FIGURE 8.14 The antibiotic penicillin inhibits the bacterial enzyme glycopeptide transpeptidase. The transpeptidase is a serine protease involved in cross-linking components of bacterial cell walls and is essential for bacterial growth and survival. It normally cleaves the peptide bond between two D-alanine residues in a polypeptide. Penicillin contains a strained peptide bond within the $\beta$-lactam ring that resembles the transition state of the normal cleavage reaction, and thus, penicillin binds very readily in the enzyme active site. As the bacterial enzyme attempts to cleave this penicillin peptide bond, penicillin becomes irreversibly covalently attached to the enzyme's active-site serine, thereby inactivating the enzyme.

![ma13450024193](ma13450024193.jpg)

FIGURE 8.15 Allopurinol is a suicide inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. A. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine, and xanthine to uric acid (urate) in the pathway for degradation of purine nucleotides. B. The oxidations are performed by a molybdenumo-oxo-sulfide coordination complex in the active site that complexes with the group being oxidized. Oxygen is donated from water. The enzyme (enz) can work either as an oxidase $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right.$ accepts the $2 \mathrm{e}^{-}$and is reduced to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ ) or as a dehydrogenase ( $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$accepts the $2 \mathrm{e}^{-}$and is reduced to NADH ). The figure only indicates that $2 \mathrm{e}^{-}$are generated during the course of the reaction. C. Xanthine oxidase is able to perform the first oxidation step and convert allopurinol to alloxanthine (oxypurinol). As a result, the enzyme has committed suicide; the oxypurinol remains bound in the molybdenum coordination sphere, where it prevents the next step of the reaction. The portion of the purine ring in green indicates the major structural difference between hypoxanthine, xanthine, and allopurinol.

(1)Lotta T. is being treated with allopurinol for gout, which is caused by an accumulation of sodium urate crystals in joints and joint fluid, particularly in the ankle and great toe. Allopurinol is a suicide inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is involved in the degradation of purine nucleotides AMP and GMP to uric acid (urate). Although both hypoxanthine and xanthine levels increase in the presence of allopurinol, neither compound forms crystals nor precipitates at this concentration. They are excreted in the urine.
function of xanthine oxidase is the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid (urate) in the pathway for degradation of purines (Fig. 8.15). The enzyme contains a molybdenum-sulfide (Mo-S) complex that binds the substrates and transfers the electrons required for the oxidation reactions. Xanthine oxidase oxidizes the drug allopurinol to oxypurinol, a compound that binds very tightly to a Mo-S complex in the active site. As a result, the enzyme has committed suicide and is unable to carry out its normal function, the generation of uric acid (urate).

## C. Heavy Metals

Heavy-metal toxicity is caused by tight binding of a metal such as mercury ( Hg ), lead $(\mathrm{Pb})$, aluminum $(\mathrm{Al})$, or iron $(\mathrm{Fe})$ to a functional group in an enzyme. Heavy metals are relatively nonspecific for the enzymes they inhibit, particularly if the metal is associated with high dose toxicity. Mercury, for example, binds to so many enzymes, of ten at reactive sulfhydryl groups in the active site, that it has been difficult to determine which of the inhibited enzymes is responsible for mercury toxicity. Lead provides an example of a metal that inhibits through replacing the normal

functional metal in an enzyme, such as calcium, iron, or zinc. Its developmental and neurologic toxicity may be caused by its ability to replace $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in two regulatory proteins important in the central nervous system and other tissues- $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-$ calmodulin and protein kinase C .

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

Dennis V. Dennis V. survived his malathion intoxication because he had ingested only a small amount of the chemical, vomited shortly after the agent was ingested, and was treated rapidly in the emergency department. Lethal doses of oral malathion are estimated at $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight for humans, although the correlation between dose and severity of toxicity is poor. Once it has been ingested, the liver converts malathion to the toxic reactive compound malaoxon by replacing the sulfur with an oxygen (Fig. 8.16). Malaoxon then binds to the active site of acetylcholinesterase and reacts to form the covalent intermediate. Unlike the complex formed between DFP and acetylcholinesterase, this initial acyl enzyme intermediate is reversible. However, with time, the enzyme-inhibitor complex "ages" (dealkylation of the inhibitor and enzyme modification) to form an irreversible complex.

Emergency department physicians used intravenous atropine, an anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agent, to antagonize the action of the excessive amounts of acetylcholine accumulating in cholinergic receptors throughout Dennis's body. They also used the drug pralidoxime (an oxime) to reactivate the acetylcholinesterase before aged complexes formed. Although this therapy has not been shown to be consistently effective in clinical trials, it is still used.

After several days of intravenous therapy, the signs and symptoms of acetylcholine excess abated, and therapy was slowly withdrawn. Dennis made an uneventful recovery.

Lotta T. Within several days of starting allopurinol therapy, Ms. T.'s serum uric acid level began to fall. Several weeks later, the level in her blood was normal. In order to prevent an acute attack of gouty arthritis, Ms. T. was given a daily dose of colchicine when she was started on the allopurinol (see Chapter 10).

3Al M. Al M. was admitted to the hospital and intravenous thiamin was initiated at a dose of $100 \mathrm{mg} /$ day (compared with the Recommended Dietary Allowance of $1.4 \mathrm{mg} /$ day). His congestive heart failure was believed to be the result, in part, of the cardiomyopathy (heart-muscle dysfunction) of acute thiamin deficiency known as beriberi heart disease. The cardiac and peripheral nerve dysfunction that result from this nutritional deficiency usually responds to thiamin replacement. However, an alcoholic cardiomyopathy can also occur in well-nourished patients with adequate thiamin levels. Exactly how ethanol, or its toxic metabolite acetaldehyde, causes alcoholic cardiomyopathy in the absence of thiamin deficiency is not completely understood.
![ma13550024193](ma13550024193.jpg)

FIGURE 8.16 The liver converts malathion to malaoxon by replacing a sulfur with an oxygen. Malaoxon will interact with acetylcholinesterase, inhibiting the enzyme. The initial inhibition is reversible with pralidoxime, but if not treated in time, the enzyme-inhibitor complex becomes resistant to oxime treatment.

At low concentrations of ethanol, liver ADH is the major route of ethanol oxidation to form acetaldehyde, a highly toxic chemical. Acetaldehyde not only damages the liver but it can also enter the blood and potentially damage the heart and other tissues. At low ethanol intakes, much of the acetaldehyde produced is safely oxidized to acetate in the liver by aldehyde dehydrogenases.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

Basic Reactions and Classes of Enzymes. In the following chapters, students will be introduced to a wide variety of reaction pathways and enzyme names. Although it may seem that the number of reactions is infinite, many of these reactions are similar and occur frequently in different pathways. Recognition of the type of reaction can aid in remembering the pathways and enzyme names, thereby reducing the amount of memorization required. You may wish to use this section for reference as you go through your first biochemical pathways.

The Enzyme Commission (EC) has divided the basic reaction types and the enzymes catalyzing them into six broad numbered classes: (1) oxidoreductases, (2) transferases, (3) hydrolases, (4) lyases, (5) isomerases, and (6) ligases. Each broad class of enzymes includes subsets of enzymes with a systematic name and a common name (e.g., dehydrogenases and kinases). For example, glucokinase (common name) has the systematic name ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, and its EC number is EC 2.7.1.2. The first " 2 " refers to the general class (transferase) of enzyme, followed by a period. The " 7 " refers to the specific number of subclasses within the transferase family of enzymes (in this case, the class that transfers a phosphate). The " 1 " denotes transfer to an alcohol receptor; and the final " 2 " yields a specific enzyme number for glucokinase.

Oxidoreductases. Oxidation-reduction reactions are very common in biochemical pathways and are catalyzed by a broad class of enzymes called oxidoreductases. Whenever an oxidation-reduction reaction occurs, at least one substrate gains electrons and becomes reduced, and another substrate loses electrons and becomes oxidized. One subset of reactions is catalyzed by dehydrogenases, which accept and donate electrons in the form of hydride ions $\left(\mathrm{H}^{-}\right)$or hydrogen atoms. Usually an electron-transferring coenzyme, such as $\mathrm{NAD}^{+} / \mathrm{NADH}$, acts as an electron donor or acceptor (e.g., see Figs. 8.10 and 8.11).

In another subset of reactions, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ donates either one or both of its oxygen atoms to an acceptor (e.g., see xanthine oxidase, Fig. 8.15). When this occurs, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ becomes reduced and an electron donor is oxidized. Enzymes participating in reactions with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ are called hydroxylases and oxidases when one oxygen atom is incorporated into a substrate and the other oxygen atom into water, or both atoms are incorporated into water. They are called oxygenases when both atoms of oxygen are incorporated into the acceptor. Most hydroxylases and oxidases require metal ions, such as $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$, for electron transfer.

Transferases. Transferases catalyze group transfer reactions-the transfer of a functional group from one molecule to another. If the transferred group is a high-energy phosphate (as shown in Fig. 8.3), the enzyme is a kinase; if the transferred group is a carbohydrate residue, the enzyme is a glycosyltransferase; if it is a fatty acyl group, the enzyme is an acyltransferase. A common feature of these reactions is that the group being transferred exists as a good leaving group on the donor molecule.

Another subset of group transfer reactions consists of transaminations (Fig. 8.17A). In this type of reaction, the nitrogen group from an amino acid is donated to an $\alpha$-keto acid, forming a new amino acid and the $\alpha$-keto acid corresponding to the donor amino acid. Enzymes that catalyze this last type of reaction are called transaminases or aminotransferases. The coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate is required for all transaminases (see Fig. 8.9C).

When the physiologically important aspect of the reaction is the compound synthesized, the transferase may be called a synthase. For example, the enzyme commonly called glycogen synthase transfers a glucosyl residue from uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucose to the end of a glycogen molecule. Its systematic name is UDP-glucose-glycogen glycosyltransferase.

![ma13650024193](ma13650024193.jpg)

FIGURE 8.17 A. An example of a group transfer reaction-a transamination. Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) on aspartate aminotransferase transfers an amino group from aspartate to the $\alpha$-keto acid ( $\alpha$-ketoglutarate) to form a new amino acid (glutamate). The enzyme was formerly called glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase. B. An example of a lyase. Aldolases catalyze carbon-carbon bond cleavage in reactions that are usually reversible. In glycolysis, the enzyme fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase cleaves a carbon-carbon bond in fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Aldolases have a lysine $\kappa$-amino group in the active site that participates in the reaction. C. An example of an isomerase. Isomerases rearrange atoms within a molecule. In the pathway of glycolysis, triose phosphate isomerase converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by rearranging hydrogen atoms. No other substrates or products of the reaction exist.

Hydrolases. In hydrolysis reactions, $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{N}$, or $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{S}$ bonds are cleaved by the addition of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in the form of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to the atoms forming the bond. The enzyme class names specify the group being cleaved (e.g., the enzyme commonly named chymotrypsin is a protease, a hydrolase that cleaves peptide bonds in proteins).

Lyases. The lyase class of enzymes consists of a diverse group of enzymes that cleave $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$, and $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{N}$ bonds by means other than hydrolysis or oxidation. Some of the enzymes that catalyze $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bond cleavage are called aldolases, decarboxylases (when carbon dioxide is released from a substrate), and thiolases (when the sulfur-containing nucleophile of cysteine or CoASH is used to break a carbon-carbon bond) (see Fig. 8.17B). The structures amenable to carbon-carbon bond cleavage usually require a carbonyl carbon that can act as an electron sink to stabilize the carbanion formed transiently when the carbon-carbon bond breaks.

This broad class of enzymes also includes dehydratases and many synthases. Dehydratases remove the elements of water from two adjacent carbon-carbon bonds to form a double bond. Certain enzymes in this group, such as certain group transferases, are commonly called synthases when the physiologically important direction of the reaction favors the formation of a carbon-carbon bond (e.g., citrate synthase).

Isomerases. Many biochemical reactions simply rearrange the existing atoms of a molecule; that is, create isomers of the starting material (see Fig. 8.17C). Enzymes that rearrange the bond structure of a compound are called isomerases, whereas enzymes that catalyze movement of a phosphate from one atom to another are called mutases.

Ligases. Ligases synthesize C-C, C-S, C-O, and C-N bonds in reactions coupled to the cleavage of a high-energy phosphate bond in ATP or another nucleotide. Carboxylases, for example, add $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to another compound in a reaction that requires ATP cleavage to provide energy (see Fig. 8.9B). Most carboxylases require the coenzyme biotin. Other ligases are named synthetases (e.g., fatty acyl-CoA synthetase). Synthetases differ from the synthases mentioned under "Lyases" and "Group Transferases" in that synthetases derive the energy for new bond formation from cleavage of high-energy phosphate bonds, and synthases use a different source of energy.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts-molecules that can accelerate the rate of a reaction.
- Enzymes are specific for various substrates because of the selective nature of the binding sites on the enzyme.
- The catalytic (active) site is the portion of the enzyme molecule at which the reaction occurs.
- Enzymes accelerate reaction rates by decreasing the amount of energy required to reach a high-energy intermediate stage of the reaction known as the transition-state complex. This is referred to as lowering the energy of activation.
- Enzymes use functional groups at the active site, provided by coenzymes, metals, or amino acid residues, to perform catalysis.
- Enzymes use general acid-base catalysis, formation of covalent intermediates, metal ions, cofactor catalysis, and transition-state stabilization as various mechanisms to accelerate reaction rates.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is B. In most reactions, the substrate binds to the enzyme before its reaction with the coenzyme occurs. Thus, the substrate may bind, but it cannot react with the coenzyme to form the transition-state complex. Each coenzyme carries out a single type of reaction, so no other coenzyme can substitute (thus, C is incorrect). The three-dimensional geometry of the reaction is so
specific that functional groups on amino acid side chains cannot substitute (thus, D is incorrect). Free coenzymes are not very reactive because amino acid side chains in the active site are required to activate the coenzyme or the reactants (thus, E is incorrect). However, increasing the supply of vitamins to increase the amount of coenzyme bound to the enzyme can sometimes help.

2. The answer is D. The patient was diagnosed with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) caused by this mutation. In glucokinase, binding of glucose normally causes a huge conformational change in the actin fold that creates the binding site for ATP. Although proline and leucine are both nonpolar amino acids, B is incorrect-proline creates kinks in helices and thus would be expected to disturb the large conformational change required (see Chapter 7). In general, binding of the first substrate to an enzyme creates conformational changes that increases the binding of the second substrate or brings functional groups into position for further steps in the reaction. Thus, a mutation need not be in the active site to impair the reaction, and A is incorrect. It would probably take more energy to fold the enzyme into the form required for the transition-state complex, and fewer molecules would acquire the energy necessary (thus, C is incorrect). The active site lacks the functional groups required for an alternate mechanism (thus, E is incorrect).
3. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. When the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of an ionizable group is below the pH value, the group will be deprotonated. When the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of an ionizable group is above the pH value, the group will be protonated. Thus, at pH 5.2 , glutamate 35 (with a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}=5.9$, which is $>5.2$ ) will remain protonated, and aspartate 52 (with a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}=4.5$, which is $<5.2$ ) will be ionized (because the side chain carries a negative charge when deprotonated). Therefore, E35 is protonated and D52 is ionized. There is sufficient information presented to answer this question.
4. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The glucose residue from UDPglucose is being transferred to the alcohol group of another compound. In isomerization reactions, groups are transferred within the same molecule (thus, B is incorrect). There is no cleavage or synthesis of carboncarbon bonds (thus, C and D are incorrect). Oxidationreduction has not occurred because no hydrogens or
oxygen atoms have been removed or added in the conversion of substrate to product.
5. The answer is C. Transfer of a carbohydrate residue from one molecule to another is a glycosyltransferase reaction. Kinases transfer phosphate groups, dehydrogenases transfer electrons as hydrogen atoms or hydride ions, transaminases transfer amino groups, and isomerases transfer atoms within the same molecule.
6. The answer is C. Malathion is a covalent inhibitor and forms an extremely tight bond with the active site of acetylcholinesterase (the enzyme) preventing its function. It does not help the enzyme as a coenzyme would and does not assist catalysis as a cofactor would.
7. The answer is B. Penicillin irreversibly binds to glycopeptidyl transferase, an enzyme required by bacteria for synthesis of the cell wall. Neither bacteria nor viruses have nuclei. Viruses have no cell wall. Protozoans have a nucleus but no cell wall. The enzyme inhibited is for cell wall synthesis and is only in bacteria. This is why penicillin is not useful in treating a viral or protozoan infection.
8. The answer is D. Most, but not all, coenzymes in humans are synthesized from vitamins. They are neither proteins nor carbohydrates but are complex organic molecules. They assist in the catalysis of a type of reaction, not just one reaction (coenzymes can associate with several different enzymes).
9. The answer is E. Thiamin acts via an activation-transfer mechanism, as does CoA. All the other listed coenzymes are of the oxidation-reduction group (tocopherol is vitamin E, niacin is part of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, riboflavin part of FAD, and ascorbic acid is vitamin C).
10. The answer is A. CoA, an activation-transfer coenzyme, is synthesized from the vitamin pantothenate. $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$is synthesized from niacin and pyridoxal phosphate from vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$. Folate and biotin are themselves vitamins.

FIGURE 9.1 The flux of substrates down a metabolic pathway is analogous to cars traveling down a highway. The rate-limiting enzyme is the portion of the highway that is narrowed to one lane by a highway barrier. This single portion of the highway limits the rate at which cars can arrive at their final destination miles later. Cars will back up before the barrier (similar to the increase in concentration of a precursor when a rate-limiting enzyme is inhibited). Some cars may exit and take an alternate route (similar to precursors entering another metabolic pathway). Moving the barrier just a little to open an additional lane is like activating a rate-limiting enzyme: It increases flow through the entire length of the pathway.

## Regulation of Enzymes

In the human body, thousands of diverse enzymes are regulated to fulfill their individual functions without waste of dietary components. Thus, with changes in our physiologic state, time of eating, environment, diet, or age, the rates of some enzymes must increase and those of others decrease. In this chapter, we describe the mechanisms for regulating enzyme activity and the strategies used to regulate the metabolic pathways in which they reside.

Regulation Matches Function. Changes in the rate of a metabolic pathway occur because at least one enzyme in that pathway, the regulatory enzyme, has been activated or inhibited, or the amount of enzyme has increased or decreased. Regulatory enzymes usually catalyze the rate-limiting, or slowest, step in the pathway, so that increasing or decreasing their rate changes the rate of the entire pathway (Fig. 9.1). The mechanisms used to regulate the rate-limiting enzyme in a pathway reflect the function of the pathway.

Substrate Concentration. The rate of all enzymes depends on substrate concentration. Enzymes exhibit saturation kinetics: their rate increases with increasing substrate concentration [S], but it reaches a maximum velocity ( $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$ ) when the enzyme is saturated with substrate. For many enzymes, the Michaelis-Menten equation describes the relationship between $\mathbf{v}_{\mathbf{i}}$ (the initial velocity of a reaction), [S], $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$ and the $\mathbf{K}_{\mathbf{m}}$ (the substrate concentration at which $v_{i}=1 / 2 \mathrm{~V}_{\text {max }}$ ).
Reversible Inhibition. Enzymes are reversibly inhibited by structural analogs and products. These inhibitors are classified as competitive, noncompetitive, or uncompetitive, depending on their effect on formation of the enzyme-substrate complex.

Allosteric Enzymes. Allosteric activators or inhibitors are compounds that bind at sites other than the active catalytic site and regulate the enzyme through conformational changes that affect the catalytic site.

Covalent Modification. Enzyme activity may also be regulated by a covalent modification such as phosphorylation of a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue by a protein kinase.

Protein-Protein Interactions. Enzyme activity can be modulated through the reversible binding of a modulator protein such as $\mathbf{C a}^{2+}$-calmodulin. Monomeric G-proteins (guanosine triphosphate [GTP]-binding proteins) activate target proteins through reversible binding.

Zymogen Cleavage. Some enzymes are synthesized as inactive precursors, called zymogens, that are activated by proteolysis (e.g., the digestive enzyme chymotrypsin).

Changes in Enzyme Concentration. The concentration of an enzyme can be regulated by changes in the rate of enzyme synthesis (e.g., induction of gene transcription) or the rate of degradation.

Regulation of Metabolic Pathways. The regulatory mechanisms for the ratelimiting enzyme of a pathway always reflects the function of the pathway in a particular tissue. In feedback regulation, the end product of a pathway directly or indirectly controls its own rate of synthesis; in feed-forward regulation, the substrate controls the rate of the pathway. Biosynthetic and degradative pathways are controlled through different but complementary regulation. Pathways are also regulated through compartmentation of enzymes unique to specific pathways.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\mathbf{O} \mathbf{O} \mathbf{O}$
AI M. is a 44-year-old man who has had a severe alcohol use disorder for the past 5 years. He was recently admitted to the hospital for congestive heart failure (see Chapter 8). After being released from the hospital, he continued to drink. One night he arrived at a friend's house at 7:00 P.M. Between his arrival and 11:00 P.M., he drank four beers and five martinis (for a total ethanol consumption of 9.5 oz ). His friends encouraged him to stay an additional hour to try and sober up. Nevertheless, he ran his car off the road on his way home. He was taken to the emergency department of the local hospital and arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. His blood alcohol concentration at the time of his arrest was $240 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, compared with the legal limit of ethanol for driving of $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $0.08 \%$ blood alcohol).

0Ann R., a 23-year-old woman, 5 ft 7 in tall, is being treated for anorexia nervosa (see Chapters 1 through 3). She has been gaining weight and is now back to 99 lb from a low of 85 lb . Her blood glucose is still below normal (fasting blood glucose $=72 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, compared with a normal range $=80$ to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). She complains to her physician that she feels tired when she jogs, and she is concerned that the "extra weight" she has gained is slowing her down. Regulation of various metabolic pathways is critical as Ann gains weight and strives to restore normal activity levels.

## I. General Overview

Although the regulation of metabolic pathways is an exceedingly complex subject, dealt with in most of the subsequent chapters of this text, several common themes are involved. Physiologic regulation of a metabolic pathway depends on the ability to alter flux through the pathway by activating the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the pathway (see Fig. 9.1). The type of regulation employed always reflects the function of the pathway and the need for that pathway in a particular tissue or cell type. Pathways that produce a necessary product are usually feedback-regulated through a mechanism that involves concentration of product (e.g., allosteric inhibition or induction/repression of enzyme synthesis), either directly or indirectly. The concentration of the product signals when enough of the product has been synthesized. Storage and toxic disposal pathways are usually regulated directly or indirectly through a feed-forward mechanism that reflects the availability of precursor. Regulatory enzymes are often tissue-specific isozymes whose properties reflect the different functions of a pathway in particular tissues. Pathways are also regulated through compartmentation, collection of enzymes with a common function within a particular organelle or at a specific site in the cell.

The mechanisms employed to regulate enzymes have been organized into three general categories: regulation by compounds that bind reversibly in the active site (including the dependence of velocity on substrate concentration and product levels), regulation by changing the conformation of the active site (including allosteric regulators, covalent modification, protein-protein interactions, and zymogen cleavage), and regulation by changing the concentration of enzyme (enzyme synthesis and degradation). We will generally be using the pathways of fuel oxidation to illustrate the role of various mechanisms of enzyme regulation in metabolic pathways (see Chapters 1 through 3 for a general overview of these pathways).

## II. Regulation by Substrate and Product Concentration

## A. Velocity and Substrate Concentration

The velocity (rate of formation of product per unit of time) of all enzymes is dependent on the concentration of substrate. This dependence is reflected in conditions

0When AI M. was stopped by police, he was required to take a Breathalyzer test. The Breathalyzer analyzes ethanol levels in expired air (assuming a ratio of I part ethanol in expired air to 2,100 parts ethanol in the blood). Once the sample enters the Breathalyzer, it is mixed with sulfuric acid, silver nitrate, and potassium dichromate. If ethanol is present, it will react with the potassium dichromate to form potassium sulfate, chromium sulfate, acetic acid, and water. Potassium dichromate generates a reddish-brown color; whereas chromium sulfate is light green. In the Breathalyzer device, the reacted sample is compared to a nonreacted sample, and the difference in light absorption (because of the different colors) is converted to an electrical current. The extent of current generated will lead to a determination of blood alcohol level (i.e., if there is no ethanol in the sample, no current will be generated). Other forms of gaseous ethanol determination use infrared spectroscopy or a fuel cell.

0AI M. was not able to clear his blood ethanol rapidly enough to stay within the legal limit for driving. Ethanol is cleared from the blood at about $0.5 \mathrm{oz} / \mathrm{hr}(15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL} / \mathrm{hr})$. Liver metabolism accounts for more than $90 \%$ of ethanol clearance from the blood. The major route of ethanol metabolism in the liver is the enzyme liver alcohol dehydrogenase ( ADH ), which oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde with generation of NADH .
$\mathrm{Ethanol}+\mathrm{NAD}^{+} \rightarrow$ acetaldehyde $+\mathrm{NADH}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$
The multienzyme complex MEOS (microsomal ethanol oxidizing system), which is also called cytochrome P450-2EI, provides an additional route for ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde in the liver and is used when ethanol levels are elevated.

One of the fuels used for jogging by Ann R.'s skeletal muscles is glucose, which is converted to glucose 6-phosphate by the enzymes hexokinase and glucokinase. Glucose 6-phosphate is metabolized in the pathway of glycolysis to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This pathway is feedbackregulated, so that as her muscles use ATP, the rate of glycolysis will increase to generate more ATP.
![ma13950024193](ma13950024193.jpg)

When she is resting, her muscles and liver will convert glucose 6-phosphate to glycogen (a fuel storage pathway, shown in ref). Glycogen synthesis is feed-forward-regulated by the supply of glucose and by insulin and other hormones that signal glucose availability. Glycogenolysis (glycogen degradation) is activated during exercise to supply additional glucose 6-phosphate for glycolysis. Unless Ann consumes sufficient calories, her glycogen stores will not be replenished after exercise and she will tire easily.

FIGURE 9.2 A graph of the MichaelisMenten equation, $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$ (solid red line) is the initial velocity extrapolated to infinite substrate concentration ([S]). $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ (dotted red line) is the concentration of $S$ at which $v_{i}=V_{\max } / 2$.
such as starvation, in which several pathways are deprived of substrate. In contrast, storage pathways (e.g., glucose conversion to glycogen in the liver) and toxic-waste disposal pathways (e.g., the urea cycle, which prevents $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ toxicity by converting $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ to urea) are normally regulated to speed up when more substrate is available. In the following sections, we use the Michaelis-Menten equation to describe the response of an enzyme to changes in substrate concentration, and we use glucokinase to illustrate the role of substrate supply in regulation of enzyme activity.

## I. The Michaelis-Menten Equation

The equations of enzyme kinetics provide a quantitative way of describing the dependence of enzyme rate on substrate concentration. The simplest of these equations, the Michaelis-Menten equation, relates the initial velocity ( $\mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ) to the concentration of substrate [S] (the brackets denote concentration) and the two parameters $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ (Equation. 9.1). The $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ of the enzyme is the maximal velocity that can be achieved at an infinite concentration of substrate, and the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the enzyme for a substrate is the concentration of substrate required to reach $1 / 2 \mathrm{~V}_{\max }$. The Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme kinetics applies to a simple reaction in which the enzyme and substrate form an enzyme-substrate complex (ES) that can dissociate back to the free enzyme and substrate. The initial velocity of product formation, $\mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{i}}$, is proportional to the concentration of ES complexes, [ES]. As substrate concentration is increased, the concentration of ES complexes increases, and the reaction rate increases proportionately. The total amount of enzyme present is represented by $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{t}}$.

For the reaction
Equation 9.1. The Michaelis-Menten equation.

$$
\mathrm{E}+\mathrm{S} \underset{k_{1}}{\stackrel{k_{1}}{\leftrightarrows}} \mathrm{ES} \xrightarrow{k_{2}} \mathrm{E}+\mathrm{P}
$$

the Michaelis-Menten equation is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{i}}=\frac{\mathrm{V}_{\max }[\mathrm{S}]}{K_{\mathrm{m}}+[S]} \\
& \text { where } K_{\mathrm{m}}=\left(k_{2}+k_{3}\right) / k_{1} \\
& \text { and } \mathrm{V}_{\max }=k_{3}\left[\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{t}}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

The graph of the Michaelis-Menten equation ( $\mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{i}}$ as a function of substrate concentration) is a rectangular hyperbola that approaches a finite limit, $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$, as the fraction of total enzyme present as ES complex increases (Fig. 9.2). At a hypothetical infinitely high substrate concentration, all of the enzyme molecules contain bound substrate, and the reaction rate is at $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$. The approach to the finite limit of $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ is called saturation kinetics because velocity cannot increase any further once the enzyme is saturated with substrate. Saturation kinetics is a characteristic property of all rate processes that depend on the binding of a compound to a protein.

The $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the enzyme for a substrate is defined as the concentration of substrate at which $\mathrm{v}_{\mathrm{i}}$ equals $1 / 2 \mathrm{~V}_{\max }$. The velocity of an enzyme is most sensitive to changes in substrate concentration over a concentration range below its $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ (see Fig. 9.2). As an example, at substrate concentrations less than one-tenth of the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$, a doubling of substrate concentration nearly doubles the velocity of the reaction; at substrate concentrations 10 times the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$, doubling the substrate concentration has little effect on the velocity.

The $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of an enzyme for a substrate is related to the dissociation constant, $K_{\mathrm{d}}$, which is the rate of substrate release divided by the rate of substrate binding $\left(k_{2} / k_{1}\right)$. For example, a genetic mutation that decreases the rate of substrate binding to the enzyme decreases the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate and increases the $K_{\mathrm{d}}$

FIGURE 9.3 The Lineweaver-Burk transformation (shown in the green box) for the Michaelis-Menten equation converts it to a straight line of the form $y=m x+b$. When the concentration of substrate ([S]) is infinite, $1 /[S]=0$, and the line crosses the ordinate ( $y$-axis) at $1 / v=1 / V_{\max }$. The slope of the line is $K_{m} / V_{\max }$. Where the line intersects the abscissa ( $x$-axis), $1 /[S]=-1 / K_{m}$.
and $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the enzyme for that substrate. The higher the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$, the higher is the substrate concentration required to reach $1 / 2 \mathrm{~V}_{\max }$.

## 2. The Lineweaver-Burk Transformation

The $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ for an enzyme can be visually determined from a plot of $1 / v_{1}$ versus $1 / S$ called a Lineweaver-Burk plot or a double-reciprocal plot. The reciprocal of both sides of the Michaelis-Menten equation generates an equation that has the form of a straight line, $y=m x+b$ (Fig. 9.3). $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ are equal to the reciprocals of the intercepts on the abscissa and ordinate, respectively. Although double-reciprocal plots are often used to illustrate certain features of enzyme reactions, they are not used directly for the determination of $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ values by researchers.

## 3. Hexokinase Isozymes Have Different $K_{m}$ Values for Glucose

A comparison between the isozymes of hexokinase found in red blood cells and in the liver illustrates the significance of the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of an enzyme for its substrate. Hexokinase catalyzes the first step in glucose metabolism in most cells-the transfer of a phosphate from ATP to glucose to form glucose 6-phosphate. Glucose 6-phosphate may then be metabolized in glycolysis, which generates energy in the form of ATP, or it can be converted to glycogen, a storage polymer of glucose. Hexokinase I, the isozyme in red blood cells (erythrocytes), has a $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for glucose of approximately 0.05 mM (Fig. 9.4). The isozyme of hexokinase called glucokinase, which is found in the liver and pancreas, has a much higher $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of approximately 5 to 6 mM . The red blood cell is totally dependent on glucose metabolism to meet its needs for ATP. At the low $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the erythrocyte hexokinase, blood glucose could fall drastically below its normal fasting level of approximately 5 mM , and the red blood cell could still phosphorylate glucose at rates near $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$. The liver, however, stores large amounts of "excess" glucose as glycogen or converts it to fat. Because glucokinase has a $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of approximately 5 mM , the rate of glucose phosphorylation in the liver will tend to increase as blood glucose increases after a high-carbohydrate meal and decrease as blood glucose levels fall. The high $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of hepatic glucokinase thus promotes the storage of glucose as liver glycogen or as fat but only when glucose is in excess supply.

## 4. Velocity and Enzyme Concentration

The rate of a reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of enzyme; if you double the amount of enzyme, you will double the amount of product

0Patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) have a rare genetic form of diabetes mellitus in which the amount of insulin being secreted from the pancreas is too low, resulting in hyperglycemia. There are several forms of the disease, all caused by a mutation in a single gene. One of the mutations in the gene for pancreatic glucokinase (a closely related isozyme of liver glucokinase) affects its kinetic properties ( $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ or $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ ). Glucokinase is part of the mechanism that controls release of insulin from the pancreas. Decreased glucokinase activity results in lower insulin secretion for a given blood glucose level.

0As
As Ann R. eats a high-carbohydrate meal, her blood glucose will rise to approximately 20 mM in the portal vein, and much of the glucose from her high-carbohydrate meal will enter the liver. How will the activity of glucokinase in the liver change as glucose is increased from 4 to 20 mM ? (Hint: Calculate $v_{1}$ as a fraction of $V_{\max }$ for both conditions, using a $K_{m}$ for glucose of 5 mM and the Michaelis-Menten equation.)

![ma14250024193](ma14250024193.jpg)

Glucokinase, which has a high $K_{m}$ for glucose, phosphorylates glucose to glucose 6-phosphate about twice as fast after a carbohydrate meal as during fasting. Substitute the values for $S$ and $K_{m}$ into the Michaelis-Menten equation. The initial velocity will be $0.44 \times \mathrm{V}_{\max }$ when blood glucose is at 4 mM and about $0.80 \times \mathrm{V}_{\max }$ when blood glucose is at 20 mM . In the liver, glucose 6-phosphate is a precursor for both glycogen and fat synthesis. Thus, these storage pathways are partially regulated through a direct effect of substrate supply. They are also partially regulated through an increase of insulin and a decrease of glucagon, two hormones that signal the supply of dietary fuel.

![ma14350024193](ma14350024193.jpg)

The liver ADH that is most active in oxidizing ethanol has a very low $K_{m}$ for ethanol, approximately 0.04 mM , and is at $>99 \%$ of its $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ at the legal limit of blood alcohol concentration for driving ( $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ or $\sim 17 \mathrm{mM}$ ). In contrast, the MEOS isozyme that is most active toward ethanol has a $K_{m}$ of approximately 11 mM . Thus, MEOS makes a greater contribution to ethanol oxidation and clearance from the blood at higher ethanol levels than at lower ones. Liver damage, such as cirrhosis, results partly from toxic by-products of ethanol oxidation generated by MEOS. AI M., who has a blood alcohol level of $240 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(\sim 52 \mathrm{mM})$, is drinking enough to potentially cause liver damage, as well as his car accident and arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. The various isozymes and polymorphisms of ADH and MEOS are discussed in more detail in Chapter 33.

![ma14450024193](ma14450024193.jpg)

FIGURE 9.4 A comparison between hexokinase I and glucokinase. The initial velocity ( $v_{i}$ ) as a fraction of maximum velocity ( $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ ) is graphed as a function of glucose concentration. The plot for glucokinase (heavy blue line) is slightly sigmoidal (S-shaped), possibly because the rate of an intermediate step in the reaction is so slow that the enzyme does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The dashed blue line has been derived from the Michaelis-Menten equation fitted to the data for concentrations of glucose $>5 \mathrm{mM}$. For S-shaped curves, the concentration of substrate (S) required to reach $1 / 2 \mathrm{~V}_{\max }$, or half-saturation, is sometimes called the $S_{0.5}$ or $K_{0.5}$ rather than $K_{m}$. At $v / V_{\max }=0.5$, for glucokinase, the $K_{m}$ is 5 mM and the $S_{0.5}$ is 6.7 mM .
produced per minute, whether you are at low or at saturating concentrations of substrate. This important relationship between velocity and enzyme concentration is not immediately apparent in the Michaelis-Menten equation because the concentration of total enzyme present $\left(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{t}}\right)$ has been incorporated into the term $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ (i.e., $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ is equal to the rate constant $k_{3} \times \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{t}}$ ). However, $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ is most of ten expressed as product produced per minute per milligram of enzyme and is meant to reflect a property of the enzyme that is not dependent on its concentration.

## 5. Multisubstrate Reactions

Most enzymes have more than one substrate, and the substrate-binding sites overlap in the catalytic (active) site. When an enzyme has more than one substrate, the sequence of substrate binding and product release affect the rate equation. As a consequence, an apparent value of $K_{\mathrm{m}}\left(K_{\mathrm{m}, \text { app }}\right)$ depends on the concentration of cosubstrate or product present.

## 6. Rates of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions in the Cell

Equations for the initial velocity of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, such as the Michaelis-Menten equation, can provide useful parameters for describing or comparing enzymes. However, many multisubstrate enzymes such as glucokinase have kinetic patterns that do not fit the Michaelis-Menten model (or do so under nonphysiologic conditions). The Michaelis-Menten model is also inapplicable to enzymes present in a higher concentration than their substrates. Nonetheless, the term $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ is still used for these enzymes to describe the approximate concentration of substrate at which velocity equals $1 / 2 \mathrm{~V}_{\max }$.

## B. Reversible Inhibition within the Active Site

One of the ways of altering enzyme activity is through compounds binding in the active site. If these compounds are not part of the normal reaction, they inhibit the enzyme. An inhibitor of an enzyme is defined as a compound that decreases the velocity of the reaction by binding to the enzyme. It is a reversible inhibitor if it is not covalently bound to the enzyme and can dissociate at a significant rate. Reversible inhibitors are generally classified as competitive, noncompetitive,

or uncompetitive with respect to their relationship to a substrate of the enzyme. In most reactions, the products of the reaction are reversible inhibitors of the enzyme producing them.

## I. Competitive Inhibition

A competitive inhibitor "competes" with a substrate for binding at the enzyme's substrate-recognition site and therefore is usually a close structural analog of the substrate (Fig. 9.5A). An increase of substrate concentration can overcome competitive inhibition; when the substrate concentration is increased to a sufficiently high level, the substrate-binding sites are occupied by substrate, and inhibitor molecules cannot bind. Competitive inhibitors, therefore, increase the apparent $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the enzyme ( $K_{\mathrm{m}, \text { app }}$ ) because they raise the concentration of substrate necessary to saturate the enzyme. They have no effect on $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$.

## 2. Noncompetitive and Uncompetitive Inhibition

If an inhibitor does not compete with a substrate for its binding site, the inhibitor is either a noncompetitive or an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to that particular substrate (see Fig. 9.5B). Uncompetitive inhibition is almost never encountered in medicine and will not be discussed further. To illustrate noncompetitive inhibition, consider a multisubstrate reaction in which substrates A and B react in the presence of an enzyme to form a product. An inhibitor ( $N I$ in Fig. 9.5B) that is a structural analog of substrate B would fit into substrate B's binding site, but the inhibitor would be a noncompetitive inhibitor with regard to the other substrate, substrate A. An increase of A will not prevent the inhibitor from binding to substrate B's binding site. The inhibitor, in effect, lowers the concentration of the active enzyme and therefore changes the $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$ of the enzyme. If the inhibitor has absolutely no effect on the binding of substrate A , it will not change the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for substrate A (a pure noncompetitive inhibitor).

Lineweaver-Burk plots provide a good illustration of competitive inhibition and pure noncompetitive inhibition (Fig. 9.6). In competitive inhibition, plots of $1 / v_{i}$ versus $1 /[\mathrm{S}]$ at a series of inhibitor concentrations intersect on the $y$-axis. Thus, at infinite substrate concentration, or $1 /[\mathrm{S}]=0$, there is no effect of the inhibitor. In pure noncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor decreases the velocity even when [S] has been extrapolated to an infinite concentration. However, if the inhibitor has no effect on the binding of the substrate, the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ is the same for every concentration of inhibitor, and the lines intersect on the x -axis.

Some inhibitors, such as metals, might not bind at either substrate-recognition site. In this case, the inhibitor would be noncompetitive with respect to both substrates.

## 3. Simple Product Inhibition in Metabolic Pathways

All products are reversible inhibitors of the enzymes that produce them and may be competitive or noncompetitive relative to a particular substrate. Simple product inhibition, a decrease in the rate of an enzyme caused by the accumulation of its own product, plays an important role in metabolic pathways: It prevents one enzyme in a sequence of reactions from generating a product faster than it can be used by the next enzyme in that sequence. As an example, product inhibition of hexokinase by glucose 6-phosphate conserves blood glucose for tissues that need it. Tissues take up glucose from the blood and phosphorylate it to glucose 6-phosphate, which can then enter several different pathways (including glycolysis and glycogen synthesis). As these pathways become more active, glucose 6-phosphate concentration decreases, and the rate of hexokinase increases. When these pathways are less active, glucose 6-phosphate concentration increases, hexokinase is inhibited, and glucose remains in the blood for other tissues to use.

FIGURE 9.5 A. Competitive inhibition with respect to substrate A.A and B are substrates for the reaction that forms the enzyme-substrate complex $(E-A B)$. The enzyme has separate binding sites for each substrate, which overlap in the active site. The competitive inhibitor (CI) competes for the binding site of A , the substrate it most closely resembles. B. NI is a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to substrate A.A can still bind to its binding site in the presence of NI. However, N is competitive with respect to $B$ because it binds to the B-binding site. In contrast, an inhibitor that is uncompetitive with respect to A might also resemble B , but it could only bind to the B site after A is bound.

A pure noncompetitive inhibitor binds to E and ES with the same affinity. If the inhibitor has different affinities for E and ES, the lines will intersect to either side of the $y$-axis, and the noncompetitive inhibitor will change both the $K_{\mathrm{m}}{ }^{\prime}$ and the $V_{\text {max }}{ }^{\prime}$. I, inhibitor; $P$, product; $E$, enzyme; $S$, substrate; $v_{n}$ initial velocity; $V_{\text {max }}$, maximum velocity.

Some of Al M.'s problems have arisen from product inhibition of liver ADH by NADH. As ethanol is oxidized in liver cells, $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$is reduced to NADH and the $\mathrm{NADH} /$ $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ratio rises. NADH is an inhibitor of ADH , competitive with respect to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, so the increased NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$ratio slows the rate of ethanol oxidation and ethanol clearance from the blood.

NADH is also a product inhibitor of enzymes in the pathway that oxidizes fatty acids. Consequently, these fatty acids accumulate in the liver; eventually contributing to the alcoholic fatty liver.

## III. Regulation through Conformational Changes

In substrate response and product inhibition, the rate of the enzyme is affected principally by the binding of a substrate or a product within the catalytic site. Most ratelimiting enzymes are also controlled through regulatory mechanisms that change the conformation of the enzyme in a way that affects the catalytic site. These regulatory mechanisms include (1) allosteric activation and inhibition, (2) phosphorylation or other covalent modification, (3) protein-protein interactions between regulatory and catalytic subunits or between two proteins, and (4) proteolytic cleavage. These types of regulation can rapidly change an enzyme from an inactive form to a fully active conformation.

In the following sections, we describe the general characteristics of these regulatory mechanisms and illustrate the first three with glycogen phosphorylase, glycogen phosphorylase kinase, and protein kinase A.

## A. Conformational Changes in Allosteric Enzymes

Allosteric activators and inhibitors (allosteric effectors) are compounds that bind to the allosteric site (a site separate from the catalytic site) and cause a conformational change that affects the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. Usually, an allosteric enzyme has multiple interacting subunits that can exist in active and inactive conformations, and the allosteric effector promotes or hinders conversion from one conformation to another.

## I. Cooperativity in Substrate Binding to Allosteric Enzymes

Allosteric enzymes usually contain two or more subunits and exhibit positive cooperativity; the binding of substrate to one subunit facilitates the binding of substrate to another subunit (Fig. 9.7). The first substrate molecule has difficulty in binding to the enzyme because all of the subunits are in the conformation with a low affinity for substrate (the taut " T " conformation) (see "Cooperativity of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Binding

in Hemoglobin" in Chapter 7, Section VII.B). The first substrate molecule to bind changes its own subunit and at least one adjacent subunit to the high-affinity conformation (the relaxed "R" state). In the example of the tetramer hemoglobin, discussed in Chapter 7, the change in one subunit facilitated changes in all four subunits, and the molecule generally changed to the new conformation in a concerted fashion. However, most allosteric enzymes follow a more stepwise (sequential) progression through intermediate stages (see Fig. 9.7).

## 2. Allosteric Activators and Inhibitors

Allosteric enzymes bind activators at the allosteric site, a site physically separate from the catalytic site. The binding of an allosteric activator changes the conformation of the catalytic site in a way that increases the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate.

In general, activators of allosteric enzymes bind more tightly to the high-affinity R state of the enzyme than the T state (i.e., the allosteric site is open only in the R enzyme) (Fig. 9.8). Thus, the activators increase the amount of enzyme in the active state, thereby facilitating substrate binding in their own and other subunits. In contrast, allosteric inhibitors bind more tightly to the T state, so either substrate concentration or activator concentration must be increased to overcome the effects of the allosteric inhibitor.
![ma14750024193](ma14750024193.jpg)

FIGURE 9.8 Activators and inhibitors of an allosteric enzyme (simplified model). This enzyme has two identical subunits, each containing three binding sites: one for the substrate (S), one for the allosteric activator (green triangle), and one for the allosteric inhibitor (two-pronged red shape). The enzyme has two conformations, a relaxed active conformation ( $R$ ) and an inactive conformation ( $T$ ). The activator binds only to its activator site when the enzyme is in the R configuration. The inhibitor-binding site is open only when the enzyme is in the T state.

A plot of velocity $\left(v / V_{\max }\right)$ versus substrate concentration reveals that binding of the substrate at its binding site stabilizes the active conformation so that the second substrate binds more readily, resulting in an $S$ (sigmoidal)-shaped curve. The graph of $v / V_{\max }$ becomes hyperbolic in the presence of activator (which stabilizes the high-affinity R form) and more sigmoidal with a higher $S_{0 S}$ in the presence of inhibitor (which stabilizes the low-affinity form).
![ma14850024193](ma14850024193.jpg)

FIGURE 9.7 A sequential model for an allosteric enzyme. The sequential model is actually the preferred path from the $T_{0}$ (taut, with 0 substrate, $S$, bound) low-affinity conformation to the $\mathrm{R}_{4}$ (relaxed, with four substrate molecules bound) conformation, taken from an array of all possible equilibrium conformations that differ by the conformation of only one subunit. The final result is a stepwise path in which intermediate conformations exist, and subunits may change conformations independently, depending on their geometric relationship to the subunits already containing bound substrate.

Phosphorylated protein
FIGURE 9.9 Protein kinases and protein phosphatases. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; $A D P$, adenosine diphosphate.

In the absence of activator, a plot of velocity versus substrate concentration for an allosteric enzyme usually results in a sigmoid or S-shaped curve (rather than the rectangular hyperbola of Michaelis-Menten enzymes) as the successive binding of substrate molecules activates additional subunits (see Fig. 9.8). In plots of velocity versus substrate concentration, the effect of an allosteric activator generally makes the sigmoidal S-shaped curve more like the rectangular hyperbola, with a substantial decrease in the $\mathrm{S}_{0.5}\left(K_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ of the enzyme, because the activator changes all of the subunits to the highaffinity state. These allosteric effectors alter the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ but not the $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ of the enzyme. An allosteric inhibitor makes it more difficult for substrate or activators to convert the subunits to the most active conformation, and, therefore, inhibitors generally shift the curve to the right, either increasing the $\mathrm{S}_{0.5}$ alone or increasing it together with a decrease in the $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$.

Some of the rate-limiting enzymes in the pathways of fuel oxidation (e.g., muscle glycogen phosphorylase in glycogenolysis, phosphofructokinase-1 in glycolysis, and isocitrate dehydrogenase in the tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle) are allosteric enzymes regulated by changes in the concentration of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or adenosine monophosphate (AMP) which are allosteric activators. The function of fuel oxidation pathways is the generation of ATP. When the concentration of ATP in a muscle cell begins to decrease, ADP and AMP increase; ADP activates isocitrate dehydrogenase, and AMP activates glycogen phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase-1. The response is very fast, and small changes in the concentration of activator can cause large changes in the rate of the reaction.

## 3. Allosteric Enzymes in Metabolic Pathways

Regulation of enzymes by allosteric effectors provides several advantages over other methods of regulation. Allosteric inhibitors usually have a much stronger effect on enzyme velocity than competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors in the active catalytic site. Because allosteric effectors do not occupy the catalytic site, they may function as activators. Thus, allosteric enzymes are not limited to regulation through inhibition. Furthermore, the allosteric effector need not bear any resemblance to substrate or product of the enzyme. Finally, the effect of an allosteric effector is rapid, occurring as soon as its concentration changes in the cell. These features of allosteric enzymes are often essential for feedback regulation of metabolic pathways by end products of the pathway or by signal molecules that coordinate multiple pathways.

## B. Conformational Changes from Covalent Modification

## I. Phosphorylation

The activity of many enzymes is regulated through phosphorylation by a protein kinase or dephosphorylation by a protein phosphatase (Fig. 9.9). Serine/threonine protein kinases transfer a phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a specific serine (and sometimes threonine) on the target enzyme; tyrosine kinases transfer a phosphate to the hydroxyl group of a specific tyrosine residue. Phosphate is a bulky, negatively charged residue that interacts with other nearby amino acid residues of the protein to create a conformational change at the catalytic site. The conformational change is caused by alterations in ionic interactions and/or hydrogen bond patterns resulting from the presence of the phosphate group. The conformational change makes certain enzymes more active and other enzymes less active. The effect is reversed by a specific protein phosphatase that removes the phosphate by hydrolysis.

## 2. Muscle Glycogen Phosphorylase

Muscle glycogen phosphorylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway of glycogen degradation, degrades glycogen to glucose 1-phosphate. It is regulated by the allosteric activator AMP, which increases in the cell as ATP is used for muscular contraction (Fig. 9.10) Thus, a rapid increase in the rate of glycogen degradation to glucose 1-phosphate is achieved when an increase of AMP signals that more fuel is needed for ATP generation in the glycolytic pathway.

![ma15050024193](ma15050024193.jpg)

FIGURE 9.10 Activation of muscle glycogen phosphorylase by adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and by phosphorylation. Muscle glycogen phosphorylase is composed of two identical subunits. The substrate-binding sites in the active catalytic site are denoted by S. AMP binds to the allosteric site, a site separate from the active catalytic site. Glycogen phosphorylase kinase can transfer a phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to one serine residue in each subunit. Either phosphorylation or binding of AMP causes a change in the active site that increases the activity of the enzyme. The first event at one subunit facilitates the subsequent events that convert the enzyme to the fully active form. ADP, adenosine diphosphate.

Glycogen phosphorylase also can be activated through phosphorylation by glycogen phosphorylase kinase. Either phosphorylation or AMP binding can change the enzyme to a fully active conformation. The phosphate is removed by protein phosphatase-1. Glycogen phosphorylase kinase links the activation of muscle glycogen phosphorylase to changes in the level of the hormone adrenaline (epinephrine) in the blood. It is regulated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A and by activation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin (a modulator protein) during contraction.

## 3. Protein Kinase $A$

Some protein kinases, called dedicated protein kinases, are tightly bound to a single protein and regulate only the protein to which they are tightly bound. However, other protein kinases and protein phosphatases simultaneously regulate several rate-limiting enzymes in a cell to achieve a coordinated response. For example, protein kinase A, a serine/ threonine protein kinase, phosphorylates several enzymes that regulate different metabolic pathways. One of these enzymes is glycogen phosphorylase kinase (see Fig. 9.10).

Protein kinase A provides a means for hormones to control metabolic pathways. Epinephrine and many other hormones increase the intracellular concentration of the allosteric regulator $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-cyclic AMP (cAMP), which is referred to as a hormonal second messenger (Fig. 9.11A). cAMP binds to regulatory subunits of protein kinase A, which dissociate and release the activated catalytic subunits (see Fig. 9.11B). Dissociation of inhibitory regulatory subunits is a common theme in enzyme regulation. The active catalytic subunits phosphorylate glycogen phosphorylase kinase and other enzymes at serine and threonine residues.

In the example shown in Figure 9.10, epinephrine indirectly increases cAMP, which activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates and activates glycogen phosphorylase kinase, which phosphorylates and activates glycogen phosphorylase. The sequence of events in which one kinase phosphorylates another kinase is called a phosphorylation cascade. Because each stage of the phosphorylation cascade is associated with one enzyme molecule activating many enzyme molecules, the initial activating event is greatly amplified.

## 4. Other Covalent Modifications

Many proteins are modified covalently by the addition of groups such as acetyl, ADP-ribose, or lipid moieties (see Chapter 6). These modifications may activate

When Ann R. begins to jog. AMP activates her muscle glycogen phosphorylase, which degrades glycogen to glucose 1-phosphate. This compound is converted to glucose 6-phosphate, which feeds into the glycolytic pathway to generate ATP for muscle contraction. As she continues to jog, her adrenaline (epinephrine) levels rise, producing the signal that activates glycogen phosphorylase kinase. This enzyme phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase, causing it to remain active even as AMP levels may drop (see Fig. 9.10).

FIGURE 9.12 Calcium-calmodulin has four binding sites for calcium (shown in green). Each calcium forms a multiligand coordination sphere by simultaneously binding several amino acid residues on calmodulin. Thus, calmodulin can create large conformational changes in proteins to which it is bound when calcium binds. Calmodulin has a flexible region in the middle connecting the two domains.
or inhibit the enzyme directly. However, they also may modify the ability of the enzyme to interact with other proteins or to reach its correct location in the cell.

## C. Conformational Changes Regulated by Protein-Protein Interactions

Changes in the conformation of the active site can also be regulated by direct protein-protein interaction. This type of regulation is illustrated by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-$ calmodulin and small (monomeric) GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins).

## I. The Calcium-Calmodulin Family of Modulator Proteins

Modulator proteins bind to other proteins and regulate their activity by causing a conformational change at the catalytic site or by blocking the catalytic site (steric hindrance). They are protein allosteric effectors that can either activate or inhibit the enzyme or protein to which they bind.
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin is an example of a dissociable modulator protein that binds to several different proteins and regulates their function in either a positive or negative manner. It also exists in the cytosol and functions as a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding protein (Fig. 9.12). The center of the symmetric molecule is a hinge region that bends as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin folds over the protein it is regulating.

One of the enzymes activated by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin is muscle glycogen phosphorylase kinase (see Fig. 9.10), which is also activated by protein kinase A. When a neural impulse triggers $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to the calmodulin subunit of muscle glycogen phosphorylase kinase, which undergoes a conformational change. This conformational change leads to the activation of glycogen phosphorylase kinase, which then phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase, ultimately increasing the synthesis of ATP to supply energy for muscle contraction. Simultaneously, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to troponin C , a member of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin superfamily that serves as a nondissociable regulatory subunit of troponin, a regulator of muscle contraction. Calcium binding to troponin prepares the muscle for contraction. Thus, the supply of energy for contraction is activated simultaneously with the contraction machinery.

## 2. G-Proteins

The masters of regulation through reversible protein association in the cell are the monomeric G-proteins, small single-subunit proteins that bind and hydrolyze GTP. GTP is a purine nucleotide that, like ATP, contains high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds that release energy when hydrolyzed. When G-proteins bind GTP, their conformation changes so that they can bind to a target protein, which is then either activated or inhibited in carrying out its function (Fig. 9.13, Step 1).

G-proteins are said to possess an internal clock because they are GTPases that slowly hydrolyze their own bound GTP to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and phosphate. As they hydrolyze GTP, their conformation changes and the complex they have formed with the target protein disassembles (see Fig. 9.13, Step 2). The bound GDP on the inactive G-protein is eventually replaced by GTP, and the process can begin again (see Fig. 9.13, Step 3).

The activity of many G-proteins is regulated by accessory proteins (GAPs [GTPase-activating proteins], GEFs [guanine nucleotide exchange factors], and GDIs [GDP dissociation inhibitors]), which may, in turn, be regulated by allosteric effectors. GAPs increase the rate of GTP hydrolysis by the G-protein and therefore the rate of dissociation of the G-protein-target protein complex (see Fig. 9.13, Step 2). When a GEF protein binds to a G-protein, it increases the rate of GTP exchange for a bound GDP and therefore activates the G-protein (see Fig. 9.13, Step 3). GDI proteins bind to the GDP-G-protein complex and inhibit dissociation of GDP, thereby keeping the G-protein inactive.

The Ras superfamily of small G-proteins is divided into five families: Ras, Rho, Arf, Rab, and Ran. These monomeric G-proteins play major roles in the regulation of cell growth, morphogenesis, cell motility, axonal guidance, cytokinesis, and trafficking through the Golgi, nucleus, and endosomes. They are generally bound to a lipid membrane through a lipid anchor, such as a myristoyl group or farnesyl group, and regulate the assembly and activity of protein complexes at these sites. The functions of some of these G-proteins will be discussed further in Chapters 10 and 11.

## D. Proteolytic Cleavage

Although many enzymes undergo some cleavage during synthesis, others enter lysosomes, secretory vesicles, or are synthesized as proenzymes, which are precursor proteins that must undergo proteolytic cleavage to become fully functional. Unlike most other forms of regulation, proteolytic cleavage is irreversible.

The precursor proteins of proteases (enzymes that cleave specific peptide bonds) are called zymogens. To denote the inactive zymogen form of an enzyme, the name is modified by addition of the suffix "-ogen" or the prefix "pro-" The synthesis of zymogens as inactive precursors prevents them from cleaving proteins prematurely at their sites of synthesis or secretion. Chymotrypsinogen, for example, is stored in vesicles within pancreatic cells until secreted into ducts leading to the intestinal lumen. In the digestive tract, chymotrypsinogen is converted to chymotrypsin by the proteolytic enzyme trypsin, which cleaves off a small peptide from the N -terminal region (and two internal peptides). This cleavage activates chymotrypsin by causing a conformational change in the spacing of amino acid residues around the binding site for the denatured protein substrate and around the catalytic site.

Most of the proteases involved in blood clotting are zymogens, such as fibrinogen and prothrombin, which circulate in blood in the inactive form. They are cleaved to the active form (fibrin and thrombin, respectively) by other proteases, which have been activated by their attachment to the site of injury in a blood vessel wall. Thus, clots form at the site of injury and not randomly in the circulation (see Chapter 43).

## IV. Regulation through Changes in Amount of Enzyme

Tissues continuously adjust the rate at which proteins are synthesized to vary the amount of different enzymes present. The expression for $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ in the MichaelisMenten equation incorporates the concept that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the amount of enzyme present. Thus, the maximal capacity of a tissue can change with increased protein synthesis or with increased protein degradation.

## A. Regulated Enzyme Synthesis

Protein synthesis begins with the process of gene transcription, transcribing the genetic code for that protein from DNA into messenger RNA. The code in messenger RNA is then translated into the primary amino acid sequence of the protein. Generally, the rate of enzyme synthesis is regulated by increasing or decreasing the rate of gene transcription, processes that are generally referred to as induction (increase) and repression (decrease). However, the rate of enzyme synthesis is sometimes regulated through stabilization of the messenger RNA. (These processes are covered in Section III of this text.) Compared with the more immediate types of regulation discussed previously, regulation by means of induction/repression of enzyme synthesis is usually slow in humans, occurring over hours to days.

## B. Regulated Protein Degradation

The content of an enzyme in the cell can be altered through selective regulated degradation as well as through regulated synthesis. For example, during fasting
![ma15450024193](ma15450024193.jpg)

FIGURE 9.13 Monomeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G-proteins). Step 1:When GTP is bound, the conformation of the G-protein allows it to bind target proteins, which are then activated (as shown), or inhibited. Step 2: The G-protein hydrolyzes a phosphate from GTP to form guanosine diphosphate (GDP), which changes the G-protein conformation and causes it to dissociate from the target protein. Step 3: GDP is exchanged for GTP, which reactivates the G-protein.

The maximum capacity of MEOS (cytochrome P450-2E1) is increased in the liver with continued ingestion of ethanol through a mechanism involving induction of gene transcription. Thus, Al M. has a higher capacity to oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde than a naive drinker (a person not previously subjected to alcohol). Nevertheless, the persistence of his elevated blood alcohol level shows that he has saturated his capacity for ethanol oxidation (i.e., the enzyme is always running at $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ ). Once his enzymes are operating near $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ any additional ethanol he drinks will not appreciably increase the rate of ethanol clearance from his blood.

or infective stress, protein degradation in skeletal muscle is activated to increase the supply of amino acids in the blood for gluconeogenesis or for the synthesis of antibodies and other components of the immune response. Under these conditions, synthesis of ubiquitin, a protein that targets proteins for degradation in proteosomes, is increased by the steroid hormone cortisol. Although all proteins in the cell can be degraded with a characteristic half-life within lysosomes, protein degradation via two specialized systems, proteosomes and caspases, is highly selective and regulated. Protein degradation is discussed in more detail in Chapter 35.

# V. Regulation of Metabolic Pathways 

The different means of regulating enzyme activity described earlier are used to control metabolic pathways, cellular events, and physiologic processes to match the body's requirements. Although there are hundreds of metabolic pathways in the body, there are a few common themes or principles are involved in their regulation. The overriding principle is that regulation of a pathway matches its function.

## A. Principles of Pathway Regulation

Metabolic pathways are a series of sequential reactions in which the product of one reaction is the substrate of the next reaction (Fig. 9.14). Each step or reaction is usually catalyzed by a separate enzyme. The enzymes of a pathway have a common function-conversion of substrate to the final end products of the pathway. A pathway also may have a branch point at which an intermediate becomes the precursor for another pathway.

## I. Role of the Rate-Limiting Step in Regulation

Pathways are principally regulated at one key enzyme, the regulatory enzyme, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pathway. This is the slowest step and usually is not readily reversible. Thus, changes in the rate-limiting step can influence flux through the rest of the pathway (see Fig. 9.1). The rate-limiting step is usually the first committed step in a pathway or a reaction that is related to or influenced by the first committed step. Additional regulated enzymes occur after each metabolic branchpoint to direct flow into the branch (e.g., in Fig. 9.14, feedback inhibition of
![ma15550024193](ma15550024193.jpg)

FIGURE 9.14 A common pattern for feedback inhibition of metabolic pathways. The letters represent compounds formed from different enzymes in the reaction pathway. Compound $B$ is at a metabolic branch point: It can go down one pathway to $E$ or down an alternate pathway to G. The end product of the pathway, E, might control its own synthesis by allosterically inhibiting enzyme 2, the first committed step of the pathway, or by inhibiting transcription of the gene for enzyme 2. As a result of the feedback inhibition, B accumulates and more B enters the pathway for conversion to G, which could be a storage pathway or a disposal pathway. In this hypothetical pathway, B is a product inhibitor of enzyme I, competitive with respect to A. Precursor A might induce the synthesis of enzyme I, which would allow more A to go to G.

enzyme 2 results in accumulation of B, which enzyme 5 then uses for synthesis of compound G). Inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme in a pathway usually leads to accumulation of the pathway precursor.

## 2. Feedback Regulation

Feedback regulation refers to a situation in which the end product of a pathway controls its own rate of synthesis (see Fig. 9.14). Feedback regulation usually involves allosteric regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme by the end product of a pathway (or a compound that reflects changes in the concentration of the end product). The end product of a pathway may also control its own synthesis by inducing or repressing the gene for transcription of the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway. This type of regulation is much slower to respond to changing conditions than allosteric regulation.

## 3. Feed-Forward Regulation

Certain pathways, such as those involved in the disposal of toxic compounds, are feed-forward-regulated. Feed-forward regulation may occur through an increased supply of substrate to an enzyme with a high $K_{\mathrm{m}}$, allosteric activation of a ratelimiting enzyme through a compound related to substrate supply, substrate-related induction of gene transcription (e.g., induction of cytochrome P450-2E1 by ethanol), or increased concentration of a hormone that stimulates a storage pathway by controlling the enzyme phosphorylation state.

## 4. Tissue Isozymes of Regulatory Proteins

The human body is composed of several different cell types that perform specific functions unique to that cell type and synthesize only the proteins consistent with their functions. Because regulation matches function, regulatory enzymes of pathways usually exist as tissue-specific isozymes with somewhat different regulatory properties unique to their function in different cell types. For example, hexokinase and glucokinase are tissue-specific isozymes with different kinetic properties. These different isozymes arose through gene duplication. Glucokinase, the low-affinity enzyme found in liver, is a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 55 kDa that contains one active catalytic site. The hexokinases found in erythrocytes, skeletal muscles, and most other tissues are 110 kDa and are essentially two mutated glucokinase molecules synthesized as one polypeptide chain. However, only one catalytic site is functional. All of the tissue-specific hexokinases except glucokinase have a $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for glucose that is $<0.2 \mathrm{mM}$.

## 5. Counterregulation of Opposing Pathways

A pathway for the synthesis of a compound usually has one or more enzymatic steps that differ from the pathway for degradation of that compound. A biosynthetic pathway can therefore have a different regulatory enzyme than the opposing degradative pathway, and one pathway can be activated, whereas the other is inhibited (e.g., glycogen synthesis is activated while glycogen degradation is inhibited).

## 6. Substrate Channeling through Compartmentation

In the cell, compartmentation of enzymes into multienzyme complexes or organelles provides a means of regulation either because the compartment provides unique conditions or because it limits or channels access of the enzymes to substrates. Enzymes or pathways with a common function are often assembled into organelles. For example, enzymes of the TCA cycle are all located within the mitochondrion. The enzymes catalyze sequential reactions, and the product of one reaction is the substrate for the next reaction. The concentration of the pathway intermediates remains much higher within the mitochondrion than in the surrounding cellular cytoplasm.

0
When Ann R. jogs, the increased use of ATP for muscle contraction results in an increase of AMP, which allosterically activates both the key enzyme phosphofructoki-nase-1, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, and muscle glycogen phosphorylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycogenolysis. These pathways both provide for a means to increase ATP production. This is an example of feedback regulation by the ATP/AMP ratio. Unfortunately, Ann's low caloric consumption has not allowed feed-forward activation of the rate-limiting enzymes in her fuel storage pathways, and she has very low glycogen stores. Consequently, she has inadequate fuel stores to support the increased energy demands of exercise.

The hormones epinephrine (released during stress and exercise) and glucagon (released during fasting) activate the synthesis of cAMP in several tissues. cAMP activates protein kinase A. Because protein kinase A is able to phosphorylate key regulatory enzymes in many pathways, these pathways can be regulated coordinately. In muscle, for example, glycogen degradation is activated, whereas glycogen synthesis is inhibited. At the same time, fatty-acid release from adipose tissue is activated to provide more fuel for muscle. The regulation of glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and other pathways of metabolism is much more complex than we have illustrated here and is discussed in many subsequent chapters of this text.

Another type of compartmentation involves the assembly of enzymes that catalyze sequential reactions into multienzyme complexes so that intermediates of the pathway can be transferred directly from the active site on one enzyme to the active site on another enzyme, thereby preventing loss of energy and information. One example of this is the MEOS, which is composed of two different subunits with different enzyme activities. One subunit transfers electrons from reduced nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to a cytochrome Fe-heme group on the second subunit, which then transfers the electrons to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

## 7. Levels of Complexity

You may have noticed by now that regulation of metabolic pathways in humans is exceedingly complex; this might be called the second principle of metabolic regulation. As you study different pathways in subsequent chapters, it may help to develop diagrams such as Fig. 9.14 to keep track of the function and rationale behind different regulatory interactions.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

$\square$Al M. In the emergency department, Al M. was evaluated for head injuries. From the physical examination and blood alcohol levels, it was determined that his mental state resulted from his alcohol consumption. Although his chronic ethanol consumption had increased his level of MEOS (and, therefore, the rate of ethanol oxidation in his liver), his excessive drinking resulted in a blood alcohol level higher than the legal limit of $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. He suffered bruises and contusions but was otherwise uninjured. He left in the custody of the police officer and his driving license was suspended.

Ann R. Ann R.'s physician explains that she had inadequate fuel stores for her exercise program. To jog, her muscles require an increased rate of fuel oxidation to generate the ATP for muscle contraction. The fuels used by muscles for exercise include glucose from muscle glycogen, fatty acids from adipose-tissue triacylglycerols, and blood glucose supplied by liver glycogen. These fuel stores were depleted during her prolonged bout of starvation. In addition, starvation resulted in the loss of muscle mass as muscle protein was degraded to supply amino acids for other processes, including gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of glucose from amino acids and other noncarbohydrate precursors). Therefore, Ann will need to increase her caloric consumption to rebuild her fuel stores. Her physician helps her calculate the additional amount of calories her jogging program will need, and they discussed which foods she will eat to meet these increased caloric requirements. He also helps her visualize the increase of weight as an increase in strength.

## BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS

The catalytic rate constant, $k_{\text {cat }}$ and fractional occupancy of an enzyme can also be determined by enzyme kinetics. Enzymes will typically, at maximal velocity, convert substrate to product as fast as the reaction can proceed. But how fast is that? Every enzyme has its own unique turnover number-that is, the number of reactions the enzyme can catalyze per unit of time (i.e., reactions per second). For example, the turnover number of carbonic anhydrase is about $4 \times 10^{5}$ reactions per second, whereas for the enzyme lysozyme the turnover number is 0.5 reaction per second (it takes 2 seconds to complete one reaction).

One can estimate the turnover number, or catalytic constant, from the rate constant $k_{3}$ in equation 1 (see the next paragraph). Recall that $\mathrm{v}=k_{3}[\mathrm{ES}]$; at maximal velocity, all of the enzyme is in the ES form, so $\mathrm{ES}=\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{t}}$, where $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{t}}$ is the total enzyme concentration. Thus, $\mathrm{V}_{\max }=k_{3} \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{t}}$. If the concentration of enzyme is known,

and the maximal velocity at that concentration of enzyme, then $k_{3}$ (the catalytic constant) can be calculated. The turnover number of an enzyme is dependent on the enzyme's structure and the rate at which it can bind substrate and approach and allow the transition state of the reaction to form.

Michael-Menten kinetics can also allow one to determine the fractional occupancy of an enzyme at any given reaction velocity. The fraction of an enzyme, E, with bound substrate, S , can be represented as $\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{ES}} . \mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{ES}}$ is equal to the velocity in the presence of $S$ divided by the maximal velocity of the reaction:

$$
\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{ES}}=(\mathrm{v}) /\left(\mathrm{V}_{\max }\right)
$$

Recall that the velocity of a reaction is equal to the following:

$$
\mathrm{v}=\left(\mathrm{V}_{\max }\right)([\mathrm{S}]) /\left([\mathrm{S}]+K_{\mathrm{m}}\right)
$$

If one substitutes the value of v in equation 2 for v in equation 1 , one obtains:

$$
\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{ES}}=\left(\mathrm{V}_{\max }\right)([\mathrm{S}]) /\left(\mathrm{V}_{\max }\right)([\mathrm{S}]+K_{\mathrm{m}})
$$

If one cancels out the $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ in the numerator and denominator of equation 3 , one obtains:

$$
\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{ES}}=[\mathrm{S}] /\left([\mathrm{S}]+K_{\mathrm{m}}\right)
$$

Thus, when $[\mathrm{S}]=K_{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{ES}}=1 / 2$. Knowing the concentration of substrate, and the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ value, one can determine what percentage of enzyme has bound substrate at that time.

3. Methanol $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}\right)$ is converted by ADHs to formaldehyde $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, a compound that is highly toxic to humans. Patients who have ingested toxic levels of methanol are sometimes treated with ethanol $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{OH}\right)$ to inhibit methanol oxidation by ADH .

D. Ethanol is an effective inhibitor of methanol oxidation regardless of the concentration of methanol.
E. Ethanol can be expected to inhibit the enzyme by binding to the formaldehyde-binding site on the enzyme, even though it cannot bind at the substratebinding site for methanol.
4. A runner's muscles use glucose as a source of energy. Muscle contains glycogen stores that are degraded into glucose 1-phosphate via glycogen phosphorylase, which is an allosteric enzyme. Assume that an allosteric enzyme has the follow-

ing kinetic properties: a $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$ of $25 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{mg}$ enzyme and a $K_{\text {m,app }}$ of 1.0 mM . These kinetic parameters were then measured in the presence of an allosteric activator. Which one of the following would best describe the findings of that experiment?

E. The toxin allosterically activates the last enzyme in the pathway.
6. In thyroid hormone production, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release from the anterior pituitary, which stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine $\left[\mathrm{T}_{3}\right]$ and thyroxine $\left[\mathrm{T}_{4}\right]$ ).

A. Complementary
B. Feedback
C. Compartmentation

8. Pathway regulation can occur via the expression of tissue-specific isozymes.

E. Glucokinase is found in red blood cells.

## Questions 9 and 10 are linked.

9. An antibiotic is developed that is a close structural analog of a substrate of an enzyme that participates in cell wall synthesis in bacteria. This binding of the antibiotic reduces overall enzyme activity, but such activity can be restored if more substrate is added.

C. It has no effect on the apparent $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the enzyme.
D. It increases the $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$ of the enzyme.
E. It decreases the $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$ of the enzyme.

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is B. The rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is directly proportional to the proportion of enzyme molecules that contain bound substrate. Thus, it is at $50 \%$ of its maximal rate when $50 \%$ of the molecules contain bound substrate (thus, $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and D are incorrect). The rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the amount of enzyme present, which is incorporated into the term $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$ (where $\mathrm{V}_{\max }=k[$ total enzyme $]$ ) (thus, E is incorrect).
2. The answer is A. The patient's enzyme has a lower $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ than the normal enzyme and therefore requires a lower glucose concentration to reach $1 / 2 \mathrm{~V}_{\max }$. Thus, the mutation may have increased the affinity of the enzyme for glucose, but it has greatly decreased the subsequent steps of the reaction leading to formation of the transi-tion-state complex, and thus, $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ is much slower. The difference in $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ is so great that the patient's enzyme

is much slower whether you are above or below its $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for glucose. You can test this by substituting 2 mM glucose and 4 mM glucose into the Michaelis-Menten equation, $\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{V}_{\max } \mathrm{S} /\left(K_{\mathrm{m}}+\mathrm{S}\right)$ for the patient's enzyme and for the normal enzyme. The values are 0.0095 and 0.0129 for the patient's enzyme versus 23.2 and 37.2 for the normal enzyme, respectively (thus, B and C are incorrect). At near-saturating glucose concentrations, both enzymes will be near $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$, which is equal to $k_{\text {cat }}$ times the enzyme concentration. Thus, it will take nearly 500 times as much of the patient's enzyme to achieve the normal rate $(93 \div 0.2)$, and so C is incorrect. E is incorrect because rates change most as you decrease substrate concentration below the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$. Thus, the enzyme with the highest $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ will show the largest changes in rate.
3. The answer is B. Ethanol has a structure very similar to methanol (a structural analog) and thus can be expected to compete with methanol at its substrate-binding site. This inhibition is competitive with respect to methanol, and, therefore, $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$ for methanol will not be altered and ethanol inhibition can be overcome by high concentrations of methanol (thus, A, C, and D are incorrect). E is illogical because the substrate methanol stays in the same binding site as it is converted to its product, formaldehyde.
4. The answer is A. Allosteric activators will shift the sigmoidal kinetic curve for the enzyme to the left, thereby reducing the $K_{\mathrm{m}, \text { app }}$ (so $1 / 2 \mathrm{~V}_{\text {max }}$ will be reached at a lower substrate concentration) without affecting the maximum velocity (although in some cases, $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ can also be increased). Allosteric inhibitors will shift the curve to the right, increasing the $K_{\mathrm{m}, \text { app }}$ and sometimes also decreasing the $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$.
5. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. The most effective regulation should be a feed-forward type of regulation in which the toxin activates the pathway. One of the most common ways this occurs is through the toxin acting to increase the amount of enzyme by increasing transcription of its gene. A and B describe mechanisms of feedback regulation, in which the end product of the pathway decreases its own rate of synthesis and are, therefore, incorrect. D is incorrect because a high $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for the toxin might prevent the enzyme from working effectively at low toxin concentrations, although it would allow the enzyme to respond to increases of toxin concentration. It would do little good for the toxin to allosterically activate any enzyme but the rate-limiting enzyme (thus, E is incorrect).
6. The answer is B. In feedback regulation, the end product (thyroid hormone) directly controls its own rate of synthesis by suppressing earlier stimulating hormones. This is called a feedback loop. Feed-forward mechanisms reflect the availability of a precursor to
activate a downstream step of a pathway, such as with toxin disposal pathways (only activated when toxin is present, and the rate of toxin removal increases as the level of toxin increases). Compartmentation is a collection of enzymes within a specific compartment of the cell (e.g., cytoplasm, peroxisome, lysosome, mitochondria). Although negative regulation refers to an inhibitor of an enzyme, the best answer to this question is feedback regulation, as the end product of the pathway is the effector that is regulating the pathway. Complementary regulation refers to several factors acting similarly (complementing each other) in regulating a pathway, which is not the case in this example.
7. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. Ammonia is a toxin and needs to be removed from the body by converting it to urea. If no ammonia is present, the pathway does not function. When arginine is present (a component of the cycle that generates urea), the disposal pathway becomes functional, and the higher the concentration of arginine, the faster the pathway-a great example of feed-forward regulation. Urea does not feedback to slow production of more urea. The enzymes of the urea cycle are not compartmentalized (they exist both in the mitochondria and in cytoplasm).
8. The answer is B. Red blood cells rely solely on glucose for energy needs and must have an isoenzyme with a much lower $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ (hexokinase I), so that at even low levels of substrate (glucose), glucose can still be phosphorylated at rates near the $\mathrm{V}_{\max }$ to allow the red blood cells to survive. With a $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ near the normal fasting level of blood glucose, liver glucokinase can convert elevated levels of glucose (after a meal) into glycogen, a glucose storage molecule.
9. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Because the antibiotic is not covalently bound to the enzyme, it is a reversible inhibitor. The antibiotic is not a suicide inhibitor because the enzyme does not alter the structure of the antibiotic. Because adding excess substrate can overcome the effects of the inhibitor, the inhibitor is acting in a competitive manner, competing with substrate for binding to the active site of the enzyme. Excess substrate cannot overcome the effects of a noncompetitive inhibitor. Uncompetitive or anticompetitive inhibitors bind to the complex formed between the enzymes and substrate and are not overcome by adding excess substrate.
10. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. A competitive inhibitor increases the apparent $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the enzyme because it raises the concentration of substrate necessary to saturate the enzyme. They have no effect on $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$. In the example of the antibiotic, a higher dose of the antibiotic would be expected to be more effective (up to maximal saturation of the enzyme). Noncompetitive inhibitors change $\mathrm{V}_{\text {max }}$ with no effect on the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the substrate.

# Relationship between Cell Biology and Biochemistry 

The basic unit of a living organism is the cell. In humans, each tissue is composed of a variety of cell types, which differ from those cell types in other tissues. The diversity of cell types serves the function of the tissue and organs in which they reside, and each cell type has unique structural features that reflect its role. In spite of their diversity in structure, human cell types have certain architectural features in common, such as the plasma membrane, membranes around the nucleus and organelles, and a cytoskeleton (Fig. IO.I). In this chapter, we review some of the chemical characteristics of these common features, the functions of organelles, and the transport systems for compounds into cells and between organelles.

Plasma Membrane. The cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer that serves as a selective barrier; it restricts the entry and exit of compounds. Within the plasma membrane, different integral membrane proteins facilitate the transport of compounds by energy-requiring active transport, facilitated diffusion, or by forming pores or gated channels. The plasma membrane is supported by a membrane skeleton composed of proteins.

Organelles and Cytoplasmic Membrane Systems. Most organelles within the cell are compartments surrounded by a membrane system that restricts exchange of compounds and information with other compartments (see Fig. I 0.1). In general, each organelle has unique functions that are served by the enzymes and other compounds it contains, or the environment it maintains. Lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes that degrade proteins and other large molecules. The nucleus contains the genetic material and carries out gene replication and transcription of DNA, the first step of protein synthesis. The last phase of protein synthesis occurs on ribosomes. For certain proteins, the ribosomes become attached to the complex membrane system called the endoplasmic reticulum; for other proteins, synthesis is completed on ribosomes that remain in the cytoplasm. The endoplasmic reticulum is also involved in lipid synthesis and transport of molecules to the Golgi. The Golgi forms vesicles for transport of molecules to the plasma membrane and other membrane systems, and for secretion. Mitochondria are organelles committed to fuel oxidation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. Peroxisomes contain many enzymes that use or produce hydrogen peroxide. The cytosol is the intracellular compartment free of organelles and membrane systems.

Cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is a flexible fibrous protein support system that maintains the geometry of the cell, fixes the position of organelles, and moves compounds within the cell. The cytoskeleton also facilitates movement of the cell itself. It is composed primarily of actin microfilaments, intermediate filaments, tubulin microtubules, and their attached proteins.

FIGURE 10.1 Common components of human cells.

V cholerae epidemics are rare in the United States. However, these bacteria grow well under the alkaline conditions found in seawater and attach to chitin in shellfish. Thus, sporadic cases occur in the southeast United States associated with the ingestion of contaminated shellfish.

Uric acid levels in blood or urine can be determined enzymatically through use of the enzyme uricase, which converts uric acid (plus oxygen) to allantoin and hydrogen peroxide. Uricase is found in lower primates but not in humans. Uric acid has a strong light absorbance at 293 nm , which allantoin does not. Therefore, measurement of the decrease in absorbance at 293 nm after treating an unknown sample with uricase can allow determination of uric acid levels. Because the presence of proteins can reduce the sensitivity of this method, an alternative method is to determine the amount of hydrogen peroxide formed during the course of the reaction. In most cases, the enzymes peroxidase or catalase are used and the enzymatic products are coupled to a chemical indicator reaction (a color change). One can determine the extent of color change during the reaction, which is proportional to the hydrogen peroxide concentration, which is the same as the concentration of uric acid in the sample.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\square$Al M. had been drinking heavily when he drove his car off the road and was taken to the hospital emergency department (see Chapters 8 and 9). Although he suffered only minor injuries, his driving license was suspended.

Two years after Dennis V. recovered from his malathion poisoning, he visited his grandfather, Percy V. Mr. V. took Dennis with him to a picnic at the shore, where they ate steamed crabs. Early the next morning, Dennis experienced episodes of profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting. Mr. V. rushed him to the hospital emergency department. Dennis's hands and feet were cold, he appeared severely dehydrated, and he was approaching hypovolemic shock (a severe drop in blood pressure). He was diagnosed with cholera, caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. Dennis was placed on intravenous rehydration therapy, followed by oral rehydration therapy with high glucose and sodium $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$-containing fluids and given antibiotics.

Before Lotta T. was treated with allopurinol for prevention of an attack of gout (see Chapter 8), her physician administered colchicine (acetyltrimethylcolchicinic acid) for the acute attack of gout affecting her great toe. After taking two doses of colchicine divided over 1 hour ( 1.2 mg for the first dose, followed 1 hour later by 0.6 mg ), the throbbing pain in her toe had abated significantly. The redness and swelling also seemed to have lessened slightly.

## I. Compartmentation in Cells

Membranes are lipid structures that separate the contents of the compartment they surround from its environment. An outer plasma membrane separates the cell from the external environment. Organelles (such as the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes) are also surrounded by membrane systems that separate the internal compartment of the organelle from the cytosol. The function of these

membranes is to allow the organelle to collect or concentrate enzymes and other molecules serving a common function into a compartment within a localized environment. The transporters and receptors in each membrane system control this localized environment and facilitate communication of the cell or organelle with the surrounding milieu.

The following sections describe the various organelles and membrane systems found in most human cells and outline the relationship between their properties and function. Each organelle contains different enzymes and carries out different general functions. For example, the nucleus contains the enzymes for DNA and RNA synthesis. The cells of humans and other animals are eukaryotes (eu, good; karyon, nucleus) because the genetic material is organized into a membrane-enclosed nucleus. In contrast, bacteria are prokaryotes (pro, before; karyon, nucleus); they do not contain nuclei or other organelles found in eukaryotic cells.

Not all cells in humans are alike. Different cell types differ quantitatively in their organelle content, and their organelles may contain vastly different amounts of a particular enzyme, consistent with the function of the cell. For example, liver mitochondria contain a key enzyme for synthesizing ketone bodies, but they lack a key enzyme required for their use. The reverse is true in muscle mitochondria. Thus, the enzyme content of the organelles varies somewhat from cell type to cell type.

## II. Plasma Membrane

## A. Structure of the Plasma Membrane

All mammalian cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane composed of a lipid bilayer (two layers) containing embedded proteins (Fig. 10.2). The membrane layer facing the "inside" of the organelle or cell is termed the inner leaflet; the other layer is the outer, or external leaflet. The membranes are continuous and sealed so that the hydrophobic lipid bilayer selectively restricts the exchange of polar compounds between the external fluid and the intracellular compartment. The membrane is referred to as a fluid mosaic because it consists of a mosaic of proteins and lipid molecules that can for the most part move laterally in the plane of the membrane. The proteins are classified as integral proteins, which span the cell membrane, or peripheral proteins, which are attached to the membrane surface through electrostatic bonds to

Bacteria are single cells surrounded by a cell membrane and a cell wall exterior to the membrane. They are prokaryotes, which do not contain nuclei or other organelles (i.e., membrane-surrounded subcellular structures) found in eukaryotic cells. Nonetheless, bacteria carry out many similar metabolic pathways, with the enzymes located in either the intracellular compartment or the cell membrane.

The V. cholerae responsible for Dennis V.'s cholera are gram-negative bacteria. Their plasma membrane is surrounded by a thin cell wall composed of a protein-polysaccharide structure called peptidoglycan and an outer membrane. In contrast, gram-positive bacteria have a plasma membrane and a thick peptidoglycan cell wall that retains the Gram stain. Vibrio grow best under aerobic conditions but also can grow under low-oxygen conditions. They possess enzymes similar to those in human cells for glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. They have a low tolerance for acid, which partially accounts for their presence in slightly basic seawater and shellfish.

FIGURE 10.2 Basic structure of a mammalian cell membrane.

One of the bacterial toxins secreted by Clostridium perfringens, the bacteria that cause gas gangrene, is a lipase that hydrolyzes phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine and from sphingomyelin. The resulting lysis (breakage) of the cell membrane releases intracellular contents that provide the bacteria with nutrients for rapid growth. These bacteria are strict anaerobes and grow only in the absence of oxygen. As their toxins lyse membranes in the endothelial cells of blood vessels, the capillaries are destroyed, and the bacteria are protected from oxygen transported by the red blood cells. They are also protected from antibiotics and components of the immune system carried in the blood.
lipids or integral proteins. Many of the proteins and lipids on the external leaflet of the plasma membrane contain covalently bound carbohydrate chains and therefore are glycoproteins and glycolipids. This layer of carbohydrate on the outer surface of the cell is called the glycocalyx. The variable carbohydrate components of the glycolipids on the cell surface function, in part, as cell recognition markers for small molecules or other cells.

## I. Lipids in the Plasma Membrane

Each layer of the plasma membrane lipid bilayer is formed primarily by phospholipids, which are arranged with their hydrophilic head groups facing the aqueous medium and their fatty acyl tails forming a hydrophobic membrane core (see Fig. 10.2). The principal phospholipids in the membrane are the glycerol lipids phosphatidylcholine (also named lecithin), phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine, and the sphingolipid sphingomyelin (Fig. 10.3). Sphingosine also forms the base for the glycosphingolipids, which are membrane-anchored lipids with carbohydrates attached. The lipid composition varies among different cell types, with phosphatidylcholine being the major plasma membrane phospholipid in most cell types and glycosphingolipids the most variable.

The lipid composition of the bilayer is asymmetric, with a higher content of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin in the outer leaflet and a higher content of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine in the inner leaflet. Phosphatidylinositol, which can function in the transfer of information from hormones and neurotransmitters across the cell membrane (see Chapter 11), is also primarily found
![ma15850024193](ma15850024193.jpg)

FIGURE 10.3 Common phospholipids in the mammalian cell membrane. A. Phosphatidylcholine (a glycerol-based lipid) and sphingomyelin (a sphingosine-based lipid). Note the similarity in structures. B. Different head groups for the phospholipids. These head groups replace the choline in phosphatidylcholine and form, respectively, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol.

in the inner leaflet. Phosphatidylserine contains a net negative charge that contributes to the membrane potential and may be important for binding positively charged molecules within the cell.

Cholesterol, which is interspersed between the phospholipids, maintains membrane fluidity. In the glycerol-based phospholipids, unsaturated fatty-acid chains bent into the cis conformation form a pocket for cholesterol, which binds with its hydroxyl group in the external hydrophilic region of the membrane and its hydrophobic steroid nucleus in the hydrophobic membrane core (Fig. 10.4). The presence of cholesterol and the cis unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane prevent the hydrophobic chains from packing too closely together. As a consequence, lipid and protein molecules that are not bound to external or internal structural proteins can rotate and move laterally in the plane of the leaflet. This movement enables the plasma membrane to partition between daughter cells during cell division, to deform as cells pass through capillaries, and to form and fuse with vesicle membranes. Cholesterol can also stabilize very fluid membranes by increasing interactions between the fatty acids of phospholipids. The fluidity of the membrane is also partially determined by the unsaturated fatty acid content of the diet.

The composition of the membrane is dynamic. Sections of membrane form buds that pinch off into vesicles, and membrane vesicles formed in the Golgi and elsewhere bring new and recycled components back to the membrane. Individual fatty acyl chains turn over as they are hydrolyzed from the lipids and replaced, and enzymes called flippases transfer lipids between leaflets.

## 2. Proteins in the Plasma Membrane

Integral proteins contain transmembrane domains with hydrophobic amino acid side chains that interact with the hydrophobic portions of the lipids to seal the membrane (see Fig. 10.2). Hydrophilic regions of the proteins protrude into the aqueous medium on both sides of the membrane. Many of these proteins function as either channels or transporters for the movement of compounds across the membrane, as receptors for the binding of hormones and neurotransmitters, or as structural proteins (Fig. 10.5).
![ma15950024193](ma15950024193.jpg)

FIGURE 10.5 Proteins in the red blood cell membrane. The proteins named Band 3 (the bicarbonate-chloride exchange transporter) and glycophorin (provides an external negative charge that repels other cells) both contain nonpolar $\alpha$-helical segments spanning the lipid bilayer. These proteins contain a large number of polar and charged hydrophilic amino acids in the intracellular and extracellular domains. On the inside of the cell, they are attached to peripheral proteins comprising the inner membrane skeleton. Band 3 is connected to spectrin filaments via the protein ankyrin. Glycophorin is connected to short actin filaments and spectrin via protein 4.1. Band 3 allows the transport of bicarbonate into the red blood cell in exchange for chloride. This allows bicarbonate transport to the lung, where it is expired as carbon dioxide.

FIGURE 10.4 Cholesterol in the plasma membrane. The polar hydroxyl group of cholesterol is oriented toward the surface. The hydrocarbon tail and the steroid nucleus (orange) lie in the hydrophobic core. A cis double bond in the fatty acyl chain of a phospholipid bends the chain to create a hydrophobic binding site for cholesterol.

Al M. is suffering from both short-term and long-term effects of ethanol on his central nervous system. Data support the theory that the short-term effects of ethanol on the brain arise partly from an increase in membrane fluidity caused when ethanol intercalates between the membrane lipids. The changes in membrane fluidity may affect proteins that span the membrane (integral proteins), such as ion channels and receptors for neurotransmitters involved in conducting the nerve impulse.

![ma16150024193](ma16150024193.jpg)

AI cells contain an inner membrane skeleton of spectrin-like proteins. Red blood cell spectrin was the first member of the spectrin family to be described. The protein dystrophin, present in skeletal muscle cells, is a member of the spectrin family. Genetic defects in the dystrophin gene are responsible for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies.

The prion protein, present in neuronal membranes, provides an example of a protein attached to the membrane through a GPI anchor. This is the protein that develops an altered pathogenic conformation in both mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (see Chapter 7, Section IX.C.3).
![ma16250024193](ma16250024193.jpg)

FIGURE 10.6 An example of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) glycan anchor. The carboxyl terminus of the protein is attached to phosphoethanolamine, which is bound to a branched oligosaccharide that is attached to the inositol portion of phosphatidylinositol. The hydrophobic fatty acyl chains of the phosphatidylinositol portion are bound in the hydrophobic core of the membrane.

Peripheral membrane proteins, which were originally defined as those proteins that can be released from the membrane by ionic solvents, are bound through weak electrostatic interactions with the polar head groups of lipids or with integral proteins. One of the best characterized classes of peripheral proteins is the spectrin family of proteins, which are bound to the intracellular membrane surface and provide mechanical support for the membrane. Spectrin is bound to actin, which together form a structure that is called the inner membrane skeleton or the cortical skeleton (see Fig. 10.5).

A third classification of membrane proteins consists of lipid-anchored proteins bound to the inner or outer surface of the membrane. The glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) glycan anchor is a covalently attached lipid that anchors proteins to the external surface of the membrane (Fig. 10.6). Several proteins involved in hormonal regulation are anchored to the internal surface of the membrane through palmityl (C16) or myristyl (C14) fatty acyl groups or through geranylgeranyl (C20) or farnesyl (C15) isoprenyl groups (see Fig. 6.13). However, many integral proteins also contain attached lipid groups to increase their stability in the membrane.

## 3. The Glycocalyx of the Plasma Membrane

Some of the proteins and lipids on the external surface of the membrane contain short chains of carbohydrates (oligosaccharides) that extend into the aqueous medium. Carbohydrates constitute $2 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the weight of plasma membranes. This hydrophilic carbohydrate layer, called the glycocalyx, protects the cell from digestion and restricts the uptake of hydrophobic compounds.

The glycoproteins generally contain branched oligosaccharide chains of approximately 15 sugar residues that are attached through N -glycosidic bonds to the amide nitrogen of an asparagine side chain ( $N$-glycosidic linkage), or through a glycosidic bond to the oxygen of serine ( $O$-glycoproteins). The membrane glycolipids are usually gangliosides or cerebrosides. Specific carbohydrate chains on the glycolipids serve as cell-recognition molecules (see Chapter 5 for structures of these compounds).

## B. Transport of Molecules across the Plasma Membrane

Membranes form hydrophobic barriers around cells to control the internal environment by restricting the entry and exit of molecules. As a consequence, cells require transport systems to permit entry of small polar compounds that they need (e.g., glucose) to concentrate compounds inside the cell (e.g., $\mathrm{K}^{+}$) and to expel other compounds (e.g., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$). The transport systems for small organic molecules and inorganic ions generally fall into four categories: First is simple diffusion through the lipid bilayer, second is facilitative diffusion, third is gated channels, and fourth is active transport pumps (Fig. 10.7). These transport mechanisms are classified as passive if energy is not required or active if energy is required. The energy is often provided by the hydrolysis of ATP.

In addition to these mechanisms for the transport of small individual molecules, cells engage in a process called endocytosis. The plasma membrane extends or invaginates to surround a particle, a foreign cell, or extracellular fluid, which then closes into a vesicle that is released into the cytoplasm (see Fig. 10.7).

## I. Simple Diffusion

Gases such as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and lipid-soluble substances (such as steroid hormones) can cross membranes by simple diffusion (see Fig. 10.7). In simple diffusion (free diffusion), molecules move by engaging in random collisions with other like molecules. There is a net movement from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration because molecules keep bumping into each other where their concentration is highest. Energy is not required for diffusion, and compounds that are uncharged eventually reach the same concentrations on both sides of the membrane.

![ma16350024193](ma16350024193.jpg)

FIGURE 10.7 Common types of transport mechanisms for human cells. The electrochemical gradient consists of the concentration gradient of the compound and the distribution of charge on the membrane, which affects the transport of charged ions such as $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Both protein amino acid residues and lipid polar head groups contribute to the net negative charge on the inside of the membrane. Generally, the diffusion of uncharged molecules (passive transport) is net movement from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration, and active transport (energy-requiring) is net movement from a region of low concentration to one of high concentration. ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

Water is considered to diffuse through membranes by nonspecific movement through ion channels, pores, or around proteins embedded in the lipids. Certain cells (e.g., renal tubule cells) also contain large protein pores, called aquaporins, which permit a high rate of water flow from a region of a high water concentration (low solute concentration) to one of low water concentration (high solute concentration).

## 2. Facilitative Diffusion through Binding to Transporter Proteins

Facilitative diffusion requires that the transported molecule bind to a specific carrier or transport protein in the membrane (Fig. 10.8A). The transporter protein then undergoes a conformational change that allows the transported molecule to be released on the other side of the membrane. Although the transported molecules are bound to proteins, the transport process is still classified as diffusion because energy is not required, and the compound equilibrates (achieves a balance of concentration and charge) on both sides of the membrane.

Transporter proteins, like enzymes, exhibit saturation kinetics; when all the binding sites on the transporter proteins in the membrane are occupied, the system is saturated and the rate of transport reaches a plateau (the maximum velocity). By analogy to enzymes, the concentration of a transported compound required to reach one-half of the maximum velocity is of ten called the $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ (see Fig. 10.8B). Facilitative transporters are similar to enzymes with respect to two additional features: They are relatively specific for the compounds they bind, and they can be inhibited by compounds that block their binding sites or change their conformation.

## 3. Gated Channels in Plasma Membranes

In the case of gated channels, transmembrane proteins form a pore for ions that is either opened or closed in response to a stimulus. These stimuli can be voltage changes across the membrane (voltage-gated channels), the binding of a compound (ligand-gated channels), or a regulatory change in the intracellular domain (phosphorylation-gated and pressure-gated channels). For example, the conduction of a nerve impulse along an axon depends on the passive flux of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions through a voltage-gated channel that is opened by depolarization of the membrane. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ channel that provides an example of a ligand-gated channel regulated through

(1)The $A, B$, and $O$ blood groups are determined by the carbohydrate composition of the glycolpids on the surface of red blood cells. Glycolpids on other cell surfaces may also serve as binding sites for viruses and bacterial toxins before penetrating the cell. For example, the cholera AB toxin (which is affecting Dennis $\mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{4}}$ ) binds to $\mathrm{GM}_{1}$-gangliosides on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells. The toxin is then endocytosed in caveolae (invaginations or "caves" that can form in specific regions of the membrane). Once inside the cell, the toxin will alter normal cellular metabolism.

(2)Dennis V. has become dehydrated because he has lost so much water through vomiting and diarrhea (see Chapter 4). Cholera toxin increases the efflux of sodium and chloride ions from his intestinal mucosal cells into the intestinal lumen. The increase of water in his stools results from the passive transfer of water from inside the cell and body fluids, where it is in high concentration (i.e., intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$concentrations are low), to the intestinal lumen and bowel, where water is in lower concentration (relative to high $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$). The watery diarrhea is also high in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions and bicarbonate. All of the signs and symptoms of cholera generally derive from this fluid loss.

![ma16450024193](ma16450024193.jpg)

FIGURE 10.8 A. Facilitative transport. Although the molecule being transported must bind to the protein transporter, the mechanism is passive diffusion and the molecule moves from a region of high concentration to one of low concentration. "Passive" refers to the lack of an energy requirement for the transport. B. Saturation kinetics of transporter proteins. When a compound must bind to a protein to be transported across a membrane, the velocity of transport depends on the amount of compound bound. It reaches a maximum rate when the compound's concentration is raised so high that all of the transporter-binding sites are occupied. The curve is a rectangular hyperbola that approaches maximum velocity $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\max }\right)$ at infinite substrate concentration, identical to that of Michaelis-Menten enzymes. The $K_{m}$ of transport is the concentration of compound required for $1 / 2 V_{\max }$. In contrast, simple diffusion of a compound does not require its binding to a protein, and the rate of transport increases linearly with increasing concentration of the compound.

(2) All of the cells in the body have facilitative glucose transporters that transport glucose across the plasma membrane down an electrochemical (concentration) gradient as it is rapidly metabolized in the cell. In muscle and adipose tissue, insulin increases the content of facilitative glucose transporters in the cell membrane, thus increasing the ability of these tissues to take up glucose. Patients with type I diabetes mellitus, who do not produce insulin (e.g., Dianne A., see Chapter 7), have a decreased ability to transport glucose into these tissues, thereby contributing to hyperglycemia (high blood glucose).
phosphorylation (phosphorylation-gated) (Fig. 10.9). CFTR is a member of the adenine nucleotide-binding cassette, or ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transport proteins and is the protein mutated in cystic fibrosis. CFTR consists of two transmembrane domains that form a closed channel, each connected to an ATP-binding site, and a regulatory domain that sits in front of the channel. When the regulatory domain is phosphorylated by a kinase, its conformation changes and it moves away from the ATP-binding domains. As ATP binds and is hydrolyzed, the transmembrane domains change conformation and open the channel, and chloride ions diffuse through. As the conformation reverts back to its original form, the channel closes.

Transport through a ligand-gated channel can be considered simple diffusion, although ATP is involved, because only a few ATP molecules are being used to open and close the channel through which many, many chloride ions diffuse. However, the distinction between ligand-gated channels and facilitative transporters is not always as clear. Many gated channels show saturation kinetics at very high concentrations of the compounds being transported, which is why Figure 10.7 characterizes ligand-gated channels as facilitative transport.
![ma16550024193](ma16550024193.jpg)

FIGURE 10.9 The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a ligand-gated channel controlled by phosphorylation. Two intracellular binding domains control opening of the channel, an adenine nucleotide-binding domain (ABD) and a regulatory domain (R). (I) Phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit by protein kinase A (PKA) causes a conformational change that allows adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to bind to the adenine nucleotide-binding domain (ABD). (2) Hydrolysis of bound ATP opens the channel so that chloride ions can diffuse through. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.

## 4. Active Transport Requires Energy and Transporter Proteins

Both active transport and facilitative transport are mediated by protein transporters (carriers) in the membrane. However, in facilitative transport, the compound is transported down an electrochemical gradient (the balance of concentration and charge across a membrane), usually from a high concentration to a low concentration, to equilibrate between the two sides of the membrane. In active transport, energy is used to concentrate the compound on one side of the membrane. If energy is applied directly to the transporter (e.g., ATP hydrolysis by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase), the transport is called primary active transport; if energy is used to establish an ion gradient (e.g., the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient), and the gradient is used to concentrate another compound, the transport is called secondary active transport. Protein-mediated transport systems, whether facilitative or active, are classified as antiports if they specifically exchange compounds of similar charge across a membrane; they are called symports or cotransporters if they simultaneously transport two molecules across the membrane in the same direction. Band 3 in the red blood cell membrane, which exchanges chloride ion for bicarbonate, provides an example of an antiport.

The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase spans the plasma membrane, much like a gated pore, with a binding site for three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions open to the intracellular side (Fig. 10.10). Energy from ATP hydrolysis is used to phosphorylate an internal domain and change the transporters' conformation so that bound $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions are released to the outside and two external $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions bind. $\mathrm{K}^{+}$binding triggers hydrolysis of the bound phosphate group and a return to the original conformation, accompanied by release of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions inside the cell. As a consequence, cells are able to maintain a much lower intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration and a much higher intracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ion concentration than are present in the external fluid.

The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient, which is maintained by primary active transport, is used to power the transport of glucose, amino acids, and many other compounds into the cell through secondary active transport. An example is provided by the transport of glucose into cells of the intestinal epithelium in conjunction with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions (Fig. 10.11). These cells create a gradient in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and then use this gradient to drive the transport of glucose from the intestinal lumen into the cell against its concentration gradient.

The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-ATPase, a calcium pump, uses a mechanism similar to that of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}-$ ATPase to maintain intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration below $10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$ in spite of the high extracellular concentration of $10^{-3} \mathrm{M}$. This transporter is inhibited by binding

The CFTR was named for its role in cystic fibrosis. Individuals homozygous for mutations in CFTR display cystic fibrosis; heterozygotes for the mutated gene are thought to have protection against cholera. An inactive CFTR leads to an inability to release chloride ions from cells into the extracellular space, with a concomitant reduced diffusion of water into the same space. Thus, a consequence of the CFTR mutation is the dehydration of respiratory and interstitial mucosal linings, leading to a plugging of airways and ducts with a thick mucus. The CFTR is also involved in the dehydration experienced by cholera patients such as Dennis V. In intestinal mucosal cells, the cholera A-subunit indirectly promotes phosphorylation of the regulatory domain of CFTR by protein kinase A. Thus, the channel stays open and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ flow from the cell into the intestinal lumen, resulting in dehydration.

The dehydration of cholera is often treated first with an intravenous rehydration solution followed by an oral rehydration solution containing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and glucose, or a diet of rice (which contains glucose and amino acids). Glucose is absorbed from the intestinal lumen via the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent glucose cotransporters, which cotransport $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$into the cells together with glucose. Many amino acids are also absorbed by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent cotransport. With the return of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to the cytoplasm, the release of water from the cell into the intestinal lumen decreases.
![ma16650024193](ma16650024193.jpg)

FIGURE 10.10 Active transport by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase. Three sodium ions bind to the transporter protein on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. When adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is hydrolyzed to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), the carrier protein is phosphorylated and undergoes a change in conformation that causes the sodium ions to be released into the extracellular fluid. Two potassium ions then bind on the extracellular side. Dephosphorylation of the carrier protein produces another conformational change, and the potassium ions are released on the inside of the cell membrane. The transporter protein then resumes its original conformation, ready to bind more sodium ions.

![ma16750024193](ma16750024193.jpg)

FIGURE I 0.11 Secondary active transport of glucose by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-glucose cotransporter. One sodium ion binds to the carrier protein in the luminal membrane, stimulating the binding of glucose.After a conformational change, the protein releases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and glucose into the cell and returns to its original conformation. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase in the basolateral membrane pumps $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$against its concentration gradient into the extracellular fluid. Thus, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration in the cell is low, and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$moves from the lumen down its concentration gradient into the cell and is pumped against its gradient into the extracellular fluid. Glucose, consequently, moves against its concentration gradient from the lumen into the cell by traveling on the same carrier as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Glucose then passes down its concentration gradient into the extracellular fluid on a passive transporter protein.
of the regulatory protein calmodulin. When the intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration increases, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to calmodulin, which dissociates from the transporter, thereby activating it to pump $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ out of the cell (see Fig. 9.12 for the structure of calmodulin). High levels of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ are associated with irreversible progression from cell injury to cell death.

# C. Vesicular Transport across the Plasma Membrane 

Vesicular transport occurs when a membrane completely surrounds a compound, particle, or cell and encloses it into a vesicle, which buds from the membrane. When the released vesicle fuses with another membrane system, the entrapped compounds are released. Endocytosis refers to vesicular transport into the cell, and exocytosis refers to transport out of the cell. Endocytosis is further classified as phagocytosis if the vesicle forms around particulate matter (such as whole bacterial cells or metals and dyes from a tattoo), and pinocytosis if the vesicle forms around fluid containing dispersed molecules. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is the name given to the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles that mediate the internalization of membrane-bound receptors in vesicles coated on the intracellular side with subunits of the protein clathrin. Cholesterol uptake, as mediated by the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor, occurs via this mechanism. Potocytosis is the name given to endocytosis that occurs via caveolae (small invaginations or "caves"), which are regions of the cell membrane with a unique lipid and protein composition (including the protein caveolin-1). The transport of the vitamin folate occurs via potocytosis.

## III. Lysosomes

Lysosomes are the intracellular organelles of digestion and are enclosed by a single membrane that prevents the release of its digestive enzymes into the cytosol. They are central to a wide variety of body functions that involve elimination of unwanted material and recycling their components, including destruction of infectious bacteria and yeast, recovery from injury, tissue remodeling, involution of tissues during development, and normal turnover of cells and organelles.

![ma16850024193](ma16850024193.jpg)

FIGURE 10.12 Lysosomal reactions. Most lysosomal enzymes are hydrolases, which cleave peptide, ester, and glycosidic bonds by adding the components of water across the bond. These enzymes are active at the acidic pH of the lysosome and inactive if accidentally released into the cytosol.

## A. Lysosomal Hydrolases

The lysosomal digestive enzymes include nucleases, phosphatases, glycosidases, esterases, and proteases (Fig. 10.12). These enzymes are all hydrolases, enzymes that cleave amide, ester, and other bonds through the addition of water. Many of the products of lysosomal digestion, such as the amino acids, return to the cytosol. Lysosomes are therefore involved in recycling compounds. The proteases are classified as serine, cysteine, or aspartyl proteases, depending on the amino acid residue at the active site of the enzyme involved in the hydrolytic reaction. The cysteine proteases are also known as cathepsins.

Most of these lysosomal hydrolases have their highest activity near a pH of approximately 5.5 (the optimal pH for hydrolysis). The intralysosomal pH is maintained near 5.5 principally by v-ATPases (vesicular ATPases), which actively pump protons into the lysosome. The cytosol and other cellular compartments have a pH nearer 7.2 and are therefore protected from escaped lysosomal hydrolases.

## B. Endocytosis, Phagocytosis, and Autophagy

Lysosomes are formed from digestive vesicles called endosomes, which are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. They also participate in digestion of foreign cells acquired through phagocytosis and the digestion of internal contents in the process of autophagocytosis.

## I. Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis

Lysosomes are involved in the digestion of compounds brought into the cells in endocytotic clathrin-coated vesicles formed by the plasma membrane. These vesicles fuse to form multivesicular bodies called early endosomes. The early endosomes can either recycle back to the cell surface or mature into late endosomes as they recycle clathrin, lipids, and other membrane components back to the plasma membrane in vesicles called recycling endosomes. The late endosomes mature into lysosomes as they progressively accumulate newly synthesized acid hydrolases and vesicular proton pumps brought to them in clathrin-coated vesicles from the Golgi. Thus, lysosomes do not acquire their full digestive power until after sorting of membrane lipids and proteins for recycling.

0Genetic defects in lysosomal enzymes, or in proteins such as the mannose 6-phosphate receptors required for targeting the enzymes to the lysosome, lead to an abnormal accumulation of undigested material in lysosomes that may be converted to residual bodies. The accumulation may be so extensive that normal cellular function is compromised, particularly in neuronal cells. Genetic diseases such as Toy-Sachs disease (an accumulation of partially digested gangliosides in lysosomes) and Pumpe disease (an accumulation of glycogen particles in lysosomes) are caused by the absence or deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes. Such diseases, in which a lysosomal function is compromised, are known as lysosomal storage diseases.

The elevated level of uric acid in Lotta T.'s blood led to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joint space (synovial fluid) of her right great toe, resulting in podagra (painful great toe). Neutrophils, the mediators of the acute inflammation that followed, attempted to phagocytose the urate crystals. The engulfed urate crystals were deposited in the late endosomes and lysosomes of the neutrophil. Because urate crystals are particles that cannot be degraded by any of the lysosomal acid hydrolases, their accumulation caused lysis of the lysosomal membranes, followed by cell lysis and release of lysosomal enzymes into the joint space. The urate crystals also resulted in release of chemical mediators of inflammation that recruited other cells into the area. This further amplified the acute inflammatory reaction in the tissues of the joint capsule (synovitis), leading to the extremely painful swelling of acute gouty arthritis.

Inner membrane
folded into cristae
FIGURE 10.13 Mitochondrion. Electron micrograph (top); three-dimensional drawing (bottom).

Within the Golgi, enzymes are targeted for endosomes (and eventually lysosomes) by addition of mannose 6-phosphate residues that bind to mannose 6-phosphate receptor proteins in the Golgi membrane. The mannose 6-phosphate receptors together with the associated bound acid hydrolases are incorporated into the clathrin-coated Golgi transport vesicles and the vesicles are released. The transport vesicles lose their clathrin coat and then fuse with the late endosomal membrane. The acidity of the endosome releases the acid hydrolases from the receptors into the vesicle lumen. The receptors are eventually recycled back to the Golgi.

## 2. Phagocytosis and Autophagy

One of the major roles of lysosomes is phagocytosis. Neutrophils and macrophages, the major phagocytic cells, devour pathogenic microorganisms and clean up wound debris and dead cells, thus aiding in repair. As bacteria or other particles are enclosed into clathrin-coated pits in the plasma membrane, these vesicles bud off to form intracellular phagosomes. The phagosomes fuse with lysosomes, where the acidity and digestive enzymes destroy the contents. Pinocytotic vesicles also may fuse with lysosomes.

In autophagy (self-eating), intracellular components such as organelles or glycogen particles are surrounded by a membrane derived from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) vesicles, forming an autophagosome. The autophagosome fuses with a lysosome, and lysosomal enzymes digest the contents of the phagolysosome. Organelles usually turn over much more rapidly than the cells in which they reside (e.g., approximately four mitochondria in each liver cell are degraded per hour). Cells that are damaged, but still viable, recover in part by using autophagy to eliminate damaged components.

If a significant amount of undigestible material remains within the lysosome after the digestion process is completed, the lysosome is called a residual body. Depending on the cell type, residual bodies may be expelled (exocytosis) or remain indefinitely in the cell as lipofuscin granules that accumulate with age.

## IV. Mitochondria

Mitochondria contain most of the enzymes for the pathways of fuel oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and thus generate most of the ATP required by mammalian cells. Each mitochondrion is surrounded by two membranes, an outer membrane and a highly impermeable inner membrane, separating the mitochondrial matrix from the cytosol (Fig. 10.13). The inner membrane forms invaginations known as cristae containing the electron-transport chain and ATP synthase. Most of the enzymes for the Krebs TCA cycle and other pathways for oxidation are located in the mitochondrial matrix, the compartment enclosed by the inner mitochondrial membrane. (The TCA cycle and the electron-transport chain are described in more detail in Chapters 23 and 24.)

The inner mitochondrial membrane is highly impermeable, and the proton gradient that is built up across this membrane during oxidative phosphorylation is essential for ATP generation from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate. The transport of ions and other small molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane occurs principally through facilitative transporters in a type of secondary active transport powered by the proton gradient established by the electron transport chain. The outer membrane contains pores made from proteins called porins and is permeable to molecules with a molecular weight up to about 1,000 Da.

Mitochondria can replicate by division; however, most of their proteins must be imported from the cytosol. Mitochondria contain a small amount of DNA, which encodes for only 13 different subunits of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Most of the enzymes and proteins in mitochondria are encoded by nuclear DNA and synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes. They are imported through membrane pores by a receptor-mediated process involving members of

the heat-shock family of proteins (proteins whose synthesis is induced by an elevation of temperature or other indicators of stress). Mutations in mitochondrial DNA result in several genetic diseases that affect skeletal muscle, neuronal tissue, and renal tissue (known as mitochondrial disorders). Mitochondrial inheritance is maternal because the sperm do not contribute mitochondria to the fertilized egg. Spontaneous mutations within mitochondrial DNA have been implicated with the mechanism of aging.

## V. Peroxisomes

Peroxisomes are cytoplasmic organelles, similar in size to lysosomes, that are involved in oxidative reactions using molecular oxygen. These reactions produce the toxic chemical hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, which is subsequently used or degraded within the peroxisome by catalase and other enzymes. Peroxisomes function in the oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids (containing 20 or more carbons) to shorterchain fatty acids, the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, and the synthesis of ether lipids called plasmalogens. They are bounded by a single membrane.

Like mitochondria, peroxisomes can replicate by division. However, they are dependent on the import of proteins to function. They contain no DNA.

## VI. Nucleus

The largest of the subcellular organelles of animal cells is the nucleus (Fig. 10.14). Most of the genetic material of the cell is located in the chromosomes of the nucleus, which are composed of DNA, an equal weight of small, positively charged proteins called histones, and a variable amount of other proteins. This nucleoprotein complex is called chromatin. The nucleolus, a substructure of the nucleus, is the site of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription and processing and of ribosome assembly. Ribosomes are required for the synthesis of proteins. Replication, transcription, translation, and the regulation of these processes are the major focus of the molecular biology section of this text (see Section III).

The nucleus is separated from the rest of the cell (the cytoplasm) by the nuclear envelope, which consists of two membranes joined at nuclear pores. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the rough ER (RER). Transport through the pores is bidirectional, as illustrated by the following example. To convert the genetic code of the DNA into the primary sequence of a protein, DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is modified and edited into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA travels through the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm, where it is translated into the primary sequence of a protein on ribosomes. Ribosomes, which are generated in the nucleolus, also must travel through nuclear pores to the cytoplasm. Conversely, proteins required for replication, transcription, and other processes enter into the nucleus through these pores. These proteins contain a specific sequence of amino acids known as a nuclear localization signal. Thus, the direction of transport through the pore is specific for the molecule or complex being transported across the membrane.

## VII. Endoplasmic Reticulum

The ER is a network of membranous tubules within the cell consisting of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), which lacks ribosomes, and RER, which is studded with ribosomes (Fig. 10.15). The SER has several functions. It contains enzymes for the synthesis of many lipids, such as triacylglycerols and phospholipids. It also contains the cytochrome P450 oxidative enzymes involved in metabolism of drugs and toxic chemicals like ethanol and the synthesis of hydrophobic molecules like steroid hormones. Glycogen is stored in regions of liver cells that are rich in SER.

(10)Pyruvate transfer across the inner mitochondrial membrane is dependent on the proton gradient, and the carrier for pyruvate transports both pyruvate and a proton into the matrix of the mitochondria. Such transport allows for the accumulation of pyruvate within the organelle at concentrations greater than in the cytosol. This is an example of which type of transport?

(11)Several diseases are associated with peroxisomes. Peroxisomal diseases are caused by mutations that affect either the synthesis of functional peroxisomal enzymes or their incorporation into peroxisomes. For example, adrenoleukodystrophy involves a mutation that decreases the content of a fatty acid transporter in the peroxisomal membrane. Zellweger syndrome is caused by the failure to complete the synthesis of peroxisomes.
![ma17050024193](ma17050024193.jpg)

FIGURE 10.14 Nucleus. Electron micrograph (top); three-dimensional drawing (bottom). RER, rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Cotransport of pyruvate and a proton, down the proton's electrochemical gradient, is an example of secondary active transport. Energy has been expended, during the transfer of electrons through the electron transfer chain, to generate the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy of the proton gradient is then used by the carrier to carry protons down their electrochemical gradient (favorable), bringing pyruvate along with the protons. This will allow pyruvate active transport, secondary to favorable proton entry into the mitochondrial matrix.

(1)Chronic ingestion of ethanol has increased the content of MEOS, the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system, in A) $\mathbf{M} \mathbf{I}$.s liver. MEOS is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ethanol, NADPH, and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to acetaldehyde, NADP ${ }^{+}$, and $2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (see Chapter 9). The adjective microsomal is a term derived from experimental cell biology that is sometimes used for processes that occur in the ER. When cells are lysed in the laboratory, the ER is fragmented into vesicles called microsomes, which can be isolated by centrifugation. Microsomes, as such, are not actually present in cells.

(2)The monomeric G-protein Arf (a member of the Ras superfamily of regulatory proteins; see Section III.C. 2 in Chapter 9) was named for its contribution to the pathogenesis of cholera and not for its normal function in the assembly of intracellular vesicles. In the case of cholera, it is required for the transport of $V$. cholerae A toxin subunit into the cell. The cholera toxin is endocytosed in caveolae vesicles that subsequently merge with lysosomes (or are transformed into lysosomes), where the acidic pH contributes to activation of the toxin. As the toxin is transported through the Golgi and ER, it is further processed and activated. Arf forms a complex with the A-subunit that promotes its travel between compartments. The A-subunit is actually an ADP-ribosylase (an enzyme that cleaves NAD and attaches the ADP portion to a protein) (see Chapter 6, Fig. 6.13), and hence, Arf became known as the ADP-ribosylating factor. The ADP-ribosylation of proteins regulating the CFTR chloride channel led to Dennis V.'s dehydration and diarrhea.
![ma17150024193](ma17150024193.jpg)

FIGURE 10.15 A. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum. B. Rough endoplasmic reticulum. $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are electron micrographs. A three-dimensional drawing is in the middle.

The RER is involved in the synthesis of certain proteins. Ribosomes attached to the membranes of the RER give them their "rough" appearance. Proteins produced on these ribosomes enter the lumen of the RER, travel to another membrane system (the Golgi complex) in vesicles, and are subsequently either secreted from the cell, sequestered within membrane-enclosed organelles such as lysosomes, or embedded in the plasma membrane. Posttranslational modifications of these proteins, such as the initiation of $N$-linked glycosylation, the addition of lipid-based anchors, and disulfide formation, occur in the RER. In contrast, proteins encoded by the nucleus and found in the cytoplasm, peroxisomes, or mitochondria are synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytosol and are seldom modified by the attachment of oligosaccharides.

## VIII. Golgi Complex

The Golgi complex is involved in modifying proteins produced in the RER and in sorting and distributing these proteins to the lysosomes, secretory vesicles, or the plasma membrane. It consists of a curved stack of flattened vesicles in the cytoplasm that is generally divided into three compartments: the cis Golgi network, which is often convex and faces the nucleus; the medial Golgi stacks; and the trans Golgi network, which often faces the plasma membrane. Vesicles transport material to and from the Golgi. The Golgi complex also participates in posttranslational modification of proteins, such as complex branched-chain oligosaccharide addition, sulfation, and phosphorylation.

## IX. Cytoskeleton

The structure of the cell, the shape of the cell surface, and the arrangement of subcellular organelles are organized by three major protein components: microtubules

composed of tubulin, which move and position organelles and vesicles; thin filaments composed of actin, which form a cytoskeleton; and intermediate filaments (IF) composed of different fibrous proteins. Actin and tubulin, which are also involved in cell movement, are dynamic structures composed of continuously associating and dissociating globular subunits. IFs, which play a structural role, are composed of stable fibrous proteins that turn over more slowly than do the components of microtubules and thin filaments.

## A. Microtubules

Microtubules, cylindrical tubes composed of tubulin subunits, are present in all nucleated cells and the platelets in blood (Fig. 10.16). They are responsible for the positioning of organelles in the cell cytoplasm and the movement of vesicles, including phagocytic vesicles, exocytotic vesicles, and the transport vesicles between the ER, Golgi, and endosomes. They also form the spindle apparatus for cell division. The microtubule network (the minus end) begins in the nucleus at the centriole and extends outward to the plasma membrane (usually the plus end). Microtubuleassociated proteins (MAPs) attach microtubules to other cellular components and can determine cell shape and polarity.

Motor proteins called kinesins and cytoplasmic dyneins use ATP energy to move cargo along the microtubules. Kinesins move molecules, vesicles, and organelles toward the plus end of the microtubule, usually toward the plasma membrane. Cytoplasmic dyneins are huge proteins that move vesicles and organelles to the minus end, generally toward the nucleus. They are also involved in the positioning of the Golgi complex and the movement of chromosomes during mitosis.

Microtubules consist of polymerized arrays of $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-tubulin dimers that form 13 protofilaments organized around a hollow core (see Fig. 10.16). Three different tubulin polypeptides ( $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ ) of similar amino acid composition are encoded by related genes; $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-dimers polymerize to form most microtubules, and $\gamma$-tubulin is found only in the centrosomes and spindle pole bodies. Two other forms of tubulin, $\delta$ and $\varepsilon$, have been found in centrioles. Tubulin dimers composed of one $\alpha$-subunit and one $\beta$-subunit bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which creates a conformational change in the dimer that favors addition of dimers to the tubulin polymer. The dimers can add to and dissociate from both ends of the tubulin, but the end to which they add more rapidly (the plus end) has a net rate of growth, and the end to which they add more slowly (the minus end) has a net rate of loss. As GTP is hydrolyzed to guanosine diphosphate (GDP), the binding of tubulin subunits is weakened, resulting in their dissociation (dynamic instability). Thus, the net rate and direction of growth are dictated by the fastest growing end of the microtubule.

## B. Actin Filaments

Actin filaments form a critical network that controls the shape of the cell and movement of the cell surface, thereby allowing cells to move, divide, engulf particles, and contract. Actin is present in all living cells. The actin polymer, called F-actin, is composed of a helical arrangement of globular G-actin subunits (Fig. 10.17). Within the polymer, each G-actin subunit contains a bound ATP or ADP that holds the actin fold into a closed conformation (see Chapter 7). The actin polymer is dynamic. New subunits of G-actin containing ATP continuously combine with the assembled F-actin polymer at the plus end. As F-actin elongates, bound ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP, so that most of the polymer contains G-actin-ADP subunits. The conformation of ADP-actin favors dissociation from the minus end of the polymer; thus, the polymer is capable of lengthening from the plus end. This directional growth can account for certain types of cell movement and shape changes: the formation of pseudopodia that surround other cells during phagocytosis, the migration of cells in the developing embryo, or the movement of white blood cells through tissues.

(1)Lotta T. was given colchicine, a drug that is frequently used to treat gout in its initial stages. One of colchicine's actions is to prevent phagocytic activity by binding to dimers of the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits of tubulin. When the tubulin dimer-colchicine complexes bind to microtubules, further polymerization of the microtubules is inhibited, depolymerization predominates, and the microtubules disassemble. Microtubules are necessary for vesicular movement of urate crystals during phagocytosis and release of mediators that activate the inflammatory response. Thus, colchicine diminishes the inflammatory response, swelling, and pain caused by formation of urate crystals.

(2) Colchicine, an initial drug used to treat Lotta T. has a narrow therapeutic index (i.e., the amount of drug that produces the desirable therapeutic effect is not much lower than the amount that produces an adverse effect). Its therapeutic effect depends on inhibiting tubulin synthesis in neutrophils, but it can also prevent tubulin synthesis (and, thus, cell division and other cellular processes) in other cells. Fortunately, neutrophils concentrate colchicine, so they are affected at lower concentrations of colchicine than other cell types. Neutrophils lack the transport protein P-glycoprotein, a member of the ABC cassette family (which includes the CFTR channel). In most other cell types, P-glycoprotein exports chemicals such as colchicine, thus preventing their accumulation.

FIGURE 10.16 Microtubules composed of $\alpha \beta$-tubulin heterodimers. These proteins project outward to attach the microtubules to other cellular components. The microtubule grows by the addition of $\alpha \beta$-dimers containing bound guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to the plus end of the polymer. Kinesin and dyneins are motor proteins that transport cargo (e.g., vesicles) along the microtubule. MAP, microtubule-associated protein.

![ma17350024193](ma17350024193.jpg)

FIGURE 10.17 Actin filaments. The polymer F-actin is assembled from G-actin subunits containing bound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). While bound, the ATP is slowly hydrolyzed to adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The conformational change shifts the equilibrium so that dissociation of the G-actin subunits is favorable at the minus end of the polymer. Once they are dissociated, the actin subunits exchange ADP for ATP, which may again associate with the actin polymer. At the plus end of the molecule, association is favored over dissociation. $P_{i}$, inorganic phosphate.

Actin polymers form the thin filaments (also called microfilaments) in the cell that are organized into compact ordered bundles or loose network arrays by crosslinking proteins. Short actin filaments bind to the cross-linking protein spectrin to form the cortical actin skeleton network (see Fig. 10.5). In muscle cells, long actin filaments combine with thick filaments, composed of the protein myosin, to produce muscle contraction. The assembly of G-actin subunits into polymers, bundling of fibers, and attachments of actin to spectrin and to the plasma membrane proteins and organelles are mediated by several actin-binding proteins and G-proteins from the Rho family.

## C. Intermediate Filaments

IFs are composed of fibrous protein polymers that provide structural support to membranes of the cells and scaffolding for attachment of other cellular components. Each IF subunit is composed of a long rodlike $\alpha$-helical core containing globular spacing domains, and globular $N$ - and $C$-terminal domains. The $\alpha$-helical segments of two subunits coil around each other to form a coiled coil and then combine with another dimer coil to form a tetramer. Depending on the type of filament, the dimers may be either hetero- or homodimers. The tetramers join end to end to form protofilaments, and approximately eight protofilaments combine to form filaments (Fig. 10.18). Filament assembly is partially controlled through phosphorylation.

In contrast to actin thin filaments, the 50 or so different types of IFs are each composed of a different protein having the same general structure described previously. Some of the IFs, such as the nuclear lamins, are common to all cell types. These filaments provide a latticelike support network attached to the inner nuclear membrane. Other IFs are specific for types of cells (e.g., epithelial cells have cytokeratins, and neurons have neurofilaments). These provide an internal network that helps to support the shape and resilience of the cell.

## CLINICAL COMMENTS

AI M. Al M. has been drinking for 5 years and has begun to exhibit mental and systemic effects of chronic alcohol consumption. In his brain, ethanol has altered the fluidity of neuronal lipids, causing changes in their response to neurotransmitters released from exocytotic vesicles. In his liver, increased levels of the MEOS (cytochrome P450-2E1) located in the SER have increased his rate of ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde, a compound that is toxic to the cells. His liver also continues to oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde through a cytosolic enzyme, liver alcohol dehydrogenase.

FIGURE 10.18 Formation of a cytokeratin filament. The central rod of the keratin monomer is principally an $\alpha$-helical structure.A specific acidic keratin monomer combines with a specific basic keratin monomer to form a heterodimer coil (a coiled-coil structure). Two dimers combine in antiparallel fashion to form a tetramer, and the tetramers combine head to tail to form protofilaments. Approximately eight protofilaments combine to form a filament. The filament is thicker than actin filaments (called thin filaments or microfilaments) and thinner than microtubules (thick tubes) and is therefore called an intermediate filament.

One of the toxic effects of acetaldehyde is inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Tubulin is used in the liver for secretion of very low-density lipoprotein particles containing newly synthesized triacylglycerols. As a result, these triacylglycerols accumulate in the liver, and he has begun to develop a fatty liver. Acetaldehyde may also damage protein components of the inner mitochondrial membrane and affect its ability to pump protons to the cytosol.

Lotta T. Lotta T. had a rapid and gratifying clinical response to the hourly administration of colchicine. This drug diminishes phagocytosis and the subsequent release of the lysosomal enzymes that initiate the inflammatory response in synovial tissue.

The inflammatory response that causes the symptoms of an acute attack of gout begins when neutrophils and macrophages ingest urate crystals. In neutrophils, urate activates the conversion of the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (present in membrane phospholipids) to leukotriene $\mathrm{B}_{4}$. The release of this messenger contributes to the pain. Colchicine, through its effect on tubulin, inhibits phagocytosis, leukotriene $\mathrm{B}_{4}$ release, and recruitment and cell division of additional cells involved in inflammation. Colchicine also inhibits the tubulin-dependent release of histamine from mast cells. As a result, there was a rapid improvement in the pain and swelling in Lotta's great toe.

After the gout attack subsided, Ms. T. was placed on daily allopurinol, a drug that inhibits urate production (see Chapter 8). During the next 6 months of allopurinol therapy, Ms. T.'s blood urate levels decreased. She did not have another gout attack during this time.

3D
Dennis V. Dennis V. was diagnosed with cholera. He was placed on intravenous rehydration therapy, followed by oral rehydration therapy with high glucose- and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-containing fluids (to be continued in Chapter 11).
V. cholerae secrete a toxin consisting of one A- and multiple B-subunits. The B -subunits allowing binding to the intestinal epithelia, and the A -subunit is processed and transported into the cell, where it associates with the monomeric G-protein Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor). The cholera toxin A-subunit ADP-ribosylates the $\mathrm{G} \alpha$-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$ (a process discussed in Chapter 11). The net result is activation of protein kinase A, which then phosphorylates the CFTR chloride channel so that it remains permanently open. The subsequent efflux of chloride, sodium, and water into the bowel lumen is responsible for Dennis V.'s diarrhea and subsequent dehydration.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

4Differences between Bacterial and Human Cells. Different species of bacteria have some common structural features that distinguish them from animal cells. They are single-cell organisms that are classified as prokaryotes ("before nucleus"). Their genetic material (DNA) is concentrated in the central region of the cell, called a nucleoid rather than a nucleus, because it is not separated from the rest of the cellular contents by a membrane. Likewise, bacteria contain no cytoplasmic organelles defined by membranes. They do have a plasma membrane that encloses the cytoplasm. External to the plasma membrane is a peptidoglycan cell wall composed of extensively cross-linked polysaccharides that form a protective shield on the surface of the cell.

Bacterial cells obtain nutrients from the medium on which they grow. Many of their metabolic pathways for fuel oxidation are similar to those in eukaryotes and generate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and ATP; however, individual steps in these pathways may use different coenzymes or very different enzymes for catalysis than do human cells. Like human cells, bacteria use intermediates of

glycolysis and other basic degradative pathways to serve as precursors for biosynthetic pathways, and energy acquired from catabolic pathways is used in anabolic pathways. Aerobic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, contain enzymes of the TCA cycle and the components of the electron-transport chain, which are located in the cell membrane. However, many bacteria are anaerobes and can function in the absence of oxygen.

Many of the metabolic differences between human cells and bacteria are related to their interactions with their environment. Some bacteria, such as E. coli, can adapt to adverse or changing conditions (high vs. low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ tension, or a single supply of nutrients from which to synthesize all required components) by dramatic shifts in the genes that are transcribed. Other bacteria find a unique environmental niche where they do not have to compete with other bacteria for nutrients (e.g., Lactobacilli in yogurt are adapted to an acidic pH ). In contrast, the human cells are adapted to interacting with blood and interstitial fluid, which provides a well-controlled pH , a constant nutrient supply, and a medium for communication between very distant cells. As a consequence of their constant environment, adult human cells seldom need to adapt (or can adapt) to widely fluctuating conditions through large variations in the genes transcribed. As a consequence of being organized into a multicellular organism, human cell types have been able to specialize in function, structure, and enzyme content.

| TABLE 10.1 Diseases Discussed in Chapter 10 |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| DISORDER OR CONDITION | GENETIC OR ENVIRONMENTAL | COMMENTS |
| Cholera | Environmental | Watery diarrhea leading to dehydration and hypovolemic shock caused by cholera toxin ADP-ribosylating a class of G-proteins, altering their function and affecting water and salt transport across the intestinal mucosa. Treat with a glucose electrolyte solution to increase coupled glucose-sodium uptake into the intestinal epithelial cells, reversing the loss of water from these cells. |
| Gout | Both | Treat by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, thereby reducing the production of uric acid, using the analog allopurinol. Before allopurinol, the patient is treated with colchicine, which blocks microtubule formation and the migration of neutrophils to the affected area. |
| Gas gangrene | Environmental | Bacterial infection that secretes a toxin which is a phospholipase, leading to cell membrane destruction. This leads to capillary destruction and impaired blood flow to the affected area. |
| Alcoholism | Both | Ethanol poisoning caused by increased production of acetaldehyde resulting from the combined actions of alcohol dehydrogenase and the induction of the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS). MEOS is induced because of the high levels of ethanol in the patient's diet. |

# ANSWERS 

1. The answer is D. Phosphatidylserine, the only lipid with a net negative charge at neutral pH , is located in the inner leaflet, where it contributes to the more negatively charged intracellular side of the membrane. The expression of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is often associated with aging. The membrane is composed principally of phospholipids and cholesterol (thus, A is incorrect). Phospholipids are amphipathic (contain polar and nonpolar ends; see Chapter 5), with their polar head groups extending into the aqueous medium inside and outside of the cell. The fatty acyl groups of the two layers face each other on the inside of the bilayer, and the polar oligosaccharide groups of glycoproteins and glycolipids extend into the aqueous medium (thus, B, C, and E are incorrect).
2. The answer is E. The transmembrane regions are $\alpha$-helices with hydrophobic amino acid side chains binding to membrane lipids. The hydrophobic interactions hinder their extraction (thus, A and D are incorrect). Because they are not easily extracted, they are classified as integral proteins (thus, B is incorrect). The carboxyl and amino terminals of transmembrane proteins extend into the aqueous intra- and extracellular medium and thus need to contain many hydrophilic residues (thus, C is incorrect).
3. The answer is A. Most of fuel oxidation and ATP generation occurs in the mitochondrion. Although some may also occur in the cytosol, the amount produced in the cytoplasm is much smaller than in the mitochondria in most cells.

4. The answer is A. Channels which open in response to a change in ion concentration across the membrane (which results in a change in membrane potential, or voltage, across the membrane) are known as voltage-gated channels. The calcium influx is not passive diffusion because a carrier is required (the channel). This is not an active transport process because calcium is flowing down its concentration gradient and the cell is not concentrating calcium within it. A ligand-gated channel opens when a particular ligand binds to it, not when the membrane potential changes. There is no phosphorylation event required in the opening of this calcium channel, so it is not an example of a phosphorylation-gated channel.
5. The answer is A. ATP is required by the vesicular ATPase, which uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to concentrate protons within the lysosome, which generates the acidic environment required for enzyme activity. Answer B is, therefore, incorrect because lysosomes are acidic compared to the cytoplasm, not basic. ATP is not required to either activate or regulate, or act as a cofactor for, any lysosomal hydrolase.
6. The answer is C. Oxygen enters red blood cells via diffusion across its plasma membrane and binds to hemoglobin within the cell. Aerobic metabolism requires the presence of mitochondria, which are lacking in red blood cells. The red blood cell metabolizes glucose for energy, so the enzymes for glucose metabolism are present in the cell.
7. The answer is B. Energy is needed to create the ion imbalance across the membrane, so the protein does not catalyze simple diffusion. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$-ATPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to create the ion gradient by exchanging three sodium ions (from the
cytoplasm) for two potassium ions (from outside the cell). This results in the export of sodium, and uptake of potassium, in an electrogenic manner (charge imbalance across the membrane). This is an example of primary active transport. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient then powers the transport of glucose into the cell against its concentration gradient (an example of secondary active transport). Urea leaving liver cells is not powered by a sodium gradient.
8. The answer is C. The CFTR is an example of a ligandgated channel regulated through phosphorylation-gated channels. The CFTR allows chloride ions to cross the membrane but not sodium ions. It is considered simple diffusion even though ATP is involved. Energy is not required in simple diffusion as it is in an active transport system.
9. The answer is B. Dystrophin is a spectrin-like protein (not lipid) that is present in skeletal muscle cells. It binds with actin to form the inner membrane skeleton or the cortical skeleton. It is a peripheral membrane protein, not a transmembrane protein, and therefore does not bind hormones or neurotransmitters.
10. The answer is C. Unsaturated fatty acid chains form a pocket for cholesterol binding which prevents the hydrophobic chains from packing too closely together thereby maintaining fluidity of the membrane and allowing the red blood cells to "deform" through small spaces. The fluidity of the plasma membrane is also partially determined by the unsaturated fatty acid content of the diet, so a diet high in unsaturated fat would theoretically act like the medication. Saturated fats do not bind to cholesterol in this manner and also tend to decrease the fluidity of the membrane.

# Cell Signaling by Chemical Messengers 

![ma17550024193](ma17550024193.jpg)

FIGURE II.I General features of chemical messengers. (I) Secretion of chemical message. (2) Binding of message to cell surface receptor. (3) Diffusion of a hydrophobic message across the plasma membrane and binding to an intracellular receptor.

Within a complex organism such as the human, the different organs, tissues, and cell types have developed specialized functions. Yet each cell must contribute in an integrated way as the body grows, differentiates, and adapts to changing conditions. Such integration requires communication that is carried out by chemical messengers traveling from one cell to another by direct contact of cells with the extracellular matrix or by direct contact of one cell with another. The eventual goal of such signals is to change actions carried out in target cells by intracellular proteins (metabolic enzymes, gene regulatory proteins, ion channels, or cytoskeletal proteins). In this chapter, we present a basic overview of signaling by chemical messengers.

Chemical Messengers. Chemical messengers (also called signaling molecules) transmit messages between cells. They are secreted from one cell in response to a specific stimulus and travel to a target cell, where they bind to a specific receptor and elicit a response (Fig. II.I). In the nervous system, these chemical messengers are called neurotransmitters; in the endocrine system, they are hormones; and in the immune system, they are called cytokines. Additional chemical messengers include retinoids, eicosanoids, and growth factors. Depending on the distance between the secreting and target cells, chemical messengers can be classified as endocrine (travel in the blood), paracrine (travel between nearby cells), or autocrine (act on the same cell that produces the message).

Receptors and Signal Transduction. Receptors are proteins that contain a binding site specific for a single chemical messenger and another binding site involved in transmitting the message (see Fig. II.I). The second binding site may interact with another protein or with DNA. They may be either plasma membrane receptors (which span the plasma membrane and contain an extracellular binding domain for the messenger) or intracellular binding proteins (for messengers able to diffuse into the cell) (see Fig. II.I). Most plasma membrane receptors fall into the categories of ion-channel receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors, tyrosine kinase-associated receptors, serine-threonine kinase receptors, or heptahelical receptors (proteins with seven $\alpha$-helices spanning the membrane). When a chemical messenger binds to a receptor, the signal it is carrying must be converted into an intracellular response. This conversion is called signal transduction.

Signal Transduction for Intracellular Receptors. Most intracellular receptors are gene-specific transcription factors, proteins that bind to DNA and regulate the transcription of certain genes. (Gene transcription is the process of copying the genetic code from DNA to RNA and is discussed further in Chapter 15.)

Signal Transduction for Plasma Membrane Receptors. Mechanisms of signal transduction that follow the binding of signaling molecules to plasma membrane receptors include phosphorylation of receptors at tyrosine residues (receptor tyrosine kinase activity), conformational changes in signal transducer proteins (e.g., proteins with Src homology 2 [SH2] domains, the monomeric guanosine triphosphate [GTP]-binding proteins [G-proteins] like Ras, or heterotrimeric G-proteins), or increases in the levels of intracellular second messengers. Second messengers are nonprotein molecules that are generated inside the cel in response

to hormone binding and that continue transmission of the message. Examples include $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inositol trisphosphate (IP $)_{3}$ ), and diacylglycerol (DAG).

Signaling often requires a rapid response and rapid termination of the message, which may be achieved by degradation of the receptor itself, by degradation of the messenger or second messenger, the conversion of GTP to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) on GTP-dependent signaling molecules, deactivation of signal transduction kinases by phosphatases, or other means.

## THE WAITING ROOM

$\mathbf{O}$
Mia S. is a 37-year-old woman who complains of increasing muscle fatigue, which she notices mostly with eating: Halfway through a meal, she has trouble chewing her food. If she rests for 5 to 10 minutes, her strength returns to normal. She also notes that if she talks on the phone, her ability to form words gradually decreases because of fatigue of the muscles of speech. She also reports that by evening, her upper eyelids droop to the point that she has to pull her upper lids back in order to see normally. These symptoms are becoming increasingly severe. When Mia is asked to sustain an upward gaze, her upper eyelids eventually drift downward involuntarily. When she is asked to hold both arms straight out in front of her for as long as she is able, both arms begin to drift downward within minutes. Her physician suspects that Mia has myasthenia gravis and orders a test to determine whether she has antibodies in her blood directed against the acetylcholine $(\mathrm{ACh})$ receptor.

Ann $\mathbf{R}$., who suffers from anorexia nervosa, has increased her weight to 102 lb from a low of 85 lb (see Chapter 9). On the advice of her physician, she has been eating more to prevent fatigue during her daily jogging regimen. She runs about 10 miles before breakfast every second day and forces herself to drink a high-energy supplement immediately afterward.

Dennis V. was hospitalized for dehydration resulting from cholera toxin (see Chapter 10). In his intestinal mucosal cells, the cholera toxin A-subunit indirectly activated the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel, resulting in secretion of chloride and sodium ions into his intestinal lumen. Ion secretion was followed by loss of water, resulting in vomiting and watery diarrhea. Dennis is being treated for hypovolemic shock by replacing his fluid loss with intravenous fluids.

## I. General Features of Chemical Messengers

Certain universal characteristics of chemical messenger systems are illustrated in Figure 11.1. Signaling generally follows this sequence: (1) the chemical messenger is secreted from a specific cells in response to a stimulus; (2) the messenger diffuses or is transported through blood or other extracellular fluid to the target cell; (3) a molecule in the target cell, termed a receptor (a plasma membrane receptor or intracellular receptor), specifically binds the messenger; (4) binding of the messenger to the receptor elicits a response; (5) the signal ceases and is terminated. Chemical messengers elicit their response in the target cell without being metabolized by the cell.

An additional feature of chemical messenger systems is that the specificity of the response is dictated by the type of receptor and its location. Generally, each receptor binds only one specific chemical messenger, and each receptor initiates a characteristic signal transduction pathway that will ultimately activate or inhibit certain processes in the cell. Only certain cells, the target cells, carry receptors for that messenger and are capable of responding to its message.

$\Delta$ACh is released by neurons and acts on ACh receptors at neuromuscular junctions to stimulate muscle contraction. Myasthenia gravis is an acquired autoimmune disease in which most patients have developed pathogenic antibodies against these receptors. Mia S.'s decreasing ability to form words as well as her other symptoms of muscle weakness are being caused by the inability of ACh to stimulate repeated muscle contraction when the numbers of effective ACh receptors at neuromuscular junctions are greatly reduced.

Endocrine hormones enable Ann R. to mobilize fuels from her adipose tissue during her periods of fasting and during jogging. Although she fasts overnight, $\alpha$-cells of her pancreas increase secretion of the polypeptide hormone glucagon. The stress of prolonged fasting and chronic exercise stimulates release of cortisol, a steroid hormone, from her adrenal cortex. The exercise of jogging also increases secretion of the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla. Each of these hormones is being released in response to a specific signal and causes a characteristic response in a target tissue, enabling her to exercise. However, each of these hormones binds to a different type of receptor and works in a different way.

Ann R.'s fasting is accompanied by high levels of the endocrine hormone glucagon, which is secreted in response to low blood glucose levels. It enters the blood and acts on the liver to stimulate several pathways, including the release of glucose from glycogen stores (glycogenolysis) (see Chapter 3). The specificity of its action is determined by the location of receptors. Although liver parenchymal cells have glucagon receptors, skeletal muscle and many other tissues do not. Therefore, glucagon cannot stimulate glycogenolysis in these tissues.

The means of signal termination is an exceedingly important aspect of cell signaling, and failure to terminate a signal contributes to several diseases such as cancer.

## A. General Features of Chemical Messenger Systems Applied to the Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor

The individual steps involved in cell signaling by chemical messengers are illustrated with acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter that acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the plasma membrane of certain muscle cells. This system exhibits the classic features of chemical messenger release and specificity of response.

Neurotransmitters are secreted from neurons in response to an electrical stimulus called the action potential (a voltage difference across the plasma membrane caused by changes in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$gradients that is propagated along a nerve). The neurotransmitters diffuse across a synapse to another excitable cell, where they elicit a response (Fig. 11.2). ACh is the neurotransmitter at neuromuscular junctions, where it transmits a signal from a motor nerve to a muscle fiber that elicits contraction of the fiber. Prior to release, ACh is sequestered in vesicles clustered near an active zone in the presynaptic membrane. This membrane also has voltagegated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels that open when the action potential reaches them, resulting in an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ triggers fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane, and ACh is released into the synaptic cleft. Thus, the chemical messenger is released from a specific cell in response to a specific stimulus. The mechanism of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is common to the release of many second messengers.

ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft to bind to the nicotinic ACh receptor on the plasma membrane of the muscle cells (Fig. 11.3). The subunits of the receptor are assembled around a channel, which has a funnel-shaped opening in the center. As ACh binds to one of the subunits of the receptor, a conformational change
![ma17650024193](ma17650024193.jpg)

FIGURE II. 2 Acetylcholine (ACh) receptors at the neuromuscular junction. A motor nerve terminates in several branches; each branch terminates in a bulb-shaped structure called the presynaptic bouton. Each bouton synapses with a region of the muscle fiber that contains junctional folds. At the crest of each fold, there is a high concentration of ACh receptors, which are gated ion channels.

![ma17750024193](ma17750024193.jpg)

FIGURE II. 3 The nicotinic acetylcholine ( ACh ) receptor. Each receptor is composed of five subunits, and each subunit has four membrane-spanning helical regions. For clarity, only three subunits are shown in this figure. The two $\alpha$-subunits are identical and contain binding sites for ACh. When two ACh molecules are bound, the subunits change their conformation so that the channel in the center of the receptor is open, allowing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions to diffuse out and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions to diffuse in.
opens the narrow portion of the channel (the gate), allowing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to diffuse in and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$to diffuse out (a uniform property of all receptors is that signal transduction begins with conformational changes in the receptor). The change in ion concentration activates a sequence of events that eventually triggers the cellular responsecontraction of the fiber.

Once ACh secretion stops, the message is rapidly terminated by acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme located on the postsynaptic membrane that cleaves ACh. It is also terminated by diffusion of ACh away from the synapse. Rapid termination of messages is a characteristic of systems that require a rapid response from the target cell.

## B. Endocrine, Paracrine, and Autocrine Actions

The actions of chemical messengers are often classified as endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine (Fig. 11.4). Each endocrine hormone (e.g., insulin) is secreted by a specific cell type (generally in an endocrine gland), enters the blood, and exerts its actions on specific target cells, which may be some distance away. In contrast to endocrine hormones, paracrine actions are those carried out on nearby cells, and the location of the cells plays a role in the specificity of the response. Synaptic transmission by ACh and other neurotransmitters (sometimes called neurocrine signaling) is an example of paracrine signaling. ACh activates only those ACh receptors that are located across the synaptic cleft from the signaling nerve, not every muscle cell with ACh receptors. Paracrine actions are also very important in limiting the immune response to a specific location in the body, a feature that helps prevent the development of autoimmune disease. Autocrine actions involve a messenger that acts on the cell from which it is secreted or on nearby cells that are the same type as the secreting cells.

## C. Types of Chemical Messengers

There are three types of major signaling systems in the body employing chemical messengers: the nervous system, the endocrine system, and the immune system. Some messengers are difficult to place in just one such category.

0Myasthenia gravis is a disease of autoimmunity, which in most cases is caused by the production of an antibody directed against the ACh receptor in skeletal muscle. In this disease, B- and T-lymphocytes cooperate in producing a variety of antibodies against the nicotinic ACh receptor. The antibodies then bind to various locations in the receptor and cross-link the receptors, forming a multireceptor antibody complex. The complex is endocytosed and incorporated into lysosomes, where it is degraded. Mia S., therefore, has fewer functional receptors on the muscle cell membrane for ACh to activate.

0ACh acts on two different types of receptors; nicotinic and muscarinic. Nicotinic receptors (for which nicotine is an activator) are found at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle cells, as well as in the parasympathetic nervous system. Muscarinic receptors (for which muscarine, a mushroom toxin, is an activator) are found at the neuromuscular junction of cardiac and smooth muscle cells, as well as in the sympathetic nervous system. Curare (a paralyzing agent) is an inhibitor of nicotinic ACh receptors, whereas atropine is an inhibitor of muscarinic ACh receptors. Atropine can be used under conditions in which acetylcholinesterase has been inactivated by various nerve gases or chemicals such that atropine will block the effects of the excess ACh present at the synapse.

0Mia S. could be tested with an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, edrophonium chloride, which is administered intravenously. After this drug inactivates acetylcholinesterase, ACh that is released from the nerve terminal accumulates in the synaptic cleft. Even though Mia expresses fewer ACh receptors on her muscle cells (owing to the autoantibody-induced degradation of receptors), by increasing the local concentration of ACh, these receptors have a higher probability of being occupied and activated. Therefore, acute intravenous administration of this short-acting drug briefly improves muscular weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis.

![ma17850024193](ma17850024193.jpg)

FIGURE II.4 Endocrine, autocrine, and paracrine actions of hormones and other chemical messengers.

The catecholamine hormone epinephrine (also called adrenaline) is the fright, fight, and flight hormone. Epinephrine and the structurally similar hormone norepinephrine are released from the adrenal medulla in response to a variety of immediate stresses, including pain, hemorrhage, exercise, hypoglycemia, and hypoxia. Thus, as Ann R. begins to jog, there is a rapid release of epinephrine and norepinephrine into her blood.

## I. The Nervous System

The nervous system secretes two types of messengers: small-molecule neurotransmitters, often called biogenic amines, and neuropeptides. Small-molecule neurotransmitters are nitrogen-containing molecules, several of which are amino acids or derivatives of amino acids (e.g., ACh, epinephrine, and $\gamma$-aminobutyrate; Fig. 11.5). Neuropeptides are usually small peptides (between 4 and 35 amino acids), secreted by neurons, that act as neurotransmitters at synaptic junctions or are secreted into the blood to act as neurohormones.

## 2. The Endocrine System

Endocrine hormones are defined as compounds secreted from specific endocrine cells in endocrine glands, which reach their target cells following transport through the blood. Insulin, for example, is an endocrine hormone secreted from the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas. Classic hormones are generally divided into the structural categories of polypeptide hormones (e.g., insulin; see Fig. 6.12 for the structure of insulin), catecholamines such as epinephrine (which is also a neurotransmitter), steroid hormones (which are derived from cholesterol), and thyroid hormone (which is derived from tyrosine). Many of these endocrine hormones also exert paracrine or autocrine actions. The hormones that regulate metabolism are discussed throughout this chapter and in subsequent chapters of this text.

Some compounds that are normally considered hormones are more difficult to categorize. For example, retinoids, which are derivatives of vitamin A (also called retinol) and vitamin D (which is also derived from cholesterol) are usually classified as hormones, although they are not synthesized in endocrine cells.

## 3. The Immune System

The messengers of the immune system, called cytokines, are small proteins with a molecular weight of approximately $20,000 \mathrm{Da}$. Cytokines regulate a network of responses designed to kill invading microorganisms. The different classes of cytokines (interleukins, tumor necrosis factors, interferons, and colony-stimulating factors) are secreted by cells of the immune system and usually alter the behavior of other cells in the immune system by activating the transcription of genes for proteins involved in the immune response. Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines in that these molecules have the ability to induce movement in targeted cells toward the source of the chemokines.

## 4. The Eicosanoids

The eicosanoids (including prostaglandins [PG], thromboxanes, and leukotrienes) control cellular function in response to injury (Fig. 11.6). These compounds are all

derived from arachidonic acid, a 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid that is usually present in cells as part of the membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine (see Chapter 5, Fig. 5.19). Although almost every cell in the body produces an eicosanoid in response to tissue injury, different cells produce different eicosanoids. The eicosanoids act principally in paracrine and autocrine functions, affecting the cells that produce them or their neighboring cells. For example, vascular endothelial cells (cells that line the vessel wall) secrete the prostaglandin prostacyclin ( $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ ), which acts on nearby smooth muscle cells to cause vasodilation (expansion of blood vessels). The synthesis and metabolism of the eicosanoids are discussed further in Chapter 31.

## 5. Growth Factors

Growth factors are polypeptides that function through stimulation of cellular proliferation (hyperplasia) or cell size (hypertrophy). For example, platelets aggregating at the site of injury to a blood vessel secrete platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF stimulates the proliferation of nearby smooth muscle cells, which eventually form a plaque covering the injured site. Some growth factors are considered hormones, and some have been called cytokines.

## II. Intracellular Transcription Factor Receptors

## A. Intracellular versus Plasma Membrane Receptors

The structural properties of a messenger determine, to some extent, the type of receptor it binds. Most receptors fall into two broad categories: intracellular receptors or plasma membrane receptors (Fig. 11.7). Messengers using intracellular receptors must be hydrophobic molecules able to diffuse through the plasma membrane into cells. In contrast, polar molecules such as peptide hormones, cytokines, and catecholamines cannot rapidly cross the plasma membrane and must bind to a plasma membrane receptor.

Most of the intracellular receptors for lipophilic messengers are gene-specific transcription factors. A transcription factor is a protein that binds to a specific site

![ma18350024193](ma18350024193.jpg)

FIGURE II.7 Intracellular versus plasma membrane receptors. Plasma membrane receptors have extracellular binding domains. Intracellular receptors bind steroid hormones or other messengers that are able to diffuse through the plasma membrane. Their receptors may reside in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus, reside in the nucleus bound to DNA, or reside in the nucleus bound to other proteins.

## 6

Lotta T. suffered enormously painful gout attacks affecting her great toe (see "Clinical Comments," Chapter 8). The extreme pain was caused by the release of a leukotriene that stimulated pain receptors. The precipitated urate crystals in her big toe stimulated recruited inflammatory cells to release the leukotriene.

on DNA and regulates the rate of transcription of a gene (i.e., synthesis of mRNA; see Chapter 16). External signaling molecules bind to transcription factors that bind to a specific sequence on DNA and regulate the expression of only certain genes; they are called gene-specific or site-specific transcription factors.

# B. The Steroid Hormone/Thyroid Hormone Superfamily of Receptors 

Lipophilic hormones that use intracellular gene-specific transcription factors include the steroid hormones (such as estrogen and cortisol), thyroid hormone, retinoic acid (the active form of vitamin A), and vitamin D (Fig. 11.8). Because these compounds are water-insoluble, they are transported in the blood bound to serum albumin, which has a hydrophobic binding pocket, or to more specific transport proteins such as steroid hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) or thyroid hormone-binding globulin (TBG). The intracellular receptors for these hormones are structurally similar and are referred to as the steroid hormone/thyroid hormone superfamily of receptors.

The steroid hormone/thyroid hormone superfamily of receptors reside primarily in the nucleus, although some members are also found in the cytoplasm. The glucocorticoid receptor, for example, exists as cytoplasmic multimeric complexes associated
![ma18450024193](ma18450024193.jpg)

FIGURE II.8 Steroid hormone-thyroid hormone superfamily. A. Cortisol (a glucocorticoid). B. Aldosterone (a mineralocorticoid). C. Thyroid hormone. D. Vitamin $D_{3}$. E. Retinoids.

with heat-shock proteins. When the hormone cortisol (a glucocorticoid) binds, the receptor undergoes a conformational change and dissociates from the heat-shock proteins, exposing a nuclear translocation signal (a signal specifying its transport to the nucleus). The receptors dimerize and the complex (including bound hormone) translocates to the nucleus where it binds to a portion of the DNA called the hormone response element (e.g., the glucocorticoid receptor binds to the glucocorticoid response element [GRE]). The majority of the intracellular receptors, however, reside principally in the nucleus, and some of these are constitutively bound to their response element in DNA (e.g., the thyroid hormone receptor). Binding of the hormone changes their activity and their ability to associate with, or disassociate from, DNA. Regulation of gene transcription by these receptors is described in more detail in Chapter 16.

As an example of the complexity that can occur with the steroid hormone superfamily of receptors, several nuclear receptors play important roles in intermediary metabolism and they have become the targets of lipid-lowering drugs. These include the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ ), the liver X -activated receptor (LXR), the farnesoid X -activated receptor (FXR), and the pregnane X receptor (PXR). These receptors form heterodimers with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and bind to their appropriate response elements in DNA in an inactive state. When the activating ligand binds to the receptor (fatty acids and their derivatives for the PPARs, oxysterols for LXR, bile salts for FXR, and secondary bile salts for PXR), the complex is activated and gene expression is altered. Unlike the cortisol receptor, these receptors reside in the nucleus and are activated once their ligands enter the nucleus and bind to them.

## III. Plasma Membrane Receptors and Signal Transduction

All plasma membrane receptors are proteins with certain features in common: an extracellular domain that binds the chemical messenger, one or more membranespanning domains that are $\alpha$-helices, and an intracellular domain that initiates signal transduction. As the ligand binds to the extracellular domain of its receptor, it causes a conformational change that is communicated to the intracellular domain through the rigid $\alpha$-helix of the transmembrane domain. The activated intracellular domain initiates a characteristic signal transduction pathway that usually involves the binding of specific intracellular signal transduction proteins. Signal transduction pathways run in one direction. From a given point in a signal transduction pathway, events closer to the receptor are referred to as upstream, and events closer to the response are referred to as downstream.

The pathways of signal transduction for plasma membrane receptors have two major types of effects on the cell: (1) rapid and immediate effects on cellular ion levels or activation/inhibition of enzymes and/or (2) slower changes in the rate of gene expression for a specific set of proteins. Often, a signal transduction pathway will ultimately produce both kinds of effects.

## A. Major Classes of Plasma Membrane Receptors

Individual plasma membrane receptors are grouped into three categories: ion-channel receptors, receptors that are kinases or bind to and activate kinases, and receptors that work through second messengers. This classification is based on the receptor's general structure and means of signal transduction.

## I. Ion-Channel Receptors

The ion-channel receptors are similar in structure to the previously discussed nicotinic ACh receptor (see Fig. 11.3). Signal transduction consists of the conformational change when ligand binds. Most small-molecule neurotransmitters and some neuropeptides use ion-channel receptors.

(1)The steroid hormone cortisol is synthesized and released from the adrenal cortex in response to the polypeptide hormone adrenal corticotrophic hormone (ACTH). Chronic stress (pain, hypoglycemia, hemorrhage, and exercise) signals are passed from the brain cortex to the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary, which releases ACTH. Cortisol acts on tissues to change enzyme levels and redistribute nutrients in preparation for acute stress. For example, it increases transcription of the genes for regulatory enzymes in the pathway of gluconeogenesis (called gene-specific activation of transcription, or induction of protein synthesis). The net result of this activity is an increased cellular content of the enzymes. Induction of gluconeogenic enzymes prepares the liver to respond rapidly to hypoglycemia with increased synthesis of glucose. Ann R. who has frequently been fasting and exercising, has an increased capacity for gluconeogenesis in her liver.

Heptahelical receptors
![ma18650024193](ma18650024193.jpg)

FIGURE II. 10 G-protein-coupled receptors and second messengers. The secreted chemical messenger (hormone, cytokine, or neurotransmitter) is the first messenger, which binds to a plasma membrane receptor such as the heptahelical receptors. The activated hormone-receptor complex activates a heterotrimeric G-protein (via an exchange of guanosine triphosphate for the bound guanosine diphosphate [GDP]; see Fig. II.17) and, via stimulation of membranebound enzymes, different G-proteins lead to generation of one or more intracellular second messengers, such as $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), diacylglycerol (DAG), or inositol trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$.

## 2. Receptors that Are Kinases or that Bind Kinases

There are several types of receptors that are kinases or bind kinases, as illustrated in Figure 11.9. Protein kinases transfer a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the hydroxyl group of a specific amino acid side chain in the target protein. Their common feature is that the intracellular kinase domain of the receptor (or the kinase domain of the associated protein) is activated when the messenger binds to the extracellular domain. The receptor kinase phosphorylates an amino acid residue (serine, threonine, tyrosine, or, rarely, histidine) on the receptor (autophosphorylation) and/or an associated protein. The message is propagated downstream through signal transducer proteins that bind to the activated messenger-receptor complex (e.g., signal transducer and activator of transcription [STAT], Smad (named after the first two proteins identified, Sma in Caenorhabditis elegans and Mad in Drosophila), or an Src homology 2 [SH2] domain-containing protein such as growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 [Grb2]).

## 3. Heptahelical Receptors

Heptahelical receptors (also called G-protein-coupled receptors [GPCRs]) contain seven membrane-spanning $\alpha$-helices and are the most common type of plasma membrane receptor (Fig. 11.10). They work through second messengers, which are small nonprotein compounds, such as cAMP, generated inside the cell in response to messenger binding to the receptor. They continue intracellular transmission of the message from the hormone/cytokine/neurotransmitter, which is the "first" messenger. Second messengers are present in low concentrations so that modulation of their level, and hence the message, can be rapidly initiated and terminated.

## B. Signal Transduction through Tyrosine Kinase Receptors

The tyrosine kinase receptors are depicted in Figure 11.9A. They generally exist in the membrane as monomers with a single membrane-spanning helix. One molecule of the growth factor generally binds two molecules of the receptor and promotes their dimerization (Fig. 11.11). Once the receptor dimer has formed, the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains of the receptor phosphorylate each other on certain tyrosine residues (autophosphorylation). The phosphotyrosine residues form specific binding sites for signal transducer proteins.

## I. Ras and the MAP Kinase Pathway

The Ras-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway demonstrates how receptor tyrosine kinases can activate signaling through the assembly of protein complexes,

![ma18750024193](ma18750024193.jpg)

FIGURE II.II Signal transduction by tyrosine kinase receptors. (I) Binding and dimerization. (2) Autophosphorylation. (3) Binding of Grb2 and SOS. (4) SOS is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that binds Ras, a monomeric G-protein anchored to the plasma membrane. (5) GEF activates the exchange of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for bound guanosine diphosphate (GDP) on Ras. (6) Activated Ras containing GTP binds the target enzyme Raf, thereby activating it and a series of downstream kinases known as the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway.
caused by protein-protein interactions. In this pathway, one of the domains of the receptor containing a phosphotyrosine residue forms a binding site for intracellular proteins with a specific three-dimensional structure known as the SH2 domain (the SH2 domain, named for the first protein in which it was found, the Src protein of the Rous sarcoma virus). The adaptor protein Grb2 is one of the proteins with an SH2 domain that binds to phosphotyrosine residues on growth factor receptors. Binding to the receptor causes a conformational change in Grb2 that activates another binding site called an SH3 domain. These activated SH3 domains bind the protein SOS (SOS is an acronym for "son of sevenless," a name that is not related to the function or structure of the compound). SOS is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ras, a monomeric G-protein located in the plasma membrane (see Chapter 9, Section III.C.2). SOS catalyzes exchange of GTP for guanosine diphosphate (GDP) on Ras, causing a conformational change in Ras that promotes binding of the protein Raf. Raf is a serine protein kinase that is also called mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK). Raf begins a sequence of successive phosphorylation steps called a phos phorylation cascade. When one of the kinases in a cascade is phosphorylated, it binds and phosphorylates the next enzyme downstream in the cascade. The MAP kinase cascade ultimately leads to an alteration of gene transcription factor activity, thereby either upregulating or downregulating transcription of many genes involved in cell survival and proliferation.

Although many different signal transducer proteins have SH2 domains, and many receptors have phosphotyrosine residues, a signal transducer protein may only be specific for one type of receptor. This specificity of binding results from the fact that each phosphotyrosine residue has a different amino acid sequence around it that forms the binding domain. Similarly, the SH2 domain of the transducer protein is only part of its binding domain. Conversely, however, several transducer proteins will bind to multiple receptors (such as Grb2).

Many tyrosine kinase receptors (as well as heptahelical receptors) also have additional signaling pathways involving intermediates such as phosphatidylinositol phosphates.

# 2. Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates in Signal Transduction 

Phosphatidylinositol signaling molecules can be generated through either tyrosine kinase receptors or heptahelical receptors. Phosphatidylinositol phosphates serve two

![ma18850024193](ma18850024193.jpg)

FIGURE II.I2 Major route for generation of the phosphatidyl inositide signal molecules inositol $I^{\prime}, 4^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$, and phosphatidylinositol $3^{\prime}, 4^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-trisphosphate (PI-3,4,5-trisP). Phosphatidylinositol $3^{\prime}$-kinase (PI 3-kinase) phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol $4^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-bisP) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (not shown) at the 3 position. Prime symbols are sometimes used in these names to denote the inositol ring. Diacylglycerol (DAG) is also a second messenger. PLC, phospholipase C.
different functions in signal transduction: (1) Phosphatidylinositol $4^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-bisP) can be cleaved to generate the two intracellular second messengers, DAG and $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$; and (2) phosphatidylinositol $3^{\prime}, 4^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-trisphosphate (PI-3,4,5-trisP) can serve as a plasma-membrane docking site for signal transduction proteins.

Phosphatidylinositol, which is present in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, is converted to PI-4,5-bisP by kinases that phosphorylate the inositol ring at the $4^{\prime}$ and $5^{\prime}$ positions (Fig. 11.12). PI-4,5-bisP, which has three phosphate groups, is cleaved by a phospholipase C isozyme to generate $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and DAG. The phospholipase isozyme $\mathrm{C}_{\gamma}\left(\mathrm{PLC}_{\gamma}\right)$ is activated by tyrosine kinase growth-factor receptors, and phospholipase $\mathrm{C}_{\beta}$ is activated by a heptahelical receptor-G-protein signal transduction pathway.

PI-4,5-bisP can also be phosphorylated at the $3^{\prime}$ position of inositol by the enzyme phosphatidylinositol $3^{\prime}$-kinase (PI 3-kinase) to form PI-3,4,5-trisP (see Fig. 11.12). PI-3,4,5-trisP (and PI-3,4-bisP) form membrane docking sites for proteins that contain a certain sequence of amino acids called the pleckstrin homology $(\mathrm{PH})$ domain. PI 3-kinase contains an SH2 domain and is activated by binding to a specific phosphotyrosine site on a tyrosine kinase receptor or receptor-associated protein. The protein phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PI-3,4,5-trisP to PI-4,5-bisP, thereby removing the primary signal from the pathway. Mutations within PTEN, or misexpression of PTEN, can lead to cancer (see Chapter 18).

## 3. The Insulin Receptor

The insulin receptor, a member of the tyrosine kinase family of receptors, provides a good example of divergence in the pathway of signal transduction. Unlike other growth-factor receptors, the insulin receptor exists in the membrane as a preformed dimer, with each half containing an $\alpha$ - and a $\beta$-subunit (Fig. 11.13). The $\beta$-subunits autophosphorylate each other when insulin binds, thereby activating the receptor. The activated phosphorylated receptor binds a protein called insulin receptor substrate (IRS). The activated receptor kinase phosphorylates IRS at multiple sites, creating multiple binding sites for different proteins with SH2 domains. One of the sites binds the adapter protein Grb2, which leads to the activation of Ras and the MAP kinase pathway. At another phosphotyrosine site, PI 3-kinase binds and is activated.
![ma18950024193](ma18950024193.jpg)

FIGURE II.I3 Insulin receptor signaling. The insulin receptor is a dimer of two membranespanning $\alpha-\beta$ pairs. The tyrosine kinase domains are shown in red, and arrows indicate autocross-phosphorylation. The activated receptor binds IRS molecules (insulin receptor substrates) and phosphorylates IRS at multiple sites, thereby forming binding sites for proteins with SH2 domains, examples being Grb2, phospholipase $\mathrm{C}_{\gamma}\left(\mathrm{PLC}_{\gamma}\right)$, and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. Both $\mathrm{PLC}_{\gamma}$ and PI 3-kinase are associated with various phosphatidylinositol phosphates (all designated with PIP) in the plasma membrane and are an important part of second messenger production. Grb2 associates with a protein known as GAPI (Grb2-associated protein), which has a pleckstrin homology domain that associates with phosphatidylinositol phosphates in the membrane.

Ins, insulin; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PH domains, pleckstrin homology domains; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1; PKB, protein kinase B; PI-3,4,5-trisP, phosphatidylinositol 3',4',5'-trisphosphate; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase.

This pathway will lead to the activation of protein kinase B (PKB). At a third site, $\mathrm{PLC}_{\gamma}$ binds and is activated. The insulin receptor can also transmit signals through direct docking with other signal transduction intermediates.

The signal pathway initiated by the insulin-receptor complex involving PI 3-kinase leads to activation of protein kinase B (also called Akt), a serine-threonine kinase that mediates many of the downstream effects of insulin (Fig. 11.14). PI 3-kinase binds to IRS and phosphorylates PI-4,5-bisP in the membrane to form PI-3,4,5-trisP. Protein kinase B and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) are recruited to the membrane by their PH domains, where PDK1 phosphorylates and activates protein kinase B. One of the signal transduction pathways for Akt leads to the effects of insulin on glucose metabolism. Other pathways result in the phosphorylation of a host of other proteins that affect cell growth and survival. In general, phosphorylation of these proteins by Akt promotes cell survival. The action of insulin is covered in more detail in Chapters 26, 36, and 43. It is important to note that other receptors' tyrosine kinase receptors will also lead to the activation of the Akt pathway through the direct binding of PI 3-kinase to activated receptors (see Section III.B. 2 of this chapter).

# C. Signal Transduction by Cytokine Receptors: Use of JAK-STAT Proteins 

Tyrosine kinase-associated receptors in the cytokine receptor family transduce signals through janus kinase (JAK)/STAT proteins to regulate the proliferation of certain cells involved in the immune response (see Fig. 11.9B). The receptors themselves have no intrinsic kinase activity but bind (associate with) a tyrosine kinase of the JAK family. Their signal transducer proteins, called STATs, are themselves gene-specific transcription factors. Thus, cytokine receptors use a more direct route for propagation of the signal to the nucleus than tyrosine kinase receptors.

Each receptor monomer has an extracellular domain, a membrane-spanning region, and an intracellular domain. As the cytokine binds to these receptors, they form dimers or trimers (either between the same or distinct receptor molecules) and may cluster (Fig. 11.15). The activated receptor-associated tyrosine kinases phosphorylate each other on tyrosine residues and also phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor, forming phosphotyrosine-binding sites for the SH2 domain of a STAT. STATs are inactive in the cytoplasm until they bind to the receptor complex, where they are also phosphorylated by the bound JAK. Phosphorylation changes the

(2)Insulin is a growth factor that is essential for cell viability and growth. It increases general protein synthesis, which strongly affects muscle mass through hypertrophy. However, it also regulates immediate nutrient availability and storage, including glucose transport into skeletal muscle and glycogen synthesis. Thus, Dianne A. and other patients with type I diabetes mellitus who lack insulin rapidly develop hyperglycemia once insulin levels drop too low. They also exhibit muscle "wasting." To mediate the diverse regulatory roles of insulin, the signal transduction pathway diverges after activation of the receptor and phosphorylation of IRS, which has multiple binding sites for different signal-mediator proteins.

conformation of the STAT, causing it to dissociate from the receptor and dimerize with another phosphorylated STAT, thereby forming an activated transcription factor. The STAT dimer translocates to the nucleus and binds to a response element on DNA, thereby regulating gene transcription.

There are many different STAT proteins, each with a slightly different amino acid sequence. Receptors for different cytokines bind different STATs, which then form heterodimers in various combinations. This microheterogeneity allows different cytokines to target different genes. STAT signaling is regulated in several ways. Two prominent types are a protein family known as suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) and protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS). Both SOCS and PIAS genes are induced by activated STAT in order to limit the duration of the second message.

# D. Receptor Serine-Threonine Kinases 

Proteins in the transforming growth factor superfamily use receptors that have serine-threonine kinase activity and associate with proteins from the Smad family, which are gene-specific transcription factors (see Fig. 11.9C). This superfamily includes (1) transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ ), a cytokine/hormone involved in tissue repair, immune regulation, and cell proliferation; and (2) bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which control proliferation, differentiation, and cell death during development.

A simplified version of TGF- $\beta$ binding to its receptor complex and activating Smads is illustrated in Figure 11.16. The TGF- $\beta$ receptor complex is composed of two different single membrane-spanning receptor subunits (type I and type II), which have different functions even though they both have serine kinase domains.
![ma19250024193](ma19250024193.jpg)

FIGURE II.I6 Serine-threonine receptors and Smad proteins. Transforming growth factor $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ (TGF- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ ), which is composed of two identical subunits, communicates through a receptor dimer of type I and type II subunits that have serine kinase domains. The type I receptor phosphorylates an R-Smad (receptor-specific Smad), which binds a Co-Smad (common Smad, also called Smad 4). The Smad dimer then translocates to the nucleus to activate or inhibit the expression of target genes.

TGF- $\beta$ binds to a type II receptor. The activated type II receptor recruits a type I receptor, which it phosphorylates at a serine residue, forming an activated receptor complex. The type I receptor then binds a receptor-specific Smad protein (called an $R$-Smad), which it phosphorylates on serine residues. The phosphorylated R-Smad undergoes a conformational change and dissociates from the receptor. It then forms a complex with another member of the Smad family, Smad 4 (Smad 4 is known as the common Smad, Co-Smad, and is not phosphorylated). The Smad complex, which may contain several Smads, translocates to the nucleus, where it activates or inhibits the transcription of target genes. Receptors for distinct ligands bind different Smads, which bind to alternative sites on DNA and regulate the transcription of different sets of genes. There is also an inhibitory Smad that is activated which acts to regulate the extent of Smad activation (another example of signal termination).

## E. Signal Transduction through Heptahelical Receptors

The heptahelical receptors are named for their seven membrane-spanning domains, which are $\alpha$-helices (see Fig. 11.10; see also Fig. 7.9). Althoughhundreds of hormones and neurotransmitters work through heptahelical receptors, the extracellular binding domain of each receptor is specific for just one polypeptide hormone, catecholamine, or neurotransmitter (or a close structural analog). Heptahelical receptors have no intrinsic kinase activity but initiate signal transduction through heterotrimeric G-proteins composed of $\alpha-, \beta$-, and $\gamma$-subunits. However, different types of heptahelical receptors bind different G-proteins, and different G-proteins exert different effects on their target proteins. The activation of the G-protein leads to second messenger production within the cells. Second messengers are present in low concentrations so that modulation of their level, and hence the message, can be rapidly initiated and terminated.

## I. Heterotrimeric G-Proteins

The function of heterotrimeric G-proteins is illustrated in Figure 11.17 using a hormone that activates adenylyl cyclase (e.g., glucagon or epinephrine). While the $\alpha$-subunit contains bound GDP, it remains associated with the $\beta$ - and $\gamma$-subunits, either free in the membrane or bound to an unoccupied receptor (see Fig. 11.17, part 1). When the hormone binds, it causes a conformational change in the receptor that promotes GDP dissociation and GTP binding. The exchange of GTP for bound GDP causes dissociation of the $\alpha$-subunit from the receptor and from the $\beta$ - and $\gamma$-subunits (see Fig. 11.17, part 2). The $\alpha$ - and $\gamma$-subunits are tethered to the intracellular side of the plasma membrane through lipid anchors, but the subunits can still move laterally on the membrane surface. The GTP $\alpha$-subunit binds its target enzyme in the membrane, thereby changing its activity. In this example, the $\alpha$-subunit binds and activates adenylyl cyclase, thereby increasing synthesis of cAMP (see Fig. 11.17, part 3).

With time, the G $\alpha$-subunit inactivates itself by hydrolyzing its own bound GTP to GDP and inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ (an intrinsic GTPase activity). This action is unrelated to the number of cAMP molecules formed. Like the monomeric G-proteins, the $\alpha$-subunit now containing GDP dissociates from its target protein, adenylyl cyclase (see Fig. 11.17, part 4). It reforms the trimeric G-protein complex, which may return to bind the empty hormone receptor. As a result of this GTPase "internal clock," sustained elevation of hormone levels is necessary for continued signal transduction and elevation of cAMP. G-proteins in which the internal clock has become defective (either through mutation or modification by toxins) can become permanently activated, thereby continuously stimulating their signal transduction pathway.

There are a large number of different heterotrimeric G-protein complexes which are generally categorized according to the activity of the $\alpha$-subunit (Table 11.1). The 20 or so different isoforms of $G \alpha$ fall into five broad categories: $G \alpha_{s}, G \alpha_{i \delta \alpha}, G \alpha_{i}$, $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{q} / 11}$, and $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{12 / 13} . \mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ refers to $\alpha$-subunits, which, like the one in Figure 11.17, stimulate adenylyl cyclase (hence the $s$ ). G $\alpha$-subunits that inhibit adenylyl cyclase are called $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{i}}$. The $\beta$ - and $\gamma$-subunits likewise exist as different isoforms, which also transmit messages. $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{q}}$, subunits activate phospholipase $\mathrm{C}_{\beta}$, which generates

$0_{0}^{0}$ACh has two types of receptors: nicotinic ion-channel receptors (the receptors inhibited by antibodies in myasthenia gravis) and muscarinic receptors (which exist as a variety of subtypes). The $\mathrm{M} \Omega$ muscarinic receptors activate a $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{i} \delta \mathrm{s}}$ heterotrimeric G-protein in which release of the $\beta \gamma$-subunit controls $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and pacemaker activity in the heart. Epinephrine has several types and subtypes of heptahelical receptors: $\beta$-Adrenergic receptors work through a $G \alpha_{s}$ and stimulate adenylyl cyclase, $\alpha_{2}$-adrenergic receptors in other cells work through a $G \alpha_{i}$ protein and inhibit adenylyl cyclase, and $\alpha_{1}$-adrenergic receptors work through $G \alpha_{q}$ subunits and activate phospholipase $C_{\beta}$. This variety in receptor types allows a messenger to have different actions in different cells.

FIGURE II. 17 Serpentine receptors and heterotrimeric G-proteins. (I) The intracellular domains of the receptor form a binding site for a G-protein that contains guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound to the $\alpha$-subunit. (2) Hormone binding to the receptor promotes the exchange of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for GDP. As a result, the complex disassembles, releasing the G-protein $\alpha$-subunit from the $\beta-\gamma$ complex. (3) The $G_{s} \alpha$-subunit binds to a target enzyme (in the example shown, the target is adenylyl cyclase), thereby changing its activity (for the "s" G-proteins, the activity is stimulated). The $\beta-\gamma$ complex may simultaneously target another protein and change its activity. (4) Over time, bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, causing dissociation of the $\alpha$-subunit from the target protein, thereby reducing the activity of the target protein. (5) The GDP $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-subunit reassociates with the $\boldsymbol{\beta} \boldsymbol{\gamma}$-subunit and the hormone receptor. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; cAMP, $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-cyclic adenosine monophosphate.
second messengers based on phosphatidylinositol. $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{1}$ subunits activate cGMP phosphodiesterase. $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{1213}$ subunits activate a GEF, which activates the small GTPbinding protein Rho, which is involved in cytoskeletal alterations.

# 2. Adenylyl Cyclase and cAMP Phosphodiesterase 

cAMP is referred to as a second messenger because changes in its concentration reflect changes in the concentration of the hormone (the first messenger). When a hormone binds and adenylyl cyclase is activated, it synthesizes cAMP from ATP.

TABLE II.I Subunits of Heterotrimeric G-Proteins

| G $\alpha$-SUBUNIT | ACTION | SOME PHYSIOLOGIC USES |

| $\alpha_{s} ; \mathrm{G} \alpha(s)^{*}$ | Stimulates adenylyl cyclase | Glucagon and epinephrine to regulate metabolic enzymes, regulatory polypeptide hormones to control steroid hormone and thyroid hormone synthesis, and by some neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine) to control ion channels |

FIGURE II. 18 Formation and cleavage of the cyclic phosphodiester bond in $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). When activated by $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{1}$, adenylyl cyclase converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP + pyrophosphate ( $\mathrm{PP}_{1}$ ). cAMP phosphodiesterase hydrolyzes cAMP to $5^{\prime}$-AMP.
cAMP is hydrolyzed to AMP by cAMP phosphodiesterase, which also resides in the plasma membrane (Fig. 11.18). The concentration of cAMP and other second messengers is kept at very low levels in cells by balancing the activity of these two enzymes (the cyclase and the phosphodiesterase) so that cAMP levels can change rapidly when hormone levels change. Some hormones change the concentration of cAMP by targeting the phosphodiesterase enzyme rather than adenylyl cyclase. For example, insulin lowers cAMP levels by causing phosphodiesterase activation.
cAMP exerts diverse effects in cells. It is an allosteric activator of protein kinase A (PKA) (see Chapter 9, Section III.B.3), which is a serine-threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates a large number of metabolic enzymes, thereby providing a rapid response to hormones like glucagon and epinephrine. It is also the enzyme that phosphorylates the CFTR, activating the channel. PKA substrates also include, among many, phosphorylase kinase (regulation of glycogen degradation) and phospholamban (regulation of cardiac contractility). The catalytic subunits of PKA also enter the nucleus and phosphorylate a gene-specific transcription factor called cyclic-AMP response elementbinding protein (CREB). Thus, cAMP also activates a slower response pathway, gene transcription. In other cell types, cAMP activates ligand-gated channels directly.

Some signaling pathways cross from the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway of MAP kinase activation to CREB activation, and the heterotrimeric G-protein pathways diverge to include a route to the MAP kinase pathway. These types of complex interconnections in signaling pathways are sometimes called hormone cross-talk.

## 3. Phosphatidylinositol Signaling by Heptahelical Receptors

Certain heptahelical receptors bind the q isoform of the $\mathrm{G} \alpha$-subunit $\left(\mathrm{G} \alpha_{q}\right)$, which activates the target enzyme phospholipase $\mathrm{C}_{\beta}$ (see Fig. 11.12). When it is activated, phospholipase $\mathrm{C}_{\beta}$ hydrolyzes the membrane lipid $\mathrm{PI}-4,5$-bisP into two second messengers, DAG and $\mathrm{IP}_{3} . \mathrm{IP}_{3}$ has a binding site in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the endoplasmic reticulum that stimulates the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activates enzymes containing the calcium-calmodulin subunit, including a protein kinase. DAG, which remains in the membrane, activates protein kinase C, which then propagates the response by phosphorylating target proteins.

Dennis V. was hospitalized for dehydration resulting from cholera toxin (see Chapter 10). The cholera toxin A-subunit was absorbed into the intestinal mucosal cells where it was processed and complexed with adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribosylation factor (Arf), a small G-protein that is normally involved in vesicular transport. Cholera A toxin is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-glycohydrolase, which cleaves NAD and transfers the ADP-ribose portion to other proteins. It ADP-ribosylates the $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{1}$ subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins, thereby inhibiting their GTPase activity. As a consequence, they remain actively bound to adenylyl cyclase, resulting in increased production of cAMP. The CFTR channel is activated, resulting in secretion of chloride ion and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion into the intestinal lumen. The ion secretion is followed by loss of water, resulting in vomiting and watery diarrhea.

FIGURE II.I9 Sites of signal termination. Processes that terminate signals are shown in red.

## F. Changes in Response to Signals

Tissues vary in their ability to respond to a message through changes in receptor activity or number. Many receptors contain intracellular phosphorylation sites that alter their ability to transmit signals. Receptor number is also varied through downregulation. After a hormone binds to the receptor, the hormone-receptor complex may be taken into the cell by the process of endocytosis in clathrin-coated pits (see Chapter 10, Section II.C) The receptors may be degraded or recycled back to the cell surface. This internalization of receptors decreases the number available on the surface under conditions of constant high hormone levels when hormones occupy more of the receptors and results in decreased synthesis of new receptors. Hence, it is called downregulation.

## IV. Signal Termination

Some signals, such as those that modify the metabolic responses of cells or that transmit neural impulses, need to turn off rapidly when the hormone is no longer being produced. Other signals, such as those that stimulate proliferation, turn off more slowly. In contrast, signals regulating differentiation may persist throughout our lifetime. Many chronic diseases are caused by failure to terminate a response at the appropriate time.

Signal transduction pathways can be terminated by a variety of means (Fig. 11.19). The first level of termination is the chemical messenger itself. When the stimulus is no longer applied to the secreting cell, the messenger is no longer secreted and existing messenger is catabolized. For example, many polypeptide hormones such as insulin are taken up into the liver and degraded. Termination of the ACh signal by acetylcholinesterase has already been mentioned.

Within each pathway of signal transduction, the signal may be turned off at specific steps. For example, serpentine receptors can be desensitized to the messenger by phosphorylation, internalization, and degradation. G-proteins, both monomeric and heterotrimeric, automatically terminate messages as they hydrolyze GTP via their intrinsic GTPase activity. Although G-proteins do have intrinsic GTPase activity, this activity is relatively weak and can be accelerated through interaction with a class of proteins known as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Termination also can be achieved through degradation of the second messenger (e.g., phosphodiesterase cleavage of cAMP). Each of these terminating processes is also highly regulated.

Another important pathway for reversing the message typically used by receptor kinase pathways is through protein phosphatases, enzymes that reverse the action of kinases by removing phosphate groups from proteins. These are specific tyrosine or serine-threonine phosphatases (enzymes that remove the phosphate group from specific proteins) for all of the sites that are phosphorylated by signal transduction kinases. There are even receptors that are protein phosphatases.

# CLINICAL COMMENTS 

![ma19650024193](ma19650024193.jpg)

Mia S. Mia S. has myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease caused by the production of antibodies affecting the neuromuscular junction. These antibodies are directed against the nicotinic ACh receptor in skeletal muscles in about $85 \%$ of patients. In about $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of patients, the antibodies are directed against other proteins in the neuromuscular junction. The diagnosis is made by history (presence of typical muscular symptoms), physical examination (presence of inability to do specific repetitive muscular activity over time), and the presence of antibodies against ACh receptors. The diagnosis can be further confirmed by neurophysiologic testing, including a diagnostic procedure involving repetitive electrical nerve stimulation and an electromyogram (EMG) showing a partial blockade of ion flux across muscular membranes. The prognosis for this otherwise debilitating disease has improved dramatically with the advent of new therapies. Virtually all myasthenia patients can live full, productive lives with proper treatment. These therapies include anticholinesterase agents; immunosuppressive drugs, such as glucocorticoids, azathioprine, or mycophenolate; thymectomy (removal of the thymus gland, which offers long-term

benefit that may eliminate the need for a continuing medical therapy by reducing immunoreactivity); intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; which decreases the effect the effect of autoantibodies); and plasmapheresis (which reduces anti-ACh receptor antibody levels). IVIG and plasmapheresis are reserved as a means of rapidly helping the patient through a period of serious myasthenia signs and symptoms.

2Ann R. Anorexia nervosa presents as a distorted visual self-image often associated with compulsive exercise. Although Ann has been gaining weight, she is still relatively low on stored fuels needed to sustain the metabolic requirements of exercise. Her prolonged starvation has resulted in release of the steroid hormone cortisol and the polypeptide hormone glucagon, whereas levels of the polypeptide hormone insulin have decreased. Cortisol activates transcription of genes for some of the enzymes of gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of glucose from amino acids and other precursors; see Chapter 3). Glucagon binds to heptahelical receptors in liver and adipose tissue and, working through cAMP and PKA, activates many enzymes involved in fasting fuel metabolism. Insulin, which is released when Ann drinks her high-energy supplement, works through a specialized tyrosine kinase receptor to promote fuel storage. Epinephrine, a catecholamine released when she exercises, promotes fuel mobilization.

3Dennis V. In the emergency department, Dennis received intravenous rehydration therapy (normal saline [ $0.9 \% \mathrm{NaCl}]$ ) and oral hydration therapy containing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and glucose or a digest of rice (which contains glucose and amino acids). Glucose is absorbed from the intestinal lumen via the sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters, which cotransport $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$into the cells together with glucose. Many amino acids are also absorbed by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent cotransport. With the return of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to the cytoplasm, water efflux from the cell into the intestinal lumen decreases. Dennis quickly recovered from his bout of cholera. Cholera is self-limiting, possibly because the bacteria remain in the intestine, where they are washed out of the system by the diffuse watery diarrhea. Antibiotics (tetracycline or doxycycline) can also be used, particularly in severe cases, to decrease the duration of the diarrhea and vibrio excretion. Over the past 3 years, Percy V. has persevered through the death of his wife and the subsequent calamities of his grandson Dennis $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{s}}$ including salicylate poisoning, suspected malathion poisoning, and now cholera. Mr. V. has decided to send his grandson home for the remainder of the summer.

# BIOCHEMICAL COMMENTS 

4Guanylyl Cyclase Receptors. Membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase receptors convert GTP to the second messenger $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-cyclic GMP (cGMP), which is analogous to cAMP. These receptors will directly synthesize cGMP in response to binding the appropriate ligand, unlike heptahelical receptors which require G-protein signaling to adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP. Like cAMP, cGMP is degraded by a membrane-bound phosphodiesterase. Elevated cGMP activates protein kinase G, which then phosphorylates target proteins to propagate the response. To date, seven such receptors have been identified, although ligands for only four of the receptors have been positively confirmed.

A soluble form of guanylyl cyclase exists, located in the cytoplasm, and is a receptor for nitric oxide (NO), a neurotransmitter/neurohormone. NO is a lipophilic gas that is able to diffuse into the cell. This receptor thus is an exception to the rule that intracellular receptors are gene transcription factors. The membrane-bound receptors will bind atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and C-type natriuretic peptide, as well as guanylin.
cGMP-elevating drugs have been used in humans to treat a variety of disorders such as angina pectoris (glycerol trinitrate decomposes to NO, which activates a guanylyl cyclase), heart failure (using nesiritide, which is synthetic $\beta$-natriuretic peptide, a ligand for activation of a guanylyl cyclase receptor), and erectile dysfunction (through drugs that inhibit a cGMP phosphodiesterase [designated PDE5], such as sildenafil).

5A laboratory test to confirm the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis uses the patient's sera as a source of antibodies directed against the ACh receptor. Human cell lines, grown in the laboratory and producing the ACh receptor, are used as a source of soluble receptor (the cells are lysed and a solubilized membrane fraction, which contains the receptor, is obtained). The soluble receptor is incubated with radioactively labeled $\alpha$-bungarotoxin, which binds very specifically and tightly to the ACh receptor. A sample of the patient's sera is incubated with the bungarotoxin-receptor complex, and the extent to which antibodies bind to the receptor complex is determined as a measurement of reduced bungarotoxin binding to the receptor. A positive result indicates the presence of anti-ACh receptor antibodies in the sera.

# KEY CONCEPTS 

- In order to integrate cellular function with the needs of the organism, cells communicate with each other via chemical messengers. Chemical messengers include neurotransmitters (for the nervous system), hormones (for the endocrine system), cytokines (for the immune system), retinoids, eicosanoids, and growth factors.
- Chemical messengers transmit their signals by binding to receptors on target cells. When a messenger binds to a receptor, a signal transduction pathway is activated which generates second messengers within the cell.
- Receptors can be either plasma membrane proteins or intracellular binding proteins.
- Intracellular receptors act primarily as transcription factors, which regulate gene expression in response to a signal being released.
- Plasma membrane receptors fall into different classes, such as ion-channel receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors, tyrosine kinase-associated receptors, serinetheonine kinase receptors, or G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), also known as serpentine receptors.
- Ion-channel receptors respond to a stimulus by allowing ion flux across the membrane.
- Tyrosine kinase and tyrosine kinase-associated receptors respond to a stimulus through activation of a tyrosine kinase activity, which phosphorylates specific target proteins to elicit a cellular response.
- Serine-threonine kinase receptors respond to a stimulus that activates a serine-threonine kinase, which then transmits signals through activation of Smad proteins, which are transcription factors.
- GPCRs respond to a stimulus by activating a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein), which, in its activated GTP-binding state, activates a target protein. G-proteins contain intrinsic GTPase activity, thereby limiting the time for which they are active.
- Signal termination can occur via a variety of mechanisms such as destruction of the chemical messenger; inactivation of second messages, such as loss of cAMP; or removal of covalent bonds added as a result of the primary message (e.g., dephosphorylation).
- Diseases discussed in this chapter are summarized in Table 11.2.

A. Increased MEOS (microsomal ethanol oxidizing system)
B. Decreased MEOS (microsomal ethanol oxidizing system)
C. Normal thyroid hormone
D. Low serum albumin
E. Low plasma membrane receptors

1. The answer is $\mathbf{E}$. This patient has myasthenia gravis caused by the production of an antibody directed against ACh receptors in skeletal muscles (not smooth muscle), resulting in fewer functional receptors but not affecting the number of ACh vesicles, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$gradients, or voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels.
2. The answer is B. Endocrine action is defined as a hormone secreted by a specific cell type with action on specific target cells usually some distance away. Paracrine actions are hormones secreted by a cell and binding to nearby cells. Autocrine action involves a messenger that acts on the cell from which it was secreted. ACh activates only those ACh receptors located across the synaptic cleft from the signaling nerve and not every cell that contains ACh receptors. ACh is a nitrogencontaining small-molecule neurotransmitter or biogenic amine, not a neuropeptide. Cytokines are messengers of the immune system.
3. The answer is $\mathbf{D}$. Parathyroid hormone is a polypeptide hormone and thus must bind to a plasma membrane receptor instead of an intracellular receptor (thus, A and B are incorrect). Hormones that bind to plasma membrane receptors do not need to enter the cell to transmit their signals (thus, C is incorrect). Heptahelical receptors work through heterotrimeric G-proteins that have an $\alpha$-subunit, and tyrosine kinase receptors work through monomeric G-proteins that have no subunits (thus, D is correct and E is incorrect).
4. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. $\mathrm{G} \alpha$, normally activates adenylyl cyclase to generate cAMP in response to parathyroid hormone. Because the patient has end-organ unresponsiveness, he must have a deficiency in the signaling pathway (thus, A is incorrect) and cAMP will be decreased. Decreased GTPase activity will increase binding to adenylyl cyclase and increase responsiveness (thus, B is incorrect). Neither $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ nor $\mathrm{PI}-3,4,5$-trisP is involved in signal transduction by the $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$ subunit.
5. The answer is $\mathbf{A}$. Grb2 binding to the receptor requires phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor. Grb2 normally binds to the receptor through its SH2 domains, which recognize phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor. In the absence of these phosphotyrosine residues, Grb2 would not be able to bind to the receptor. Growth factor binding to the receptor does not require phosphotyrosine residues. It is the binding of the growth factor to the receptor, through a conformational change in the receptor that activates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of the receptor, which then leads to autophosphorylation of the receptor. The lack of intracellular tyrosine residues on the receptor will not alter the events initiated by the
conformational change of the receptor. Dimerization of receptors occurs upon binding growth factor and is not dependent on the activation of the tyrosine kinase activity or on autophosphorylation of the receptor.
6. The answer is B. Glucagon increases blood/serum glucose by stimulating the release of glucose from liver glycogen stores. Liver parenchymal cells express glucagon receptors but muscle cells do not, so muscle cells do not respond to glucagon. Glucagon therefore stimulates liver glycogenolysis but has no effect on muscle cells. Glycogenesis, the synthesis of glycogen, is an effect of insulin but not glucagon.
7. The answer is $\mathbf{C}$. Curare is an inhibitor of nicotinic (skeletal and parasympathetic) ACh receptors causing muscle paralysis, but curare does not affect the heart or the sympathetic nervous system (which express muscarinic ACh receptors). Curare inhibits only ACh receptors, not ACh production or elimination. Atropine blocks the effects of excess ACh and is a completely different medication than curare.
8. The answer is D. PG, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes are eicosanoids and are all derived from arachidonic acid, a 20 -carbon fatty acid derived from linoleic acid (an essential fatty acid). Arachidonic acid cannot be derived from any of the other fatty acids listed as possible answers.
9. The answer is $\mathbf{E}$. Catecholamines are polar molecules that are not hydrophobic and cannot rapidly cross the plasma membrane (they do not bind to an intracellular receptor). They must bind to a plasma membrane receptor, which in this case is a heptahelical receptor linked to a G-protein. Catecholamines do not directly activate tyrosine kinase receptors or ligand-gated receptors, nor do they lead to the activation of Smad (which is a function of TGF- $\beta$ receptors).
10. The answer is D. The patient is manifesting a low functioning level of testosterone. Testosterone is a steroid hormone that is lipophilic (hydrophobic) and must be transported in blood bound to albumin. Alcoholics with cirrhosis produce less albumin than normal and are usually protein-malnourished, which further decreases serum albumin. The low serum albumin thus decreases functional or transported levels of testosterone. Normal-sized testicles imply normal production of testosterone. MEOS helps to metabolize alcohol but has nothing to do with testosterone. Being a hydrophobic molecule, testosterone diffuses through the plasma membrane and does not use a plasma membrane receptor; it binds to an intracellular transcription factor receptor. Expressing normal thyroid hormone would not produce any of these symptoms.

# Gene Expression and the Synthesis of Proteins 

In the middle of the 20th century, DNA was identified as the genetic material and its structure was determined. Using this knowledge, researchers then discovered the mechanisms by which genetic information is inherited and expressed. During the last quarter of the 20th century, our understanding of this critical area of science, known as molecular biology, grew at an increasingly rapid pace. We now have techniques to probe the human genome that will completely revolutionize the way medicine is practiced in the 21 st century.

The genome of a cell consists of all its genetic information, encoded in DNA. In eukaryotes, DNA is located mainly in nuclei, but small amounts are also found in mitochondria. Nuclear genes are packaged in chromosomes that contain DNA and protein in tightly coiled structures (Chapter 12).

The molecular mechanism of inheritance involves a process known as replication, in which the strands of parental DNA serve as templates for the synthesis of DNA copies (Fig. III.1) (Chapter 13). After DNA replication, cells divide, and these DNA copies are passed to daughter cells. Alterations in genetic material occur by recombination (the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes) and by mutation (the result of chemical changes that alter DNA). DNA repair mechanisms correct much of this damage, but, nevertheless, many gene alterations are passed to daughter cells.

The expression of genes within cells requires two processes: transcription and translation (see Fig. III.1) (Chapters 14 and 15). DNA is transcribed to produce RNA. Three major types of RNA are transcribed from DNA and subsequently participate in the process of translation (the synthesis of proteins). Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the genetic information from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where translation occurs on ribosomes-structures that contain proteins complexed with ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) carries individual amino acids to the ribosomes, where they are joined in peptide linkage to form proteins. During translation, the sequence of nucleic acid bases in mRNA is read in sets of three (each set of three bases constitutes a codon). The sequence of codons in the mRNA dictates the sequence of amino acids in the protein. Proteins function in cell structure, signaling, and catalysis and, therefore, determine the appearance and behavior of cells and the organism as a whole. The regulation of gene expression (Chapter 16) determines which proteins are synthesized and the amount synthesized at any time, thus allowing cells to undergo development and differentiation and to respond to changing environmental conditions.

Research in molecular biology has produced a host of techniques, known collectively as recombinant DNA technology, biotechnology, or genetic engineering, that can be used for the diagnosis and treatment of disease (Chapter 17). These techniques can detect a number of genetic diseases that previously could only be diagnosed after symptoms appeared. Diagnosis of these diseases can now be made with considerable accuracy even before birth, and carriers of these diseases also can be identified.

Many drugs used in medicine to treat bacterial infections are targeted to interfere with the bacteria's ability to synthesize RNA and proteins. Thus, medical students need to know the basics of bacterial DNA replication, RNA synthesis, and protein synthesis to understand the mechanism of action of these drugs.
