# Preface to the 5th Edition 

It has been 5 years since the fourth edition was completed. The fifth edition has some significant organizational changes, as suggested by extensive surveys of faculty and students who used the fourth edition in their classes and studies. The major pedagogic features of the text remain. They have been enhanced by the following changes for the fifth edition:

1. Every patient history has been reviewed and revised to reflect current standards of care (as of 2016). The patient names have also been changed to a first name and last initial. A key indicating the "old" names and "new" names is available in the online supplement associated with the text.
2. The Biochemical Comments associated with each chapter have been updated, where appropriate, to allow students to experience where current research efforts are headed.
3. The presentation of metabolism has been altered such that glycolysis is now the first topic discussed, followed by the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and then oxidative phosphorylation. The correlation between fourth edition chapters and fifth edition chapters are as follows:
a. Chapters 1 through 18, no change
b. Section IV is now entitled "Carbohydrate Metabolism, Fuel Oxidation, and the Generation of Adenosine Triphosphate" and consists of Chapters 19 through 28.
i. Chapter 19 of the fifth edition (Basic Concepts in the Regulation of Fuel Metabolism by Insulin, Glucagon, and Other Hormones) is based on Chapter 26 of the fourth edition.
ii. Chapter 20 of the fifth edition (Cellular Bioenergetics: Adenosine Triphosphate and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ) is based on Chapter 19 of the fourth edition.
iii. Chapter 21 of the fifth edition (Digestion, Absorption, and Transport of Carbohydrates) is based on Chapter 27 of the fourth edition.
iv. Chapter 22 of the fifth edition (Generation of Adenosine Triphosphate from Glucose, Fructose, and Galactose: Glycolysis) is based on Chapter 22 of the fourth edition and also contains parts of Chapter 29 of the fourth edition (Pathways of Sugar Metabolism: Pentose Phosphate Pathway, Fructose, and Galactose Metabolism).
v. Chapter 23 of the fifth edition (Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle) is based on Chapter 20 of the fourth edition.
vi. Chapter 24 of the fifth edition (Oxidative Phosphorylation and Mitochondrial Function) is based on Chapter 21 of the fourth edition.
vii. Chapter 25 of the fifth edition (Oxygen Toxicity and Free-Radical Injury) is based on Chapter 24 of the fourth edition.
viii. Chapter 26 of the fifth edition (Formation and Degradation of Glycogen) is based on Chapter 28 of the fourth edition.
ix. Chapter 27 of the fifth edition (Pentose Phosphate Pathway and the Synthesis of Glycosides, Lactose, Glycoproteins, and Glycolipids) is based on Chapter 30 of the fourth edition, along with a section (The Pentose Phosphate Pathway) of Chapter 29 of the fourth edition. This led to the deletion of old Chapter 29 from the Table of Contents of the fifth edition.

x. Chapter 28 of the fifth edition (Gluconeogenesis and Maintenance of Blood Glucose Levels) is based on Chapter 31 of the fourth edition.
c. Section V (Lipid Metabolism) now consists of the following chapters:
i. Chapter 29 of the fifth edition (Digestion and Transport of Dietary Lipids) is based on Chapter 32 of the fourth edition.
ii. Chapter 30 of the fifth edition (Oxidation of Fatty Acids and Ketone Bodies) is based on Chapter 23 of the fourth edition.
iii. Chapter 31 of the fifth edition (Synthesis of Fatty Acids, Triacylglycerols, and the Major Membrane Lipids) is based on Chapter 33 of the fourth edition and also contains basic information concerning the eicosanoids from Chapter 35 of the fourth edition. Material from Chapter 35 of the fourth edition that was not incorporated into Chapter 31 of the fifth edition is available as an online supplement. A separate chapter on eicosanoid metabolism is not present in the fifth edition.
iv. Chapter 32 of the fifth edition (Cholesterol Absorption, Synthesis, Metabolism, and Fate) is based on Chapter 34 of the fourth edition.
v. Chapter 33 of the fifth edition (Metabolism of Ethanol) is based on Chapter 25 of the fourth edition.
vi. Chapter 34 of the fifth edition (Integration of Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism) is based on Chapter 36 of the fourth edition.
d. Section VI (Nitrogen Metabolism) has the same chapter order as in the fourth edition, but because two chapters have been deleted previously from the text, the chapter numbers in the fifth edition are two less than in the fourth edition. Section VI in the fifth edition comprises Chapters 35 through 40, whereas in the fourth edition, it is Chapters 37 through 42.
e. Section VII (Tissue Metabolism) has the same chapter order as in the fourth edition, but the chapter numbers in the fifth edition are two less than in the fourth edition. Section VII in the fifth edition comprises Chapters 41 through 47, whereas in the fourth edition, it is Chapters 43 through 49.
4. The number of printed review questions at the end of each chapter has been increased to 10 , up from 5 questions per chapter in the fourth edition ( 470 total questions). The online question bank associated with the text has also been increased to 560 questions, as compared to 468 questions associated with the fourth edition. Where possible, questions are presented in National Board of Medical Examiners format.
As stated in previous editions, in revising a text geared primarily toward medical students, the authors always struggle with new advances in biochemistry and whether such advances should be included in the text. We have taken the approach of only including advances that will enable the student to better relate biochemistry to medicine and future diagnostic tools. Although providing incomplete, but exciting, advances to graduate students is best for their education, medical students benefit more from a more directed approach-one that emphasizes how biochemistry is useful for the practice of medicine. This is a major goal of this text.

Any errors are the responsibility of the authors, and we would appreciate being notified when such errors are found.

The accompanying website for this edition of Marks' Basic Medical Biochemistry: A Clinical Approach contains the aforementioned additional multiple-choice questions for review, a table listing patient names for the fifth edition and how they correspond to those of the fourth edition, summaries of all patients described in the text (patient cases), all chapter references and additional reading (with links to the article in PubMed, where applicable), a listing of diseases discussed in the book (with links to appropriate websites for more information), and a summary of all of the methods described throughout the text.

# How to Use This Book 

Icons identify the various components of the book: the patients who are presented at the start of each chapter; the clinical notes, methods notes, questions, and answers that appear in the margins; and the Key Concepts, Clinical Comments, and Biochemical Comments that are found at the end of each chapter.

Each chapter starts with an abstract that summarizes the information so that students can recognize the key words and concepts they are expected to learn. The next component of each chapter is The Waiting Room, describing patients with complaints and detailing the events that led them to seek medical help.
indicates a female patient
indicates a male patient
indicates a patient who is an infant or young child
As each chapter unfolds, icons appear in the margin, identifying information related to the material presented in the text:
indicates a clinical note, usually related to the patients in The Waiting Room for that chapter. These notes explain signs or symptoms of a patient or give some other clinical information relevant to the text.
indicates a methods note, which elaborates on how biochemistry is required to perform, and interpret, common laboratory tests.

Questions and answers also appear in the margin and should help to keep students thinking as they read the text:
indicates a question
indicates the answer to the question. The answer to a question is always located on the next page. If two questions appear on one page, the answers are given in order on the next page.

Each chapter ends with these three sections: Key Concepts, Clinical Comments, and Biochemical Comments:

The Key Concepts summarize the important take-home messages from the chapter.
The Clinical Comments give additional clinical information, of ten describing the treatment plan and the outcome.

The Biochemical Comments add biochemical information that is not covered in the text or explore some facet of biochemistry in more detail or from another angle.

Finally, Review Questions are presented. These questions are written in a United States Medical Licensing Examination-like format, and many of them have a clinical slant. Answers to the review questions, along with detailed explanations, are provided at the end of every chapter.




# Acknowledgments 

The authors would like to thank Professor Kent Littleton of Bastyr University, for his careful reading of the fourth edition and pointing out mistakes and errors that required correcting for the fifth edition.

# Fuel Metabolism 

In order to survive, humans must meet two basic metabolic requirements: We must be able to synthesize everything our cells need that is not supplied by our diet, and we must be able to protect our internal environment from toxins and changing conditions in our external environment. To meet these requirements, we metabolize our dietary components through four basic types of pathways: fuel oxidative pathways, fuel storage and mobilization pathways, biosynthetic pathways, and detoxification or waste disposal pathways. Cooperation between tissues and responses to changes in our external environment are communicated through transport pathways and intercellular signaling pathways (Fig. I.1).

The foods in our diet are the fuels that supply us with energy in the form of calories. This energy is used for carrying out such diverse functions as moving, thinking, and reproducing. Thus, several of our metabolic pathways are fuel oxidative pathways that convert fuels into energy that can be used for biosynthetic and mechanical work. But what is the source of energy when we are not eating, such as between meals, and while we sleep? How does a person on a hunger strike that you read about in the morning headlines survive so long? We have other metabolic pathways that are fuel storage pathways. The fuels that we store can be mobilized during periods when we are not eating or when we need increased energy for exercise.

Our diet also must contain the compounds we cannot synthesize, as well as all the basic building blocks for compounds we do synthesize in our biosynthetic pathways. For example, we have dietary requirements for some amino acids, but we can synthesize other amino acids from our fuels and a dietary nitrogen precursor. The compounds required in our diet for biosynthetic pathways include certain amino acids, vitamins, and essential fatty acids.

Detoxification pathways and waste disposal pathways are metabolic pathways devoted to removing toxins that can be present in our diets or in the air we breathe, introduced into our bodies as drugs, or generated internally from the metabolism of dietary components. Dietary components that have no value to the body, and must be disposed of, are called xenobiotics.

In general, biosynthetic pathways (including fuel storage) are referred to as anabolic pathways; that is, pathways that synthesize larger molecules from smaller components. The synthesis of proteins from amino acids is an example of an anabolic pathway. Catabolic pathways are those pathways that break down larger molecules into smaller components. Fuel oxidative pathways are examples of catabolic pathways.

In humans, the need for different cells to carry out different functions has resulted in cell and tissue specialization in metabolism. For example, our adipose tissue is a specialized site for the storage of fat and contains the metabolic pathways that allow it to carry out this function. However, adipose tissue is lacking many of the pathways that synthesize required compounds from dietary precursors. To enable our cells to cooperate in meeting our metabolic needs during changing conditions of diet, sleep, activity, and health, we need transport pathways into the blood and between tissues and intercellular signaling pathways. One means of communication is for hormones to carry signals to tissues about our dietary state. For example, a message that we have just had a meal, carried by the hormone insulin, signals adipose tissue to store fat.
