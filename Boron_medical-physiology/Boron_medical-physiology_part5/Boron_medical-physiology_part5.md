## ELEMENTS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

## The circulation is an evolutionary consequence of body size

Isolated single cells and small organisms do not have a circulatory system. They can meet their metabolic needs by the simple processes of diffusion and convection of solutes from the external to the internal milieu (Fig. 17-1A). The requirement for a circulatory system is an evolutionary consequence of the increasing size and complexity of multicellular organisms. Simple diffusion (see p. 108) is not adequate to supply nutrients to centrally located cells or to eliminate waste products; in large organisms, the distances separating the central cells from the external milieu are too long. A simple closedend tube (see Fig. 17-1B), penetrating from the extracellular compartment and feeding a central cell deep in the core of the organism, would not be sufficient. The concentration of nutrients inside the tube would become very low at its closed end because of both the uptake of these nutrients by the cell and the long path for resupply leading to the cell. Conversely, the concentration of waste products inside the tube would become very high at the closed end. Such a tube represents a long unstirred layer; as a result, the concentration gradients for both nutrients and wastes across the membrane of the central cell are very small.

In complex organisms, a circulatory system provides a steep concentration gradient from the blood to the central cells for nutrients and in the opposite direction for waste products. Maintenance of such steep intracellular-toextracellular concentration gradients requires a fast convection system that rapidly circulates fluid between surfaces that equilibrate with the external milieu (e.g., the lung, gut, and kidney epithelia) and individual central cells deep inside the organism (see Fig. 17-1C). In mammals and birds, the exchange of gases with the external milieu is so important that they have evolved a two-pump, dual circulatory system (see Fig. 17-1D) that delivers the full output of the "heart" to the lungs (see pp. 683-684).

The primary role of the circulatory system is the distribution of dissolved gases and other molecules for nutrition, growth, and repair. Secondary roles have also evolved: (1) fast chemical signaling to cells by means of circulating hormones or neurotransmitters, (2) dissipation of heat by delivery of heat from the core to the surface of the body, and
(3) mediation of inflammatory and host defense responses against invading microorganisms.

The circulatory system of humans integrates three basic functional parts, or organs: a pump (the heart) that circulates a liquid (the blood) through a set of containers (the vessels). This integrated system is able to adapt to the changing circumstances of normal life. Demand on the circulation fluctuates widely between sleep and wakefulness, between rest and exercise, with acceleration/deceleration, during changes in body position or intrathoracic pressure, during digestion, and under emotional or thermal stress. To meet these variable demands, the entire system requires sophisticated and integrated regulation.

## The heart is a dual pump that drives the blood in two serial circuits: the systemic and the pulmonary circulations

A remarkable pump, weighing $\sim 300 \mathrm{~g}$, drives the human circulation. The heart really consists of two pumps, the left heart, or main pump, and the right heart, or boost pump (see Fig. 17-1D). These operate in series and require a delicate equalization of their outputs. The output of each pump is $\sim 5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, but this can easily increase 5 -fold during exercise.

During a 75 -year lifetime, the two ventricles combined pump 400 million L of blood (enough to fill a lake 1 km long, 40 m wide, and 10 m deep). The circulating fluid itself is an organ, kept in a liquid state by mechanisms that actively prevent cell-cell adhesion and coagulation. With each heartbeat, the ventricles impart the energy necessary to circulate the blood by generating the pressure head that drives the flow of blood through the vascular system. On the basis of its anatomy, we can divide this system of tubes into two main circuits: the systemic and the pulmonary circulations (see Fig. 17-1D). We could also divide the vascular system into a high-pressure part (extending from the contracting left ventricle to the systemic capillaries) and a low-pressure part (extending from the systemic capillaries, through the right heart, across the pulmonary circulation and left atrium, and into the left ventricle in its relaxed state). The vessels also respond to the changing metabolic demands of the tissues they supply by directing blood flow to (or away from) tissues as demands change. The circulatory system is also self-repairing/self-expanding. Endothelial cells lining vessels

Figure 17-1 Role of the circulatory system in promoting diffusion. In C, nutrients and wastes exchange across two barriers: a surface for equilibration between the external milieu and blood, and another surface between blood and the central cell. Inset, Blood is the conduit that connects the external milieu (e.g., lumina of lung, gut, and kidney) to the internal milieu (i.e., extracellular fluid bathing central cells). In $\mathbf{D}$, the system is far more efficient, using one circuit for exchange of gases with the external milieu and another circuit for exchange of nutrients and nongaseous wastes.

mend the surfaces of existing blood vessels and generate new vessels (angiogenesis).

Some of the most important life-threatening human diseases are caused by failure of the heart as a pump (e.g., congestive heart failure), failure of the blood as an effective liquid organ (e.g., thrombosis and embolism), or failure of the vasculature either as a competent container (e.g., hemorrhage) or as an efficient distribution system (e.g., atherosclerosis). Moreover, failure of the normal interactions among these three organs can by itself elicit or aggravate many human pathological processes.

## HEMODYNAMICS

## Blood flow is driven by a constant pressure head across variable resistances

To keep concepts simple, first think of the left heart as a constant pressure generator that maintains a steady mean arterial pressure at its exit (i.e., the aorta). In other words, assume that blood flow throughout the circulation is steady or nonpulsatile (below in the chapter, see the discussion of the consequences of normal cyclic variations in flow and pressure that occur as a result of the heartbeat). As a further simplification, assume that the entire systemic circulation is a single, straight tube.

To understand the steady flow of blood, driven by a constant pressure head, we can apply classical hydrodynamic laws. The most important law is analogous to Ohm's law of electricity:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\Delta V=I \cdot R & \text { for electricity } \\
\Delta P=F \cdot R & \text { for liquids }
\end{array}
$$

That is, the pressure difference $(\Delta P)$ between an upstream point (pressure $P_{1}$ ) and a downstream site (pressure $P_{2}$ ) is equal to the product of the flow $(F)$ and the resistance $(R)$ between those two points (Fig. 17-2). Ohm's law of hydrodynamics holds at any instant in time, regardless of how simple or how complicated the circuit. This equation also does not require any assumptions about whether the vessels are rigid or compliant, as long as $R$ is constant.
![bo0585266204](bo0585266204.jpg)

Figure 17-2 Flow through a straight tube. The flow $(F)$ between a highpressure point $\left(P_{1}\right)$ and a low-pressure point $\left(P_{2}\right)$ is proportional to the pressure difference $(\Delta P) . A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are cross-sectional areas at these two points. A cylindrical bolus of fluid-between the disks at $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$-moves down the tube with a linear velocity $v$.

In reality, the pressure difference $(\Delta P)$ between the beginning and end points of the human systemic circulationthat is, between the high-pressure side (aorta) and the low-pressure side (vena cava)-turns out to be fairly constant over time. Thus, the heart behaves more like a generator of a constant pressure head than like a generator of constant flow, at least within physiological limits. Indeed, flow ( $F$ ), the output of the left heart, is quite variable in time and depends greatly on the physiological circumstances (e.g., whether one is active or at rest). Like flow, resistance ( $R$ ) varies with time; in addition, it varies with location within the body. The overall resistance of the circulation reflects the contributions of a complex network of vessels in both the systemic and pulmonary circuits.

Blood can take many different pathways from the left heart to the right heart (Fig. 17-3): (1) a single capillary bed (e.g., coronary capillaries), (2) two capillary beds in series (e.g., glomerular and peritubular capillaries in the kidney), or (3) two capillary beds in parallel that subsequently merge and feed into a single capillary bed in series (e.g., the parallel splenic and mesenteric circulations, which merge on entering the portal hepatic circulation). In contrast, blood flow from the right heart to the left heart can take only a single pathway, across a single capillary bed in the pulmonary circulation. Finally, some blood also courses from the left heart directly back to the left heart across shunt pathways, the most important of which is the bronchial circulation.

The overall resistance $\left(R_{\text {total }}\right)$ across a circulatory bed results from parallel and serial arrangements of branches and is governed by laws similar to those for the electrical resistance of DC circuits. For multiple resistance elements $\left(R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}, \ldots\right)$ arranged in series,

$$
R_{\text {total }}=R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}+\ldots
$$

For multiple elements arranged in parallel,

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text {total }}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}+\ldots
$$

## Blood pressure is always measured as a pressure difference between two points

Physicists measure pressure in the units of grams per square centimeter or dynes per square centimeter. However, physiologists most often gauge blood pressure by the height it can drive a column of liquid. This pressure is

$$
P=\rho g h
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the liquid in the column, $g$ is the gravitational constant, and $h$ is the height of the column. Therefore, if we neglect variations in $g$ and know $\rho$ for the fluid in the column (usually water or mercury), we can take the height of the liquid column as a measure of blood pressure. Physiologists usually express this pressure in millimeters of mercury or centimeters of water. Clinicians use the classical blood pressure gauge (sphygmomanometer) to report arterial blood pressure in millimeters of mercury.

![bo0685266204](bo0685266204.jpg)

Pressure is never expressed in absolute terms but as a pressure difference $\Delta P$ relative to some "reference" pressure. We can make this concept intuitively clear by considering pressure as a force $\mathcal{F}$ applied to a surface area $A$.

$$
P \approx \mathcal{F} / A
$$

If we apply a force to one side of a free-swinging door, we cannot predict the direction the door will move unless we know what force a colleague may be applying on the opposite side. In other words, we can define a movement or distortion of a mechanical system only by the difference between two forces. In electricity, we compare the difference between two

![bo0785266204](bo0785266204.jpg)

Figure 17-4 Three kinds of pressure differences, and their axes, in a blood vessel.
voltages. In hemodynamics, we compare the difference between two pressures. When it is not explicitly stated, the reference pressure in human physiology is the atmospheric or barometric pressure (PB). Because PB on earth is never zero, a pressure reading obtained at some site within the circulation, and referred to PB, actually does not express the absolute pressure in that blood vessel but rather the difference between the pressure inside the vessel and PB .

Because a pressure difference is always between two points-and these two points are separated by some distance $(\Delta x)$ and have a spatial orientation to one another-we can define a pressure gradient $(\Delta P / \Delta x)$ with a spatial orientation. Considering orientation, we can define three different kinds of pressure differences in the circulation:

1. Driving pressure. In Figure 17-4, the $\Delta P$ between points $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ inside the vessel-along the axis of the vessel-is the axial pressure difference. Because this $\Delta P$ causes blood to flow from $x_{1}$ to $x_{2}$, it is also known as the driving pressure. In the circulation, the driving pressure is the $\Delta P$ between the arterial and venous ends of the systemic (or pulmonary) circulation, and it governs blood flow. Indeed, this is the only $\Delta P$ we need to consider to understand flow in horizontal rigid tubes (see Fig. 17-2).
2. Transmural pressure. The $\Delta P$ in Figure 17-4 between point $r_{1}$ (inside the vessel) and $r_{2}$ (just outside the vessel)along the radial axis-is an example of a radial pressure difference. Although there is normally no pressure difference through the blood along the radial axis, the pressure drops steeply across the vessel wall itself. The $\Delta P$ between $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ is the transmural pressure; that is, the difference between the intravascular pressure and the tissue pressure. Because blood vessels are distensible, transmural pressure governs vessel diameter, which is in turn the major determinant of resistance.
3. Hydrostatic pressure. Because of the density of blood and gravitational forces, a third pressure difference arises
if the vessel does not lie in a horizontal plane, as was the case in Figure 17-2. The $\Delta P$ in Figure 17-4 between point $h_{1}$ (bottom of a liquid column) and $h_{2}$ (top of the column)-along the height axis-is the hydrostatic pressure difference $P_{1}-P_{2}$. This $\Delta P$ is similar to the $P$ in Equation 17-4 (here, $\rho$ is the density of blood), and it exists even in the absence of any blood flow. If we express increasing altitude in positive units of $h$, then hydrostatic $\Delta P=-\rho g\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)$.

## Total blood flow, or cardiac output, is the product (heart rate) $\times$ (stroke volume)

The flow of blood delivered by the heart, or the total mean flow in the circulation, is the cardiac output (CO). The output during a single heartbeat, from either the left or the right ventricle, is the stroke volume (SV). For a given heart rate (HR),

$$
\mathrm{CO}=F=\mathrm{HR} \cdot \mathrm{SV}
$$

The cardiac output is usually expressed in liters per minute; at rest, it is $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ in a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ human. Cardiac output depends on body size and is best normalized to body surface area. The cardiac index (units: liters per minute per square meter) is the cardiac output per square meter of body surface area. The normal adult cardiac index at rest is about $3.0 \mathrm{~L} /\left(\min \mathrm{m}^{2}\right)$.

The principle of continuity of flow is the principle of conservation of mass applied to flowing fluids. It requires that the volume entering the systemic or pulmonary circuit per unit time be equal to the volume leaving the circuit per unit time, assuming that no fluid has been added or subtracted in either circuit. Therefore, the flow of the right and left hearts (i.e., right and left cardiac outputs) must be equal in the steady state. N17-1

# N17-1 Cardiac Output of the Left and Right Hearts 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

As shown on the right side of Figure 17-3 the bronchial circulation-which carries $\sim 2 \%$ of the cardiac output or $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ at rest-originates from the aorta (i.e., the output of the left heart). After passing through bronchial capillaries, about half of this bronchial blood empties into the azygos vein (see p. 693) and returns to the right atrium, and about half enters pulmonary venules (i.e., the input to the left heart). In other words, $\sim 1 \%$ or $\sim 50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of the blood leaving the left ventricle reenters the left atrium, thus bypassing the right heart (i.e., a right-to-left shunt). Thus, although we generally say that the outputs of the left and right hearts are identical in the steady state, in fact the cardiac output of the left heart exceeds the cardiac output of the right heart by about $1 \%$ or $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ at rest.

## Flow in an idealized vessel increases with the fourth power of radius (Poiseuille equation)

Flow $(F)$ is the displacement of volume $(\Delta V)$ per unit time $(\Delta t)$ :

$$
F=\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t}
$$

In Figure 17-2, we could be watching a bolus (the blue cylinder)-with an area $A$ and a length $L$-move along the tube with a mean velocity $\bar{v}$. During a time interval $\Delta t$, the cylinder advances by $\Delta x$, so that the volume passing some checkpoint (e.g., at $P_{2}$ ) is $(A \cdot \Delta x)$. Thus,

$$
F=\frac{\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t}}{\frac{A \cdot \Delta x}{\Delta t}}=A \cdot \frac{\frac{v}{\Delta x}}{\Delta t}=A \cdot \bar{v}
$$

This equation holds at any point along the circulation, regardless of how complicated the circulation is or how irregular the cross-sectional area.

In a physically well defined system, it is also possible to predict the flow from the geometry of the vessel and the properties of the fluid. In 1840 and 1841, Jean Poiseuille observed the flow of liquids in tubes of small diameter and derived the law associated with his name. In a straight, rigid, cylindrical tube,

$$
F=\Delta P \cdot \frac{\frac{\pi r^{4}}{8 \eta l}}{\frac{1}{V R}}
$$

This is the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, (○) N17-2 where $F$ is the flow, $\Delta P$ is the driving pressure, $r$ is the inner radius of the tube, $l$ is its length, and $\eta$ is the viscosity. The Poiseuille equation requires that both driving pressure and the resulting flow be constant.

Three implications of Poiseuille's law are as follows:

1. Flow is directly proportional to the axial pressure difference, $\Delta P$. The proportionality constant- $\left(\pi r^{4}\right) /$ $(8 \eta l)$-is the reciprocal of resistance $(R)$, as is presented below.
2. Flow is directly proportional to the fourth power of vessel radius.
3. Flow is inversely proportional to both the length of the vessel and the viscosity of the fluid.

Unlike Ohm's law of hydrodynamics $(F=\Delta P / R)$, which applies to all vessels, no matter how complicated, the Poiseuille equation applies only to rigid, cylindrical tubes. Moreover, discussion below in this chapter reveals that the fluid flowing through the tube must satisfy certain conditions.

## Viscous resistance to flow is proportional to the viscosity of blood but does not depend on properties of the blood vessel walls

The simplest approach for expressing vascular resistance is to rearrange Ohm's law of hydrodynamics (see Equation 17-1):

$$
R=\frac{\Delta P}{F}
$$

This approach is independent of geometry and is even applicable to very complex circuits, such as the entire peripheral circulation. Moreover, we can conveniently express resistance in units used by physicians for pressure (millimeters of mercury) and flow (milliliters per second). Thus, the units of total peripheral resistance are millimeters of mercury/(milliliters per second)—also known as peripheral resistance units (PRUs).

Alternatively, if the flow through the tube fulfills Poiseuille's requirements, we can express "viscous" resistance in terms of the dimensions of the vessel and the viscous properties of the circulating fluid. (○) N17-3 Combining Equation 17-9 and Equation 17-10, we get

$$
R=\frac{8}{\pi} \cdot \frac{\eta l}{r^{4}}
$$

Thus, viscous resistance is proportional to the viscosity of the fluid and the length of the tube but inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the blood vessel. Note that this equation makes no statement regarding the properties of the vessel wall per se. The resistance to flow results from the geometry of the fluid-as described by $l$ and $r$-and the internal friction of the fluid, the viscosity $(\eta)$. Viscosity is a property of the content (i.e., the fluid), (○) N17-3 unrelated to any property of the container (i.e., the vessel).

## The viscosity of blood is a measure of the internal slipperiness between layers of fluid

Viscosity expresses the degree of lack of slipperiness between two layers of fluid. Isaac Newton described the interaction as illustrated in Figure 17-5A. Imagine that two parallel planes of fluid, each with an area $A$, are moving past one another. The velocity of the first is $v$, and the velocity of the slightly faster moving second plane is $\bar{v}+\Delta v$. The difference in velocity between the moving planes is $\Delta v$ and the separation between the two planes is $\Delta x$. Thus, the velocity gradient in a direction perpendicular to the plane of shear, $\Delta v / \Delta x$ (units: [centimeters/second]/centimeter $=$ second $^{-1}$ ), is the shear rate. The additional force that we must apply to the second sheet to make it move faster than the first is the shear stress. The greater the area of the sheets, the greater the force needed to overcome the friction between them. Thus, shear stress is expressed as force per unit area $(\mathcal{F} / A)$. The shear stress required to produce a particular shear rate Newton defined as the viscosity:

$$
\eta=\frac{\text { shear stress }}{\text { shear rate }}=\frac{\mathcal{F} / A}{\Delta v / \Delta x}
$$

Viscosity measures the resistance to sliding when layers of fluid are shearing against each other. The unit of viscosity is the poise ( P ). Whole blood has a viscosity of $\sim 3$ centipoise $(\mathrm{cP})$.

If we apply Newton's definition of viscosity to a cylindrical blood vessel, the shearing laminae of the blood are not planar

# N17-2 Hagen-Poiseuille Law 

Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille (1797-1869) was a French physician and experimentalist whose studies in hemodynamics in 1838, later published in 1840, are now known as the HagenPoiseuille law. (For more information, see http://www.cartage .org. lb/en/themes/Biographies/MainBiographies/P/Poiseuille/ 1.html.)

What is widely known as Poiseuille's equation was in fact derived by Gotthilf Heinrich Ludwig Hagen (1797-1884), a German physicist, who in 1839 independently confirmed the findings of Poiseuille's experiments. (For more information, see http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthilf_Heinrich_Ludwig _Hagen.)

The Hagen-Poiseuille law describes the laminar flow of a viscous liquid through a cylindrical tube (see Fig. 17-5B). The viscous resistance reflects the frictional interaction between adjacent layers of fluid, each of which moves at a different velocity. This resistance does not reflect the friction between the outermost layer of fluid-which is stationary-and the wall of the tube.

In the Hagen-Poiseuille law (Equation 17-9, shown here as Equation NE 17-1),

$$
F=\Delta P \frac{\pi r^{4}}{\frac{8 \eta l}{10}}
$$

$F$ is the flow (in milliliters $\cdot$ second ${ }^{-1}$ ), $\Delta P$ is the pressure difference (in dynes $\cdot$ centimeter ${ }^{-2}$ ), $r$ is the inner radius of the tube (in centimeters), $l$ is the length of the tube (in centimeters), and $\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity (in dynes $\cdot$ second centimeter ${ }^{-2}=$ poise). The unit of dynamic viscosity, the poise, is named after Poiseuille.

The discoveries of Hagen and Poiseuille are often described as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, Poiseuille's law, or the Poiseuille equation. These terms are synonymous in meaning and are used interchangeably.

but concentric cylinders (see Fig. 17-5B). If we apply a pressure head to the blood in the vessel, each lamina will move parallel to the long axis of the tube. Because of cohesive forces between the inner surface of the vessel wall and the blood, we can assume that an infinitesimally thin layer of blood close to the wall of the tube (see Fig. 17-5B, layer \#0) cannot move. However, the next concentric cylindrical layer, layer \#1, moves in relation to the stationary outer layer \#0, but slower than the next inner concentric cylinder, layer \#2, and so on. Thus, the velocities increase from the wall to the center of the cylinder. The resulting velocity profile is a parabola with a maximum velocity, $v_{\max }$, at the central axis. The lower the viscosity, the sharper the point of the bulletshaped velocity profile.

## HOW BLOOD FLOWS

As discussed, the Poiseuille equation (see Equation 17-9) is based on solid empirical and theoretical grounds. However, the equation requires the following assumptions:

1. The fluid must be incompressible.
2. The tube must be straight, rigid, cylindrical, and unbranched, and have a constant radius.
3. The velocity of the thin fluid layer at the wall must be zero (i.e., no "slippage"). This assumption holds for aqueous solutions, but not for some "plastic" fluids.
4. The flow must be laminar. That is, the fluid must move in concentric undisturbed laminae, without the gross exchange of fluid from one concentric shell to another.
5. The flow must be steady (i.e., not pulsatile).
6. The viscosity of the fluid must be constant. First, it must be constant throughout the cross section of the cylinder. Second, it must be constant in the "newtonian" sense; that is, the viscosity must be independent of the magnitude of the shear stress (i.e., force applied) and the shear rate (i.e., velocity gradient produced). In other words, the shear stress at each point is linearly proportional to its shear rate at that point.

To what extent does the circulatory system fulfill the conditions of the Poiseuille equation? The first condition (i.e., incompressible fluid) is well satisfied by blood. If we consider only flow in a vessel segment that is of fairly fixed size (e.g., thoracic aorta), the second assumption (i.e., simple geometry) is also reasonably well satisfied. The third requirement (i.e., no slippage) is true for blood in blood vessels. Indeed, if one forms a reservoir out of a piece of vessel (e.g., aorta) and fills it with blood, a meniscus forms with the concave surface facing upward, indicating adherence of blood to the vessel wall.

The fourth and fifth assumptions, which are more complex, are the subject of the next two sections. With regard to the sixth assumption, Chapter 18 addresses the anomalous viscosity of blood.

## Blood flow is laminar

From Ohm's law of hydrodynamics $(\Delta P=F \cdot R)$, flow should increase linearly with driving pressure if resistance is constant. In cylindrical vessels, flow does indeed increase linearly with $\Delta P$ up to a certain point (Fig. 17-6A). However, at high flow rates-beyond a critical velocity-flow rises less steeply and is no longer proportional to $\Delta P$ but to roughly the square root of $\Delta P$, because $R$ apparently increases. Here, blood flow is no longer laminar but turbulent. Because turbulence causes substantial kinetic energy losses, it is energetically wasteful.

The critical parameter that determines when flow becomes turbulent is a dimensionless quantity called the Reynolds number (Re), named after Osborne Reynolds: (T) N17-4

$$
R e=\frac{2 r \bar{v} \rho}{\eta}
$$

Blood flow is laminar when $R e$ is below $\sim 2000$ and is mostly turbulent when $R e$ exceeds $\sim 3000$. The terms in the numerator reflect disruptive forces produced by the inertial momentum in the fluid. Thus, turbulent blood flow occurs

# N17-3 Viscous Resistance 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

The Hagen-Poiseuille equation describes the laminar flow of a viscous liquid through a cylindrical tube (see Fig. 17-5B). The viscous resistance reflects the frictional interaction between adjacent layers of fluid, each of which moves at a different velocity. This resistance does not reflect the friction between the outermost layer of fluid-which is stationary-and the wall of the tube. (In other words, Hagen and Poiseuille assumed that the outer edge of fluid does not move. It sticks to the wall!) Rather, viscous resistance depends on the fluid's viscosity and shape.

In Equation 17-11 (shown here as Equation NE 17-2), we define the viscous resistance as

$$
R=\frac{8}{\pi} \cdot \frac{\eta}{r^{4}}
$$

Here, the resistance term $R$ has the fundamental dimensions (mass) - (length) ${ }^{-4} \cdot$ (time) ${ }^{-4}$. If the length $(l)$ and the radius $(r)$ are
given in centimeters, and if the dynamic viscosity $(\eta)$ is given in poise (or dynes $\cdot$ second $\cdot$ centimeter ${ }^{-2}$ ), then resistance is in the units dynes $\cdot$ centimeter ${ }^{-8} \cdot$ second $^{-1}$.

If one instead expresses the dynamic viscosity $(\eta)$ not in poise but in the units grams centimeter ${ }^{-1}$ second $^{-1}$ (remembering that, because force $=$ mass $\times$ acceleration, the dyne has the units gram - centimeter second ${ }^{-3}$ ), then the units of resistance become gram centimeter ${ }^{-4}$ second $^{-1}$.

Note that if the vessel is not straight, rigid, cylindrical (which implies a smooth internal surface), and unbranched, other nonviscous parameters will sum with the viscous resistance to make up the total resistance of the system $(R)$ that appears in Ohm's law of hydrodynamics (see Equation 17-1). Such nonviscous resistances can arise from contributions from rough vessel walls and obstructions in the path of fluid flow-qualities of the container.

## N17-4 Reynolds Number

## Contributed by Chevalier Emile Boulpaep

In Equation 17-13 (shown here as Equation NE 17-3),

$$
R e=\frac{2 r \cdot \eta}{\eta}
$$

(NE 17-3)
the mean linear velocity $(\bar{\varphi})$ is expressed in centimeters $\cdot$ second $^{-1}$, the radius $(r)$ in centimeters, the density $(\rho)$ in grams . centimeter ${ }^{-2}$, and the viscosity $(\eta)$ in poise. When the equation is written as above-with the term $2 r$ or diameter in the numerator-blood flow is laminar when $R e$ is below -2000 .

You may also encounter a similar equation with $r$, rather than $2 r$, in the numerator:

$$
R e=\frac{r \cdot \eta}{\eta}
$$

(NE 17-4)
When the equation is written in terms of radius rather than diameter, blood flow is laminar when $R e$ is below -1000 . In the first and second printings of the first edition of this text, the value 1160 was used assuming the "radius" convention in Equation NE 17-4.

Regardless of which version of the equation we use, the terms in the numerator reflect disruptive forces produced by the inertial momentum in the liquid, because of both the velocity term and the product $r \cdot \rho$, which is related to the mass of the moving fluid. In other words, a high inertial momentum
predisposes to turbulence. The term in the denominator reflects the cohesive forces in the liquid; that is, the viscosity that tends to keep the layers of fluid together.

One way of looking at the above equations is that at low $R e$, flow is laminar and a tiny volume of fluid in one layer in Figure 17-5B tends to stay in that layer. When $R e$ is sufficiently high, flow is turbulent, and that tiny volume may leave its original layer and become part of a neighboring layer-that is, it participates in eddy formation.

Another way of looking at the above equations is that a tiny volume of fluid has a certain probability of deviating course and leaving its original layer. This tendency to stray from its original layer is enhanced when velocity $(\bar{\varphi})$ or density $(\rho)$ is high (which raises inertial momentum) but is counteracted by the viscosity (which tends to hold it in the layer). The tendency to stray is also counteracted by a small radius, which reduces the number of layers and brings the average layer closer to a constraining wallchanneling the fluid.

when $r$ is large (e.g., aorta) or when $\bar{v}$ is large (e.g., high cardiac output). Turbulent flow can also occur when a local decrease in vessel diameter (e.g., arterial stenosis) causes a local increase in $\bar{v}$. The term in the denominator of Equation 17-13, viscosity, reflects the cohesive forces that tend to keep the layers well organized. Therefore, a low viscosity (e.g., in anemia-a low red blood cell count) predisposes to turbulence. When turbulence arises, the parabolic profile of the linear velocity across the radius of a cylinder becomes blunted (see Fig. 17-6B).

The distinction between laminar and turbulent flow is clinically very significant. Laminar flow is silent, whereas vortex formation during turbulence sets up murmurs. These Korotkoff sounds are useful in assessing arterial blood flow in the traditional auscultatory method for determination of blood pressure. These murmurs are also important for diagnosis of vessel stenosis, vessel shunts, and cardiac valvular lesions (Box 17-1). Intense forms of turbulence may be detected not only as loud acoustic murmurs but also as mechanical vibrations or thrills that can be felt by touch.

## Pressure and flow oscillate with each heartbeat between maximum systolic and minimum diastolic values

Thus far we have considered blood flow to be steady and driven by a constant pressure generator. That is, we have been working with a mean blood flow and a mean driving pressure (the difference between the mean arterial and venous pressures). However, we are all aware that the heart is a pump of the "two-stroke" variety, with a filling and an emptying phase. Because both the left and right hearts perform their work in a cyclic fashion, flow is pulsatile in both the systemic and pulmonary circulations.

## BOX 17-1 Heart Murmurs and Arterial Bruits

Stage 1: Turbulence as blood flows across diseased heart valves creates murmurs that can be readily detected by auscultation with a stethoscope. The factors causing turbulence are the ones that increase the Reynolds number: increases in vessel diameter or blood velocity and decreases in viscosity. Before the advent of sophisticated technology, such as cardiac ultrasonography, clinicians made a fine art of detecting these murmurs in an attempt to diagnose cardiac valvular disease. In general, it was appreciated that normal blood flow across normal heart valves is silent, although murmurs can occur with increased blood flow (e.g., exercise) and are not infrequently heard in young, thin individuals with dynamic circulations. The grading of heart murmurs helps standardize the cardiac examination from observer to observer. Thus, a grade 1 heart murmur is barely audible, grade 2 is one that is slightly more easily heard, and grades 3 and 4 are progressively louder. A grade 5 murmur is the loudest murmur that still requires a stethoscope to be heard. A grade 6 murmur is so loud that it can be heard with the stethoscope off the chest and is often accompanied by a thrill. The location, duration, pitch, and quality of a murmur aid in identifying the underlying valvular disorder.
Stage 2: Blood flowing through diseased arteries can also create a murmur or a thrill. By far the most common cause is atherosclerosis, which narrows the vessel lumen and thus increases velocity. In patients with advanced disease, these murmurs can be heard in virtually every major artery, most easily in the carotid and femoral arteries. Arterial murmurs are usually referred to as bruits.

The mean blood pressure in the large systemic arteries is $\sim 95 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. This is a single, time-averaged value. In reality, the blood pressure cycles between a maximal systolic arterial pressure $(\sim 120 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$ that corresponds to the contraction of the ventricle and a minimal diastolic arterial pressure $(\sim 80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$ that corresponds to the relaxation of the ventricle (Fig. 17-7). The difference between the systolic pressure and the diastolic pressure is the pulse pressure. Note that the mean arterial pressure is not the arithmetic mean of systolic and diastolic values, which would be

$(120+80) / 2=100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in our example; rather, it is the area beneath the curve, which describes the pressure in a single cardiac cycle (see Fig. 17-7, blue area) divided by the duration of the cycle. A reasonable value for the mean arterial pressure is 95 mm Hg .

Like arterial pressure, flow through arteries also oscillates with each heartbeat. Because both pressure and flow are pulsatile, and because the pressure and flow waves are not perfectly matched in time, we cannot describe the relationship between these two parameters by a simple Ohm's lawlike relationship $(\Delta P=F \cdot R)$, which is analogous to a simple DC circuit in electricity. Rather, if we were to model pressure and flow in the circulatory system, we would have to use a more complicated approach, analogous to that used to understand AC electrical circuits. (5) N17-5

## ORIGINS OF PRESSURE IN THE CIRCULATION

Four factors help generate pressure in the circulation: gravity, compliance of the vessels, viscous resistance, and inertia.

## Gravity causes a hydrostatic pressure difference when there is a difference in height

Because gravity produces a hydrostatic pressure difference between two points whenever there is a difference in height ( $\Delta h$; see Equation 17-4), one must always express pressures relative to some reference $h$ level. In cardiovascular physiology, this reference-zero height-is the level of the heart.

Whether the body is recumbent (i.e., horizontal) or upright (i.e., erect) has a tremendous effect on the intravascular pressure. In the horizontal position (Fig. 17-8A), where

# N17-5 Mechanical Impedance of Blood Flow 

## Contributed by Ridder Emile Boulpaep

We began this chapter by drawing an analogy between the flow of blood and electrical current, as described by a Ohm's law of hydrodynamics: $\Delta P=F \cdot R$. We now know that there are other factors that influence pressure. In addition to the flow resistance $R$ (electrical analogy = ohmic resistor), we must also consider the compliance $C$ (electrical analogy = capacitance) as well as the inertiance $L$ (electrical analogy = inductance). A similar problem is faced in electricity when dealing with alternating (as opposed to direct) currents. In Ohm's law for alternating currents, $E=I \cdot Z$, where $Z$ is a complex quantity called the impedance. $Z$ depends on the electrical resistance $R$, the electrical capacitance $C$, and the electrical inductance $L$. Similarly, for blood flow, we can write $\Delta P=F \cdot Z$, where $Z$ is also a complex quantity, called mechanical impedance, that includes the following:

1. Compliant impedance that opposes volume change (compliance of the vessel).
2. Viscous (or resistive) impedance that opposes flow (shearing forces in the liquid). This term is the $R$ of Ohm's law of hydrodynamics: $\Delta P=F \cdot R$ (Equation 17-1).
3. Inertial impedance that opposes a change of flow (kinetic energy of fluid and vessels).
Considering all these sources of pressure, we can state that the total pressure difference at any point in time, instead of being given by Ohm's law, is

$$
P_{\text {total }}=P_{\text {gravity }}+P_{\text {compliance }}+P_{\text {viscous resistance }}+P_{\text {inertance }} \quad(\text { NE 17-5) }
$$

The $P_{\text {gravity }}$ term in the above equation is discussed on pages 418-419 in the section titled "Gravity causes a hydrostatic pressure difference when there is a difference in height."

![bo1385266204](bo1385266204.jpg)

Figure 17-9 Compliance: changes in pressure with vessels of different compliances.
we assume that the entire body is at the level of the heart, we do not need to add a hydrostatic pressure component to the various intravascular pressures. Thus, the mean pressure in the aorta is 95 mm Hg , and-because it takes a driving pressure of $\sim 5 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ to pump blood into the end of the large arteries-the mean pressure at the end of the large arteries in the foot and head is 90 mm Hg . Similarly, the mean pressure in the large veins draining the foot and head is 5 mm Hg , and-because it takes a driving pressure of $\sim 3 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ to pump blood to the right atrium-the mean pressure in the right atrium is 2 mm Hg .

When a $180-\mathrm{cm}$ tall person is standing (see Fig. 17-8B), we must add a $130-\mathrm{cm}$ column of blood (the $\Delta h$ between the heart and large vessels in the foot) to the pressure prevailing in the large arteries and veins of the foot. Because a water column of 130 cm is equivalent to 95 mm Hg , the mean pressure for a large artery in the foot will be $90+95=$ 185 mm Hg , and the mean pressure for a large vein in the foot will be $5+95=100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. On the other hand, we must subtract a $50-\mathrm{cm}$ column of blood from the pressure prevailing in the head. Because a water column of 50 cm is equivalent to 37 mm Hg , the mean pressure for a large artery in the head will be $90-37=53 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, and the mean pressure for a large vein in the head will be $5-37=-32 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Of course, this "negative" value really means that the pressure in a large vein in the head is 32 mm Hg lower than the reference pressure at the level of the heart.

In this example, we have simplified things somewhat by ignoring the valves that interrupt the blood column. In reality, the veins of the limbs have a series of one-way valves that allow blood to flow only toward the heart. These valves act like a series of relay stations, so that the contraction of skeletal muscle around the veins pushes blood from one valve to another (see p. 516). Thus, veins in the foot do not "see" the full hydrostatic column of 95 mm Hg when the leg muscles pump blood away from the foot veins.

Although the absolute arterial and venous pressures are much higher in the foot than in the head, the $\Delta P$ that drives blood flow is the same in the vascular beds of the foot and head. Thus, in the horizontal position, the $\Delta P$ across the vascular beds in the foot or head is $90-5=85 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. In the upright position, the $\Delta P$ for the foot is $185-100=$ 85 mm Hg , and for the head, $53-(-32)=85 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Thus,
gravity does not affect the driving pressure that governs flow. On the other hand, in "dependent" areas of the body (i.e., vessels "below" the heart in a gravitational sense), the hydrostatic pressure does tend to increase the transmural pressure (intravascular versus extravascular "tissue" pressure) and thus the diameter of distensible vessels. Because various anatomical barriers separate different tissue compartments, it is assumed that gravity does not appreciably affect this tissue pressure.

## Low compliance of a vessel causes the transmural pressure to increase when the vessel blood volume is increased

Until now, we have considered blood vessels to be rigid tubes, which, by definition, have fixed volumes. If we were to try to inject a volume of fluid into a truly rigid tube with closed ends, we could in principle increase the pressure to infinity without increasing the volume of the tube (Fig. 17-9A). At the other extreme, if the wall of the tube were to offer no resistance to deformation (i.e., infinite compliance), we could inject an infinite volume of fluid without increasing the pressure at all (see Fig. 17-9B). Blood vessels lie between these two extremes; they are distensible but have a finite compliance (see p. 454). Thus, if we were to inject a volume of blood into the vessel, the volume of the vessel would increase by the same amount $(\Delta V)$, and the intravascular pressure would also increase (see Fig. 17-9C). The $\Delta P$ accompanying a given $\Delta V$ is greater if the compliance of the vessel is lower. The relationship between $\Delta P$ and $\Delta V$ is a static property of the vessel wall and holds whether or not there is flow in the vessel. Thus, if we were to infuse blood into a patient's blood vessels, the intravascular pressure would rise throughout the circulation, even if the heart were stopped.

## The viscous resistance of blood causes an axial pressure difference when there is flow

As we saw in Ohm's law of hydrodynamics (see Equation 17-1), during steady flow down the axis of a tube (see Fig. 17-2), the driving pressure $(\Delta P)$ is proportional to both flow and resistance. Viewed differently, if we want to achieve a constant flow, then the greater the resistance, the greater the

$\Delta P$ that we must apply along the axis of flow. Of the four sources of pressure in the circulatory system, this $\Delta P$ due to viscous resistance is the only one that appears in Poiseuille's law (see Equation 17-9).

## The inertia of the blood and vessels causes pressure to decrease when the velocity of blood flow increases

For the most part, we have been assuming that the flow of blood as well as its mean linear velocity is steady. However, as we have already noted, blood flow in the circulation is not steady; the heart imparts its energy in a pulsatile manner, with each heartbeat. Therefore, $\vec{v}$ in the aorta increases and reaches a maximum during systole and falls off during diastole. As we shall shortly see, these changes in velocity lead to compensatory changes in intravascular pressure.

The tradeoff between velocity and pressure reflects the conversion between two forms of energy. Although we generally state that fluids flow from a higher to a lower pressure, it is more accurate to say that fluids flow from a higher to a lower total energy. This energy is made up of both the pressure or potential energy and the kinetic energy $\left(K E=\int_{0}^{L} m v^{2}\right)$. The impact of the interconversion between these two forms of energy is manifested by the familiar Bernoulli effect. As fluid flows along a horizontal tube with a narrow central region, which has half the diameter of the two ends, the pressure in the central region is actually lower than the pressure at the distal end of the tube (Fig. 17-10). How can the fluid paradoxically flow against the pressure gradient from the lower-pressure central to the higherpressure distal region of the tube? We saw above that flow is the product of cross-sectional area and velocity (see Equation 17-8). Because the flow is the same in both portions of the tube, but the cross-sectional area in the center is lower by a factor of 4 , the velocity in the central region must be 4 -fold higher (see table at bottom of Fig. 17-10). Although the blood in the central region has a lower potential energy (pressure $=60$ ) than the blood at the distal end of the tube (pressure $=80$ ), it has a 16 -fold higher kinetic energy. Thus, the total energy of the fluid in the center exceeds that in the distal region, so that the fluid does indeed flow down the energy gradient.

This example illustrates an interconversion between potential energy (pressure) and kinetic energy (velocity) in space because velocity changes along the length of a tube even though flow is constant. We will see on pages 511-513 that during ejection of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta, the flow and velocity of blood change with time at any point within the aorta. These changes in velocity contribute to the changes in pressure inside the aorta.

The Bernoulli effect has important practical implications for measurement of blood pressure with an open-tipped catheter. The pressure recorded with the open tip facing the flow is higher than the actual pressure by an amount corresponding to the kinetic energy of the oncoming fluid (Fig. 17-11). Conversely, the pressure recorded with the open tip facing away from the flow is lower than the actual pressure by an equal amount. The measured pressure is correct only when the opening is on the side of the catheter, perpendicular to the flow of blood.
![bo1485266204](bo1485266204.jpg)

Figure 17-10 Bernoulli effect. For the top tube, which has a uniform radius, velocity $(v)$ is uniform and transmural pressure $(P)$ falls linearly with the length, which we artificially compress to fit in the available space. The bottom tube has the same upstream and downstream pressures but a constriction in the middle that is short enough so as not to increase overall resistance or overall fall in $P$. The constriction has crosssectional area that is only one fourth that of the two ends. Thus, velocity in the narrow portion must be 4 -fold higher than it is at the ends. Although the total energy of fluid falls linearly along the tube, pressure is lower in the middle than at the distal end.

## HOW TO MEASURE BLOOD PRESSURE, BLOOD FLOW, AND CARDIAC VOLUMES

## Blood pressure can be measured directly by puncturing the vessel

One can record blood pressure anywhere along the circulation-inside a heart chamber, inside an artery, within a capillary, or within a vein. Clinicians are generally concerned with the intravascular pressure at a particular site (e.g., in a systemic artery) in reference to the barometric pressure outside the body and not with pressure differences between two sites.

The most direct approach for measurement of pressure is to introduce a needle or a catheter into a vessel and position

![bo1585266204](bo1585266204.jpg)

Figure 17-11 Effects of kinetic energy on the measurement of blood pressure with catheters.

Figure 17-12 Direct method for determining blood pressure.
the open tip at a particular site. In the first measurements of blood pressure ever performed, Stephen Hales in 1733 found that a column of blood from a presumably agitated horse rose to fill a brass pipe to a height of 3 m . It was Poiseuille who measured blood pressure for the first time by connecting a mercury-filled U-tube to arteries through a tube containing a solution of saturated $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$. In modern times, a saline-filled transmission or conduit system connects the blood vessel to a pressure transducer. In the most primitive form of this system, a catheter was connected to a closed chamber, one wall of which was a deformable diaphragm. Nowadays, the pressure transducer is a stiff diaphragm bonded to a strain gauge that converts mechanical strain into a change in electrical resistance, capacitance, or inductance (Fig. 17-12). The opposite face of the diaphragm is open to the atmosphere, so that the blood pressure is referenced to barometric pressure. The overall performance of the system depends largely on the properties of the catheter and the strain gauge. The presence of air bubbles and a long or
narrow catheter can decrease the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the fluid in the catheter. Together, these properties determine overall performance characteristics such as sensitivity, linearity, damping of the pressure wave, and frequency response. To avoid problems with fluid transmission in the catheter, some high-fidelity devices employ a solidstate pressure transducer at the catheter tip.

In catheterizations of the right heart, the clinician begins by sliding a fluid-filled catheter into an antecubital vein and, while continuously recording pressure, advances the catheter tip into the superior vena cava, through the right atrium and the right ventricle, and past the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery. Eventually, the tip reaches and snugly fits into a smaller branch of the pulmonary artery, recording the pulmonary wedge pressure (see p. 519). The wedge pressure effectively measures the pressure downstream from the catheter tip, that is, the left atrial pressure.

In catheterizations of the left heart, the clinician slides a catheter into the brachial artery or femoral artery, obtaining the systemic arterial blood pressure. From there, the catheter is advanced into the aorta, the left ventricle, and finally the left atrium.

Clinical measurements of venous pressure are typically made by inserting a catheter into the jugular vein. Because of the low pressures, these venous measurements require very sensitive pressure transducers or water manometers.

In the research laboratory, one can measure capillary pressure in exposed capillary beds by inserting a micropipette that is pressurized just enough (with a known pressure) to keep fluid from entering or leaving the pipette.

## Blood pressure can be measured indirectly by use of a sphygmomanometer

In clinical practice, one may measure arterial pressure indirectly by use of a manual sphygmomanometer (Fig. 17-13). An inextensible cuff containing an inflatable bag is wrapped around the arm (or occasionally, the thigh). Inflation of the bag by means of a rubber squeeze bulb to a pressure level above the expected systolic pressure occludes the underlying brachial artery and halts blood flow downstream. The pressure in the cuff, measured by means of a mercury or aneroid manometer, is then allowed to slowly decline (see Fig. 17-13, diagonal red line). The physician can use either of two methods to monitor the blood flow downstream of the slowly deflating cuff. In the palpatory method, the physician detects the pulse as an indicator of flow by feeling the radial artery at the wrist. In the auscultatory method, the physician detects flow by using a stethoscope to detect the changing character of Korotkoff sounds over the brachial artery in the antecubital space.

The palpatory method permits determination of the systolic pressure; that is, the pressure in the cuff below which it is just possible to detect a radial pulse. Because of limited sensitivity of the finger, palpation probably slightly underestimates systolic pressure. The auscultatory method permits the detection of both systolic and diastolic pressure. The sounds heard during the slow deflation of the cuff can be divided into five phases (see Fig. 17-13). During phase I, there is a sharp tapping sound, indicating that a spurt of blood is escaping under the cuff when cuff pressure is just

![bo1785266204](bo1785266204.jpg)

Figure 17-13 Sphygmomanometry. The clinician inflates the cuff to a pressure that is higher than the anticipated systolic pressure and then slowly releases the pressure in the cuff.
below systolic pressure. The pressure at which these taps are first heard closely represents systolic pressure. In phase II, the sound becomes a blowing or swishing murmur. During phase III, the sound becomes a louder thumping. In phase IV, as the cuff pressure falls toward the diastolic level, the sound becomes muffled and softer. Finally, in phase V, the sound disappears. Although some debate persists about whether the point of muffling or the point of silence is the correct diastolic pressure, most favor the point of muffling as being more consistent. Actual diastolic pressure may be somewhat overestimated by the point of muffling but underestimated by the point of silence.

Practical problems arise when a sphygmomanometer is used with children or obese adults or when it is used to obtain a measurement on a thigh. Ideally, one would like to use a pressure cuff wide enough to ensure that the pressure inside the cuff is the same as that in the tissue surrounding the artery. In 1967, the American Heart Association recommended that the pneumatic bag within the cuff be $20 \%$ wider than the diameter of the limb, extend at least halfway around the limb, and be centered over the artery. More recent studies indicate that accuracy and reliability improve when the pneumatic bag completely encircles the limb, as long as the width of the pneumatic bag is at least the limb diameter.

## Blood flow can be measured directly by electromagnetic and ultrasound flowmeters

The spectrum of blood flow measurements in the circulation ranges from determinations of total blood flow (cardiac
output) to assessment of flow within an organ or a particular tissue within an organ. Moreover, one can average blood flow measurements over time or record continuously. Examples of continuous recording include recordings of the phasic blood flow that occurs during the cardiac cycle or any other periodic event (e.g., breathing). We discuss both invasive and noninvasive approaches.

Invasive Methods Invasive approaches require direct access to the vessel under study and are thus useful only in research laboratories. The earliest measurements of blood flow involved collecting venous outflow into a graduated cylinder and timing the collection with a stopwatch. This direct approach was limited to short time intervals to minimize blood loss and the resulting changes in hemodynamics. Blood loss could be avoided by ingenious but now antiquated devices that returned the blood to the circulation, in either a manual or a semiautomated fashion.

The most frequently used modern instruments for measurement of blood flow in the research laboratory are electromagnetic flowmeters based on the electromagnetic induction principle (Fig. 17-14). The vessel is placed in a magnetic field. According to Faraday's induction law, moving any conductor (including an electrolyte solution, such as blood) at right angles to lines of the magnetic field generates a voltage difference between two points along an axis perpendicular to both the axis of the movement and the axis of the magnetic field. The induced voltage is

$$
E=B \bar{v} D
$$

![bo1885266204](bo1885266204.jpg)

Figure 17-14 Electromagnetic flowmeter.
where $B$ is the density of magnetic flux, $\bar{v}$ is the average linear velocity, and $D$ is the diameter of the moving column of blood.

Ultrasound flowmeters employ a pair of probes placed at two sites along a vessel. One probe emits an ultrasound signal, and the other records it. The linear velocity of blood in the vessel either induces a change in the frequency of the ultrasound signal (Doppler effect) or alters the transit time of the ultrasound signal. Both the electromagnetic and ultrasound methods measure linear velocity, not flow per se.

Noninvasive Methods The electromagnetic or ultrasonic flowmeters require the surgical isolation of a vessel. However, ultrasonic methods are also widely used transcutaneously on surface vessels in humans. This method is based on recording of the backscattering of the ultrasound signal from moving red blood cells. To the extent that the red blood cells move, the reflected sound has a frequency different from that of the emitted sound (Doppler effect). This frequency difference may thus be calibrated to measure flow. Plethysmographic methods are noninvasive approaches for measurement of changes in the volume of a limb or even of a whole person (see p. 617). Inflation of a pressure cuff enough to occlude veins but not arteries allows blood to continue to flow into (but not out of) a limb or an organ, so that the volume increases with time. The record of this rise in volume, as recorded by the plethysmograph, is a measure of blood flow.

With the exception of transcutaneous ultrasonography, the direct methods discussed for measurement of blood flow are largely confined to research laboratories. The next two
sections include discussions of two indirect methods that clinicians use to measure mean blood flow.

## Cardiac output can be measured indirectly by the Fick method, which is based on the conservation of mass

The Fick method requires that a substance be removed from or added to the blood during its flow through an organ. The rate at which X passes a checkpoint in the circulation $(\dot{Q})$ is simply the product of the rate at which blood volume passes the checkpoint $(F)$ and the concentration of X in that blood:

$$
\text { Units: } \frac{\dot{\mathrm{Q}}=F \cdot[X]}{\mathrm{s}}=\frac{\text { litres }}{\mathrm{s}} \cdot \frac{\text { moles }}{\mathrm{liter}}
$$

The Fick principle is a restatement of the law of conservation of mass. The amount of X per unit time that passes a downstream checkpoint $\left(\dot{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{B}}\right)$ minus the amount of X that passes an upstream checkpoint $\left(\dot{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{A}}\right)$ must equal the amount of X added or subtracted per unit time $\left(\dot{\mathrm{Q}}_{\text {added/subtracted }}\right)$ between these two checkpoints (Fig. 17-15A):

$$
\dot{Q}_{\text {added/subtracted }}=\dot{Q}_{B}-\dot{Q}_{A}
$$

$\dot{Q}_{\text {added/subtracted }}$ is positive for the addition of X . If the volume flow is identical at both checkpoints, combining Equation 17-15 and Equation 17-16 yields the Fick equation:

$$
\dot{Q}_{\text {added/subtracted }}=F\left([\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{B}}-[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{A}}\right)
$$

We can calculate flow from the amount of X added or subtracted and the concentrations of X at the two checkpoints:

$$
F=\frac{\dot{Q}_{\text {added/subtracted }}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{B}}-[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{A}}}=\frac{\text { moles } / \mathrm{min}}{\text { moles/liter }}=\frac{\text { liters }}{\min }
$$

It is easiest to apply the Fick principle to the blood flow through the lungs, which is the cardiac output (see Fig. 17-15B). The quantity added to the bloodstream is the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake $\left(\dot{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ by the lungs, which we obtain by measuring the subject's $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption. This value is typically 250 mL of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gas per minute. The upstream checkpoint is the pulmonary artery (point $A$ ), where the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content $\left(\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{A}}\right)$ is typically 15 mL of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ per deciliter of blood. The sample for this checkpoint must reflect the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of mixed venous blood, obtained by means of a catheter within the right atrium or the right ventricle or pulmonary artery. The downstream checkpoint is a pulmonary vein (point $B$ ), where the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content $\left(\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{B}}\right)$ is typically $20 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ per deciliter of blood. We can obtain the sample for this checkpoint from any systemic artery. Using these particular values, we calculate a cardiac output of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
F & =\frac{\dot{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{B}}-\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{A}}}=\frac{250 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{min}}{(20-15) \mathrm{mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL} \text { blood }} \\
& =5 \mathrm{~L} \text { blood } / \mathrm{min}
\end{aligned}
$$

Figure 17-15 Fick method for determining cardiac output.

## Cardiac output can be measured indirectly by dilution methods

The dye dilution method, inaugurated by G.N. Stewart in 1897 and extended by W.F. Hamilton in 1932, is a variation of the Fick procedure. One injects a known quantity of a substance ( X ) into a systemic vein (e.g., antecubital vein) at site A while simultaneously monitoring the concentration downstream at site B (Fig. 17-16A). It is important that the substance not leave the vascular circuit and that it be easy to follow the concentration, by either successive sampling or continuous monitoring. If we inject a single known amount $\left(Q_{X}\right)$ of the indicator, an observer downstream at checkpoint B will see a rising concentration of X , which, after reaching its peak, falls off exponentially. Concentration measurements provide the interval $(\Delta t)$ between the time the dye makes its first appearance at site B and the time the dye finally disappears there.

If site B is in the pulmonary artery, then the entire amount $Q_{X}$ that we injected into the peripheral vein must pass site B during the interval $\Delta t$, carried by the entire cardiac output. We can deduce the average concentration $[\overline{\mathrm{X}}]$ during the interval $\Delta t$ from the concentration-versus-time curve in Figure 17-16B. From the conservation of mass, we know that

$$
Q_{\mathrm{X}}=V \cdot[\overline{\mathrm{X}}]
$$

Units: moles $=$ liters $\cdot \frac{\text { moles }}{\text { liter }}$
Because the volume of blood $(V)$ that flowed through the pulmonary artery during the interval $\Delta t$ is, by definition, the product of cardiac output and the time interval $(\mathrm{CO} \cdot \Delta t)$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_{\mathrm{X}} & =\mathrm{CO} \cdot \Delta t \cdot[\overline{\mathrm{X}}] \\
\text { Units: moles } & =\frac{\text { liters }}{\mathrm{s}} \cdot \mathrm{~s} \cdot \frac{\text { moles }}{\text { liter }}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the product $\Delta t \cdot[\overline{\mathrm{X}}]$ is the area under the concentration-versus-time curve in Figure 17-16B. Solving for CO, we have

$$
\mathrm{CO}=\frac{Q_{\mathrm{X}}}{[\overline{\mathrm{X}}] \cdot \Delta t}=\frac{Q_{\mathrm{X}}}{\text { Area }}
$$

In practice, cardiologists monitor $[\mathrm{X}]$ in the brachial artery. Obviously, only a fraction of the cardiac output passes through a brachial artery; however, this fraction is the same as the fraction of $Q_{\mathrm{X}}$ that passes through the brachial artery. If we were to re-derive Equation 17-22 for the brachial artery,

A PRINCIPLE OF DYE DILUTION
![bo2085266204](bo2085266204.jpg)

Figure 17-16 Dye dilution method for determining blood flow. In $\mathbf{B}, \mathbf{C}$, and $\mathbf{D}$, the areas underneath the three red curves-as well as the three green areas-are all the same.
we would end up multiplying both the CO and $Q_{S}$ terms by this same fraction. Therefore, even though only a small portion of both cardiac output and injected dye passes through any single systemic artery, we can still use Equation 17-22 to compute cardiac output with data from that artery.

Compared with the $[\mathrm{X}]$ profile in the pulmonary artery, the $[\mathrm{X}]$ profile in the brachial artery is not as tall and is more spread out, so that $[\overline{\mathrm{X}}]$ is smaller and $\Delta t$ is longer. However, the product $[\overline{\mathrm{X}}] \cdot \Delta t$ in the brachial artery-or any other systemic artery-is the same as that in the pulmonary artery. Indocyanine green dye (Cardiogreen) is the most common dye employed. Because the liver removes this dye from the
circulation, it is possible to repeat the injections, after a sufficient wait, without progressive accumulation of dye in the plasma. Imagine that after we inject 5 mg of the dye, $[\overline{\mathrm{X}}]$ under the curve is $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ and $\Delta t$ is 0.5 min . Thus,

$$
\mathrm{CO}=\frac{5 \mathrm{mg}}{2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L} \times 0.5 \mathrm{~min}}=5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}
$$

A practical problem is that after we inject a marker into a systemic vein, blood moves more quickly through some pulmonary beds than others, so that the marker arrives at checkpoint B at different times. This process, known as dispersion, is the main cause of the flattening of the $[\mathrm{X}]$ profile

in the brachial artery (see Fig. 17-16C) versus the pulmonary artery (see Fig. 17-16B). If we injected the dye into the left atrium and monitored it in the systemic veins, the dispersion would be far worse because of longer and more varied path lengths in the systemic circulation compared with the pulmonary circulation. In fact, the concentration curve would be so flattened that it would be difficult to resolve the area underneath the $[\mathrm{X}]$ profile.

A second practical problem with a closed circulatory system is that before the initial $[\mathrm{X}]$ wave has waned, recirculation causes the injected indicator to appear for a second time in front of the sensor at checkpoint B (see Fig. 17-16D). Extrapolation of the exponential decay of the first wave can correct for this problem.

The thermodilution technique is a convenient alternative approach to the dye technique. In this method, one injects a bolus of cold saline and an indwelling thermistor is used to follow the dilution of these "negative calories" as a change of temperature at the downstream site. In the thermodilution technique, a temperature-versus-time profile replaces the concentration-versus-time profile. During cardiac catheterization, the cardiologist injects a bolus of cold saline into the right atrium and records the temperature change in the pulmonary artery. The distance between upstream injection and downstream recording site is kept short to avoid heat exchange in the pulmonary capillary bed. The advantages of this method are that (1) the injection of cold saline can be repeated without harm, (2) a single venous (versus venous and arterial) puncture allows access to both the upstream and the downstream sites, (3) less dispersion occurs because no capillary beds are involved, and (4) less recirculation occurs because of adequate temperature equilibration in the pulmonary and systemic capillary beds. A potential drawback is incomplete mixing, which may result from the proximity between injection and detection sites.

## Regional blood flow can be measured indirectly by "clearance" methods

The methods used to measure regional blood flow are often called clearance methods, although the term here has a meaning somewhat different from its meaning in kidney physiology. Clearance methods are another application of the Fick principle, using the rate of uptake or elimination of a substance by an organ together with a determination of the difference in concentration of the indicator between the arterial inflow and venous outflow (i.e., the a-v difference). By analogy with Equation 17-18, we can compute the blood flow through an organ $(F)$ from the rate at which the organ removes the test substance X from the blood $\left(\mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ and the concentrations of the substance in arterial blood $\left([\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$ and venous blood $\left([\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{v}}\right)$ :

$$
F=\frac{\mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{X}}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{a}}-[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{v}}}=\frac{\text { moles } / \mathrm{min}}{\text { moles } / \text { liter }}=\text { liters } / \min
$$

One can determine hepatic blood flow with the use of BSP (bromsulphthalein), a dye that the liver almost completely clears and excretes into the bile (see p. 951). Here, $Q_{X}$ is the rate of removal of BSP from the blood, estimated as the rate at which BSP appears in the bile. $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{a}}$ is the

## BOX 17-2 Thallium Scanning for Assessment of Coronary Blood Flow

Tallium is an ion that acts as a potassium analog and enters cells through the same channels or transporters as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$does. Active cardiac muscle takes up injected ${ }^{207} \mathrm{Tl}$, provided there is adequate blood flow. Therefore, the rate of uptake of the ${ }^{207} \mathrm{Tl}$ isotope by the heart is a useful qualitative measure of coronary blood flow. Complete ${ }^{207} \mathrm{Tl}$ myocardial imaging is possible by two-dimensional scanning of the emitted gamma rays or by computed tomography for a threedimensional image. Thus, in those portions of myocardial tissue supplied by stenotic coronary vessels, the uptake is slower, and these areas appear as defects on a thallium scan. Thallium scans are used to detect coronary artery disease during exercise stress tests.
concentration of BSP in a systemic artery, and $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{s}}$ is the concentration of BSP in the hepatic vein.

In a similar manner, one can determine renal blood flow with the use of PAH (para-aminohippurate). The kidneys almost completely remove this compound from the blood and secrete it into the urine (see pp. 749-750).

It is possible to determine coronary blood flow or regional blood flow through skeletal muscle from the tissue clearance of rapidly diffusing inert gases, such as the radioisotopes ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ and ${ }^{85} \mathrm{Kr}$.

Finally, one can use the rate of disappearance of nitrous oxide $\left(\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, a gas that is historically important as the first anesthetic, to compute cerebral blood flow.

A similar although qualitative approach is thallium scanning to assess coronary blood flow. Here one measures the uptake of an isotope by the heart muscle, rather than its clearance (Box 17-2).

## Ventricular dimensions, ventricular volumes, and volume changes can be measured by angiography and echocardiography

Clinicians can use a variety of approaches to examine the cardiac chambers. Gated radionuclide imaging employs compounds of the gamma-emitting isotope ${ }^{99 \mathrm{~m}} \mathrm{Tc}$, (1) N17-6 which has a half-life of 6 hours. After ${ }^{99 \mathrm{~m}} \mathrm{Tc}$ is injected, a gamma camera provides imaging of the cardiac chambers. Electrocardiogram (ECG) gating (i.e., synchronization to a particular spot on the ECG) allows the apparatus to snap a picture at a specific part of the cardiac cycle and to sum these pictures over many cycles. Because this method does not provide a high-resolution image, it yields only a relative ventricular volume. From the difference between the count at the maximally filled state (end-diastolic volume) and at its minimally filled state (end-systolic volume), the cardiologist can estimate the fraction of ventricular blood that is ejected during systole-the ejection fraction-which is an important measure of cardiac function.

Angiography can accurately provide the linear dimensions of the ventricle, allowing the cardiologist to calculate absolute ventricular volumes. A catheter is threaded into either the left or the right ventricle, and saline containing a

# N17-6 ${ }^{99 \mathrm{~m}} \mathrm{Tc}$ Scanning 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Several compounds labeled with ${ }^{99 \mathrm{~m}} \mathrm{Tc}$-for instance, technetium Tc 99m sestamibi and technetium Tc 99m tetrofosminhave been introduced for imaging myocardial perfusion. The ${ }^{99 \mathrm{~m}} \mathrm{Tc}$ label emits gamma radiation at 140 keV by an isomeric transition (indicated by the $m$ in 99 m ); it has a half-life of 6 hours. Following injection, the initial distribution of these agents in the myocardium is proportional to the relative distribution of myocardial blood flow. The radiochemical enters cardiac myocytes passively in such a way that about $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ of the chemical is extracted by the myocardium. Extraction may be enhanced by administering nitrates prior to injection. Because the radiochemical leaves the myocyte rather slowly (over several hours), one can perform the imaging with the gamma camera over a time period of hours. Note that absolute measurements of myocardial blood flow would require positron-emission tomography (PET), which can quantitate counts per unit volume of tissue.

It is possible to use ${ }^{99 \mathrm{~m}} \mathrm{Tc}$-labeled compounds not only for assessing myocardial perfusion but also for assessing myocardial function. In single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), the computer acquires imaging data synchronized with the $R$ wave of the ECG (see Fig. 21-7). This gated imaging allows one to display end-diastolic and endsystolic images along various axes of the heart. These enddiastolic and end-systolic dimensions can then be compared to assess ejection fraction, stroke volume, regional wall motion, and regional wall thickening.

contrast substance (i.e., a chemical opaque to x-rays) is injected into the ventricle. This approach provides a twodimensional projection of the ventricular volume as a function of time. In magnetic resonance imaging, the physician obtains a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) image of the protons in the water of the heart muscle and blood. However, because standard NMR requires long data-acquisition times, it does not provide good time resolution.

Echocardiography, which exploits ultrasonic waves to visualize the heart and great vessels, can be used in two modes. In M-mode echocardiography (M is for motion), the technician places a single transducer in a fixed position on the chest wall and obtains a one-dimensional view of heart components. As shown in the upper portion of Figure 17-17A, the ultrasonic beam transects the anterior wall of the right ventricle, the right ventricle, the septum, the left ventricle, the leaflets of the mitral valve, and the posterior wall of the left ventricle. The lower portion of Figure 17-17A shows the positions of the borders between these structures (x-axis) during a single cardiac cycle (y-axis) and thus how the size of the left ventricle-along the axis of the beamchanges with time. Of course, the technician can obtain other views by changing the orientation of the beam.

In two-dimensional echocardiography, the probe automatically and rapidly pivots, scanning the heart in a single anatomical slice or plane (see Fig. 17-17A, area between the two broken lines) and providing a true cross section. This approach is therefore superior to angiography, which provides only a two-dimensional projection. Because cardiac output is the product of heart rate and stroke volume, one can calculate cardiac output from echocardiographic measurements of ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume.

A problem common to angiography and M-mode echocardiography is that it is impossible to compute ventricular volume from a single dimension because the ventricle is not a simple sphere. As is shown in Figure 17-17B, the left ventricle is often assumed to be a prolate ellipse, with a long axis $L$ and two short axes $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$. To simplify the calculation and to allow ventricular volume to be computed from a single measurement, it is sometimes assumed that $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ are identical and that $D_{1}$ is half of $L$. Unfortunately, use of this algorithm and just a single dimension, as provided by M-mode echocardiography, N17-3 often yields grossly erroneous volumes. Use of two-dimensional echocardiography to sum information from several parallel slices through the ventricle, or from planes that are at a known angle to one another, can yield more accurate volumes.

In addition to ultrasound methods and angiography, the technique of magnetic resonance angiography, an application of magnetic resonance tomography, is used to obtain twodimensional images of slices of ventricular volumes or of blood vessels.

In contrast to standard echocardiography, Doppler echocardiography provides information on the velocity, direction, and character of blood flow, just as police radar monitors traffic. In Doppler echocardiography (as with police radar), most information is obtained with the beam parallel to the flow of blood. In the simplest application of Doppler flow measurements, one can continuously monitor the velocity of flowing blood in a blood vessel or part of the heart. On such a record, the x -axis represents time, and the y -axis

In A, the tracing on the bottom shows the result of an M-mode echocardiogram (i.e., transducer in a single position) during one cardiac cycle.

represents the spectrum of velocities of the moving red blood cells (i.e., different cells can be moving at different velocities). Flow toward the transducer appears above baseline, whereas flow away from the transducer appears below baseline. The intensity of the record at a single point on the $y$-axis (encoded by a gray scale or false color) represents the strength of the returning signal, which depends on the number of red blood cells moving at that velocity. Thus, Doppler echocardiography is able to distinguish the

A, Blood moves through the mitral valve and into the left ventricle during diastole. Because blood is flowing toward the transducer, its velocity is encoded as red. B, Blood moves out of the ventricle and toward the aortic valve during systole. Because blood is flowing away from the transducer, its velocity is encoded as blue. (From Feigenbaum H: Echocardiography. In Braunwald E [ed]: Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine, 5th ed. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 1997.)
character of flow: laminar versus turbulent. Alternatively, at one instant in time, the Doppler technician can scan a region of a vessel or the heart, obtaining a two-dimensional, color-encoded map of blood velocities. If we overlay such two-dimensional Doppler data on a two-dimensional echocardiogram, which shows the position of the vessel or cardiac structures, the result is a color flow Doppler echocardiogram (Fig. 17-18).

Finally, a magnetic resonance scanner can also be used in two-dimensional phase-contrast mapping to yield quantitative measurements of blood flow velocity.

# N17-7 Ventricular Volume from M-Mode Echocardiography 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

As shown in Figure 17-17B, the left ventricle is often assumed to be a prolate ellipse, with a long axis $L$ and two short axes $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$. To simplify the calculation, and to allow ventricular volume to be computed from a single measurement, it is sometimes assumed that $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ are identical, and that $D_{1}$ is half of $L$. Unfortunately, use of this algorithm and just a single dimension, as provided by M-mode echocardiography, often yields grossly erroneous volumes.

One can obtain a more accurate estimate of ventricular volume by including an independent measurement of a second dimension, as is done in two-dimensional echocardiography. For example, one could obtain the long axis ( $L$ ) in addition to the short axes ( $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$, which are assumed to be the same in the simple calculation). However, the ventricle often does not resemble a prolate ellipse, certainly not in pathological states. Thus, cardiologists have used more complex geometric models (e.g., bullet shape).

# BLOOD 

Emile L. Boulpaep

Blood is a complex fluid consisting of plasma-extracellular fluid rich in proteins-and of formed elements-red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. Total blood volume is $\sim 70 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight in the adult woman and $\sim 80 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight in the adult man (see Table 5-1).

## BLOOD COMPOSITION

## Whole blood is a suspension of cellular elements in plasma

If you spin down a sample of blood containing an anticoagulant for $\sim 5$ minutes at $10,000 \mathrm{~g}$, the bottom fraction contains formed elements-RBCs (or erythrocytes), WBCs (leukocytes, which include granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes); the top fraction is blood plasma (Fig. 18-1). The RBCs having the highest density are at the bottom of the tube, whereas most of the WBCs and platelets form a whitish gray layer-the buffy coat-between the RBCs and plasma. Only a small amount of WBCs, platelets, and plasma is trapped in the bottom column of RBCs.

The hematocrit (see p. 102) is the fraction of the total column occupied by RBCs. The normal hematocrit is $\sim 40 \%$ for adult women and $\sim 45 \%$ for adult men. The hematocrit in the newborn is $\sim 55 \%$ and falls to $\sim 35 \%$ at 2 months of age, from which time it rises during development to reach adult values at puberty. The hematocrit is a measure of concentration of RBCs, not of total body red cell mass. Expansion of plasma volume in a pregnant woman reduces the hematocrit, whereas her total red cell volume also increases but less than plasma volume (see p. 1142). Immediately after hemorrhage, the hematocrit may be normal despite the loss of blood volume (see pp. 585-586). Total RBC volume is $\sim 28 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight in the adult woman and $\sim 36 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight in the adult man.

Plasma is a pale-white watery solution of electrolytes, plasma proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Pink-colored plasma suggests the presence of hemoglobin caused by hemolysis (lysis of RBCs) and release of hemoglobin into the plasma. A brown-green color may reflect elevated bilirubin levels (see Box 46-1). Plasma can also be cloudy in cryoglobulinemias (see pp. 438-439). The electrolyte composition of plasma differs only slightly from that of interstitial
fluid on account of the volume occupied by proteins and their electrical charge (see Table 5-2).

Plasma proteins at a normal concentration of $\sim 7.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ account for a colloid osmotic pressure or oncotic pressure of $\sim 25 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (see p. 470). Principal plasma proteins are albumin, fibrinogen, globulins, and other coagulation factors. The molecular weights of plasma proteins range up to 970 kDa (Table 18-1). The plasma concentration of albumin ranges from 3.5 to $5.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, which provides the body with a total plasma albumin pool of $\sim 135 \mathrm{~g}$. Albumin is synthesized by the liver at a rate of $\sim 120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight per day and, due to catabolism, has a half-life in the circulation of $\sim 20$ days. Urinary losses of albumin are normally negligible ( $<20 \mathrm{mg} /$ day; see p. 470). Plasma concentration of albumin is typically decreased in hepatic cirrhosis (see p. 569). Hepatic synthesis of albumin is strongly enhanced by a low plasma colloid osmotic pressure.

Many plasma proteins are involved in blood coagulation through coagulation cascades, the end point of which is the cleavage of fibrinogen into fibrin monomers that further assemble into a fibrin polymer. The fibrinogen molecule is a dimer of identical heterotrimers, each composed of $A \alpha$-, $B \beta$-, and $\gamma$ chains. Fibrinogen is synthesized only by the liver (see Table 46-3) and circulates in plasma at concentrations of 150 to $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. The acute-phase response (Box 18-1) greatly enhances fibrinogen synthesis. During clotting, the cross-linked polymers of fibrin form strands that trap red and white cells, platelets, and plasma inside the thrombus (i.e., blood clot). Subsequent interaction of myosin and actin in the platelets of the clot allows the clot to shrink to a plug that expels a slightly yellow-tinged fluid. This residual fluid is serum, which differs principally from plasma by the absence of fibrinogen and other coagulation factor. However, serum still contains albumin, antibodies, and other proteins. Note that plasma can also form a clot, but a plasma clot does not retract because it lacks platelets.

Subtraction of the albumin and fibrinogen moiety from total protein concentration yields the concentration of all the proteins grouped as globulins. Electrophoresis can be used to fractionate plasma proteins. The electrophoretic mobility of a protein depends on its molecular weight (size and shape) as well as its electrical charge. Plasma proteins comprise the following in decreasing order of electrophoretic

## BOX 18-1 Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate

Almost any acute stress to the body (trauma, infection, disease) induces a reaction called the acute-phase response. During the course of several hours, in response to inflammatory cytokines the liver rapidly synthesizes and secretes into the circulatory system a number of proteins that aid in the host response to the threat. Among these proteins is fibrinogen (see p. 429), which causes RBCs to cluster and increases their effective density. When anticoagulated blood from a patient with hyperfibrinogenemia is placed in a glass tube, the RBCs fall more quickly under the influence of gravity than when the blood is from a healthy subject. After 1 hour, this sedimentation leaves a layer of clear plasma on the top of the tube ( $\leq 15 \mathrm{~mm}$ thick for normal blood and often $>40 \mathrm{~mm}$ thick in certain inflammatory disorders). This rate of fall is called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Although it is nonspecific because so many different conditions can cause it to increase, the ESR is still widely used by clinicians to assess the presence and severity of inflammation. It is a simple technique, easily performed in a physician's office. As an example of its utility, a patient with an inflammatory process that naturally waxes and wanes, such as lupus erythematosus, may present with nonspecific complaints such as fatigue, weakness, and achiness. An elevated ESR would suggest that these complaints are due to the reactivation of the disease and not just to a poor night's sleep or depression.

The three most abundant peaks are albumin, fibrinogen, and $\gamma$-globulins. The $\gamma$-globulins include the immunoglobulins or antibodies, which can be separated into $\mathrm{IgA}, \mathrm{IgD}, \mathrm{IgE}, \mathrm{IgG}$, and IgM . Immunoglobulins are synthesized by B lymphocytes and plasma cells.

Clinical laboratories most often perform electrophoresis of blood proteins on serum instead of plasma (see Fig. 18-2B). Table 18-1 shows the major protein components

The liver synthesizes most of the globulins and coagulation factors. (1) N18-1

## Bone marrow is the source of most blood cells

If you spread a drop of anticoagulated blood thinly on a glass slide, you can detect under the microscope the cellular elements of blood. In such a peripheral blood smear, the following mature cell types are easily recognized: erythrocytes; granulocytes divided in neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils; lymphocytes; monocytes; and platelets (Fig. 18-3).

Hematopoiesis is the process of generation of all the cell types present in blood. Because of the diversity of cell types generated, hematopoiesis serves multiple roles ranging from the carriage of gases to immune responses and hemostasis. Pluripotent long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) constitute a population of adult stem cells found in bone marrow that are multipotent and able to self-renew. The short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs) give rise to committed stem cells or progenitors, which after proliferation are able to differentiate into lineages that in turn give rise to burst-forming units (BFUs) or colony-forming units (CFUs), each of which ultimately will produce one or a limited number of mature cell types: erythrocytes, the megakaryocytes that give rise to platelets, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils, monocytes-macrophages/dendritic cells, and B or T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (Fig. 18-4). Soluble factors known as cytokines guide the development of each lineage. The research of Donald Metcalf demonstrated the importance of a family of hematopoietic cytokines that stimulate colony formation by progenitor cells, the colonystimulating factors. The main colony-stimulating factors are granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; see p. 70), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3) and IL-5 (see p. 70), thrombopoietin (TPO), and erythropoietin (EPO; see pp. 431-433).

GM-CSF is a glycoprotein that stimulates proliferation of a common myeloid progenitor and promotes the production of neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes-macrophages. Recombinant GM-CSF (sargramostim [Leukine]) is used clinically after bone marrow transplantation and in certain acute leukemias.

G-CSF and M-CSF are glycoproteins that guide the ultimate development of granulocytes and monocytesmacrophages/dendritic cells, respectively. Recombinant GCSF (filgrastim [Neupogen]) is used therapeutically in neutropenia (e.g., after chemotherapy). M-CSF is also required for osteoclast development (see p. 1057 and Fig. 52-4).

IL-3 (also known as multi-CSF) has a broad effect on multiple lineages. The liver and the kidney constitutively produce this glycoprotein. IL-5 (colony-stimulating factor, eosinophil), a homodimeric glycoprotein, sustains the terminal differentiation of eosinophilic precursors.

TPO binds to a TPO receptor called c-Mpl, which is the cellular homolog of the viral oncogene $v-m p l$ (murine myeloproliferative leukemia virus). On stimulation by TPO, the Mpl receptor induces an increase in the number and size of megakaryocytes-the cells that produce plateletswhich thereby greatly augments the number of circulating platelets.

EPO, (2) N18-2 which is homologous to TPO, is produced by the kidney and to a lesser extent by the liver. This cytokine supports erythropoiesis or red cell development

## N18-2 Erythropoietin

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Erythropoietin (EPO) is a $\sim 34-\mathrm{kDa}$ glycoprotein made mainly in the kidney by fibroblast-like type I interstitial cells in the cortex and outer medulla (see p. 730). EPO is a growth factor related to other cytokines, and it acts through a tyrosine kinase-associated receptor (see pp. 70-71) to stimulate the production of proerythroblasts in the bone marrow as well as the development of red cells from their progenitor cells. In fetal life, the liver rather than the kidney produces EPO. Even in the adult, Kupffer cells in the liver produce some EPO.

Four lines of evidence indicate that the stimulus for EPO synthesis is a decrease in local $P_{\mathrm{fg}}$. First, EPO synthesis increases with anemia. Second, EPO production increases with lowered renal blood flow. Third, EPO synthesis increases with central hypoxia (i.e., low arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{fg}}$ ), such as may occur with pulmonary disease or with living at high altitude (see p. 1231). In all three of these cases, local $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{fg}}$ falls as tissues respond to a decrease in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery by extracting more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from each volume of blood that passes through the kidney. Finally, EPO production increases
when hemoglobin has a high $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity. Here, the renal cells must lower $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{fg}}$ substantially before $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociates from hemoglobin. Thus, mutant hemoglobins with high $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinities, stored blood (which has low 2,3-DPG levels), and alkaline blood all lead to increased EPO production.

Besides local hypoxia, several hormones and other agents stimulate EPO production. For example, prostaglandin $\mathrm{E}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PGE}_{2}\right)$ and adenosine appear to stimulate EPO synthesis by increasing intracellular levels of cAMP. Norepinephrine and thyroid hormone also stimulate EPO release. Finally, androgens stimulatewhereas estrogens inhibit-EPO synthesis, which explains at least in part why women in their childbearing years have lower hematocrit levels than men do.

Because the kidneys are the major source of EPO, renal failure leads to reduced EPO levels and anemia. The development of recombinant EPO has had a major impact in ameliorating the anemia of chronic renal failure.

(Fig. 18-5). As described on pages 93-94, hypoxia increases the abundance of the $\alpha$ subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1 $\alpha$ ), which enhances production of EPO messenger RNA. Although EPO is not absolutely required for early commitment of progenitor cells to the erythroid lineage, it is essential for the differentiation of burst-forming uniterythroid cells (BFU-Es) to colony-forming unit-erythroid cells (CFU-Es) or proerythroblasts (also known as pronormoblasts), which still lack hemoglobin. The further maturation of cells downstream of proerythroblasts does not require

EPO. Recombinant EPO has proved effective in the treatment of anemia. Hemoglobin first appears at the stage of polychromatic erythroblasts and is clearly evident in orthochromatic erythroblasts. The subsequent exocytosis of the nucleus produces reticulocytes (see Fig. 18-5), whereas the loss of ribosomes and mitochondria yields mature erythrocytes, which enter the circulation. The mature erythrocyte has a life span of $\sim 120$ days. Immature reticulocytes may also appear in the circulation when erythropoiesis is heavily activated.

## RBCs are mainly composed of hemoglobin

As evidenced by the magnitude of the hematocrit, RBCs are the most abundant elements in blood. RBCs are nonnucleated biconcave cells with a diameter of $\sim 7.5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ and a volume of $\sim 90 \mathrm{fL}\left(90 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{~L}\right)$. Maintaining the shape of the RBC is a cytoskeleton that is anchored to the plasma membrane by glycophorin and the "band 3" $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger (see Fig. 2-9). The distinctive shape of the RBC provides a much larger surface-to-volume ratio than that of a spherical cell; this maximizes diffusion area and minimizes intracellular diffusion distances for gas exchange. The RBC performs three major tasks: (1) carrying $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the lungs to the systemic tissues, (2) carrying $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from tissues to the lungs, and (3) assisting in the buffering of acids and bases.

Table 18-2 lists the properties of RBCs that are routinely determined in the clinical laboratory. The most important constituent of the RBC is hemoglobin. Globin synthesis begins in the proerythroblast (see Fig. 18-5). By the end of the orthochromatic-erythroblast stage, the cell has synthesized all the hemoglobin it will carry. Normal blood hemoglobin content is $\sim 14.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ in the adult female and $\sim 15.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ in the adult male. The hemoglobin concentration in red cell cytosol is extremely high, $\sim \mathbf{5 . 5} \mathbf{~ m M}$. The mean cell hemoglobin concentration is $\sim 35 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ RBCs, or about five times the concentration of proteins in plasma. Enclosure of hemoglobin in red cells has the advantage of minimizing the loss of hemoglobin from the plasma through filtration across the blood capillary walls. The structure and various chemical

forms of hemoglobin, as well as the carriage of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by hemoglobin, are discussed in Chapter 29.

Because the mature RBCs contain no nucleus or other organelles, they can neither synthesize proteins nor engage in oxidative metabolism. The RBC can engage in two metabolic pathways: glycolysis, which consumes $90 \%$ of glucose uptake; and the pentose shunt (see Fig. 58-1), which consumes the remaining $10 \%$ of glucose. The cell generates its ATP exclusively by glycolysis. An important constituent of the RBC is 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). RBCs use DPG mutase to convert 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3-DPG), part of the normal glycolytic pathway (see Fig. 58-6A), into 2,3-DPG. In RBCs, the cytosolic concentration of 2,3-DPG is normally 4 to 5 mM , about the same as the concentration of hemoglobin. 2,3-DPG acts on hemoglobin by reducing the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity of hemoglobin (see pp. 654-655).

Erythrocytes contain glutathione at $\sim 2 \mathrm{mM}$, more than any other cell of the body outside the hepatocyte (see p. 955). A high ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) protects the RBC against oxidant damage. Glutathione reductase regenerates GSH from GSSG in a reaction that consumes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The RBC generates all its NADPH from the glycolytic intermediate glucose-6phosphate through the pentose-shunt pathway (see Fig. 58-1).

RBCs carry two cytoplasmic isoforms of carbonic anhydrase (see p. 656), 0 N18-3 CA I and CA II. These enzymes, which rapidly interconvert $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, play a critical role in carrying metabolically produced $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the systemic tissues to the pulmonary capillaries for elimination in the exhaled air (see pp. 655-657). CA II has one of the fastest known enzymatic turnover rates.
$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ carriage also depends critically on the $\mathbf{C l}-\mathbf{H C O}_{3}$ exchanger AE1 (see pp. 124-125 and 656) in the RBC membrane. The transporter was originally known as band 3 protein because of its position on a sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel of RBC membrane proteins. AE1 is the most abundant membrane protein in RBCs, with $\sim 1$ million copies per cell. One AE1 molecule can transport as many as 50,000 ions per second-it is one of the fastest known transporters. AE1 and most other members of the SLC4 family of

# N18-3 Carbonic Anhydrases 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

## Overview

The carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are a family of zinc-containing enzymes with at least 16 members among mammals; eTable 18-1 lists some of these isoforms. Physiologically, the CAs catalyze the interconversion of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$although they also can cleave aliphatic and aromatic ester linkages. CA I is present mainly in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes. CA II is a ubiquitous cytoplasmic enzyme. CA IV is a GPI-linked enzyme (see p. 13) found, for example, on the outer surface of the apical membrane of the renal proximal tubule (see pp. 828-829). A hallmark of many CAs is their inhibition by sulfonamides (e.g., acetazolamide).

## Reaction Catalyzed by CAs

Before we consider the action of CA, it is instructive to examine the interconversion of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in the absence of enzyme. When $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ increases,

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \text { slow } \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2} \text { fast } \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \quad \text { (NE 18-1) }
$$

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can also form $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$by directly combining with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, a reaction that becomes important at high pH values, when $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$is also high:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \\
& \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \xrightarrow[\rightarrow]{\uparrow} \mathrm{H}^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because the dissociation of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ replenishes the consumed $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the two mechanistically distinct pathways for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$formation are functionally equivalent. Of course, both reaction sequences are reversible. However, in the absence of CA, the overall speed of the interconversion between $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is slow at physiological pH . In fact, it is possible to exploit this slowness experimentally to generate $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$solutions that are temporarily "out of equilibrium" ( $\mathrm{N}_{28-4}$. Unlike normal (i.e., equilibrated) solutions, such out-of-equilibrium solutions can have virtually any combination of $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right],\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$, and pH in the physiological range.

Structural biologists have solved the crystal structures of several CAs. At the reaction site, three histidines coordinate a zinc atom that, along with a threonine, plays a critical role in binding $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. In CA II, the fastest of the CAs, a fourth histidine acts as a proton acceptor/donor. Extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies have provided considerable insight into the mechanism of the CA reaction. The CAs have the effect of catalyzing the slow $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ hydration in Equation NE 18-1. Actually, these enzymes catalyze the top reaction in Equation NE 18-2, the direct combination of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to form $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. CA II catalyzes both reactions in Equation NE 18-2:
$\left(\right.$ HisEnzyme $-\mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightleftarrows\left(\right.$ HisEnzyme $-\mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$
$\left(\right.$ HisEnzyme $-\mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftarrows\left(\right.$ HisEnzyme $-\mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$
$\left(\right.$ HisEnzyme $-\mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{H}^{+}-$HisEnzyme $-\mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{OH}^{-}$
$\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}-\right.$ HisEnzyme $-\mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightleftarrows\left(\right.$ HisEnzyme $-\mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$ (NE 18-3)

CA II has one of the highest turnover numbers of any known enzyme: Each second, one CA II molecule can convert $>1$ million $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions. In the erythrocyte, this rapid reaction is important for the carriage of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the peripheral blood vessels to the lungs (see pp. 655-657). In the average cell, CAs
are important for allowing the rapid buffering of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$by the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer pair.

Another role of CAs may be in minimizing the pH changes that occur on membrane surfaces that contain transporters that move $\mathrm{H}^{+}$or $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$. For example, the extrusion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the cell by an $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchanger would generate a low pH at the outer surface of the cell. CA IV, with its extracellular catalytic domain, would consume much of the extruded $\mathrm{H}^{+}$

\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}

and thereby minimize the fall in surface pH .
Preliminary data suggest that the electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ cotransporters (NBCe1 and NBCe2; see p. 122), and perhaps also the other $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled " $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$" transporters (the electroneutral NBCs NBCn1 and NBCn2, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$exchanger NDCBE; see p. 124), actually move $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$. As $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ enters the cell, the following reaction would not only replenish the $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ but would also generate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$on the outer surface of the cell:

$$
\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}
$$

(NE 18-5)
The consequence would be a buildup of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$on the extracellular surface, just as in the case of an $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchanger. An extracellular CA like CA IV would consume this newly generated $\mathrm{H}^{+}$:

$$
\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

(NE 18-6)
The net reaction (summing Equation NE 18-5 and Equation NE 18-6) would be as follows:

$$
2 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

Thus, when a transporter like NBCe1 appears to transport 2 $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the cell, what is really happening is that $1 \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ is being transported by the NBCe1, and $1 \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $1 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ are entering the cell by another mechanism. CA enzymes on both the extra- and intracellular surfaces of the cell minimize the pH changes (by consuming or generating $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, as necessary) generated by NBCs and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$transporters.

## CA Deficiency in Humans

For a discussion of genetic deficiencies of CAs in humans, see Box 39-1. The homozygous absence of normal CA II causes CA II deficiency syndrome, characterized by osteopetrosis, renal tubular acidosis, and cerebral calcification. At least seven different mutations can cause genetic defects. The mutation that is common in patients of Arabic descent causes mental retardation but less severe osteopetrosis. Other patients may carry two different mutations. Indeed, the first three patients described with CA II deficiency syndrome, sisters in the same family, were compound heterozygotes, having received one mutation from their mother and a second from their father.

Although CA I deficiency exists, the homozygous condition has no obvious consequences because CA I and CA II normally contribute about equally to the CA activity in RBCs.

## Nontraditional CAs

Three soluble CAs-VIII, X, and XI-are unusual in that they lack one or more of the three homologous histidine residues that enzymatically active CAs use to coordinate $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$. In addition, two

## Leukocytes defend against infections

Table 18-3 summarizes the relative abundance of various leukocytes in the blood. These WBCs are in two major groups: the granulocytes, on the one hand, and the lymphocytes and monocytes, on the other. Granulocytes are so named because of their cytoplasmic granules, which on a blood smear stained with Giemsa stain or Wright stain appear red (eosinophils), blue (basophils), or intermediate (neutrophils). The nuclear material is irregularly shaped in the form of the letter S or Z. The name polymorphonuclear leukocytes applies to all three types of granulocytes, but often is used to refer specifically to neutrophils. The average diameter of a neutrophil is $\sim 12 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, smaller than that of a monocyte ( 14 to $20 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ) or eosinophil ( $\sim 13 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ), somewhat larger than that of a basophil ( $\sim 11 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ), and much larger than that of a lymphocyte ( 6 to $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ). Granulocytes have a brief life span in the blood ( $<12$ hours), but on activation can migrate into the tissues.

Neutrophils The most abundant leukocytes, neutrophils are identified on the basis of the shape of the nucleus as mature segmented neutrophils ( $56 \%$ of leukocytes) and immature band neutrophils ( $3 \%$ of leukocytes). Segmented neutrophils have at least two lobes separated by a thin filament, whereas band neutrophils have a nucleus of more uniform thickness. Neutrophils have two types of granules (specific and azurophilic) that contain lysosomal enzymes, peroxidase, collagenase, and other enzymes capable of digesting foreign material. In the presence of a chemotactic attractant, neutrophils approach foreign substances, such as bacteria, to phagocytose them within a phagocytic vacuole. By a process known as degranulation, granules merge with the vacuole and empty their contents into the vacuole. Bacteria are destroyed within the vacuole by the action of hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ and the superoxide anion radical $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\right.$; see p. 1238).

Eosinophils The granules of eosinophils contain major basic protein (MBP), which is toxic to parasites, as well as
other enzymes. These cells are important in the response to parasites and viruses. Eosinophils also play a role in allergic reactions.

Basophils Basophils, the least common granulocytes, are a major source of the cytokine IL-4, which in turn stimulates B lymphocytes to produce IgE antibodies. The granuleswhich nearly obscure the nucleus-contain histamine, heparin, and peroxidase. Like eosinophils, basophils also play a role in allergic reactions.

Lymphocytes Like the monocytes discussed next, lymphocytes do not have granules. Lymphocytes come in different classes, although they cannot be distinguished in a blood smear. The lymphocyte precursors originate in the bone marrow where lineage commitment occurs.

T lymphocytes or T cells, which represent $70 \%$ to $80 \%$ of peripheral lymphocytes in blood, undergo maturation primarily in the thymus. T lymphocytes are responsible for cellmediated immunity.

B lymphocytes or B cells, which represent $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of peripheral lymphocytes in blood, undergo maturation in bone marrow and peripheral lymphoid tissue. When B cells interact with antigen in the presence of T cells and macrophages, B cells can transform into plasma cells, which abundantly make and secrete antibodies that are directed against specific antigens. Thus, B cells are responsible for humoral immunity.

The remaining lymphocytes in blood include a variety of classes, such as the natural killer cells.

Monocytes Because they migrate from the bone marrow to peripheral tissues, monocytes are not abundant in blood. Rather, monocytes spend most of their long life in peripheral tissues, where they develop into larger macrophages ( 20 to $40 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter). The macrophage (from the Greek macros [large] + phagein [eat]) serves two functions: (1) the phagocytosis of pathogens or cellular debris, and (2) the presentation of antigens to lymphocytes.

## Platelets are nucleus-free fragments

Platelets form in the bone marrow by budding off from large cells called megakaryocytes, the maturation of which depends on TPO and IL-3. Each megakaryocyte can produce up to a few thousand platelets. Normal blood contains 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter. A feedback mechanism operates between platelets and megakaryocytes, controlling platelet production. Platelets carry receptors for TPO that are able to bind and remove TPO from the plasma. Thus, a hypoplastic marrow generating few megakaryocytes leads to thrombocytopenia (platelet shortage) and thereby little removal of TPO, which in turn stimulates megakaryocyte production and corrects the lack of platelets. Conversely, a hyperplastic marrow creating many megakaryocytes leads to thrombocytosis (platelet excess) and thereby greater TPO removal, which ultimately turns off megakaryocyte production.

The life span of platelets is about 10 days. In their unactivated state, these nucleus-free fragments are disk shaped and 2 to $3 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter (Fig. 18-6). The external coat is rich in platelet receptors, which are glycoproteins. A

circumferential band of microtubules composed of tubulin provides an inner skeleton. Actin and myosin contractile filaments are present in the platelet interior. In addition to mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes, platelets have two types of special organelles: $\alpha$ granules and, less abundantly, dense-core granules. The $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ granules store von Willebrand factor, platelet fibrinogen, and clotting factor V. The fibrinogen inside the platelets actually originates in the liver, which secretes it into the blood plasma, where megakaryocytes and platelets then endocytose the fibrinogen. The dense-core granules store ATP, ADP, serotonin, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. As discussed below, platelets are essential for hemostasis (see p. 439).

## BLOOD VISCOSITY

The Poiseuille equation (see Equation 17-9) is based on several important assumptions (see pp. 416-418). On p. 416, we considered the first five, and here we consider the sixth: whether the viscosity of whole blood is constant in a newtonian sense (see pp. 416-418).

## Whole blood has an anomalous viscosity

Water and saline solutions are homogeneous or newtonian liquids. For these, the relationship between shear stress (force needed to move one lamina faster than its neighbor) and shear rate (velocity gradient between laminae) is linear and passes through the origin (Fig. 18-7, blue line). Viscosity (see Equation 17-12) is the slope of this line. The relationship of shear stress to shear rate for a non-newtonian fluid, such as latex house paint, is nonlinear. Blood plasma (see Fig. 18-7, yellow line) and serum are nearly newtonian. However, normal whole blood is non-newtonian: it has a nonlinear shear stress-to-shear rate relationship that intersects the y -axis above the origin (see Fig. 18-7, red curve). In other words, one has to apply some threshold force (i.e., the yield shear stress) before the fluid will move at all. At lower forces, the fluid is immobile. However, at higher shear rates (such as those achieved physiologically after the velocity of blood flow has increased sufficiently), the relationship between shear stress and shear rate assumes the newtonian ideal, with a slope that corresponds to a viscosity of -3.2 centipoise $(\mathrm{cP})$.

The concept of yield shear stress can best be understood by comparing two familiar viscous solutions: honey and mayonnaise. If one estimates the effort needed to stir a pot of honey or a jar of mayonnaise with a spoon, one might assume that their apparent viscosity is the same because each solution offers about the same resistance to deformation.
![bo3485266204](bo3485266204.jpg)

Figure 18-7 Anomalous viscosity of blood. To emphasize deviations from linearity, we plot the square roots of shear stress (force/area) and shear rate $(\Delta v / \Delta x)$.

However, with use of a more modest deforming force, such as gravity, a striking difference between the two fluids emerges. As one removes the spoon from the pot of honey, gravity causes the honey to drip from the spoon in a continuous stream. In contrast, a glob of mayonnaise stays attached to the spoon. The velocity of the mayonnaise is zero because its yield shear stress is greater than the force of gravity. Honey is a newtonian fluid that behaves similarly at low and high forces of deformation. Mayonnaise is similar to blood in that its viscosity appears to be infinite at low forces of deformation.

## Blood viscosity increases with the hematocrit and the fibrinogen plasma concentration

In practice, the effective viscosity of whole blood depends on several physiological factors: (1) fibrinogen concentration, (2) hematocrit, (3) vessel radius, (4) linear velocity, and (5) temperature. As noted previously, the viscosity of whole blood in the linear (or newtonian) region of Figure 18-7 is $\sim 3.2 \mathrm{cP}$, assuming a typical fibrinogen concentration of $260 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, a hematocrit of $40 \%$, and a temperature of $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. We will now see how each of these five factors influences the viscosity of blood.

Fibrinogen Fibrinogen is a major protein component of human plasma (see p. 429) and is a key element in the coagulation cascade. The main reason for the non-newtonian behavior of blood is the interaction of this fibrinogen with RBCs. Thus, plasma (which contains fibrinogen but not RBCs) is newtonian, as is a suspension of washed RBCs in saline (without fibrinogen). However, the simultaneous presence of fibrinogen and blood cells causes the nonlinear behavior illustrated by the red curve in Figure 18-7. At normal hematocrits, fibrinogen and, perhaps, lowdensity lipoproteins (see p. 968), electrophoretically seen as $\beta$-lipoproteins, are the only plasma proteins capable of creating a yield shear stress.

At normal hematocrits, the absence of fibrinogen (in congenital afibrinogenemia) eliminates the yield shear stress altogether. (○) N18-4 Conversely, hyperfibrinogenemia elevates yield shear stress and, in the extreme, leads to a clustering of RBCs that increases their effective density. This increased effective density, in turn, causes the RBCs to settle toward the bottom of a vertical tube-easily measured as an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (see p. 430). Note that fibrinogen levels tend to increase with age and with smoking.

Hematocrit Increases in hematocrit elevate blood viscosity by two mechanisms (Fig. 18-8). One prevails at physiological hematocrits, the other at higher hematocrits. Starting from values of $30 \%$, raising the hematocrit increases the interactions among RBCs-both directly and by proteins such as fibrinogen-and thereby increases viscosity. The reason is that forcing two RBCs closer together at higher hematocrits makes them more likely to stick to each other. At hematocrits $>60 \%$, the cells are so tightly packed that further increases lead to cell-cell interactions that increasingly deform the RBCs, thereby increasing viscosity. In patients with polycythemia, not only is viscosity high, but

Figure 18-9 Dependence of viscosity on vessel radius.
the yield stress can be $>4$-fold higher than normal (see Fig. 18-7). Obviously, the combination of a high hematocrit and a high fibrinogen level can be expected to lead to extremely high viscosities.

Vessel Radius In reasonably large vessels (radius greater than $\sim 1 \mathrm{~mm}$ ), blood viscosity is independent of vessel radius Fig. 18-9). However, the viscosity decreases steeply at lower radii. This Fahraeus-Lindqvist phenomenon has four major causes.

Poiseuille observed not only that RBCs move faster in the center of an arteriole or venule than at the periphery but also that the concentration of RBCs is greater at the center. Indeed, very near the wall, he observed a "transparent space" occupied only by plasma (Fig. 18-10A). This axial accumulation of RBCs occurs because the plasma imparts a spin to an erythrocyte caught between two layers of plasma sliding past one another at different velocities (see Fig. 17-5B). This spin causes the cell to move toward the center of the vessel, much like a billiard ball curves when struck off center (see Fig. 18-10A, inset of upper drawing). One consequence of axial accumulation is that local viscosity is lowest in the cell-poor region near the vessel wall and greatest in the cell-enriched core. The net effect in smaller vessels is that the overall

# N18-4 Effect of Fibrinogen on Blood Viscosity 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

As shown by Figure 18-7, at very low shear rates ( $x$-axis), the viscosity of whole blood (the value of shear stress divided the shear rate for the red curve) is greater than at high shear rates because of the non-newtonian nature of whole blood. The "yield shear stress" (the intercept at the $y$-axis) is the minimum force (i.e., shear stress) that one needs to apply to achieve any blood flow (i.e., shearing) at all.

The yield shear stress increases with the square of the fibrinogen concentration. Fibrinogen is a large glycoprotein (molecular weight $\cong 340 \mathrm{kDa}$ ) that is a hexamer composed, in turn, of a dimer of three chains, $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$.

All known congenital fibrinogen disorders cause fibrinogen levels to be low. Congenital afibrinogenemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that leads to severely impaired hemostasis. As would be expected-because of the lack of fibrinogen-this disease is associated with near-newtonian behavior of whole-blood viscosity. Congenital hypofibrinogenemia is a rare genetic condition caused by mutations in one of the three fibrinogen chain genes ( $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ ). As a result, heterozygotes exhibit poor assembly and secretion of mature fibrinogen by the liver.

Acquired alterations in fibrinogen levels include both hypofibrinogenemia and hyperfibrinogenemia. Hypofibrinogenemia can result from liver failure. Elevated fibrinogen levels are part of the acute-phase reaction during inflammation. Higher fibrinogen levels are associated with higher risk of ischemic heart disease-although there is not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship.

viscosity of the blood is decreased because the cell-poor plasma (low intrinsic viscosity) moves to the periphery where the shearing forces are the greatest, whereas the cellenriched blood (high intrinsic viscosity) is left along the central axis where the shearing forces are least. A second consequence of axial accumulation is that branch vessels preferentially skim the plasma (plasma skimming) from the main stream of the parent vessel, which leads to a lower hematocrit in branch vessels. However, some anatomical sites prevent skimming by means of an arterial cushion (see Fig. 18-10A, lower drawing).

The Poiseuille equation does not hold in vessels small enough to contain only a few RBCs in their cross section. Hagen's derivation of the equation assumes an infinite number of concentric laminae inside the vessel. In reality, a lamina can be no smaller than the thickness of an erythrocyte, which severely limits the number of laminae in small vessels (see Fig. 18-10B). If we were to re-derive a Poiseuillelike equation to model a small vessel, it would predict a viscosity that is lower than that predicted by the Poiseuille equation for a large vessel.

In vessels (e.g., capillaries) so small that their diameter is about the size of a single erythrocyte, we can no longer speak of the friction between concentric laminae. Instead, in small capillaries, the membrane of the RBC rolls around the cytoplasm in a movement called tank treading, similar to that of the track of a bulldozer (see Fig. 18-10C). As two treading erythrocytes shoot down a capillary, they spin the bolus of plasma trapped between them (bolus flow).

In vessels smaller than an erythrocyte, highly deformedliterally bullet-shaped-RBCs squeeze through the capillaries, so that the effective viscosity falls even farther below that of the bulk solution (see Fig. 18-10D). Under these conditions, a layer of plasma separates the erythrocytes from the capillary wall. The cells automatically "focus" themselves to the centerline of the capillary and maintain a fixed distance between two successive cells.

Velocity of Flow As for an ideal fluid (see Fig. 17-6A), the dependence of flow on pressure is linear for blood plasma (Fig. 18-11, gold curve). However, for whole blood, the pressure-flow relationship deviates slightly from linearity at velocities close to zero, and the situation is even worse for polycythemia. These deviations at very low flows have two explanations. First, at low flows, the shear rate is also low, which causes the whole blood (like mayonnaise) to behave in a non-newtonian manner (see Fig. 18-7) and to have a high apparent viscosity. In fact, as was already seen, one must apply a threshold force to get the blood to move at all. Thus, the red and green curves in Figure 18-11 have shallower slopes at low flows than at high flows. The second reason for the nonlinear pressure-flow relationship is that the tendency for RBCs to move to the center of the streamthereby lowering viscosity-requires a modest flow. After this axial accumulation "saturates," however, the relationship becomes linear.

Temperature Cooling normal whole blood from $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ increases its viscosity $\sim 2.5$-fold. However, physiologically, this effect is negligible in humans except during intense cooling of the extremities. On the other hand, in some

patients, the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood can cause an abnormal rise in viscosity even with less intense cooling of limbs. Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate at a temperature that is $<37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ but can partially resolubilize on warming. Different cryoglobulins are associated with infections, particularly hepatitis C, as well as with several autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders. High blood viscosity from the precipitated cryoglobulins can lead to vessel obstruction and local thrombosis.

## HEMOSTASIS AND FIBRINOLYSIS

We have already noted that two essential requirements of the circulatory system are that the blood must be a liquid and that it must not leak through the walls of the blood vessels. Meeting these two requirements is the job of the fibrinolytic and hemostatic machinery. Blood is normally in a liquid state inside blood vessels because it does not come into contact with negatively charged surfaces (e.g., the collagen beneath endothelial cells) that activate an intrinsic coagulation pathway, nor does it contact tissue factors (e.g., released from damaged tissue) that activate an extrinsic pathway. Furthermore, thrombolytic pathways keep the coagulation pathways in check. Indeed, plasma contains proteins that can be converted to proteases that digest fibrin and thereby lyse blood clots.

Hemostasis (from the Greek hemos [blood] + stasis [standing]), or the prevention of hemorrhage, can be
achieved by four methods: (1) vasoconstriction, (2) increased tissue pressure, (3) formation of a platelet plug in the case of capillary bleeding, and (4) coagulation or clot formation.

Vasoconstriction contributes to hemostasis because it raises the critical closing pressure-as we discuss on page 454 -and thus collapses vessels that have an intravascular pressure below the critical closing pressure. Vessel constriction is also promoted by chemical byproducts of platelet plug formation and of coagulation. For example, activated platelets release the vasoconstrictors thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}\left(\mathrm{TXA}_{2}\right.$; see p. 64) and serotonin (5-HT; see p. 315). Moreover, thrombin, a major product of the clotting machinery, triggers the endothelium to generate endothelin 1 (ET-1; see p. 480), the most powerful physiological vasoconstrictor.

Increased tissue pressure contributes to hemostasis because it decreases transmural pressure (see p. 414), which is the difference between intravascular pressure and tissue pressure. Transmural pressure is the main determinant of blood vessel radius. Given the fourth-power relationship between flow and blood vessel radius (see Equation 17-9), an increase in tissue pressure that causes radius to decrease by a factor of 2 would diminish flow by a factor of 16 . We all take advantage of this principle when we press a finger against a small cut to stop the bleeding. A tourniquet increases extravascular pressure and can thus halt an arterial hemorrhage in a limb. Finally, surgeons routinely make use of this principle when applying hemostatic clamps to close off "bleeders."

In the next two sections, we discuss the third and fourth methods of hemostasis, platelet plug formation and coagulation.

## Platelets can plug holes in small vessels

In a highly controlled fashion, platelets plug small breaches in the vascular endothelium. Plug formation is a process that includes adhesion, activation, and aggregation.

Adhesion Platelets do not adhere to themselves, to other blood cells, or to endothelial membranes. One preventive factor may be the negative surface charge on both platelets and endothelial cells. In the case of endothelial cells, the negative surface charge reflects the presence of proteoglycans, mainly heparan sulfate. Platelet adhesion occurs in response to an increase in the shearing force (see p. 415) at the surface of platelets or endothelial cells and in response to vessel injury or humoral signals.

Platelet adhesion-the binding of platelets to themselves or to other components-is mediated by platelet receptors, which are glycoproteins in the platelet membrane. These platelet receptors are integral membrane proteins belonging to a class of matrix receptors known as integrins (see p. 17). They are usually heterodimers linked by disulfide bonds. One ligand naturally present in the blood plasma is von Willebrand factor (vWF), (1) N18-5 a glycoprotein made by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. vWF is found in Weibel-Palade bodies of the endothelial cells and in $\alpha$ granules of platelets. High shear, certain cytokines, and hypoxia all trigger the release of vWF from endothelial cells. vWF binds to the platelet receptor known as glycoprotein Ib/Ia (Gp Ib/Ia), which is a dimer of Gp Ib linked to Gp Ia.

# N18-5 Von Willebrand Disease 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Von Willebrand disease is named for the Finnish internist Erik Adolf von Willebrand (1870-1949). In 1925 von Willebrand saw a 5-year-old patient from the Åland Islands in the Sea of Bothnia between Finland and Sweden. Four of her siblings had died from bleeding at an early age and both her mother and father came from families with histories of bleeding. Von Willebrand went to the Åland Islands and found that 23 of 66 family members had bleeding problems. In his report of the family in 1926, von Willebrand concluded that this was an unknown form of hemophilia. He called it pseudohemophilia. It is also known as vascular hemophilia and angiohemophilia.

A breach of the endothelium exposes platelet receptors to ligands that are components of the subendothelial matrix. These ligands include collagen, which binds to Gp Ia/IIa, and fibronectin and laminin (see p. 17), both of which bind to Gp Ic/IIa.

Activation The binding of these ligands-or of certain other agents (e.g., thrombin) that we will discuss belowtriggers a conformational change in the platelet receptors that initiates an intracellular signaling cascade, which leads to an exocytotic event known as the release reaction or platelet activation. The signal-transduction cascade involves the activation of phospholipase C (see p. 58) and an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Activated platelets exocytose the contents of their dense storage granules, which include ATP, ADP, serotonin, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Activated platelets also exocytose the contents of their $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ granules, which contain several proteins, including a host of growth factors and three hemostatic factors: vWF (see above) and two clotting factors that we will discuss below, clotting factor V and fibrinogen. Activated platelets also use cyclooxygenase (see pp. 62-64) to initiate the breakdown of arachidonic acid to thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$, which they release. Platelet activation is also associated with marked cytoskeletal and morphological changes as the platelet extends first a broad lamellipodium and then many finger-like filopodia.

Aggregation Signaling molecules released by activated platelets amplify the platelet activation response. ADP (which binds to P2Y12 receptors on platelets), serotonin, and thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ all activate additional platelets, and this recruitment promotes platelet aggregation. Aspirin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, inhibits clotting by reducing the release of thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$. Another antiplatelet agent-clopidogrel-acts by inhibiting the P2Y12 receptors on the platelet surface. As noted before, vWF released by activated platelets binds to the platelet receptor Gp Ib/la, thereby activating even more platelets and forming molecular bridges between platelets. Platelet activation also induces a conformational change in Gp IIb/IIIa, another platelet receptor, endowing it with the capacity to bind fibrinogen. Thus, as a result of the conformational change in Gp IIb/IIIa, the fibrinogen that is always present in blood forms bridges between platelets and participates in the formation of a platelet plug. As we will see below, when cleaved by thrombin, fibrinogen also plays a critical role in clotting.

## A controlled cascade of proteolysis creates a blood clot

A blood clot is a semisolid mass composed of both platelets and fibrin and-entrapped in the mesh of fibrinerythrocytes, leukocytes, and serum. A thrombus is also a blood clot, but the term is usually reserved for an intravascular clot. Thus, the blood clot formed at the site of a skin wound would usually not be called a thrombus. The relative composition of thrombi varies with the site of thrombosis (i.e., thrombus formation). A higher proportion of platelets is present in clots of the arterial circulation, whereas a higher proportion of fibrin is present in clots of the venous circulation.

Platelet plug formation and blood clotting are related but distinct events that may occur in parallel or in the absence of one other. As we will see below, activated platelets can release small amounts of some of the factors (e.g., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ) that play a role in blood clotting. Conversely, as we have already noted, some clotting factors (e.g., thrombin and fibrinogen) play a role in platelet plug formation. Thus, molecular crosstalk between the machinery involved in platelet plug formation and clot formation helps coordinate hemostasis.

The cardiovascular system normally maintains a precarious balance between two pathological states. On the one hand, inadequate clotting would lead to the leakage of blood from the vascular system and, ultimately, to hypovolemia. On the other hand, overactive clotting would lead to thrombosis and, ultimately, to cessation of blood flow. The cardiovascular system achieves this balance between an antithrombotic (anticoagulant) and a prothrombotic (procoagulant) state by a variety of components of the vascular wall and blood. Promoting an antithrombotic state is a normal layer of endothelial cells, which line all luminal surfaces of the vascular system. Promoting a prothrombotic state are events associated with vascular damage: (1) the failure of endothelial cells to produce the proper antithrombotic factors, and (2) the physical removal or injury of endothelial cells, which permits the blood to come into contact with thrombogenic factors that lie beneath the endothelium. Also promoting a prothrombotic state is the activation of platelets by any of the ligands that bind to platelet receptors, as discussed above. For instance, as platelets flow past artificial mechanical heart valves, the shearing forces can activate the platelets.

According to the classical view, two distinct sequences can precipitate coagulation: the intrinsic pathway and the extrinsic pathway. It is the intrinsic pathway that becomes activated when blood comes into contact with a negatively charged surface-in the laboratory we can mimic this process by putting blood into a glass test tube. The extrinsic pathway is activated when blood comes in contact with material from damaged cell membranes. In both cases, the precipitating event triggers a chain reaction that converts precursors into activated factors, which in turn catalyze the conversion of other precursors into other activated factors, and so on. Most of these "precursors" are zymogens that give rise to "activated factors" that are serine proteases. Thus, controlled proteolysis plays a central role in amplifying the clotting signals. However, the cascades do not occur in the fluid phase of the blood, where the concentration of each of these factors is low. In the case of the intrinsic pathway, the chain reaction occurs mainly at the membrane of activated platelets. In the case of the extrinsic pathway, the reactions occur mainly at a "tissue factor" that is membrane bound. Both pathways converge on a common pathway that culminates in generation of thrombin and, ultimately, "stable" fibrin. Table 18-4 provides the names, synonyms, and properties of the procoagulant and anticoagulant factors in various parts of the clotting scheme.

The proteins of the coagulation cascade have a distinct domain structure, including a signal peptide, a propeptide, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a kringle domain, and a catalytic domain, whereas some other domains are variable among these proteins. The signal peptide domain is required for the translocation of the polypeptide into the endoplasmic reticulum, where the signal peptide is

cleaved. The propeptide or $\gamma$-carboxyglutamic acid-rich domain (Gla domain) is rich in glutamic acid residues that undergo $\gamma$-carboxylation under the influence of the $\gamma$-carboxylase that requires vitamin $K$. The presence of these $\gamma$-carboxyglutamic acid residues is required for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding. The EGF-like domain may appear multiple times and play a role in forming protein complexes. The kringle domain is loop structure created by several disulfide bonds that also play a role in forming protein complexes and attaching the protease to its target. The catalytic domain confers the serine protease function to the coagulation proteins and is homologous to trypsin, chymotrypsin, and other serine proteases.

Intrinsic Pathway (Surface Contact Activation) The left branch of Figure 18-12 shows the intrinsic pathway, a cascade of protease reactions initiated by factors that are all present within blood. When in contact with a negatively charged surface such as glass or the membrane of an activated platelet, a plasma protein called factor XII (Hageman factor) can become factor XIIa-the suffix $a$ indicates that this is the activated form of factor XII. A molecule called high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), a product of platelets that may in fact be attached to the platelet membrane, helps anchor factor XII to the charged surface and thus serves as a cofactor. However, this HMWK-assisted conversion of factor XII to factor XIIa is limited in speed. Once a small amount of factor XIIa accumulates, this protease converts prekallikrein to kallikrein, with HMWK as an anchor. In turn, the newly produced kallikrein accelerates the conversion of factor XII to factor XIIa-an example of positive feedback. On pages 553-554, we see another example of an interaction between kallikreins and kininogens (e.g., HMWK), in which the proteolytic activity of kallikreins on kininogens leads to the release of small vasodilatory peptides called kinins.

In addition to amplifying its own generation by forming kallikrein, factor XIIa (together with HMWK) proteolyti-
cally cleaves factor XI to factor XIa. In turn, factor XIa (also bound to the charged surface by HMWK) proteolytically cleaves factor IX (Christmas factor) to factor IXa, which is a protease. Factor IXa and two downstream products of the cascade-factors Xa and, most important, thrombinproteolytically cleave factor VIII to factor VIIIa, a cofactor in the next reaction. Finally, factors IXa and VIIIa, together with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (which may come largely from activated platelets) and negatively charged phospholipids, form a trimolecular complex called tenase. Tenase then converts factor X (Stuart factor) to factor Xa, yet another protease.

Extrinsic Pathway (Tissue Factor Activation) The right branch of Figure 18-12 shows the extrinsic pathway, a cascade of protease reactions initiated by factors that are outside the vascular system. Nonvascular cells constitutively express an integral membrane protein called tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin, or factor III), which is a receptor for a plasma protein called factor VII. When an injury to the endothelium allows factor VII to come into contact with tissue factor, the tissue factor nonproteolytically activates factor VII to factor VIIa. Subsequently, tissue factor, factor VIIa, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ form a trimolecular complex analogous to tenase. Like tenase, the trimolecular complex of [tissue factor + factor $\mathrm{VIIa}+\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ] proteolytically cleaves the proenzyme factor X to factor Xa. An interesting feature is that when factor X binds to the trimolecular complex, factor VIIa undergoes a conformational change that prevents it from dissociating from tissue factor.

Regardless of whether factor Xa arises by the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway, the cascade proceeds along the common pathway.

Common Pathway Factor Xa from either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway is the first protease of the common pathway (center of Fig. 18-12). Reminiscent of the conversion of

![bo4285266204](bo4285266204.jpg)

factor VIII to the cofactor VIIIa in the intrinsic pathway, the downstream product thrombin clips factor V to form the cofactor Va. Factor V is highly homologous to factor VIII, and in both cases the proteolytic activation clips a single protein into two peptides that remain attached to one another. Factors Xa and Va, together with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phospholipids, form yet another trimolecular complex called prothrombinase. Prothrombinase acts on a plasma protein called prothrombin to form thrombin.

Thrombin is the central protease of the coagulation cascade, responsible for three major kinds of actions:

1. Activation of downstream components in the clotting cascade. The main action of thrombin is to catalyze the proteolysis of fibrinogen (see p. 429) by cleaving the A $\alpha$ chain, releasing fibrinopeptide A , and cleaving the $\mathrm{B} \beta$ chain, releasing fibrinopeptide B. The release of the fibrinopeptide results in the formation of fibrin monomers that are still soluble. Fibrin monomers now composed of $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ chains then spontaneously polymerize to form a gel of fibrin polymers that traps blood cells. Thrombin also activates factor XIII to factor XIIIa, which mediates
the covalent cross-linking of the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ chains of fibrin polymers to form a mesh called stable fibrin that is even less soluble than fibrin.
2. Positive feedback at several upstream levels of the cascade. Thrombin can catalyze the formation of new thrombin from prothrombin and can also catalyze the formation of the cofactors Va and VIIIa.
3. Paracrine actions that influence hemostasis. First, thrombin causes endothelial cells to release nitric oxide, prostaglandin $\mathrm{I}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PGI}_{2}\right)$, ADP, vWF, and tissue plasminogen activator (see below). Second, thrombin can activate platelets through PAR-1, a protease-activated receptor that belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (see pp. 51-52). Thus, thrombin is a key part of the molecular crosstalk introduced above between platelet activation and blood clotting, both of which are required for optimal clot formation. On the one hand, thrombin is a strong catalyst for platelet activation, and on the other hand, activated platelets offer the optimal surface for the intrinsic pathway leading to additional thrombin generation.

Coagulation as a Connected Diagram The concept of independent intrinsic and extrinsic branches converging on a common pathway is becoming obsolete. In such a "branching tree" (see p. 572), multiple branches converge to form larger downstream branches, eventually converging on a single "trunk"-with no crosstalk between branches. However, coagulation is best conceptualized as a "connected diagram" (see p. 572) in which the branches may interconnect in both the upstream and downstream directions. One example of interconnections is thrombin's multiple actions just discussed. Another example is the trimolecular complex of [tissue factor + factor VIIa $\left.+\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ of the extrinsic pathway, which activates factors IX and XI of the intrinsic pathway. In the other direction, factors IXa and Xa of the intrinsic pathway can activate factor VII of the extrinsic pathway. Thus, the intrinsic pathway and extrinsic pathway are strongly interconnected to form a network.

What parts of this network are most important for coagulation in vivo? Clinical evidence suggests that coagulation depends largely on the extrinsic pathway. Although tissue factor is normally absent from intravascular cells, inflammation can trigger peripheral blood monocytes and endothelial cells to express tissue factor, which increases the risk of coagulation. Indeed, during sepsis, the tissue factor
produced by circulating monocytes initiates intravascular thrombosis. (5) N18-6

## Anticoagulants keep the clotting network in check

Thus far, our discussion has focused on the coagulation cascade and attendant positive feedback. Just as important are the mechanisms that prevent hemostasis from running out of control. Endothelial cells are the main sources of the agents that help maintain normal blood fluidity. These agents are of two general types, paracrine factors and anticoagulant factors.

Paracrine Factors Endothelial cells generate prostacyclin (PGI ${ }_{2}$; see p. 64), which promotes vasodilation (see Table 20-8) and thus blood flow and also inhibits platelet activation and thus clotting. Stimulated by thrombin, endothelial cells also produce nitric oxide (see pp. 66-67). Through cGMP, nitric oxide inhibits platelet adhesion and aggregation.

Anticoagulant Factors As summarized in Figure 18-13, endothelial cells also generate anticoagulant factors that interfere with the clotting cascade that generates fibrin. Table 18-4 lists these factors.

# N18-6 Hemophilias 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Deficiencies of certain factors affect coagulation. Hemophilia A (the most common form of hemophilia) is caused by a deficiency in factor VIII:C. The gene for factor VIII is located on the $X$ chromosome, which explains why females are carriers of hemophilia A, whereas males present with the disease.

Hemophilia B or Christmas disease is caused by a deficiency in factor IX. The very mild Hemophilia $\mathbf{C}$ is caused by a deficiency in factor XI.

A genetic deficiency of a particular factor does not always result in a clotting defect, however. For instance, factor V as a component of the prothrombinase complex is a procoagulant factor. However, factor V also participates in the inactivation of activated factor VIII (FVIIIa). As a result mutations in factor V gene may produce either hemorrhagic or thrombotic phenotypes. The most common thrombophilic mutation is the factor V Leiden mutation in which factor V is resistant to degradation by activated protein C. The mutation is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism.

1. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). TFPI is a plasma protein that binds to the trimolecular complex [tissue factor + factor VIIa $+\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ] in the extrinsic pathway and blocks the protease activity of factor VIIa. TFPI is glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linked (see p. 32) to the endothelial cell membrane, where it maintains an antithrombotic surface.
2. Antithrombin III (AT III). AT III binds to and inhibits factor Xa and thrombin. The sulfated glycosaminoglycans (see p. 39) heparan sulfate and heparin enhance the binding of AT III to factor Xa or to thrombin, thus inhibiting coagulation. Heparan sulfate is present on the external surface of most cells, including endothelial surfaces. Mast cells and basophils release heparin.
3. Thrombomodulin. A glycosaminoglycan product of endothelial cells, thrombomodulin can form a complex with thrombin, thereby removing thrombin from the circulation and inhibiting coagulation. In addition, thrombomodulin also binds protein C.
4. Protein C. After protein C binds to the thrombomodulin portion of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, the thrombin activates protein C. Activated protein $\mathrm{C}\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$ is a protease. Together with its cofactor protein S, activated protein C inactivates the cofactors Va and VIIIa, thus inhibiting coagulation.
5. Protein S. This is the cofactor of protein C and is thus an anticoagulant.

Finally, clearance of activated clotting factors by the Kupffer cells of the liver also keeps hemostasis under control.

## Fibrinolysis breaks up clots

As noted on page 429, cross-linked stable fibrin traps RBCs and WBCs as well as platelets in a freshly formed thrombus.

Through the interaction of actin and myosin in the platelets, the clot shrinks to a plug and thereby expels serum. After plug formation, fibrinolysis-the breakdown of stable fibrin—breaks up the clot in a more general process known as thrombolysis. As shown in Figure 18-14, the process of fibrinolysis begins with the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, catalyzed by one of two activators: tissue-type plasminogen activator or urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Table 18-5 summarizes the properties of fibrinolytic factors.

The source of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), a serine protease, is endothelial cells. t-PA consists of a single peptide chain with two kringles at the N -terminal portion of the molecule and a protease motif in the C-terminal portion. Kringles are loop structures created by three disulfide bonds and serve to anchor the molecule to its substrate. t-PA converts the plasma zymogen plasminogen to the active fibrinolytic protease plasmin. The presence of fibrin greatly accelerates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.

Besides t-PA, the other plasminogen activator, urokinasetype plasminogen activator (u-PA), is present in plasma either as a single-chain protein or as the two-chain product of a proteolytic cleavage. Like t-PA, u-PA converts plasminogen to the active protease plasmin. However, this

proteolysis requires that u-PA attach to a receptor on the cell surface called urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR).

Plasminogen, mainly made by the liver, is a large, singlechain glycoprotein that is composed of an N -terminal heavy chain (A chain) and a C-terminal light chain (B chain). The N -terminal heavy chain contains five kringles, and the C-terminal light chain contains the protease domain. t-PA cleaves plasminogen at the junction between the heavy and light chains, yielding plasmin. However, the two chains in plasmin remain connected by disulfide bonds.

Plasmin is a serine protease that can break down both fibrin and fibrinogen. The five kringles of the heavy chain of plasminogen are still present in plasmin. These anchors attach to lysine residues on fibrin, holding the protease portion of the molecule in place to promote hydrolysis. Plasmin proteolytically cleaves stable fibrin to fibrin breakdown products. Plasmin can also cleave t-PA between the kringle and protease motifs of t-PA. The C terminus of single-chain t-PA nonetheless retains its protease activity.

The cardiovascular system regulates fibrinolysis at several levels, using both enhancing and inhibitory mechanisms. Catecholamines and bradykinin increase the levels of circulating t-PA. Two serine protease inhibitors (serpins) reduce
the activity of the plasminogen activators: plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2). PAI-1 complexes with and inhibits both single-chain and two-chain t-PA as well as u-PA. PAI-1 is produced mainly by endothelial cells. PAI-2 mainly inhibits u-PA. PAI-2 is important in pregnancy because it is produced by the placenta and may contribute to increased risk of thrombosis in pregnancy.

It is of interest that activated protein C, which inhibits coagulation as shown in Figure 18-13, also inhibits PAI-1 and PAI-2, thereby facilitating fibrinolysis. Only one serpin targets plasmin, $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{2}$-antiplasmin $\left(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{2}-\mathrm{AP}\right)$ made by liver, kidney, and other tissues. When plasmin is not bound to fibrin (i.e., when the plasmin is in free solution), $\alpha_{2}-\mathrm{AP}$ complexes with and thereby readily inactivates plasmin. However, when plasmin is attached to lysine residues on fibrin, the inhibition by $\alpha_{2}$-AP is greatly reduced. In other words, the very presence of a clot (i.e., fibrin) promotes the breakdown of the clot (i.e., fibrinolysis).

# ARTERIES AND VEINS 

Emile L. Boulpaep

## ARTERIAL DISTRIBUTION AND VENOUS COLLECTION SYSTEMS

Hemodynamics is the study of the physical laws of blood circulation. It therefore addresses the properties of both the "content" (i.e., blood) and the "container" (i.e., blood vessels). In Chapter 18, we discussed the properties of the blood. This chapter is primarily concerned with the properties of the blood vessels. The circulation is not a system of rigid tubes. Moreover, the anatomy and functions of the various segments of the vasculature differ greatly from one to another. Because the function of the circulation is to carry substances all over the body, the circulatory system branches out into a network of billions of tiny capillaries. We can think of the arteries as a distribution system, the microcirculation as a diffusion and filtration system, and the veins as a collection system.

## Physical properties of vessels closely follow the level of branching in the circuit

The aorta branches out into billions of capillaries that ultimately regroup into a single vena cava (Fig. 19-1, panel 1). At each level of arborization of the peripheral circulation, the values of several key parameters vary dramatically:

1. Number of vessels at each level of arborization
2. Radius of a typical individual vessel
3. Aggregate cross-sectional area of all vessels at that level
4. Mean linear velocity of blood flow within an individual vessel
5. Flow (i.e., volume per second) through a single vessel
6. Relative blood volume (i.e., the fraction of the body's total blood volume present in all vessels of a given level)
7. Circulation (i.e., transit) time between two points of the circuit
8. Pressure profile along that portion of the circuit
9. Structure of the vascular walls
10. Elastic properties of the vascular walls

We discuss parameters 1 to 5 in this section and parameters 6 to 8 in the following two sections. Parameters 9 and 10 are the subject of the second subchapter.

The number of vessels at a particular level of arborization (Table 19-1) increases enormously from a single aorta to
$\sim 10^{4}$ small arteries, $\sim 10^{7}$ arterioles, and finally $\sim 4 \times 10^{10}$ capillaries. However, only about one fourth of all capillaries are normally open to flow at rest. Finally, all of the blood returns to a single vessel where the superior and inferior venae cavae join.

The radius of an individual vessel ( $r_{i}$; see Table 19-1) declines as a result of the arborization, decreasing from 1.1 cm in the aorta to a minimum of $\sim 3 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in the smallest capillaries. Because the cross-sectional area of an individual vessel is proportional to the square of the radius, this parameter decreases even more precipitously.

The aggregate cross-sectional area (see Table 19-1) at any level of branching is the sum of the single cross-sectional areas of all parallel vessels at that level of branching. That is, it is the area that you would see if you sliced through all of the vessels at the same level of branching in panel 1 of Figure 19-1.

A fundamental law of vessel branching is that at each branch point, the combined cross-sectional area of daughter vessels exceeds the cross-sectional area of the parent vessel. In this process of bifurcation, the steepest increase in total cross-sectional area occurs in the microcirculation (see Fig. 19-1, panel 2). A typical microcirculation in the smooth muscle and submucosa of the intestine (Fig. 19-2) encompasses a first-order arteriole, several orders of progressively smaller arterioles, capillaries, several orders of venules into which the capillaries empty, and eventually a first-order venule. In humans, the maximum cross-sectional area occurs not at the level of the capillaries, but at the "postcapillary" (i.e., fourth-order) venules. Because of anastomoses among capillaries, capillaries only slightly outnumber fourth-order venules, whereas the cross-sectional unit area of each venule is appreciably greater than the area of a capillary. Assuming that only a quarter of the capillaries are usually open, the peak aggregate cross-sectional area of these postcapillary venules can be $\sim 1000$-fold greater than the cross section of the parent artery (e.g., aorta), as shown in panel 2 of Figure 19-1.

The profile of the mean linear velocity of flow $(\bar{v})$ along a vascular circuit (see Fig. 19-1, panel 3) is roughly a mirror image of the profile of the total cross-sectional area. According to the principle of continuity, which is an application of conservation of mass, total volume flow of blood must be the same at any level of arborization. Indeed, as we

Figure 19-1 Profile of key parameters along the cardiovascular system. Panel 1 (top) shows branching of the cardiovascular system, from left side to right side of heart and back to left. Panel 2 shows the variation of aggregate cross-sectional area of all vessels at any level of branching. Panel 3 shows how mean linear velocity of blood varies in typical vessels. Panel 4 shows ways of grouping blood volume in various compartments. Panel 5 shows profile of blood pressure, with superimposed oscillations that represent variations in time.
make multiple vertical slices along the x -axis of panel 1 in Figure 19-1, the aggregate flow for each slice is the same:

$$
F_{\text {total }}=\underbrace{A_{1} \cdot \bar{v}_{1}}_{\text {Level } 1}=\underbrace{A_{2} \cdot \bar{v}_{2}}_{\text {Level } 2}=\underbrace{A_{3} \cdot \bar{v}_{3}}_{\text {Level } 3}=\ldots
$$

As a consequence, $\bar{v}$ must be minimal in the postcapillary venules $(\sim 0.03 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s})$, where $A_{\text {total }}$ is maximal. Conversely, $\bar{v}$ is maximal in the aorta ( $\sim 20$ to $50 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$ ). Thus, both $A_{\text {total }}$ and $\bar{v}$ values range $\sim 1000$-fold from the aorta to the capillaries but are inversely related to one another. The vena cava, with a cross-sectional area $\sim 50 \%$ larger than that of the aorta, has a mean linear velocity that is about one third less.

Single-vessel flow, in contrast to total flow, varies by $\sim 10$ orders of magnitude. In the aorta, the flow is $\sim 83 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{s}$, the same as the cardiac output ( $\sim 5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ ). When about $25 \%$ of the capillaries are open, a typical capillary has a mean linear velocity of $0.03 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$ and a flow of $8 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{s}(8 \mathrm{pL} / \mathrm{s})-10$ orders of magnitude less than the flow in the aorta. Within the microcirculation, single-vessel flow has considerable range. At one extreme, a first-order arteriole ( $r_{1} \sim 30 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ) may have a flow of $20 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{s}$. At the other, the capillaries that are closed at any given time have zero flow.

## Most of the blood volume resides in the systemic veins

The body's total blood volume $(V)$ of about 5 L (see Table $5-1$ ) is not uniformly distributed along the x -axis of panel 1 in Figure 19-1. At any level of branching, the total blood volume is the sum of the volumes of all parallel branches. Table 19-2 summarizes-for a hypothetical 70-kg womanthe distribution of total blood volume expressed as both absolute blood volumes and relative blood volumes (percentage of total blood volume). Panel 4 in Figure 19-1 summarizes four useful ways of grouping these volumes.

First, we can divide the blood volume into the systemic circulation (where $\sim 85 \%$ of blood resides), the pulmonary circulation ( $\sim 10 \%$ ), and the heart chambers ( $\sim 5 \%$ ). The pulmonary blood volume is quite adjustable (i.e., it can be much higher than $10 \%$ ) and is carefully regulated.

Second, as can be seen in the next section, we can divide blood volume into what is contained in the high-pressure system ( $\sim 15 \%$ ), the low-pressure system ( $\sim 80 \%$ ), and the heart chambers ( $\sim 5 \%$ ).

Third, we can group the blood volumes into those in the systemic venous system versus the remainder of the circulation. Of the $85 \%$ of the total blood volume that resides in the systemic circulation, about three fourths-or $65 \%$ of the total-is on the venous side, particularly in the smaller veins. Thus, the venous system acts as a volume reservoir. Changes in the diameters of veins have a major impact on the amount

of blood they contain. For example, an abrupt increase in venous capacity causes pooling of blood in venous segments and may lead to syncope (i.e., fainting).

We can also use a fourth approach for grouping of blood volumes-divide the blood into the central blood volume (volumes of heart chambers and pulmonary circulation) versus the rest of the circulation. This central blood volume is very adjustable, and it constitutes the filling reservoir for the left heart. Left-sided heart failure can cause the normally careful regulation of the central blood volume to break down.

The circulation time is the time required for a bolus of blood to travel either across the entire length of the circulation or across a particular vascular bed. Total circulation time (the time to go from left to right across panel 1 in Fig. 19-1) is $\sim 1$ minute. Circulation time across a single vascular bed (e.g., coronary circulation) may be as short as 10 seconds. Circulation times may be obtained in humans by injection of a substance such as ether into an antecubital vein and measurement of the time to its appearance in the lung ( 4 to 8 seconds), or by injection of a bitter or sweet substance and

measurement of the time to the perception of taste in the tongue ( 10 to 18 seconds). Although, in the past, circulation time was used clinically as an index of cardiac output, the measurement has little physiological significance. The rationale for determination of circulation time was that a shortening of circulation time could signify an improvement of cardiac output. However, the interpretation is more complicated, because circulation time is actually the ratio of blood volume to blood flow:

$$
\begin{gathered}
t=\frac{V}{F} \\
\text { Units: } \mathrm{s}=\frac{\mathrm{mL}}{\mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{s}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Changes in circulation time may thus reflect changes in volume as well as in flow. For instance, a patient in heart failure may have a decreased cardiac output (i.e., $F$ ) or an increased blood volume (i.e., $V$ ), either of which would contribute to an elevation of transit time.

## The intravascular pressures along the systemic circuit are higher than those along the pulmonary circuit

Panel 5 in Figure 19-1 shows the profile of pressure along the systemic and pulmonary circulations. Pressures are far higher in the systemic than in the pulmonary circulation. Although the cardiac outputs of the left and right hearts are the same in the steady state, the total resistance of the systemic circulation is far higher than that of the pulmonary circulation (see pp. 683-684). This difference explains why

## A SYSTEMIC CIRCULATION

![bo4785266204](bo4785266204.jpg)
the upstream driving pressure averages $\sim 95 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in the systemic circulation but only $\sim 15 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in the pulmonary circulation. Table 19-3 summarizes typical mean values at key locations in the circulation. In both the systemic and pulmonary circulations, the systolic and diastolic pressures decay downstream from the ventricles (Fig. 19-3). The instantaneous pressures vary throughout each cardiac cycle for much of the circulatory system (see Fig. 19-1, panel 5). In addition, the systemic venous and pulmonary pressures vary with the respiratory cycle, and venous pressure in the lower limbs varies with the contraction of skeletal muscle.

As noted above, the circulation can be divided into a high-pressure and a low-pressure system. The high-pressure system extends from the left ventricle in the contracted state all the way to the systemic arterioles. The low-pressure

system extends from the systemic capillaries, through the rest of the systemic circuit, into the right heart, and then through the pulmonary circuit into the left heart in the relaxed state. The pulmonary circuit, unlike the systemic circuit, is entirely a low-pressure system; mean arterial pressures normally do not exceed 15 mm Hg , and the capillary pressures do not rise above 10 mm Hg .

## Under normal conditions, the steepest pressure drop in the systemic circulation occurs in arterioles, the site of greatest vascular resistance

If we assume for simplicity's sake that the left heart behaves like a constant pressure generator of 95 mm Hg and the right heart behaves like a constant pressure generator of 15 mm Hg , it is the resistance of each vascular segment that determines the profile of pressure fall between the upstream arterial and downstream venous ends of the circulation. In particular, the pressure difference between two points along the axis of the vessel (i.e., the driving pressure difference, $\Delta P$ ) depends on flow and resistance: $\Delta P=F \cdot R$ (see p. 412). According to Poiseuille's law (see p. 415), the resistance $\left(R_{c}\right)$ of an individual, unbranched vascular segment is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius. Thus, the pressure drop between any two points along the circuit depends critically on the diameter of the vessels between these two points. However, the steepest pressure drop $(\Delta P / \Delta x)$ does not occur along the capillaries, where vessel diameters are smallest, but rather along the precapillary arterioles. Why? The aggregate resistance contributed by vessels of a particular order of arborization depends not only on their average radius but also on the number of vessels in parallel. N19-1 The more vessels in parallel, the smaller the aggregate resistance (see Equation 19-3). Although the resistance of a single capillary exceeds that of a single arteriole, capillaries far outnumber arterioles (Table 19-4). The result is that the aggregate resistance is larger in the arterioles, and this is where the steepest $\Delta P$ occurs.

## Local intravascular pressure depends on the distribution of vascular resistance

We have just seen that the $\Delta P$ between an upstream checkpoint and a downstream checkpoint depends on the resistance between these points. What determines the absolute

pressure at some location between the two checkpoints? To answer this question, we need to know not only the upstream arterial and downstream venous pressures but also the distribution of resistance between the two checkpoints. A good example to explain this concept is the distribution of resistance and pressure in the systemic microvasculature. Just how the upstream pressure in the arteriole and the downstream pressure in the venule affect the pressure at the midpoint of the capillary $\left(P_{c}\right)$ depends on the relative size of the upstream and downstream resistances. For the simple circuit illustrated in Figure 19-4A, N19-2

$$
P_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right) \cdot P_{\mathrm{e}}+P_{\mathrm{c}}}{1+\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right)}
$$

where $P_{\mathrm{e}}$ is arteriolar pressure, $P_{\mathrm{c}}$ is venular pressure, $R_{\text {pre }}$ is precapillary resistance upstream of the capillary bed, and $R_{\text {post }}$ is postcapillary resistance downstream of the capillary.

From this equation, we can draw three conclusions about local microvascular pressure. First, even though arteriolar pressure is 60 mm Hg and venular pressure is 15 mm Hg in our example (see Table 19-3), capillary pressure is not necessarily 37.5 mm Hg , the arithmetic mean. According to Equation 19-3, $P_{c}$ would be the arithmetic mean only if the precapillary and postcapillary resistances were identical (i.e., $R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}=1$ ).

## N19-1 Relative Resistance of Arterioles Versus Capillaries

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

In Chapter 17, we introduced the concept of how to compute the aggregate resistance of a group of blood vessels (or resistors) arranged in parallel. We used Equation 17-3, shown here as Equation NE 19-1:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text {total }}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}+\ldots
$$

If we assume that each of $N$ parallel branches has the same resistance $R_{i}$ (i.e., $R_{i}=R_{1}=R_{2}=R_{3}=R_{4}=\ldots$ ), then the overall resistance is

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text {total }}}=\frac{1}{R_{i}}+\frac{1}{R_{i}}+\frac{1}{R_{i}}+\ldots=\frac{N}{R_{i}}
$$

Thus,

$$
R_{\text {total }}=\frac{R_{i}}{N}
$$

If the aorta gives rise to $10^{7}$ arterioles (the $N$ in the above equations), each with a resistance $(R_{i})$ of $15 \times 10^{7}$ dyne $\mathrm{s} / \mathrm{cm}^{5}$, then the total resistance of all the arterioles would be 15 dyne $\mathrm{s} / \mathrm{cm}^{5}$ :

$$
R_{\text {total }}=\frac{R_{i}}{N}=\frac{15 \times 10^{7}}{10^{7}}=15 \text { dyne } \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{cm}^{5}
$$

If the same aorta gives rise to $3000 \times 10^{7}$ capillaries $(N)$, each with a resistance $(R)$ of $1 \times 10^{10}$ dyne $\mathrm{s} / \mathrm{cm}^{5}$, then the total resistance of all the capillaries would be 3 dyne $\mathrm{s} / \mathrm{cm}^{5}$ :

$$
R_{\text {total }}=\frac{R_{i}}{N}=\frac{3000 \times 10^{7}}{10^{10}}=3 \text { dyne } \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{cm}^{5}
$$

Thus, because the capillaries vastly outnumber the arterioles, their aggregate resistance is less, even though their unit resistance is considerably greater.

## N19-2 Derivation of Equation for Midcapillary Pressure

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

On page 451 of the text, we present Equation 19-3 (shown here as Equation NE 19-6)

$$
P_{c}=\frac{\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right) \cdot P_{a}+P_{c}}{1+\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right)}
$$

The capillary pressure $\left(P_{c}\right)$ depends on arteriolar pressure $\left(P_{a}\right)$, venular pressure $\left(P_{v}\right)$, the precapillary resistance upstream of the capillary bed $\left(R_{\text {pre }}\right)$, and the postcapillary resistance downstream of the capillary $\left(R_{\text {post }}\right)$. This equation describes the hydrodynamic equivalent of the electrical voltage drop ("voltage divider") across each of two resistances in series, such as the pair of resistors shown in Figure 19-4A.

Because of conservation of flow along the vascular circuit, the flow $(F)$ across $R_{\text {pre }}$ and $R_{\text {post }}$ is, by definition, the same. For each of the two resistive elements, Ohm's law of hydrodynamics (see Equation 17-1) states that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P_{a}-P_{c}=F \cdot R_{\text {pre }} \\
& \text { (NE 19-7) } \\
& P_{v}-P_{c}=F \cdot R_{\text {post }}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, because $F$ is identical in Equations NE 19-7 and NE 19-8,

$$
\left(P_{a}-P_{c}\right) / R_{\text {pre }}=\left(P_{c}-P_{v}\right) / R_{\text {post }}
$$

Solving for $P_{c}$ in the above equation, we get the following:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right)\left(P_{a}-P_{c}\right)=\left(P_{a}-P_{v}\right) \\
\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right) P_{a}-\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right) P_{v}+P_{a}=P_{a} \\
\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right) P_{a}+P_{v}=P_{a}+\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right) P_{a} \\
\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right) P_{a}+P_{v}=P_{a}\left[1+\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right)\right] \\
\left\{\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right) P_{a}+P_{v}\right\}\left[1+\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}\right)\right]=P_{a}
\end{gathered}
$$

(NE 19-10)

The last in the preceding set of equations is a simple rearrangement of Equation NE 19-6 above.

vascular beds (see Fig. 19-4A) implies that $R_{\text {pre }}$ exceeds $R_{\text {post }}$ (i.e., $R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}<1$ ). Under normal conditions in most microvascular beds, $R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}$ ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 .

The second implication of Equation 19-3 is that as long as the sum $\left(R_{\text {pre }}+R_{\text {post }}\right)$ is constant, reciprocal changes in $R_{\text {pre }}$ and $R_{\text {post }}$ would not alter the total resistance of the circuit and would therefore leave both $P_{x}$ and $P_{y}$ constant. However, as $R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}$ increases, $P_{y}$ would increase, thereby approaching $P_{x}$ (see Fig. 19-4B). Conversely, as $R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}$ decreases, $P_{y}$ would decrease, approaching $P_{x}$ (see Fig. 19-4C). This conclusion is also intuitive. If we reduced $R_{\text {pre }}$ to zero (but increased $R_{\text {post }}$ to keep $R_{\text {post }}+R_{\text {pre }}$ constant), no pressure drop would occur along the precapillary vessels, and $P_{y}$ would be the same as $P_{x}$. Conversely, if $R_{\text {post }}$ were zero, $P_{y}$ would be the same as $P_{x}$.

The third conclusion from Equation 19-3 is that, depending on the value of $R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}, P_{y}$ may be more sensitive to changes in arteriolar than in venular pressure, or vice versa. For example, when the ratio $R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}$ is low (i.e., $R_{\text {pre }}>R_{\text {post }}$, as in Fig. 19-4A or C), capillary pressure tends to follow the downstream pressure in large veins. This phenomenon explains why standing may cause the ankles to swell. The elevated pressure in large leg veins translates to an increased $P_{x}$, which, as discussed below, leads to increased transudation of fluid from the capillaries into the interstitial spaces (see pp. 467-468). It also explains why elevation of the feet, which lowers the pressure in the large veins, reverses ankle edema.

Vascular resistance varies in time and depends critically on the action of vascular smooth-muscle cells. The major site of control of vascular resistance in the systemic circulation is the terminal small arteries (or feed arteries) and arterioles. Figure 19-5 illustrates the effect of vasoconstriction or vasodilation on the pressure profile. Whereas the overall $\Delta P$ between source and end point may not vary appreciably during a change in vascular resistance, the shape of the local pressure profile may change appreciably. Thus, during arteriolar constriction, the pressure drop between two points along the circuit (i.e., axial pressure gradient, $\Delta P / \Delta x$ ) is steep and concentrated at the arteriolar site (see Fig. 19-5, green curve). During arteriolar dilation, the gradient is shallow and more spread out (see Fig. 19-5, violet curve).

Although the effects of vasoconstriction and vasodilation are greatest in the local arterioles (lighter red band in Fig. 19-5), the effects extend both upstream (darker red band) and downstream (purple and blue bands) from the site of vasomotion because the pressure profile along the vessel depends on the resistance profile. Thus, if one vascular element contributes a greater fraction of the total resistance, a greater fraction of the pressure drop will occur along that element.

## ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF BLOOD VESSELS

## Blood vessels are elastic tubes

The walls of blood vessels consist of three layers: the intima, the media, and the adventitia. Capillaries, which have only an intimal layer of endothelial cells resting on a basal lamina, are the exception. Regardless of the organization of layers, one can distinguish four building blocks that make up the vascular wall: endothelial cells, elastic fibers, collagen fibers,
![bo5285266204](bo5285266204.jpg)

Figure 19-5 Pressure profiles during vasomotion. In this example, we assume that constriction or dilation of terminal arteries and arterioles does not affect the overall driving pressure $(\Delta P)$ between aorta and vena cava. This assumption is reasonable in two cases: (1) vasoconstriction or vasodilation is confined to a single parallel vascular bed (e.g., one limb) and does not substantially change total peripheral resistance; and (2) even if total peripheral resistance does change, the cardiac pump still maintains constant systemic arterial and venous pressures.
and smooth-muscle cells. Figure 19-6 shows how the relative abundance of these components varies throughout the vascular circuit. In addition to these principal components, fibroblasts, nerve endings, and blood cells invade the intima; other extracellular components (e.g., proteoglycans) may also be present.

Endothelial cells form a single, continuous layer that lines all vascular segments. Junctional complexes keep the endothelial cells together in arteries but are less numerous in veins. The organization of the endothelial cell layer in capillaries varies greatly, depending on the organ (see p. 461). The glomus bodies in the skin and elsewhere are unusual in that their "endothelial cells" exist in multiple layers of cells called myoepithelioid cells. These glomus bodies control small arteriovenous shunts or anastomoses (see p. 570).

Elastic fibers are a rubber-like material that accounts for most of the stretch of vessels at normal pressures as well as the stretch of other tissues (e.g., lungs). Elastic fibers have two components: a core of elastin and a covering of microfibrils. The elastin core consists of a highly insoluble polymer of elastin, a protein rich in nonpolar amino acids (i.e., glycine, alanine, valine, proline). After being secreted into the extracellular space, the elastin molecules remain in a random-coil configuration. They covalently cross-link and assemble into a highly elastic network of fibers, capable of stretching more than $100 \%$ under physiological conditions. The microfibrils, which are composed of glycoproteins and have a diameter of $\sim 10 \mathrm{~nm}$, are similar to those found in the extracellular matrix in other tissues. In arteries, elastic fibers are arranged as concentric, cylindrical lamellae. A network

![bo5385266204](bo5385266204.jpg)

Figure 19-6 Structure of blood vessels. The values for medium arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins are merely illustrative because the dimensions can range widely. The drawings of the vessels are not to scale.
of elastic fibers is abundant everywhere except in the true capillaries, in the venules, and in the aforementioned arteriovenous anastomoses.

Collagen fibers constitute a jacket of far less extensible material than the elastic fibers, like the fabric woven inside the wall of a rubber hose. Collagen can be stretched only 3\% to $4 \%$ under physiological conditions. The basic unit of the collagen fibers in blood vessels is composed of type I and type III collagen molecules, which are two of the fibrillar collagens. After being secreted, these triple-helical molecules assemble into fibrils that may be 10 to 300 nm in diameter; these in turn aggregate into collagen fibers that may be several microns in diameter and are visible with a light microscope. Collagen fibers are present throughout the circulation except in the capillaries. Collagen and elastic fibers form a network that is arranged more loosely toward the inner surface of the vessel than at the outer surface. Collagen fibers are usually attached to the other components of the vascular wall with some slack, so that they are normally not under tension. Stretching of these other components may take up the slack on the collagen fibers, which may then contribute to the overall tension.

Vascular smooth-muscle cells (VSMCs) are also present in all vascular segments except the capillaries. In elastic arteries, VSMCs are arranged in spirals with pitch varying from nearly longitudinal to nearly transverse-circular; whereas in muscular arteries, they are arranged either in concentric rings or as helices with a low pitch. Relaxed VSMCs do not contribute appreciably to the elastic tension of the vascular wall, which is mainly determined by the elastin and collagen fibers. VSMCs exert tension primarily by means of active contraction (see pp. 238-240 and 459).

## Because of the elastic properties of vessels, the pressure-flow relationship of passive vascular beds is nonlinear

Because blood vessels are elastic, we must revise our concept of blood flow, which was based on Poiseuille's law for rigid tubes (see p. 415). Poiseuille's law predicts a linear pressureflow relationship (Fig. 19-7A, broken line). However, in reality, the pressure-flow relationship is markedly nonlinear in an in vivo preparation of a vascular bed (see Fig. 19-7A, red curve). Starting at the foot of the red curve at a driving pressure of about 6 mm Hg , we see that the curve rises more steeply as the driving pressure increases. The reason is that increase of the driving pressure (i.e., axial pressure gradient) also increases the transmural pressure, causing the vessel to distend. Because radius increases, resistance falls and flow rises more than it would in a rigid tube. Thus, the plot curves upward. The elastic properties of vessels are the major cause of such nonlinear pressure-flow relationships in vascular beds exhibiting little or no "active tension."

As driving pressure-and thus transmural pressureincreases, vessel radius increases as well, causing resistance (see p. 415) to fall (see Fig. 19-7B, red curve). Conversely, resistance increases toward infinity when driving pressure falls. In Poiseuille's case, of course, resistance would be constant (see Fig. 19-7B, broken line), regardless of the driving pressure. Although many vascular beds behave like the red curves in Figure 19-7A and B, we will see in Chapter 24 that some are highly regulated (i.e., active tension varies with pressure). These special circulations therefore exhibit a pressure-flow relationship that differs substantially from that of a system of elastic tubes.

Figure 19-7 Nonlinear relationships among pressure, flow, and resistance. (3) N19-8

## Contraction of smooth muscle halts blood flow when driving pressure falls below the critical closing pressure

As we have already seen, at low values of driving pressure, resistance rises abruptly toward infinity (see Fig. 19-7B, red curve). Viewed differently, flow totally ceases when the pressure falls below about 6 mm Hg , the critical closing pressure (see Fig. 19-7A, red curve). The stoppage of flow occurs because of the combined action of elastic fibers and active tension from VSMCs. Graded increases in active tensionproduced, for example, by sympathetic stimulation-shift the pressure-flow relationship to the right and decrease the slope (see Fig. 19-7A, blue and green curves), which reflects an increase in resistance over the entire pressure range (see Fig. 19-7B, blue and green curves). The critical closing pressure also shifts upward with increasing degrees of vasomotor tone. This phenomenon is important in hypotensive shock, in which massive vasoconstriction occurs-in an attempt to raise arterial pressure-and critical closing pressures rise to

40 mm Hg or more. As a result, blood flow can stop completely in the limb of a patient in hypotensive shock, despite the persistence of a finite, albeit small, pressure difference between the main artery and vein.

## Elastic and collagen fibers determine the distensibility and compliance of vessels

Arteries and veins must withstand very different transmural pressures in vivo (see Table 19-3). Moreover, their relative blood volumes respond in strikingly different ways to increases in transmural pressure (Fig. 19-8). Arteries have a low volume capacity but can withstand large transmural pressure differences. In contrast, veins have a large volume capacity (and are thus able to act as blood reservoirs) but can withstand only small transmural pressure differences.

The abundance of structural elements in the vascular walls also differs between arteries and veins (see Fig. 19-6). These disparities contribute to differences in the elastic behavior of arteries and veins. We can study the elastic properties of an isolated blood vessel either by recording the "static" volume change produced by pressurizing the vessel to different levels or, conversely, by recording the "static" pressure change produced by filling the vessel with liquid to different volumes. After the pressure or volume is recorded experimentally, it is important to wait until the vessel has finished responding (i.e., it becomes static) before the measurements are recorded.

The volume distensibility expresses the elastic properties of blood vessels. Three measurements are useful for assessment of distensibility. First, the absolute distensibility is the change in volume for a macroscopic step change in pressure, $\Delta V / \Delta P$. Second, because the unstretched size varies among vessels, it is preferable to normalize the volume change to the initial, unstretched volume $\left(V_{0}\right)$ and thus to use a normalized distensibility instead:

$$
\text { Normalized distensibility }=\frac{\left(\Delta V / V_{0}\right)}{\Delta P}
$$

This ratio is a measurement of the fractional change in volume with a given step in pressure. Third, the most useful index of distensibility is compliance ( $C$ ), which is the slope of the tangent to any point along the pressure-volume diagram in Figure 19-8:

$$
C=\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta P}
$$

Here, the $\Delta V$ and $\Delta P$ values are minute displacements. The steeper the slope of a pressure-volume diagram, the greater the compliance (i.e., the easier it is to increase volume). In Figure 19-8, the slope-and thus the compliancedecreases with increasing volumes. For such a nonlinear relationship, this variable compliance is the slope of the tangent to the curve at any point. Thus, a compliance reading should always include the transmural pressure or the volume at which it was made. Similar principles apply to the compliance of airways in the lung (see p. 610).

# N19-8 Nonlinear Relationships Among Pressure, Flow, and Resistance 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In Figure 19-7A, the broken line shows the theoretical pressure-flow relationship for a rigid tube-flow is directly proportional to driving pressure. For a real vascular bed (red curve), the relationship is nonlinear. First, the curve does not pass through the origin (i.e., flow is zero until driving pressure exceeds critical closing pressure). Second, the curve bends upward because increased transmural pressure widens the vessels. Increasing the vasomotor tone (blue and green curves) has two effects: shifting the critical closing pressure to the right and decreasing the slope (i.e., increasing the resistance once the vessel is open).

In Figure 19-7B, the three curves describe the resistance for the like-colored curves in Figure 19-7A. Under control conditions (no sympathetic stimulation—red curve), the resistance is infinitely high at pressures below the critical closing pressure because the baseline active tension causes the vessel to collapse. Higher driving pressures cause the vessel to dilate, lowering resistance with the fourth power of the radius. Thus, the resistance falls dramatically with increasing driving pressure. Increasing the vasomotor tone (blue and green curves) shifts the pressure-resistance relationships to the right (reflecting the increased critical closing pressures) and up (reflecting the higher resistance throughout).

Figure 19-8 Compliance of blood vessels. In $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, a relative volume of $100 \%$ represents the volume in a fully relaxed vessel.

## Differences in compliance cause arteries to act as resistors and veins to act as capacitors

As we increase transmural pressure, arteries increase in volume. As they accommodate the volume of blood ejected with every heartbeat, large, muscular systemic arteries (e.g., femoral artery) increase in radius by about $10 \%$. This change for a typical muscular artery is much smaller than the distention that one would observe for elastic arteries (e.g., aorta), which have fewer layers of smooth muscle and are not under nervous control. The higher compliance of elastic arteries is evident in the pressure-volume diagram in Figure 19-8A—obtained after the smooth muscle is relaxed. The compliance of a relaxed elastic artery is substantial: increasing the transmural pressure from 0 to 100 mm Hg (near the normal mean arterial pressure) increases relative volume by $\sim 180 \%$. With further increases in pressure and diameter, compliance decreases only modestly. For example, increase of transmural pressure from 100 to 200 mm Hg increases relative volume by a further $\sim 100$ percentage points. Thus, arteries are properly constituted for development and withstanding of high transmural pressures. Because an increase in pressure raises the radius only modestly under physiological conditions, particularly in muscular arteries, the resistance of the artery (inversely proportional to $r^{4}$ ) does not fall markedly. Because muscular arteries have a rather stable resistance, they are sometimes referred to as resistance vessels.

Veins behave very differently. The pressure-volume diagram of a vein (see Fig. 19-8B) shows that compliance is extremely high—far higher than for "elastic arteries"—at least in the low-pressure range. For a relaxed vein, a relatively small increase of transmural pressure from 0 to 10 mm Hg increases volume by $\sim 200 \%$. This high compliance in the low-pressure range is not due to a property of the elastic fibers. Rather, it reflects a change in geometry. At pressures
$<6$ to 9 mm Hg , the vein's cross section is ellipsoidal. A small rise in pressure causes the vein to become circular, without an increase in perimeter but with a greatly increased crosssectional area. Thus, in their normal pressure range (see Table 19-3), veins can accept relatively large volumes of blood with little buildup of pressure. Because they act as volume reservoirs, veins are sometimes referred to as capacitance vessels. The true distensibility or compliance of the venous wall—related to the increase in perimeter produced by pressures $>10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ —is rather poor, as shown by the flat slope at higher pressures in Figure 19-8B.

How do veins and elastic arteries compare in response to a sudden increase in volume $(\Delta V)$ ? When the heart ejects its stroke volume into the aorta, the intravascular pressure increases modestly, from 80 to 120 mm Hg . This change in intravascular pressure-also known as the pulse pressure (see p. 418)—is the same as the change in transmural pressure. We have already seen that venous compliance is low in this "arterial" pressure range. Thus, if we were to challenge a vein with a sudden increase in volume $(\Delta V)$ in the arterial pressure range, the increase in transmural pressure $(\Delta P)$ would be much higher than in an artery of equal size. This is indeed the case when a surgeon uses a saphenous vein segment in a coronary artery bypass graft and anastomoses the vein between two sites on a coronary artery, forming a bypass around an obstructed site.

Changes in the volume of vessels during the cardiac cycle are due to changes in radius rather than length. During ejection of blood during systole, the length of the thoracic aorta may increase by only about $1 \%$. 0 N19-3

## Laplace's law describes how tension in the vessel wall increases with transmural pressure

Because compliance depends on the elastic properties of the vessel wall, the discussion here focuses on how an external

# N19-3 Changes in Vessel Volume 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The volume ( $V$ ) of a vessel is the product of its mean crosssectional area and length ( $L$ ). Thus, for a cylindrical vessel with a radius of $r$ :

$$
V=\pi r^{2} L
$$

Changes in the volume ( $\Delta V$ ) of a vessel-changes such as those that occur during the cardiac cycle or respiratory cyclegenerally are due to changes in radius, rather than in length. During the cardiac cycle, the ejection during systole of a stroke volume of 70 mL of blood causes a substantial increase in the radius of the thoracic aorta but causes the length of the thoracic aorta to increase by only $\sim 1 \%$. Moreover, a $1 \%$ decrease in the length of the abdominal aorta compensates for this increase in the length of the thoracic aorta.

In the case of coiled vessels, an increase in vessel length may make a larger contribution to the volume change. We will discuss two examples, vessels in the uterus and those in "apical" skin.

1. The arteries that supply the uterus form arcuate arteries inside the myometrium, from which arise radial arteries oriented toward the lumen of the uterus. As the radial arteries enter the endometrium, they become coiled spiral arteries. These spiral arteries undergo dramatic changes as
the endometrium grows during the endometrial cycle (see pp. 1124-1126). During the proliferative phase of the cycle, the spiral arteries grow toward the lumen of the uterus together with the endometrium. During the luteal/secretory phase, the spiral arteries increase their coiling. On pages 1136-1137, we discuss the role of these spiral arteries in the maternal blood flow during pregnancy. See also Figure 56-6, which shows an unlabeled spiral artery that branches off from the maternal artery.
2. Another example of coiled vessels is the arteriovenous anastomoses (glomus bodies) in apical skin (see pp. 570-571). These vessels act as shunts between arterioles and venules in the dermis and play a role in the control of cutaneous blood flow, and thus heat flow from the "core" and the skin (see pp. 1200-1201).
In the case of pulmonary vessels, increases in lung volume stretch the blood vessels within the parenchyma of the lung, thereby increasing their length. Imagine that lung volume increases from residual volume ( 1.5 to 1.9 L as shown in Fig. 26-8) to total lung capacity ( 4.9 to 6.4 L as shown in Fig. 26-8), resulting in a 3.4 -fold increase in lung volume. If that volume increase represents a uniform increase in all three axes of the lung, it would correspond to a $\sim 50 \%$ increase along each dimension.

force deforms elastic materials. When the force vanishes, the deformation vanishes, and the material returns to its original state. The simplest mechanical model of a linearly elastic solid is a spring (Fig. 19-9A). The elongation $\Delta L$ is proportional to the force $(\mathcal{F})$, according to Hooke's law:

$$
\mathcal{F}=k \cdot \Delta L
$$

where $k$ is a constant. If an elastic body requires a larger force to achieve a certain deformation, it is stiffer or less compliant. The largest stress that the material can withstand while remaining elastic is the elastic limit. If it is deformed beyond this limit, the material reaches its yield point and, eventually, its breaking point.

Stress is the force per unit cross-sectional area $(\mathcal{F} / A)$. Thus, if we pull on an elastic band-stretching it from an initial length $L_{0}$ to a final length $L$-the stress is the force we apply, divided by the area of the band in cross section. Strain is the fractional increase in length, that is, $\Delta L / L_{0}$ or $\left(L-L_{0}\right) / L_{0}$ (see Fig. 19-9B). An equation analogous to Hooke's law describes the relationship between stress and strain:

$$
\frac{\mathcal{F}}{\frac{A}{\text { Stress }}}=Y \underbrace{\left(\frac{L-L_{0}}{L_{0}}\right)}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Strain }
\end{array}}
$$

The proportionality factor, the Young elastic modulus $(Y)$, (5) N19-4 is the force per cross-sectional area required to stretch the material to twice its initial length and also the slope of the strain-stress diagram in Figure 19-9B. Thus, the stiffer a material is, the steeper the slope, and the greater the elastic modulus. For example, collagen is $>1000$-fold stiffer than elastin (Table 19-5).

Figure 19-11 Laplace's law. The circumferential arrows that attempt to bring together the edges of an imaginary slit along the length of the vessel represent the constricting force of the tension in the wall. The radial arrows that push the wall outward represent the distending force. At equilibrium, the two sets of forces balance.

Because the elastic and collagen fibers in blood vessels are not arranged as simple linear springs, the stresses and strains that arise during the pressurization or filling of a vessel occur, at least in principle, along three axes (Fig. 19-10): (1) an elongation of the circumference $(\theta)$, (2) an elongation of the axial length $(x)$, and (3) a compression of the thickness of the vessel wall in the direction of the radius $(r)$. In fact, blood vessels actually change little in length during distention, and the thinning of the wall is usually not a major factor. Thus, we can describe the elastic properties of a vessel by considering only what happens along the circumference.

The transmural pressure $(\Delta P)$ is the distending force that tends to increase the circumference of the vessel. Opposing this elongation is a force inside the vessel wall. It is convenient to express this wall tension $(T)$ as the force that must be applied to bring together the two edges of an imaginary slit, of unit length $L$, cut in the wall along the longitudinal axis of the vessel (Fig. 19-11). Note that in using tension

# N19-4 Young Modulus 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The elastic modulus used in Equation 19-7 in the text is the elastic modulus measured in an experiment in which one stretches an object. The tensile elastic modulus, also called the Young elastic modulus, is expressed by the term $Y$ (for Young). $Y$ is a measure of the force needed to stretch a material. If the material that we stretch has a uniform cross-sectional area $A$, the stress is the force we apply, normalized to the crosssectional area $\mathscr{F} / \mathcal{A}$. Stress is given in units of force per area, such as dynes per square centimeter or newtons per square meter. One pascal ( Pa ) is $1 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. Because $1 \mathrm{~N}=10^{6}$ dynes and $1 \mathrm{~m}^{2}=10^{4} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}, 1 \mathrm{~Pa}=10 \mathrm{dyne} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

The elongation that results from the stress that we apply is expressed as a strain or the change in length of the material normalized to its initial length $\left(\left(L-L_{0}\right) / L_{0}\right)$. The relationship between stress and strain is given by Equation 19-7 (shown here as Equation NE 19-11):

$$
\underbrace{\mathcal{F}}_{\text {Stress }}=\underbrace{Y\left(\frac{L-L_{0}}{L_{0}}\right)}_{\text {Strain }}
$$

(NE 19-11)

Because strain is dimensionless (i.e., length divided by length), the coefficient $Y$ has the same units as stress: dynes per square centimeter, or newtons per square meter = pascals.

Table 19-5 in the text gives the elastic moduli in dynes per square centimeter, whereas in engineering elastic moduli are often given in pascals. For further comparison, the elastic modulus of cortical long bone, such that of the femur, is $2 \times 10^{10}$ Pa or $2 \times 10^{11}$ dyne $/ \mathrm{cm}^{2}$, and that of most types of steel is only an order of magnitude larger, $\sim 2 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{~Pa}$ or $2 \times 10^{12}$ dyne $/ \mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

Finally, the elastic modulus of materials can also be obtained by measuring the degree of bending of a material under a given weight. For example, one could suspend a beam between two fixed points at either end of the beam, with the weight placed in the middle. The deflection of the beam is described by an equation analogous to Equation 19-7 (which is only valid for the tensile elastic modulus).

Figure 19-12 Elastic diagram (tension versus radius) of blood vessels. In A, the curves are replots of the curves in Figure 19-8, $A$ and $B$. In B, the plot is the result of reversing the two axes in $\mathbf{A}$. In $\mathbf{C}$, the solid red and blue curves are transformations of the curves in $\mathbf{B}$. If we solve for $r$, the $x$-axis of $\mathbf{B}$ (volume) becomes the radius in $\mathbf{C}$; if we use Laplace's law $(T=\Delta P \cdot r)$ to solve for $T$, the $y$-axis of $\mathbf{B}$ (transmural pressure) becomes tension in $\mathbf{C}$.
(units: dynes per centimeter) rather than stress (units: dynes per square centimeter), we assume that the thickness of the vessel wall is constant.

The equilibrium between $\Delta P$ and $T$ depends on the vessel radius and is expressed by a law derived independently by Thomas Young and the Marquis de Laplace in the early 1800s. N19-5 For a cylinder,

$$
T=\Delta P \cdot r
$$

Thus, for a given transmural pressure, the wall tension in the vessel gets larger as the radius increases.

## The vascular wall is adapted to withstand wall tension, not transmural pressure

In Figure 19-8, we plotted the volume of a vessel against transmural pressure, finding that the slope of this relationship is compliance. However, this sort of analysis does not provide us with direct information on the spring-like properties of the materials that make up the vessel wall. With Laplace's law $(T=\Delta P \cdot r)$, we can transform the pressurevolume relationship into the same kind of "elastic diagram" that we used in Figure 19-9B to understand the properties of a rubber band.

Figure 19-12A is a replot of the pressure-volume diagrams in Figure 19-8A and B. In Figure 19-12B, we reverse the coordinate system so that volume is now on the x -axis and pressure on the y -axis. Finally, in Figure 19-12C, we convert volume to radius on the x -axis and use Laplace's law to convert pressure into wall tension on the y -axis. The plots in Figure 19-12C are analogous to a stress-strain diagram for a rubber band (see Fig. 19-9B). Thus, stretching the radius of the aorta (solid red curve) causes a considerable rise in wall tension, which reflects the aorta's moderate compliance. The vena cava, on the other hand, fills over a wide range of radii before any wall tension develops, which reflects the shape change that makes it appear to be very compliant at the low pressures that are physiological for a vein. However, further stretching of the vein's radius results in a steep rise in wall tension, which reflects the inherently limited compliance of veins. (○) N19-6

What does Laplace's law (see Equation 19-8) tell us about the wall tension necessary to withstand the pressure inside a blood vessel? On the plot of tension versus radius for the aorta in Figure 19-12C, we have chosen a single point at a radius of 6 mm ; because the aorta is relatively stiff, stretching it to this radius produces a wall tension of 120,000 dyne/cm. According to Laplace's law, exactly one pressure-200,000 dyne/cm ${ }^{2}$ or 150 mm Hg -satisfies this combination of $r$ and T. In Figure 19-12C, this pressure is indicated by the slope of the red broken line that connects the origin with our point.

# N19-5 Laplace's Law 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In N19-9, we point out that, although one could consider as many as three axes of stress-strain relationships for a blood vessel, the most important is the circumferential stress-strain relationship. Laplace's law illustrates how the circumferential geometry of an elastic tube depends on the balance of the distending force, which is generated by the transmural pressure ( $\Delta P$ ) that pushes the wall outward, and the constricting force from elastic components within the wall that pulls the wall inward. We can compute the distending force acting on a vessel (vessel length $=L$ ) from $\Delta P$. For a blood vessel, $\Delta P$ is the transmural pressure, which is the difference between the intravascular pressure and the tissue pressure (see Fig. 17-4). The pressure is simply the force $(\mathcal{F})$ divided by the inner surface area of the vessel wall, which is $\left(A_{\text {surface }}\right), 2 \pi \cdot r \cdot L$. Because we disregard the changes in the thickness of the wall, the present treatment assumes a single radius ( $r$ ), which is roughly equivalent to the midwall radius. Thus,

$$
\mathcal{F}_{\text {intensity }}=\Delta P \cdot A_{\text {surface }}=\Delta P \cdot 2 \pi \cdot r \cdot L
$$

If we normalize this distending force per unit length of vessel, $\mathcal{F} / L$ (in dynes per centimeter), we have the following:

$$
\frac{\mathcal{F}_{\text {distending }}}{L}=\Delta P \cdot 2 \pi \cdot r
$$

The constricting force that balances the distending force is the circumferential stress in the wall of the vessel. This stress is the force that must be applied to bring together the two edges of an imaginary slit of length $L$ that has been cut through the vessel wall, along the longitudinal axis of the vessel wall (see Fig. 19-11). You can imagine that, as we cut through the vessel wall, we see that the cross-sectional area cut through the wall $\left(A_{s l l}\right)$ is $A_{s l l}=h \cdot x$, where $h$ is the thickness of the wall. This crosssectional area is highlighted in yellow in Figure 19-10 and is labeled " $A_{s l l}$ ". The circumferential stress is the force acting over the area $A_{s l l}$. However, because we lack information about thickness of the wall, and thus about $A_{s l l}$, we will ignore the dimension of thickness and instead will focus on the constricting force per unit length of the slit rather than per unit area. Thus, instead of working with the circumferential stress $\left(\mathcal{F} / A_{s l}\right)$ of the vessel, we will instead work with the circumferential tension ( $\mathcal{F} / L$, in dynes per centimeter):

$$
\frac{\mathcal{F}_{\text {intensity }}}{L}=\mathcal{T}
$$

In order for the system to be in equilibrium, the work done by the distending force must balance the work done by the constricting force. Work is force times displacement. The work done by the distending force (see Equation NE 19-13) is done over a displacement in the radial axis $(\Delta r)$, as shown in Figure 19-10:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Distending work } & =\mathcal{F} \cdot \Delta r \\
& =\Delta P \cdot 2 \pi \cdot r \cdot \Delta r
\end{aligned}
$$

The work done by the constricting force (see Equation NE 19-14) is done over a displacement in the circumferential axis and has the magnitude $2 \pi \cdot \Delta r$ :

$$
\text { Constricting work }=T \cdot 2 \pi \cdot \Delta r
$$

Based on the principles of virtual work and conservation of energy, we conclude that-at equilibrium-the distending work (see Equation NE 19-15) is the same as the constricting work (see Equation NE 19-16):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Distending work } & =\text { Constricting work } \\
\Delta P \cdot 2 \pi \cdot r \cdot \Delta r & =T \cdot 2 \pi \cdot \Delta r
\end{aligned}
$$

Simplifying this equation yields the law of Young/Laplace for a cylinder:

$$
\Delta P=T / r
$$

or

$$
T=\Delta P \cdot r
$$

As we shall see on page 613, Equation 27-6 describes Laplace's law for a sphere, such as a balloon. In this case, the equation of Young and Laplace becomes:

$$
\Delta P=2 T / r
$$

(NE 19-19)
Here, $\Delta P$ is the pressure distending the balloon (i.e., the difference between the internal and external pressures), $T$ is the tension within the wall of the balloon, and $r$ is the radius of the balloon. If the sphere were instead a soap bubble, $T$ would be the surface tension.

# N19-9 Axes of Vessel Deformation 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Figure 19-10 in the text shows the three axes along which deformation can occur during the filling of a blood vessel: circumferential ( $\theta$ ), longitudinal ( $\boldsymbol{x}$ ), and radial ( $\boldsymbol{r}$ ). Therefore, as a blood vessel is distended by blood filling its lumen, we can consider three stresses and three strains, each with a different orientation. The three strains are as follows:

1. An elongation of the circumference $(\Delta \theta=\Delta 2 \pi r)$, where $r$ is the average of the vessel's inner radius $\left(r_{1}\right)$ and outer radius $\left(r_{2}\right)$ as shown in Fig. 17-4
2. An elongation of the length of the vessel $(\Delta x)$
3. A compression of the thickness of the vessel wall $(\Delta h)$ in the direction of the radius; that is, a change in the difference between outer and inner radii, $\Delta\left(r_{2}-r_{1}\right)$
As noted in $\bigcirc$ N19-3, blood vessels actually change little in length during distention, and therefore we can disregard the
strain-stress along the axis $x$ of Figure 19-10. Although thinning of the wall does occur during blood vessel distention, the radial stress from wall compression is usually far less than the circumferential stress; therefore, we will also ignore the strain-stress along the axis $r$. Thus, we are left to consider only the strain-stress relationship along the circumferential axis ( $\theta$ ), which is given by Laplace's law in Equation 19-8:

$$
T=\Delta P \cdot r
$$

Note that in the above equation, stress (i.e., force per unit area) is replaced by tension (i.e., force per unit length).

## N19-6 Length-Tension Versus Strain-Stress Diagrams

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In Figure 19-12C of the text, we plot the wall tension of a cylindrical blood vessel against its radius ( $r_{1}$ in millimeters). This wall tension is the force per unit length ( $T$, in dynes per centimeter) of an imaginary slit in the wall of the blood vessel (see Fig. 19-10). The radius in Figure 19-12C is related by a constant $(2 \pi)$ to the length of the circumference of the vessel $(2 \pi r)$. Thus, the $x$-axis is really a length, so that Figure 19-12C is really a length-tension diagram similar to that shown for passive tension in muscle (see Fig. 9-9C). Note, however, that in Figure 9-9C, what we plotted on the $y$-axis was the percent of maximum active force, not the wall tension (in which the force is normalized to the length of an imaginary slit in the vessel).

In contrast, an engineer studying the elastic properties of a solid would use a strain-stress diagram, as shown in Figure 19-9B, which differs from a length-tension diagram on both the $y$ - and $x$-axes. On the $y$-axis of a strain-stress diagram, we plot the force, normalized to the cross-sectional area of the materialwe define this parameter as stress (dynes per square centimeter). On the $x$-axis, we plot the fractional change in the length of the material-we define this dimensionless parameter as the strain. The following equation (which reproduces Equation 19-7) shows that the relationship between stress and strain is linear:

$$
\frac{\mathcal{F}}{\frac{A}{S_{\text {stress }}}}=\gamma\left(\frac{L-L_{0}}{L_{0}}\right) \quad(\text { (NE 19-20) }
$$

Note that the proportionality constant in this equation is the Young elastic modulus ( $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ ), which is a characteristic of a particular material, as shown in Table 19-5.

It would be advantageous to convert the length-tension diagram in Figure 19-12C into a true strain-stress diagram because that would allow us to estimate the Young elastic modulus for the blood vessel wall, which in turn would give us insight into the material that makes up the wall. This conversion requires that we (1) convert the $y$-axis from wall tension (dynes per centimeter) to stress (dynes per square centimeter), and (2) convert the $x$-axis from absolute length (centimeters) to fractional change in length (dimensionless). Starting from the definition of stress, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathcal{F}}{\frac{A_{x y}}{\text { Stress }}} & =\frac{\mathcal{F}}{\left(\frac{\text { Length of slit) }}{\text { Wall thickness }}\right.}(\text { (NE 19-21) } \\
& =\frac{\mathcal{F}}{\left(\frac{\text { Length of slit) }}{\text { Wall thickness }}\right.}(\text { (Wall thickness) } \\
& =\frac{\text { Wall tension }}{\text { Wall thickness }}
\end{aligned}

We see that we can obtain the stress by dividing wall tension ( $y$-axis in Fig. 19-12C) by the wall thickness. Note that the experimental data of Figure 19-12C were obtained on vessels of an experimental animal with vessel diameters that were about half those of the human aorta or vena cava. Assuming that wall thickness of both the aorta and vena cava in the experimental animal were 0.1 cm , we can convert the $y$-axis of Figure 19-12C to units of stress (dynes per square centimeter) simply by dividing the wall tension by 0.1 cm . We will perform this conversion separately for the aorta and vena cava and, in the process, compute the Young elastic modulus for the materials that constitute the wall of the aorta and vena cava.

## Aorta

Because the length-tension diagram in Figure 19-12C was not linear, the resulting strain-stress diagram will also be nonlinear. Therefore, we will analyze the relationship between strain and stress at two different points along the curve (i.e., at two different degrees of elongation of the circumference of the vessel wall).

For an elongation of the vessel-wall circumference from a radius of 3.15 mm (the intersection of the curve with the $x$-axis) to a radius of 4 mm , the fractional change in length is $\left(L-L_{0}\right) / L_{0}$ $=(4-3.15) / 3.15=0.27$, or a change of $27 \%$. Achieving this elongation requires that we increase the wall tension from zero to 21,500 dyne/cm. Viewed another way, assuming a wall thickness of 0.1 cm , we must increase the stress from zero to (21,500 dyne/cm)/(0.1 cm) or 215,000 dyne/cm². Inserting the preceding values into Equation NE 19-20 yields an elastic modulus $(Y)$ of $-800,000$ dyne/cm². Referring to Table 19-5, we see that this value is intermediate between the elastic modulus

# N19-6 Length-Tension Versus Strain-Stress Diagrams-cont'd 

of smooth muscle and that of elastin, suggesting that both smooth muscle and elastin contribute to the elastic properties of the vessel wall in this low range of elongation of the vessel-wall circumference.

For an elongation of the vessel-wall circumference from a radius of 6 mm (the red point on the red curve in Fig. 19-12C) to a radius of 6.1 mm , the fractional change in length is $6.1-$ $6.0) / 6.0=0.017$, or a change of $1.7 \%$. Achieving this elongation requires that we increase the wall tension from 120,000 dyne/ cm to 140,000 dyne/cm, an increase in wall tension of 20,000 dyne/cm. Viewed another way, and assuming a wall thickness of 0.1 cm , we must increase the stress by $(20,000 \mathrm{dyne} / \mathrm{cm})$ ( 0.1 cm ) or $200,000 \mathrm{dyne} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Inserting the preceding values into Equation NE 19-20 yields an elastic modulus (Y) of $12,000,000$ dyne/cm². This estimated elastic modulus somewhat exceeds the typical elastic modulus of elastin, indicating the likely recruitment-in this range of elongation-of some material with a higher elastic modulus (i.e., collagen).

This analysis confirms the conclusion that we reached on page 458. Thus, depending on the degree of stretch, different materials of different elastic modulus contribute to the overall elastic diagram of the aorta.

## Vena Cava

For an elongation of the vessel-wall circumference from a radius of 3 mm to a radius of 6 mm , the fractional change in length is $\left(L-L_{0}\right) / L_{0}=(6-3) / 3=1$, or a change of $100 \%$. Achieving this elongation requires that we increase the wall tension from zero to $\sim 1000$ dyne/cm. Assuming a wall thickness of 0.1 cm , we
must increase the stress from zero to ( $1000 \mathrm{dyne} / \mathrm{cm}) /(0.1 \mathrm{~cm})$ or $10,000 \mathrm{dyne} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Inserting the preceding values into Equation NE 19-20 yields an elastic modulus (Y) of $\sim 100,000$ dyne/cm², which is in the range of the elastic modulus for pure smooth muscle (see Table 19-5). However, because smooth muscle is arranged in parallel with elastin, it is impossible to pull on one without pulling on the other. Thus, the elastic modulus of $\sim 100,000$ dyne/cm² is unrealistically low. In fact, the stress that we are applying in this range of elongation does not place any increased strain on the smooth muscle and elastic fibers of the vessel wall. Rather, the small increase in wall stress is merely that required to change the geometry of the vena cava from ellipsoidal (i.e., collapsed) to circular (i.e., fully rounded), as discussed on page 455.

For an elongation of the vessel-wall circumference from a radius of 6.8 mm (the blue point on the blue curve in Fig. 19-12C) to a radius of 6.9 mm , the fractional change in length is (6.9 $6.8) / 6.8=0.015$, or a change of $1.5 \%$. Achieving this elongation requires that we increase the wall tension from 20,000 dyne/cm to $40,000 \mathrm{dyne} / \mathrm{cm}$, an increase in wall tension of $20,000 \mathrm{dyne} /$ cm . Assuming a wall thickness of 0.1 cm , we must increase the stress by $(20,000 \mathrm{dyne} / \mathrm{cm}) /(0.1 \mathrm{~cm})$ or $200,000 \mathrm{dyne} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Inserting the preceding values into Equation NE 19-20 yields an elastic modulus (Y) of $\sim 13,600,000$ dyne/cm². The estimated elastic modulus of the vena cava in this range of elongation of the circumference somewhat exceeds the typical elastic modulus of elastin, which indicates-as in the case of the aorta-the recruitment of a material with a higher elastic modulus (i.e., collagen).

*The number of plus signs is a relative index of the amount of elastic tissue.

In a similar exercise for the vena cava, we assume a radius of $\sim 6.7 \mathrm{~mm}$, which is similar to the one we chose for the aorta; because the vena cava is readily deformed in this range, expanding it to this radius produces a wall tension of only $12,000 \mathrm{dyne} / \mathrm{cm}$ (blue broken line). This combination of $r$ and $T$ yields a much lower pressure-18,000 dyne $/ \mathrm{cm}^{2}$, or 13.5 mm Hg. Thus, comparing vessels of similar size, Laplace's law tells us that a high wall tension is required to withstand a high pressure.

Comparing two vessels of very different size reveals a disparity between wall tension and pressure. A large vein, such as the vena cava, must resist only 10 mm Hg in transmural pressure but is equipped with a fair amount of elastic tissue. A capillary, on the other hand, which must resist a transmural pressure of 25 mm Hg , does not have any elastic tissue at all. Why? The key concept is that what the vessel really has to withstand is not pressure but wall tension. According to Laplace's law (see Equation 19-8), wall tension is the product of transmural pressure and radius $(\Delta P \cdot r)$. Hence, wall tension in a capillary ( $10 \mathrm{dyne} / \mathrm{cm}$ ) is much smaller than that in the vena cava ( $18,000 \mathrm{dyne} / \mathrm{cm}$ ), even though the capillary is at a higher pressure. Table 19-6 shows that the amount of elastic tissue correlates extremely well with wall tension but very poorly with transmural pressure. The higher the tension that the vessel wall must bear, the greater is its complement of elastic tissue.

## Elastin and collagen separately contribute to the wall tension of vessels

The solid red and blue curves in Figure 19-12C are quite different from the linear behavior predicted by Hooke's law (see Fig. 19-9B). With increasing stretch, the vessel wall resists additional deformation more; that is, the slope of the relationship becomes steeper. The increasing slope (i.e., increasing elastic modulus) of the radius-tension diagram of a blood vessel is due to the heterogeneity of the elastic material of the vascular wall. Elastic and collagen fibers have different elastic moduli (see Table 19-5). We can quantitate the separate contributions of elastic and collagen fibers by "chemical dissection." After selective digestion of elastin with elastase, which unmasks the behavior of collagen fibers, the length-tension relationship is very steep and closer to the linear relationship expected from Hooke's law (Fig. 19-13, orange curve). After selective digestion of collagen fibers with formic acid, which unmasks the behavior of elastic
![bo6185266204](bo6185266204.jpg)

Figure 19-13 Chemical dissection of elastic moduli of collagen and elastin.
fibers, the length-tension relationship is fairly flat (see Fig. 19-13, violet curve). The orange curve (collagen) is steeper than the violet curve (elastin) because collagen is stiffer than elastin (see Table 19-5). In a normal vessel (see Fig. 19-13, red curve), modest degrees of stretch elongate primarily the elastin fibers along a relatively flat slope. Progressively greater degrees of stretch recruit collagen fibers, resulting in a steeper slope.

## Aging reduces the distensibility of arteries

With aging, important changes occur in the elastic properties of blood vessels, primarily arteries. We can look at these age relationships for arteries from two perspectives, the pressure-volume curve and the radius-tension curve.

The most obvious difference in aortic pressure-volume curves with increasing age is that the curves shift to progressively higher volumes (Fig. 19-14A), which reflects an increase in diameter. In addition, the compliance of the aorta first rises during growth and development to early adulthood and then falls during later life. After early adulthood, two unfavorable changes occur. First, arteriosclerotic changes reduce the vessel's compliance per se. Thus, during ventricular ejection, a normal-sized increase in aortic volume $(\Delta V)$

![bo6285266204](bo6285266204.jpg)

Figure 19-14 Effect of aging on arteries. In $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, a relative radius of $100 \%$ represents the fully relaxed value. In $\mathbf{A}$, the white triangles show the expected change in transmural pressure (blue line) for the increase in aortic blood volume (red line) produced by each heartbeat-assuming a diastolic pressure of 80 mm Hg .
in a young adult produces a relatively small pulse pressure $(\Delta P)$ in the aorta. In contrast, the same change in aortic volume in an elderly individual produces a much larger pulse pressure. Second, because blood pressure frequently rises with age, the older person operates on a flatter portion of the pressure-volume curve, where the compliance is even lower than at lower pressures. Thus, a normal-sized increase in aortic volume produces an even larger pulse pressure.

The second approach for assessment of the effects of age on the elastic properties of blood vessels is to examine the radius-tension diagram (see Fig. 19-14B). Because of the progressive, diffuse fibrosis of vessel walls with age, and because of an increase in the amount of collagen, the maximal slope of the radius-tension diagram increases with age. In addition, with age, these curves start to bend upward at lower radii, as the same degree of stretch recruits a larger number of collagen fibers. Underlying this phenomenon is an increased cross-linking among collagen fibers (see p. 1239) and thus less slack in their connections to other elements in the arterial wall. Thus, even modest elongations challenge the stiffer collagen fibers to stretch.

## Active tension from smooth-muscle activity adds to the elastic tension of vessels

Although we have been treating blood vessels as though their walls are purely elastic, the active tension (see pp. 238-240) from VSMCs also contributes to wall tension. Stimulation of VSMCs can reduce the internal radius of muscular feed arteries by $20 \%$ to $50 \%$. Laplace's law $(T=\Delta P \cdot r)$ tells us that as the VSMC shortens-thereby reducing vessel radius against a constant transmural pressure-there is a decrease in the tension that the muscle must exert to maintain that new, smaller radius.

For a blood vessel in which both passive elastic components and active smooth-muscle components contribute to

Figure 19-15 Active versus passive tension. The relative radius of $100 \%$ is that of an excised vessel maximally stimulated by norepinephrine (red curve, total tension) but not "stressed" (i.e., transmural pressure is 0 ). When the vessel is maximally poisoned with potassium cyanide, the baseline radius is $\sim 150 \%$ (green curve, passive tension), which reflects its relaxed state. The blue curve is just the active (i.e., smooth-muscle) component of tension.
the total tension, the radius-tension relationship reflects the contributions of each. (19-7 The red curve in Figure 19-15 shows such a compounded (passive + active) radiustension diagram for an artery in which the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (see p. 342) has maximally stimulated the VSMCs. The green curve shows a passive radius-tension relationship for just the elastic component of the tension (after the active component is eliminated by poisoning of the VSMCs with potassium cyanide). Of course, the green curve is the radius-tension diagram on which we have focused the previous figures (e.g., see Fig. 19-12C).

# N19-7 Stability of Vessels with Combined Active and Passive Tension 

## Contributed by Ridder Emile Boulpaep

Figure 19-15 in the text shows that total vascular wall tension from active and passive elements (red curve) is a rising function of relative radius (i.e., length). We can compare the active, passive, and total tensions of a blood vessel wall with those of skeletal muscle, which are shown in Figure 9-9C. Active tensions in both skeletal muscle and vascular smooth-muscle cells (VSMCs) plotted against length exhibit a maximum, as shown for skeletal muscle in Figure 9-9D and for VSMCs by the blue curve in Figure 19-15. However, note that the plot of the total tension of skeletal muscle against length (orange curve in Fig. 9-9C) exhibits a plateau or a maximum, whereas the plot of total tension of VSMCs against length rises monotonically throughout (red curve in Fig. 19-15). The latter phenomenon is due to the increasingly large passive tension component (green curve in Fig. 19-15), which rises very steeply as one stretches the wall of the blood vessel.

The absence of a plateau in the total-tension versus radius curve for a blood vessel wall is of great benefit for the stability of a blood vessel over a wide range of transmural pressures. We can make this point more clearly by considering a lengthtension diagram similar to the red curve in Figure 19-15, but in which we plot the absolute radius on the $x$-axis. The solid red curve in Figure 19-12C is just such a plot. Here, the dashed red line represents the particular transmural pressure of 150 mm Hg that satisfies the physical equilibrium of that vessel at a wall tension of 120,000 dyne/cm and a radius of 6 mm . We could draw a family of dashed lines in Figure 19-15-each one representing one transmural pressure and passing through the origin (zero tension and zero radius) and intersecting various points on the rising red curve. Each of these dashed lines would represent one of a wide range of transmural pressures that can be in physical equilibrium, each with its own wall tension and vessel radius.

We now return to the red curve in Figure 19-15, which represents a vessel whose VSMCs have been maximally stimulated by norepinephrine. Note that in this plot, the $x$-axis starts with $100 \%$, rather than zero. This $100 \%$ represents the "unloaded" diameter in which the transmural pressure is zero. This is also the minimum radius that the vessel can achieve under the current conditions of norepinephrine stimulation. Now let us assume that we extend the $x$-axis of Figure 19-15 to the left to $0 \%$ to obtain the true origin of a diagram such as that in Figure 19-12 (tension $=0$, radius $=0$ ). Because we have drawn Figure 19-15 for an artery of an experimental animal, we will assume that the $100 \%$ radius corresponds to $3 \mathrm{~mm}=0.3 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Just as we introduced the concept of drawing a family of dashed lines in Figure 19-12C, we can draw a family of dashed lines in Figure 19-15, with its $x$-axis artificially extended to the left to $0 \%$. The table below shows the coordinates of the end points of just such a family of dashed lines. In each row we show the coordinates of the origin (columns 1 and 2), the coordinates of the intersection of the dashed line with the red curve (columns 3 and 4), and finally the appropriate equilibrium pressure in two different units (columns 5 and 6) computed from Laplace's law (i.e., $P=T / r$ ). For example, the first row of data pertains to the unloaded condition. Here, the dashed line is horizontal and connects the new origin at $0 \%$ with $100 \%$ (i.e., the old origin). Note that the slope is the transmural pressure, which is zero. Another example is the last row of data, which corresponds to a radius of $200 \%$, or twice the initial radius of $100 \%$. Here, the dashed line has a slope of 275 mm Hg , which is the transmural pressure necessary for the physical equilibrium between the radius of $200 \%$ and wall tension of 220,000 dyne/cm. Thus, the table shows that the system can be in equilibrium for transmural pressures ranging from zero to 275 mm Hg , and even beyond.

# N19-7 Stability of Vessels with Combined Active and Passive Tension-cont'd 

We will now use two examples to illustrate why it is important for blood vessels to contain elastic material with a reasonably high elastic modulus. That is, the green curve in Figure 19-15 must be reasonably steep.

First, consider the hypothetical case in which the active tension of smooth muscle (analogous to the blue curve in Fig. 19-15) peaks at a wall tension of 100,000 dyne/cm at a radius of $190 \%=0.57 \mathrm{~cm}$ and then falls very steeply to a wall tension of zero at a radius of $195 \%$. If we now summed this new hypothetical blue curve and the existing green curve in Figure 19-15, we would obtain a red curve that reaches a maximum total wall tension of $\sim 150,000$ dyne/cm at a radius of $190 \%$ and then falls off at higher radii. At the maximum wall tension, the transmural pressure $(P)$ would be 197 mm Hg . Any transmural pressure in excess of 197 mm Hg (i.e., a pressure of $P+\Delta P$ ) would further dilate the vessel to a radius in excess of $190 \%$ (i.e., a radius of $r+\Delta t$ ). The total wall tension required for equilibrium, according to Laplace's law, would be $T_{\text {required }}=(P+\Delta P) \times(r+\Delta t)$, which would have to be $>150,000$ dyne/cm. In fact, the actual tension ( $T_{\text {actual }}$ ) has already passed its peak of 150,000 dyne/cm. Accordingly, $T_{\text {required }}=(P+\Delta P) \times(r+\Delta t)>T_{\text {actual }}$ and a blowout would result (see Fig. 19-16B, panel 2).

Second, consider another hypothetical case in which smoothmuscle tension is perfectly constant. That is, the blue curve for
active tension (analogous to the blue curve in Fig. 19-15) is a flat horizontal line that might have a wall tension, for example, of 100,000 dyne/cm, irrespective the size of the vessel. If we now summed this new hypothetical blue curve and the existing green curve in Figure 19-15, we would obtain a red curve that would be the same as the green curve, but upwardly displaced by 100,000 dyne/cm. Thus, this new red curve would be flat between a radius of $0 \%$ and a radius of $140 \%$. Beyond a radius of $140 \%$, this new red curve would rise with the same slope as the green curve. Let us now assume a starting radius of $140 \%$ $(0.42 \mathrm{~cm})$ and a wall tension of 100,000 dyne/cm, which would be in physical equilibrium-according to Laplace's law-at a transmural pressure of 178 mm Hg . If the transmural pressure then fell to $<178 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (i.e., a pressure of $P-\Delta P$ ), the vessel would tend to narrow below a radius of $140 \%$ (i.e., a radius of $r-\Delta t$ ). The total wall tension required for equilibrium, according to Laplace's law, would be $T_{\text {required }}=(P-\Delta P) \times(r-\Delta t)$, which would have to be $<100,000$ dyne/cm. In fact, the actual tension ( $T_{\text {actual }}$ ) is 100,000 dyne/cm. Accordingly, $T_{\text {required }}=(P-\Delta P) \times$ $(r-\Delta t)<T_{\text {actual }}$ and a complete vessel collapse would result (see Fig. 19-16B, panel 3).

Figure 19-16 Mechanical stability of vessels.

Subtraction of the green from the red curve in Figure 19-15 yields the active length-tension diagram (blue curve) for the vascular smooth muscle.

## Elastic tension helps stabilize vessels under vasomotor control

Consider a vessel initially stretched to a radius that is $80 \%$ greater than the unstressed radius (i.e., 180 versus 100 on the x -axis of Fig. 19-15). As we inject more fluid into the vessel, the radius increases (i.e., the vessel is more "stressed"). As a result, total wall tension must increase (see Fig. 19-15, red curve). The opposite, of course, would happen if we were to withdraw some fluid from the vessel. During such changes in total wall tension, what are the individual contributions of vascular smooth-muscle tension and the passive connective tissue tension? In Figure 19-16, we consider two extreme examples, one in which the vessel has only elastic elements and another in which it has only a fixed (i.e., isotonic) active tension.

First, consider a vessel lacking smooth muscle, so that only elastic elements contribute to total wall tension (see Fig. 19-16A). If we increase transmural pressure from $P$ (panel 1) to $P+\Delta P$ (panel 2), thereby increasing the radius from $r$ to $r+\Delta r$, wall tension will automatically increase from $T$ to $T+\Delta T$. This increase in tension allows the vessel to reach a new equilibrium, according to Laplace's law:

$$
T+\Delta T=(P+\Delta P) \cdot(r+\Delta r)
$$

Conversely, a decrease in pressure must lead to a decrease in radius and a decrease in tension (panel 3). To achieve either the stable inflation of panel 2 or the stable deflation of panel $3, \Delta T$ cannot be zero. In other words, the passive radius-tension diagram (see Fig. 19-15, green curve) cannot have a slope of zero. The vessel wall must have some elasticity.

Second, consider a hypothetical case in which no elastic fibers are present and in which the total tension $T$ is kept constant by active elements (i.e., VSMCs) alone. For example, this would be approximately the case for the blue curve in Figure 19-15, between relative radii of $180 \%$ and $200 \%$. At
the start (see Fig. 19-16B, panel 1), we will assume that the smooth-muscle tension exactly balances the $P \cdot r$ product. However, when we now increase pressure (panel 2), the automatic adaptation of tension that we saw in the previous example would not occur. Indeed any increase in pressure would make the product $(P+\Delta P) \cdot(r+\Delta r)$ exceed the fixed $T$ of the VSMCs. As a result, the vessel would blow out. Conversely, any decrease in pressure would make the product $(P-\Delta P) \cdot(r-\Delta r)$ fall below the fixed $T$ and lead to full collapse of the vessel (panel 3). This type of instability does in fact occur in arteriovenous anastomoses, which are characterized by poor elastic tissue and abundant myoepithelioid cells.

A real vessel, whose wall contains both elastic and smooth-muscle elements, can be stable (i.e., neither blown out nor collapsed) over a wide range of radii. The role of elastic tissue in vessels is therefore not only to withstand high transmural pressures, but also to stabilize the vessel. Thus, elastic tissue ensures a graded response when smooth-muscle tone changes. If vessels had only smooth muscle-and no elastic fibers-they would be like those in panels 2 and 3 of Figure 19-16B, and tend to be either completely open or completely closed.

An imbalance between passive and active elastic components in blood vessels can be important in disease. For example, when the passive, elastic fibers of a blood vessel are reduced or damaged, vessels tend to become larger, as in aneurysms and varicosities. If the radius exceeds the value compatible with the physical equilibrium governed by Laplace's law, a blowout may occur.

A second pathological example is seen when smooth muscle has undergone maximal stimulation and, conversely, passive elastic elements have regressed. This is the case in Raynaud disease, in which exposure to cold leads to extreme constriction of arterioles in the extremities, particularly the fingers. Vessel closure occurs because active smooth-muscle tension dominates the radius-tension diagram.

# THE MICROCIRCULATION 

Emile L. Boulpaep

## The microcirculation serves both nutritional and non-nutritional roles

The primary function of the cardiovascular system is to maintain a suitable environment for the tissues. The microcirculation is the "business end" of the system. The capillary is the principal site for exchange of gases, water, nutrients, and waste products. In most tissues, capillary flow exclusively serves these nutritional needs. In a few tissues, however, a large portion of capillary flow is non-nutritional. For example, in the glomeruli of the kidneys, capillary flow forms the glomerular filtrate (see p. 739). Blood flow through the skin, some of which may shunt through arteriovenous anastomoses, plays a key role in temperature regulation (see pp. 1200-1201). Capillaries also serve other non-nutritional roles, such as signaling (e.g., delivery of hormones) and host defense (e.g., delivery of platelets). In the first part of this chapter, we discuss the nutritional role of capillaries and examine how gases, small water-soluble substances, macromolecules, and water pass across the endothelium. In the last two subchapters, we discuss lymphatics as well as the regulation of the microcirculation.

The morphology and local regulatory mechanisms of the microcirculation are designed to meet the particular needs of each tissue. Because these needs are different, the structure and function of the microcirculation may be quite different from one tissue to the next.

## The microcirculation extends from the arterioles to the venules

The microcirculation is defined as the blood vessels from the first-order arteriole to the first-order venule. Although the details vary from organ to organ, the principal components of an idealized microcirculation include a single arteriole and venule, between which extends a network of true capillaries (Fig. 20-1). Sometimes a metarteriole-somewhat larger than a capillary-provides a shortcut through the network. Both the arteriole and the venule have vascular smooth-muscle cells (VSMCs). Precapillary sphincters-at the transition between a capillary and either an arteriole or a metarteriole-control the access of blood to particular segments of the network. Sphincter closure or opening creates small local pressure differences that may reverse the direction of blood flow in some segments of the network.

Arteries consist of an inner layer of endothelium, an internal elastic lamina, and a surrounding sheath of at least two continuous layers of innervated VSMCs (see p. 453). The inner radius of terminal arteries (called feed arteries in muscle) may be as small as $25 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. Arterioles (inner radius, 5 to $25 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ) are similar to arteries but have only a single continuous layer of VSMCs, which are innervated. Metarterioles are similar to arterioles, but of shorter length. Moreover, their VSMCs are discontinuous and are not usually innervated. The precapillary sphincter is a small cuff of smooth muscle that usually is not innervated but is very responsive to local tissue conditions. Relaxation or contraction of the precapillary sphincter may modulate tissue blood flow by an order of magnitude or more. Metarterioles and precapillary sphincters are not found in all tissues.

True capillaries (inner radius, 2 to $5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ) consist of a single layer of endothelial cells surrounded by a basement membrane, a fine network of reticular collagen fibers, andin some tissues-pericytes. The endothelial cells have a smooth surface and are extremely thin (as little as 200 to 300 nm in height), except at the nucleus. The thickness and density of the capillary basement membrane vary among organs. Where large transcapillary pressures occur or other large mechanical forces exist, the basement membrane is thickest. Some endothelial cells have, on both luminal and basal surfaces, numerous pits called caveolae (see pp. 42-43) that are involved in ligand binding. Fluid-phase and receptormediated endocytosis (see pp. 41-42) can result in $70-\mathrm{nm}$ caveolin-coated vesicles. In addition, the cytoplasm of capillary endothelial cells is rich in other endocytotic (pinocytotic) vesicles that contribute to the transcytosis of water and water-soluble compounds across the endothelial wall. In some cases, the endocytotic vesicles are lined up in a string and even appear linked together to form a transendothelial channel.

Linking endothelial cells together are interendothelial junctions (Fig. 20-2) where the two cell membranes are $\sim 10 \mathrm{~nm}$ apart, although there may be constricted regions where the space or cleft between the two cells forms adhering junctions only $\sim 4 \mathrm{~nm}$ wide. Tight junctions (see pp. 43-44) may also be present in which the apposed cell membranes appear to fuse, and claudins 1,3 , and 5 (CLDN1, CLDN3, CLDN5; see pp. 43-44) as well as occludin seal the gap. CLDN5 is quite specific for endothelial cells. Occludin is not found in all endothelia.

Some endothelial cells have membrane-lined, cylindrical conduits-fenestrations-that run completely through the cell, from the capillary lumen to the interstitial space. These fenestrations are 50 to 80 nm in diameter and are seen primarily in tissues with large fluid and solute fluxes across the capillary walls (e.g., intestine, choroid plexus, exocrine glands, and renal glomeruli). A thin diaphragm often closes the perforations of the fenestrae (e.g., in intestinal capillaries).

The endothelia of the sinusoidal capillaries in the liver, bone marrow, and spleen have very large fenestrations as well as gaps 100 to 1000 nm wide between adjacent cells. Vesicles, transendothelial channels, fenestrae, and gaps-as well as structures of intermediate appearance-are part of a

spectrum of regulated permeation across the endothelial cells.

Capillaries fall into three groups, based on their degree of leakiness (Fig. 20-3).

1. Continuous capillary. This is the most common form of capillary, with interendothelial junctions 10 to 15 nm wide (e.g., skeletal muscle). However, these clefts are absent in the blood-brain barrier (see p. 284), whose capillaries have narrow tight junctions.
2. Fenestrated capillary. In these capillaries, the endothelial cells are thin and perforated with fenestrations. These capillaries most often surround epithelia (e.g., small intestine, exocrine glands).
3. Discontinuous capillary. In addition to fenestrae, these capillaries have large gaps. Discontinuous capillaries are found in sinusoids (e.g., liver).

At their distal ends, true capillaries merge into venules (inner radius, 5 to $25 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ), which carry blood back into lowpressure veins that return blood to the heart. Venules have a

A shows Krogh's tissue cylinder, which consists of a single capillary (radius $r_{s}$ ) surrounded by a concentric cylinder of tissue (radius $r_{t}$ ) that the capillary supplies with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and other nutrients.

discontinuous layer of VSMCs and therefore can control local blood flow. Venules may also exchange some solutes across their walls.

## CAPILLARY EXCHANGE OF SOLUTES

## The exchange of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ across capillaries depends on the diffusional properties of the surrounding tissue

Gases diffuse by a transcellular route across the two cell membranes and cytosol of the endothelial cells of the capillary with the same ease that they diffuse through the surrounding tissue. In this section, we focus primarily on the exchange of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Very similar mechanisms exist for the exchange of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, but they run in the opposite direction.

Arterial blood has a relatively high $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ level. As blood traverses a systemic capillary, the principal site of gas exchange, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffuses across the capillary wall and into the tissue space, which includes the interstitial fluid and the neighboring cells.

The most frequently used model of gas exchange is August Krogh's tissue cylinder, a volume of tissue that a single capillary supplies with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (Fig. 20-4A). The cylinder of tissue surrounds a single capillary. According to this model, the properties of the tissue cylinder govern the rate of diffusion of both $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The radius of a tissue cylinder in an organ is typically half the average spacing from one capillary to the next, that is, half the mean intercapillary distance. Capillary density and therefore mean intercapillary distance vary greatly among tissues. Among systemic tissues, capillary density is highest in tissues with high $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption

(e.g., myocardium) and lowest in tissues consuming little $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (e.g., joint cartilage). Capillary density is extraordinarily high in the lungs (see p. 684).

The Krogh model predicts how the concentration or partial pressure of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ within the capillary lumen falls along the length of the capillary as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ exits for the surrounding tissues (see Fig. 20-4A). The $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ within the capillary at any site along the length of the capillary depends on several factors:

1. The concentration of free $\mathbf{O}_{2}$ in the arteriolar blood that feeds the capillary. This dissolved $\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]$, which is the same in the plasma and the cytoplasm of the red blood cells (RBCs), is proportional to the partial pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see p. 647) in the arterioles.
2. The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of the blood. Less than $2 \%$ of the total $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in arterial blood is dissolved; the rest is bound to hemoglobin inside the RBCs. Each 100 mL of arterial blood contains $\sim 20 \mathrm{~mL}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gas, or 20 volume\%-the $\mathbf{O}_{2}$ content (see Table 29-3).
3. The capillary blood flow $(F)$.
4. The radial diffusion coefficient $\left(D_{r}\right)$, which governs the diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ out of the capillary lumen. For simplicity, we assume that $D_{r}$ is the same within the blood, the capillary wall, and the surrounding tissue and that it is the same along the entire length of the capillary.
5. The capillary radius $\left(r_{c}\right)$.
6. The radius of tissue cylinder $\left(r_{t}\right)$ that the capillary is supplying with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.
7. The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption by the surrounding tissues $\left(\dot{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$.
8. The axial distance $(\boldsymbol{x})$ along the capillary.

The combination of all these factors accounts for the shape of the concentration profiles within the vessel and the tissue. Although this model appears complicated, it is actually based on many simplifying assumptions. (5) N20-1

## The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction ratio of a whole organ depends primarily on blood flow and metabolic demand

In principle, beginning with a model like Krogh's but more complete, one could sum up the predictions for a single capillary segment and then calculate gas exchange in an entire tissue. However, it is more convenient to pool all the capillaries in an organ and to focus on a single arterial inflow and single venous outflow. The difference in concentration of a substance in the arterial inflow and venous outflow of that organ is the arteriovenous (a-v) difference of that substance. For example, if the arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content $\left(\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{a}\right)$ entering the tissue is $20 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$ blood and the venous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content leaving it $\left(\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{v}\right)$ is $15 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$ blood, the $\mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{a}-\mathrm{v}$ difference for that tissue is $5 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ gas $/ \mathrm{dL}$ blood.

For a substance like $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which exits the capillaries, another way of expressing the amount that the tissues remove is the extraction ratio. This parameter is merely the a-v difference normalized to the arterial content of the substance. Thus, the extraction ratio of oxygen $\left(E_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ is

$$
E_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{a}-\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{v}}{\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{a}}
$$

Thus, in our example,

$$
E_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\frac{20 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}-15 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}}{20 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}}=\frac{5}{20}=25 \%
$$

In other words, the muscle in this example removes (and burns) $25 \%$ of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ presented to it by the arterial blood.

What are the factors that determine $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction? To answer this question, we return to the hypothetical Krogh cylinder. The same eight factors that influence the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ profiles in Figure 20-4A also determine the whole-organ $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction. Of these factors, the two most important are capillary flow (item 3 in the list above) and metabolic demand (item 7). The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction ratio decreases with increased flow but increases with increased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption. These conclusions make intuitive sense. Greater flow supplies more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, so the tissue needs to extract a smaller fraction of the incoming $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to satisfy its fixed needs. Conversely, increased metabolic demands require that the tissue extract more of the incoming $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. These conclusions are merely a restatement of the Fick principle (see p. 423), which we can rewrite as

$$
\underbrace{\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{a}-\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{v}}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Related to } \\
\text { extraction ratio }
\end{array}}=\frac{\dot{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{F}
$$

The term on the left is the a-v difference. The extraction ratio is merely the a-v difference normalized to $\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{a}$. Thus, the Fick principle confirms our intuition that the extraction ratio should increase with increasing metabolic demand but decrease with increasing flow.

Another important factor that we have so far ignored is that not all of the capillaries in a tissue may be active at any one time. For example, skeletal muscle contains roughly a half million capillaries per gram of tissue. However, only $\sim 20 \%$ are perfused at rest (see Fig. 20-4B). During exercise, when the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption of the muscle increases, the resistance vessels and precapillary sphincters dilate to meet the increased demand. This vasodilation increases muscle blood flow and the density of perfused capillaries (see Fig. 20-4C). This response is equivalent to decreasing the tissue radius of Krogh's cylinder because each perfused capillary now supplies a smaller region. Other things being equal, reduced diffusion distances cause $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the tissue to increase.

The velocity of blood flow in the capillaries also increases during exercise. All things being equal, this increased velocity would cause $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ to fall less steeply along the capillary lumen. For example, if the velocity were infinite, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ would not fall at all! In fact, because $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption rises during exercise, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ actually falls more steeply along the capillary.

## According to Fick's law, the diffusion of small water-soluble solutes across a capillary wall depends on both the permeability and the concentration gradient

Although the endothelial cell is freely permeable to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, it offers a significant barrier to the exchange of lipidinsoluble substances. Hydrophilic solutes that are smaller than albumin can traverse the capillary wall by diffusion via a paracellular route (i.e., through the clefts and interendothelial junctions as well as gaps and fenestrae, if these are present).

# N20-1 Limitations of Krogh's Tissue-Cylinder Model 

## Contributed by Emile L. Boulpaep

Krogh's tissue-cylinder model (see Fig. 20-4A), which describes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ exchange between the capillary and surrounding tissue, is based on several simplifying-but criticalassumptions.

1. The model assumes that the capillary displays cylindrical symmetry around a central axis, so that only two spatial dimensions must be considered (i.e., $x$ and $r$ in Fig. 20-4A).
2. The model is correct only for the idealized case of capillaries that run in parallel, start and end in the same plane, and carry blood in the same direction.
3. The model neglects any longitudinal diffusion of gas along the $x$-axis within the tissue and the blood. In other words, Krogh assumes that blood flow is the sole mode for gas to move along the $x$-axis.
4. The model requires that the capillary wall itself does not constitute a rate-limiting barrier to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport; that is, the permeability of the endothelial membranes to these gases is similar to the diffusion properties of the bulk phase. In other words, as stated in point 4 on page 464, the radial diffusion coefficient $(D)$ is uniform within the blood vessel, the vessel wall, and the surrounding tissue.
5. Krogh assumes that there is no $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ flow into or out of the tissue cylinder across the cylinder's outer boundary (i.e., beyond the radius, $r$ ). In a regular array of identical tissue cylinders, each neighboring tissue cylinder would have the same $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ at its outer boundary (see Fig. 20-4C). Therefore, there would be no $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ difference to drive $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion from one tissue cylinder to another.
6. The model assumes a steady state. There are no transients; $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is a function of position, not of time.
7. The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption of the tissue must be constant.
8. The upstream $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the capillary must be constant. Investigators have generated more complicated models that include different geometries of capillary distribution and also incorporate (1) the effects of pH and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ changes on the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity of hemoglobin (see pp. 652 and 653-654, as well as Fig. 29-5); (2) the effects of changes in oxygen solubility on the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of the blood; and (3) the effects of changes in the amount of hemoglobin and its affinity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which even more strongly affects the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of the blood.

The amount of solute that crosses a particular surface area of a capillary per unit time is called a flux. It seems intuitive that the flux ought to be proportional to the magnitude of the concentration difference across the capillary wall and that it ought to be bigger in leakier capillaries (Fig. 20-5). These ideas are embodied in a form of Fick's law: (5) N20-2

$$
J_{\mathrm{X}}=P_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot\left(\left[\mathrm{X}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}-[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{f}}\right)
$$

In Figure 20-5 and Equation 20-4, $J_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the flux of the solute X (units: moles $/\left[\mathrm{cm}^{2} \mathrm{~s}\right]$ ), assuming a positive $J_{\mathrm{X}}$ with flow out of the capillary, into the interstitial fluid. $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{f}}$ are the dissolved concentrations of the solute in the capillary and interstitial fluid, respectively. Because the capillary wall thickness $a$ (units: cm ) is difficult to determine, we combined the diffusion coefficient $D_{\mathrm{X}}\left(\right.$ units: $\left.\mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}\right)$ and wall thickness into a single term $\left(D_{\mathrm{X}} / a\right)$ called $P_{\mathrm{X}}$, the permeability coefficient (units: $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{s}$ ). Thus, $P_{\mathrm{X}}$ expresses the ease with which the solute crosses a capillary by diffusion.

Because, in practice, the surface area $(S)$ of the capillary is often unknown, it is impossible to compute the flux of a solute, which is expressed per unit area. Rather, it is more

common to compute the mass flow $(\dot{Q})$, which is simply the amount of solute transferred per unit time (units: moles/s):

$$
\dot{Q}=S \cdot J_{\mathrm{X}}=S \cdot P_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot\left(\left[\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{c}}-[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{f}}\right)\right.
$$

## The whole-organ extraction ratio for small hydrophilic solutes provides an estimate of the solute permeability of capillaries

How could we estimate the permeability coefficient for a solute in different capillaries or for different solutes in the same capillary? Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine permeability coefficients in single capillaries. Therefore, investigators use an indirect approach that begins with measurement of the whole-organ extraction ratio for the solute X. As we have already seen for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see Equation 20-1), the extraction ratio $\left(E_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ is a normalized a-v difference for X :

$$
E_{\mathrm{X}}=\frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{a}}-[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{v}}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{a}}}
$$

Thus, $E_{\mathrm{X}}$ describes the degree to which an organ removes a solute from the circulation. Unlike the situation for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, the extraction ratio for small hydrophilic solutes depends not only on total organ blood flow $(F)$ but also on the overall "exchange properties" of all of its capillaries, expressed by the product of permeability and total capillary area $\left(P_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot S\right)$. The dependence of $E_{\mathrm{X}}$ on the $P_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot S$ product and $F$ is described by the following equation:

$$
E_{\mathrm{X}}=1-e^{-\left(P_{\mathrm{x}} S / F\right)}
$$

Therefore, by knowing the whole-organ extraction ratio for a solute and blood flow through the organ, we can calculate the product $P_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot S$. The second column of Table 20-1 lists the $P_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot S$ products for a single solute (inulin), determined from Equation 20-7, for a number of different organs. Armed with independent estimates of the capillary surface area (see Table 20-1, column 3), we can compute $P_{\mathrm{X}}$ (column 4). $P_{\mathrm{X}}$ increases by a factor of -4 from resting skeletal muscle to heart, which reflects a difference in the density of fluid-filled interendothelial clefts. Because a much greater fraction of the capillaries in the heart are open to blood flow (i.e., $S$ is $\sim 10$-fold larger), the $P_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot S$ product for heart is $\sim 40$-fold higher than that for resting skeletal muscle.

# N20-2 Fick's Law 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

The passive movement of a small solute ( X ) across any surface can be described by Fick's law:

$$
J_{a}=-D \frac{\partial[X]}{\partial z}
$$

where $J_{a}$ is the flux of solute (units: moles $\cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \cdot \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ), assuming a positive $J_{a}$ in the direction of increasing distance $z$. $D$ is the diffusion coefficient in $\mathrm{cm}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, and $\partial(\mathrm{X}) / \partial z$ is the concentration gradient of $X$ (units: moles $\cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \cdot \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ) along the $z$ axis. In the case of a solute crossing a capillary wall (see Fig. 20-5), we assume that the concentration of the solute in the bulk phase of the capillary $\left([\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$, as well as in the bulk phase of the interstitial fluid $\left([\mathrm{X}]_{0}\right)$, is constant and uniform. We also assume that the diffusion distance along the axis of diffusion $(z)$ is equal to the thickness of the capillary wall (a). We can then rewrite Fick's law as

$$
J_{a}=-D_{a} \frac{[X]_{a}-[X]_{c}}{z_{a}-z_{c}}=D_{a} \frac{[X]_{c}-[X]_{c}}{a}
$$

Because the wall thickness (a) is hard to determine, one often combines the terms $D_{a}$ and $a$ into a single permeability coefficient $P$ (units: $\mathrm{cm} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ), defined as $P_{a}=D_{a} / a$. The permeability coefficient is an expression of the ease with which a solute crosses a membrane, driven by the concentration difference. Therefore, the flux of a solute becomes

$$
J_{R}=P_{R} \cdot\left([X]_{c}-[X]_{d}\right)
$$

Equation NE 20-3 is the same as Equation 20-4.

The cerebral vessels have unique characteristics that constitute the basis of the blood-brain barrier (see p. 284). The tight junctions of most brain capillaries do not permit any paracellular flow of hydrophilic solutes; therefore, they exhibit a very low permeability to sucrose or inulin, probably because of the abundant presence of CLDN5 and occludin. In contrast, the water permeability of cerebral vessels is similar to that of other organs. Therefore, a large fraction of water exchange in cerebral vessels must occur through the endothelial cells.

Whole-organ $P_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot S$ values are not constant. First, arterioles and precapillary sphincters control the number of capillaries being perfused and thus the available surface area (S). Second, in response to a variety of signaling molecules (e.g., cytokines), endothelial cells can reorganize their cytoskeleton, thereby changing their shape. This deformation widens interendothelial clefts and increases $P_{\mathrm{X}}$. One example is the increased leakiness that develops during inflammation in response to the secretion of histamine by mast cells and basophilic granulocytes. (5) N20-3

## Small polar molecules have a relatively low permeability because they can traverse the capillary wall only by diffusing through water-filled pores (small-pore effect)

Having compared the permeabilities of a single hydrophilic solute (inulin) in several capillary beds, we can address the selectivity of a single capillary wall to several solutes. Table 20-2 shows that the permeability coefficient falls as molecular radius rises. For lipid-soluble substances such as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which can diffuse through the entire capillary endothelial cell and not just the water-filled pathways, the permeability
is much larger than for the solutes in Table 20-2. Early physiologists had modeled endothelial permeability for hydrophilic solutes on the basis of two sets of pores: (5) N20-4 large pores with a diameter of $\sim 10 \mathrm{~nm}$ or more and a larger number of small pores with an equivalent radius of 3 nm . Small water-soluble, polar molecules have a relatively low permeability because they can diffuse only by a paracellular path through interendothelial clefts or other water-filled pathways, which constitute only a fraction of the total capillary area. Discontinuities or gaps in tight-junction strands could form the basis for the small pores. Alternatively, the molecular sieving properties of the small pores may reside in a fiber matrix (Fig. 20-6) that consists of either a meshwork of glycoproteins in the paracellular clefts (on the

## N20-3 Effect of Inflammation on Capillary Leakiness

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Endothelial tight junctions are regulated by a wide variety of signaling mechanisms, including cytokines; extracellular [Ca ${ }^{2+}$ ]; G proteins; intracellular [cAMP] and $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$; serine, threonine, and tyrosine kinases; and proteases. The increased endothelial permeability induced by the inflammatory response can result from two general mechanisms. First, increased tension caused by actomyosin/cytoskeletal contractility can change the shape of cells and pull individual endothelial cells apart. Second, intercellular adhesion can be decreased by breakdown or modulation of the intercellular junctions.

Histamine increases vascular permeability by causing transitory gaps of 100 to 400 nm between adjacent endothelial cells. These gaps occur without any detectable increased tension within the cells. Instead, histamine alters the adhering junctions between endothelial cells, particularly the adhesions that are based on vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin; see "Cadherin Terminology" below). Among the cell-cell adhesion molecules (see p. 17), the type I cadherins (i.e., $\mathrm{E}^{-}$, $\mathrm{N}^{-}$, and P -cadherin) associate with cortical actin filaments via $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-catenin, whereas VE-cadherin is a type II cadherin that is linked not only to cortical actin by $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-catenin, but also to the intermediate filament protein vimentin (see p. 23) via $\gamma$-catenin and desmoplakin. Endothelial cells respond to histamine with an increase in intracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, which stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and $\gamma$-catenin. How these phosphorylation events affect the link of VE-cadherin with the vimentin cytoskeleton is not known.

## N20-4 Pore Theory

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

The "pore theory" has been the main model of capillary permeability for a long time. Many studies have attempted to relate the permeability of solutes of various molecular weights to the geometry of hypothetical fluid-filled transendothelial channels, clefts, fenestrations, and gaps (see p. 462). Investigators have used the whole-organ extraction of molecular probes to estimate the size of a pore that would be necessary to allow movement of these probes at the observed rates. The result can then be used to estimate the number or density of pores, assuming that they have a fixed size and geometry. However, structural studies of capillary endothelial cells of various organs have failed to corroborate the initial formulation of the pore theory. Electron microscopic examination reveals that, in tissues such as muscle, transendothelial channels and the junctions between endothelial cells would allow the passage of substances of a molecular radius of 5 nm , exceeding that of inulin. The fenestrae in other tissues-such as the intestine, the kidney, and some glands-have even wider openings, 60 to 80 nm in diameter. However, except in glomerular capillaries, these openings are mostly covered by a thin diaphragm (see p. 727). Thus, the diverse overall geometry, size, and number of the transendothelial channels, clefts, and fenestrae in endothelia do not agree with the limited sets of pores that have been postulated based on pore theory. On the other hand, investigators measuring solute exchange at the level of a single perfused capillary-which is a far simpler system than a whole organ-are beginning to resolve the discrepancy between whole-organ permeability measurements and the images obtained by electron microscopy.

abluminal side of the tight junctions) or the glycocalyx on the surface of the endothelial cell (on the luminal side of the tight junctions). The endothelium-specific, calciumdependent adhesion molecule VE-cadherin (CDH5; see p. 17) and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1, or CD31 antigen) are important glycoprotein components of the postulated fiber matrix in the paracellular clefts. In fact, the small-pore effect is best explained by an arrangement of discontinuities in the tight junctional strands in series with a fiber matrix on either side of the tight junction.

Interendothelial clefts are wider-and fenestrae are more common-at the venular end of the capillary than at its arteriolar end, so that $P_{\mathrm{E}}$ increases along the capillary. Therefore, if the transcapillary concentration difference $\left([\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{c}}-[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{d}}\right)$ were the same, the solute flux would actually be larger at the venous end of the microcirculation.

Small proteins can also diffuse across interendothelial clefts or through fenestrae. In addition to molecular size, the electrical charge of proteins and other macromolecules is a major determinant of their apparent permeability coefficient. In general, the flux of negatively charged proteins is much smaller than that of neutral macromolecules of equivalent size, whereas positively charged macromolecules have the highest apparent permeability coefficient. Fixed negative charges in the endothelial glycocalyx exclude macromolecules with negative charge and favor the transit of macromolecules with positive charge. Selective permeability based on the electrical charge of the solute is a striking feature of the filtration of proteins across the glomerular barrier of the nephron (see pp. 742-743).

The diffusive movement of solutes is the dominant mode of transcapillary exchange. However, the convective movement of water can also carry solutes. This solvent drag is the flux of a dissolved solute that is swept along by the bulk movement of the solvent. Compared with the diffusive flux of a small solute with a high permeability coefficient (e.g., glucose), the contribution of solvent drag is minor.

## The exchange of macromolecules across capillaries can occur by transcytosis (large-pore effect)

Macromolecules with a radius $>1 \mathrm{~nm}$ (e.g., plasma proteins) can cross the capillary, at a low rate, through wide intercellular clefts, fenestrations, and gaps-when these are present. However, it is caveolae (see p. 461) that are predominantly responsible for the large-pore effect that allows transcellular translocation of macromolecules. The transcytosis of very large macromolecules by vesicular transport involves (1) equilibration of dissolved macromolecules in the capillary lumen with the fluid phase inside the open vesicle; (2) pinching off of the vesicle; (3) vesicle shuttling to the cytoplasm and probably transient fusion with other vesicles within the cytoplasm, allowing intermixing of the vesicular content; (4) fusion of vesicles with the opposite plasma membrane; and (5) equilibration with the opposite extracellular fluid phase.

Although one can express the transcytotic movement of macromolecules as a flux, the laws of diffusion (see Equation 20-4) do not govern transcytosis. Nevertheless, investigators have calculated the "apparent permeability" of typical capillaries to macromolecules (Table 20-3). The resulting

"permeability"-which reflects the total movement of the macromolecule, regardless of the pathway-falls off steeply with increases in molecular radius, a feature called sieving. This sieving may be the result of steric hindrance when large macromolecules equilibrate across the neck of nascent vesicles or when a network of glycoproteins in the glycocalyx above the vesicle excludes the large macromolecules. In addition, sieving of macromolecules according to molecular size could occur as macromolecules diffuse through infrequent chains of fused vesicles that span the full width of the endothelial cell. 0 N20-5

Transcytosis is not as simple as the luminal loading and basal unloading of ferryboats-the cell may process some of the cargo. Although the luminal surface of endothelial cells avidly takes up ferritin ( 750 kDa ), only a tiny portion of endocytosed ferritin translocates to the opposite side of the cell (see Table 20-3). The remainder stays for a time in intracellular compartments, where it is finally broken down.

Both transcytosis and chains of fused vesicles are less prominent in brain capillaries. The presence of continuous tight junctions and the low level of transcytosis account for the blood-brain barrier's much lower apparent permeability to macromolecules.

## CAPILLARY EXCHANGE OF WATER

## Fluid transfer across capillaries is convective and depends on net hydrostatic and osmotic forces (i.e., Starling forces)

The pathway for fluid movement across the capillary wall is a combination of transcellular and paracellular pathways. Endothelial cell membranes express constitutively active aquaporin 1 (AQP1) water channels (see p. 110). It is likely that AQP1 constitutes the principal transcellular pathway for water movement. The interendothelial clefts, fenestrae, or gaps may be the anatomical substrate of the paracellular pathway.

Whereas the main mechanism for the transfer of gases and other solutes is diffusion, the main mechanism for the net transfer of fluid across the capillary membrane is convection. As first outlined in 1896 by Ernest Starling, (0) N20-6 the two driving forces for the convection of fluidor bulk water movement-across the capillary wall are the transcapillary hydrostatic pressure difference and effective osmotic pressure difference, also known as the colloid osmotic pressure or oncotic pressure difference (see p. 128).

## N20-5 Fast Versus Slow Pathways for Exchange of Macromolecules Across Capillary Walls

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Classical transcytosis provides a relatively slow pathway. A fast pathway is provided by the infrequent transient chains of fused vesicles that happen to span the full width of the endothelial cell. Any degree of differential diffusion through this fast pathway will manifest itself as sieving.

## N20-6 Ernest Henry Starling

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Ernest Starling (1866-1927) was born in London and educated at Guy's Hospital Medical School (MB, 1889). Upon graduation, he became a demonstrator in physiology at Guy's. In 1890 he began part-time work at University College, London, where he soon began a lifelong association with Sir William M. Bayliss.

Starling was professor of physiology at University College, London, where he did pioneering work in two cardiovascular areas, the heart and the microcirculation. His name is attached to Starling's law of the heart, which describes the dependence of stroke volume on end-diastolic volume (see pp. 524-526) and the Starling equation, which describes the movement of fluid across the capillary wall (see pp. 467-468). In addition, Starling and Bayliss together introduced the concept of a hormone and coined the term as part of their discovery of secretin, the first hormone identified. He and Bayliss also showed that intestinal peristalsis is a ganglionic reflex.

Starling's textbook Principles of Human Physiology (1912; 14th edition with Sir Charles A. Evans, 1968) was a standard physiology textbook in the first half of the 20th century.

*Alternatively, the leakiness of the capillary wall to water may be expressed in terms of water permeability ( $P_{\mathrm{a}}$ units: $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{s}$ ) $\bigcirc$ N20-7 In this case, the hydrostatic and osmotic forces are given in the units of osmolality.

The hydrostatic pressure difference $(\Delta P)$ across the capillary wall is the difference between the intravascular pressure (i.e., capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_{\mathrm{c}}$ ) and the extravascular pressure (i.e., interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure, $P_{\mathrm{d}}$ ). Note that the term hydrostatic includes all sources of intravascular pressure, not only that derived from gravity; we use it here in opposition to osmotic.

The colloid osmotic pressure difference $(\Delta \pi)$ across the capillary wall is the difference between the intravascular colloid osmotic pressure caused by plasma proteins $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$ and the extravascular colloid osmotic pressure caused by interstitial proteins and proteoglycans $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{d}}\right)$. A positive $\Delta P$ tends to drive water out of the capillary lumen, whereas a positive $\Delta \pi$ attracts water into the capillary lumen.

Starling's hypothesis to describe the volume flow $(F)$ or volume flux $\left(J_{\mathrm{V}}\right)$ of fluid across the capillary wall is embodied in the following equation, which is similar to Equation 5-26:

Table 20-4 describes the terms in this equation. The equation is written so that the flux of water leaving the capillary is positive and that of fluid entering the capillary is negative.

The hydraulic conductivity $\left(L_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ ( $\mathrm{N} 20-7$ is the proportionality constant that relates the net driving force to $J_{\mathrm{V}}$ and expresses the total permeability provided by the ensemble of AQP1 channels and the paracellular pathway.

According to van't Hoff's law, the theoretical colloid osmotic pressure difference $\left(\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}\right)$ is proportional to the protein concentration difference $(\Delta[\mathrm{X}])$ :

$$
\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}=R T \Delta[\mathrm{X}]
$$

However, because capillary walls exclude proteins imperfectly, the observed colloid osmotic pressure difference
$\left(\Delta \pi_{\text {obs }}\right)$ is less than the ideal. The ratio $\Delta \pi_{\text {obs }} / \Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}$ is the reflection coefficient $(\sigma) \bigcirc$ N20-8 that describes how a semipermeable barrier excludes or "reflects" solute X as water moves across the barrier, driven by hydrostatic or osmotic pressure gradients.

The value of $\sigma$ can range from 0 to 1 . When $\sigma$ is zero, the moving water perfectly "entrains" the solute, which moves with the water and exerts no osmotic pressure across the barrier. When $\sigma$ is 1 , the barrier completely excludes the solute as the water passes through, and the solute exerts its full or ideal osmotic pressure. To the extent that $\sigma$ exceeds zero, the membrane sieves out the solute. The $\sigma$ for plasma proteins is nearly 1 .

Because small solutes such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$freely cross the endothelium, their $\sigma$ is zero, and they are not included in the Starling equation for the capillary wall (see Equation 20-8). Thus, changing the intravascular or interstitial concentrations of such "crystalloids" does not create a net effective osmotic driving force across the capillary wall. (Conversely, because plasma membranes have an effective $\sigma_{\mathrm{NaCl}}=1, \mathrm{NaCl}$ gradients do shift water between the intracellular and interstitial compartments.)

The net driving force in the Starling equation (see Equation 20-8), $\left[\left(P_{\mathrm{c}}-P_{\mathrm{d}}\right)-\sigma\left(\pi_{\mathrm{c}}-\pi_{\mathrm{d}}\right)\right]$, has a special name, the net filtration pressure. Filtration of fluid from the capillary into the tissue space occurs when the net filtration pressure is positive. In the special case where $\sigma$ for proteins is 1 , the fluid leaving the capillary is protein free; this process is called ultrafiltration. Conversely, absorption of fluid from the tissue space into the vascular space occurs when the net filtration pressure is negative. At the arterial end of the capillary, the net filtration pressure is generally positive, so that filtration occurs. At the venous end, the net filtration pressure is generally negative, so that absorption occurs. However, as is discussed below, some organs do not adhere to this general rule.

In the next four sections, we examine each of the four Starling forces that constitute the net filtration pressure: $P_{\mathrm{c}}$, $P_{\mathrm{d}}, \pi_{\mathrm{c}}$, and $\pi_{\mathrm{d}}$.

## N20-7 Hydraulic Conductivity Versus Water Permeability Coefficient

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

The hydraulic conductivity $\left(L_{h}\right)$ is the coefficient that relates water flux $J_{V}$ (units: $\mathrm{cm}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{~cm}^{-2} \cdot \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ) to the net driving force in units of pressure ( $\Delta P$ or $\Delta \pi$; units: mm Hg ).

$$
J_{V}=L_{h}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\left(P_{L}-P_{H}\right)-\sigma \cdot\left(\pi_{v}-\pi_{A}\right) \\
\frac{\Delta P}{P_{L}} \\
\text { Hydrostatic } \\
\text { pressure } \\
\text { difference }
\end{array}\right]
$$

Net filtration pressure
i.e., net driving force

Thus, the units of $L_{h}$ are $\mathrm{cm} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-1} \cdot(\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})^{-1}$. These are the terms used in Equation 20-8 and in Table 20-4.

The water permeability coefficient or osmotic permeability coefficient or filtration coefficient $(P)$ is the coefficient that relates water flux $\left(J_{V}\right.$; units: moles $\cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \cdot \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ) to the net driving force of water in units of concentration difference $(\Delta[\mathrm{X}]$; units: moles $\cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ ):

$$
J_{V}=P_{1} \Delta[X]
$$

Thus, the units of $P_{1}$ are $\mathrm{cm} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
What is the relationship between the two proportionality factors $L_{h}$ and $P_{1}$ ? It can be shown that

$$
P_{1}=\left(\frac{R T}{V_{t e}}\right) L_{p}
$$

Here, $R$ is the universal gas constant $(0.082055 \mathrm{~atm} \cdot \mathrm{~L}$. mole $^{-1} \cdot \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ ) $=62.4 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} \cdot \mathrm{L} \cdot$ mole $^{-1} \cdot \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ ), $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $V_{t e}$ is the partial molar volume of water ( 0.018 L $\cdot$ mole $^{-1}$ ). Note that the $P_{1}-L_{p}$ conversion factor depends on temperature. At $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$,

$$
\frac{R T}{V_{t e}}=\frac{62.4(\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}) \mathrm{L} \cdot \mathrm{~mole}^{-1} \cdot \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \cdot 310 \mathrm{~K}}{0.018 \mathrm{~L} \cdot \mathrm{~mole}^{-1}}=1,074,667 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}
$$

(NE 20-7)
Thus, at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$,

$$
P_{1}=(1,074,667 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}) L_{p}
$$

(NE 20-8)
This conversion makes sense because multiplying $L_{p}$, which is in units of $\mathrm{cm} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-1} \cdot(\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})^{-1}$ by $(\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg})$ yields $\mathrm{cm} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which are the units of $P_{1}$.

## N20-8 Reflection Coefficient

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

## Lest we forget ... she is still here!

If a semipermeable membrane excludes a solute (X) perfectly, then a concentration difference of the solute $X(\Delta[X])$ generates an osmotic pressure difference that is exactly the same as the theoretically predicted value (see Equation 20-9, reproduced here):

$$
\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}=R T \Delta[X]
$$

$($ NE 20-9)
Here, $R$ is the gas constant $(0.082055 \mathrm{~atm} \cdot \mathrm{~L} \cdot \mathrm{~mole}^{-1}$. $\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ ) and $T$ is the absolute temperature (K). Equation NE 20-9 is known as van't Hoff's law. Because $R T$ at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ equals 25.4 $\mathrm{atm} \cdot \mathrm{L} \cdot \mathrm{~mole}^{-1}$ or $19,332 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} \cdot \mathrm{L} \cdot \mathrm{~mole}^{-1}$, an osmotic pressure difference of 1 mM should exert an ideal osmotic pressure $\left(\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}\right)$ of 19.3 mm Hg (see p. 128).

If, on the other hand, the membrane excludes the solute imperfectly, the observed osmotic pressure $\left(\Delta \pi_{\text {obs }}\right)$ is less than the ideal. The reflection coefficient for solute $\mathbf{X}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$ is the ratio of the observed to the predicted osmotic pressure:

$$
\sigma=\frac{\Delta \pi_{\text {obs }}}{\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}}
$$

(NE 20-10)
The reflection coefficient is the property of a semipermeable membrane that causes the observed osmotic pressure $\left(\pi_{\text {obs }}\right)$-generated by a concentration difference $\Delta[\mathrm{X}]$-to be less than the theoretical osmotic pressure for an ideal membrane $\left(\pi_{\text {theory }}\right)$. The reflection coefficient is dimensionless and ranges between 0 and 1 . When $\sigma=1$, the membrane excludes the solute perfectly and is an ideal osmometer. When $\sigma=0$, the membrane treats the solute the same as water, and the solute generates no osmotic pressure.

Because the capillary endothelium has multiple "permeability" pathways for macromolecules, and because the permeability is different for different macromolecules, the $\sigma$ in Equation 20-8 (reproduced here)

$$
\left.\begin{array}{l}
J_{V}=L_{p}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\left(P_{L}-P_{H}\right)-\sigma \cdot\left(\pi_{v}-\pi_{A}\right) \\
\frac{\Delta P}{P_{L}} \\
\text { Hydrostatic } \\

\text { difference }
\end{array}\right] \quad \begin{array}{c}
\Delta \pi \\

\end{array} \right\rvert\,
$$

is actually the average reflection coefficient of proteins by the capillary wall.

## Capillary blood pressure $\left(P_{c}\right)$ falls from $\sim 35 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at the arteriolar end to $\sim 15 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at the venular end

Capillary blood pressure is also loosely called the capillary hydrostatic pressure, to distinguish it from capillary colloid osmotic pressure. It is possible to record $P_{c}$ only in an exposed organ, ideally in a thin tissue (e.g., a mesentery) that allows good transillumination. One impales the lumen of the capillary with a fine micropipette (tip diameter $<5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ) filled with saline and heparin. The micropipette lumen connects to a manometer, which has a sidearm to a syringe. Immediately after the impalement, blood begins to rise slowly up the pipette. A pressure reading at this time would underestimate the actual $P_{c}$ because pipette pressure is less than $P_{v}$. The syringe makes it possible to apply just enough pressure to the pipette lumen to reach true pressure equilibrium-when fluid flows neither from nor to the pipette. By use of this null-point approach, the recorded pressure is the true $P_{v}$. In the human skin, $P_{v}$ is $\sim 35 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at the arteriolar end and $\sim 15 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at the venular end.

When the arteriolar pressure is 60 mm Hg and the venular pressure is 15 mm Hg , the midcapillary pressure is not the mean value of 37.5 mm Hg but only 25 mm Hg (Table 20-5, top row). The explanation for the difference is that normally the precapillary upstream resistance exceeds the postcapillary downstream resistance ( $R_{\text {pref }} / R_{\text {pre }}$ is typically 0.3 ; see pp. 451-452). However, the midcapillary pressure is not a constant and uniform value. In the previous chapter, we saw that $P_{c}$ varies with changes in $R_{\text {pre }}$ and $R_{\text {post }}$ (see Equation 19-3). $P_{c}$ also varies with changes in four other parameters: (1) upstream and downstream pressure, (2) location, (3) time, and (4) gravity.

Arteriolar $\left(P_{c}\right)$ and Venular $\left(P_{v}\right)$ Pressure Because $R_{\text {post }}$ is less than $R_{\text {pre }}, P_{c}$ follows $P_{v}$ more closely than $P_{a}$ (see p. 451). Thus, increasing $P_{a}$ by $10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}-$ at a constant $R_{\text {pref }} / R_{\text {pre }}$ of 0.3 -causes $P_{c}$ to rise by only 2 mm Hg (see Table 20-5, middle row). On the other hand, increasing $P_{v}$ by 10 mm Hg causes $P_{c}$ to rise by 8 mm Hg (see Table 20-5, bottom row).

Location Capillary pressure differs markedly among tissues. For example, the high $P_{c}$ of glomerular capillaries in the kidney, $\sim 50 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (see p. 744), is required for ultrafiltration. The retinal capillaries in the eye must also have a high $P_{c}$ because they bathe in a vitreous humor that is under a pressure of $\sim 20 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (see pp. 360-361). A higher $P_{c}$ is needed to keep the capillaries patent in the face of the external compressing force. The pulmonary capillaries have

TABLE 20-5 Effect of Upstream and Downstream Pressure Changes on Capillary Pressure*

| Control | 60 | 25 | 15 |
| Increased arteriolar <br> pressure | 70 | 27 | 15 |

unusually low $P_{c}$ values, 5 to 15 mm Hg , which minimizes the ultrafiltration that otherwise would lead to the accumulation of edema fluid in the alveolar air spaces (see p. 684).

Time Capillary blood pressure varies considerably from moment to moment at any given site, depending on the arteriolar diameter and tone of the precapillary sphincter (i.e., $R_{\text {pre }}$ ). In individual capillaries, these fluctuations lead to times of net filtration and other times of net fluid absorption.

Gravity Finally, the effect of gravity on $P_{c}$ is the same as that discussed for arterial and venous pressure. Thus, a capillary bed below the level of the heart has a higher $P_{c}$ than a capillary bed at the level of the heart.

## Interstitial fluid pressure $\left(P_{i f}\right)$ is slightly negative, except in encapsulated organs

The interstitium consists of both a solid and a liquid phase. The solid phase is made up of collagen fibers and proteoglycans. In the liquid phase, only a small fraction of interstitial water is totally "free" and capable of moving under the influence of convective forces. Most of the water is trapped in gels (e.g., proteoglycans), in which both water and small solutes move by diffusion. It was once thought that $P_{i f}$ in the liquid phase is slightly above barometric pressure throughout the interstitium, but more recent measurements indicate that $P_{i f}$ is subatmospheric in many tissues.

Estimation of $P_{i f}$ is very difficult because the probe used to make the measurement is far larger than the interstitial space; thus, the measurement itself can alter $P_{i f}$. If one inserts a probe percutaneously and immediately uses a null-point method (5) N20-9 to measure $P_{i f}$ (as outlined above for capillary pressure), the values are +1 to +2 mm Hg . However, during the next 4 to 5 hours, the measured value drops to -1 to -2 mm Hg . Arthur Guyton implanted a perforated, hollow plastic sphere under the skin to provide a long-term record of $P_{i f}$ (Fig. 20-7). After the wound has healed, the pressure inside the sphere may be as low as $\sim 2$ to $\sim 10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$

# N20-9 Null-Point Technique for Measuring Interstitial Pressure 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

As pointed out on pages 469-470, measuring interstitial pressure $\left(P_{i}\right)$ is technically challenging. If one measures $P_{i}$ by inserting a small needle percutaneously and immediately recording the pressure needed to force fluid out of the needle and into the interstitial fluid, one obtains values of +1 to +5 mm Hg . However, this approach suffers from some weaknesses. First, the very act of pushing fluid out of the needle distorts the narrow interstitial spaces during this brief measurement. Second, the interstitial fluid is actually in several microcompartments that are separated by connective tissue; the fluid injected cannot communicate freely among all of these microcompartments. As a result, one would have to wait a very long time for the distortions to dissipate.

A "null-point" method overcomes some of the aforementioned difficulties. In this case, the experimenter makes upward and downward adjustments to the pressure inside the probe in an effort to avoid any net movement of fluid into or out of the interstitial fluid (i.e., out of or into the needle). In brief experiments, this null-point method for measuring $P_{i}$ (see p. 469), yields values of +1 to +2 mm Hg . However, during the next 4 to 5 hours, the measured value drops to -1 to -2 mm Hg . Thus, the short-term measurements of $\mathrm{P}_{i}$ even those using a null-point method-are intrinsically flawed. As outlined in the text, Guyton overcame these shortcomings by obtaining a long-term record of $P_{i}$.

after 1 or 2 weeks. Another approach, the wick-in-needle technique, also yields subatmospheric values.

A value of -2 mm Hg is a reasonable average in loose tissues, such as the lung and subcutaneous tissue. $P_{d}$ is slightly negative because of fluid removal by the lymphatics (see below). Inside rigid enclosed compartments, such as the bone marrow or brain, $P_{d}$ is positive. It is also positive in encapsulated organs such as the kidney, where $P_{d}$ is +1 to +3 mm Hg within the parenchyma. Expansion of high-pressure vessels in the kidney pushes the interstitial fluid against an unyielding fibrous capsule, raising $P_{d}$. The same principle applies to skeletal muscle, which is surrounded by layers of fascia. In some cases, it is not the interstitial fluid but another specialized compartment that provides the pressure around the capillaries. For renal glomerular capillaries, it is Bowman's space (see pp. 743-744)-filled with glomerular filtrate to a pressure of about +10 mm Hg -that is the relevant outside compartment. For pulmonary capillaries, the relevant outside compartment is the alveolus, the pressure of which varies during the respiratory cycle (see p. 622).
$P_{d}$ is also sensitive to the addition of fluid to the interstitial compartment. When small amounts of fluid are added to the interstitial compartment, the interstitium behaves like a lowcompliance system, so that $P_{d}$ rises steeply for the small amount of added fluid. Adding more fluid disrupts the solid phase of collagen fibers and the gel of proteoglycans, so that large volumes can now accumulate with only small additional pressure increases. In this high-volume range, the interstitial compartment thus behaves like a high-compliance system. This high compliance is especially high in loose subcutaneous tissues, which can accommodate more edema fluid (Box 20-1) than can muscle.

## Capillary colloid osmotic pressure $\left(\pi_{c}\right)$, which reflects the presence of plasma proteins, is $\sim 25 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$

The colloid osmotic pressure difference across the capillary endothelium is due solely to the plasma proteins, such as albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen. Total plasma protein concentration is $\sim 7.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, which corresponds to $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{mM}$ of protein. According to van't Hoff's law (see Equation 20-9), these proteins would exert an osmotic pressure of $\sim 28 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ if perfectly reflected by the capillary wall $(\sigma=1)$. The $\sigma$ is indeed close to 1 for the principal plasma proteins-albumin ( 3.5 to $5.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) and the globulins ( 2.0 to $3.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ )-so that the actual colloid osmotic pressure $\left(\sigma \pi_{c}\right)$ in capillaries is $\sim 25 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. This value is the same as if osmotically active solutes were present at $\sim 1.3 \mathrm{mM}$. Note that because of the very definition of colloid osmotic pressure, we have ignored the osmotic effects of the small solutes in plasma, which have an osmolality of 290 mOsm (see p. 105). (○) N20-10
$\pi_{c}$ does vary appreciably along the length of the capillary. Indeed, most capillary beds filter $<1 \%$ of the fluid entering at the arteriolar end. Thus, the loss of protein-free fluid does not measurably concentrate plasma proteins along the capillary and does not appreciably raise $\pi_{c}$.

Because clinical laboratories report plasma protein concentrations in grams per deciliter and not all proteins have the same molecular weight, a plasma protein concentration of $7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ can produce different $\pi_{c}$ values, depending on the protein composition of the plasma. Because albumin has a

Figure 20-8 Dependence of colloid osmotic pressure on the concentration of plasma proteins. The point on the orange curve indicates that normal plasma, a mixture of proteins at a concentration of $7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, has a colloid osmotic pressure $\left(\pi_{c}\right)$ of 25 mm Hg .
much lower molecular weight than $\gamma$-globulin, replacement of 1 g of the heavier $\gamma$-globulin with 1 g of the lighter albumin raises $\pi_{c}$. Whereas van't Hoff's law (see Equation 20-9) predicts a linear relationship between osmotic pressure and concentration, colloid osmotic pressure actually increases more steeply, even when the albumin/globulin ratio is held constant at 1.8 (Fig. 20-8, orange curve). (○) N20-11 Obviously, the steepness of the curve varies from one plasma protein to the next because all have different molecular weights.

Not only does $\pi_{c}$ vary markedly with protein composition and concentration, the reflection coefficient for colloids also varies widely among organs. The lowest values for $\sigma$ (i.e., greatest leakiness) are in discontinuous capillary beds (e.g., liver); intermediate values are in muscle capillaries; and the highest values $(\sigma=1)$ are in the tight, continuous capillary beds of the brain.

The plasma proteins do more than just act as osmotic agents. Because these proteins also carry negative charges, the Donnan effect (1) N20-12 (see Fig. 5-15) causes an increase in both the concentrations of cations (see p. 104) and the colloid osmotic pressure in the capillary lumen.

## Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure $\left(\pi_{d}\right)$ varies between 0 and 10 mm Hg among different organs

It is difficult to measure the interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure because it is virtually impossible to obtain uncontaminated samples. As a first approximation, we generally assume that $\pi_{d}$ is the same as the colloid osmotic pressure of lymph. The protein content of lymph varies greatly from region to region; for example, it is 1 to $3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ in the legs, 3 to $4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ in the intestine, and 4 to $6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ in the liver. Such lymph data predict that $\pi_{d}$ ranges from 3 to 15 mm Hg . However, the protein concentration in the interstitial fluid is probably somewhat higher than in the lymph. A total-body

## N20-10 Total Osmotic Pressure versus Colloid Osmotic Pressure of Plasma

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

The total osmotic pressure of blood plasma that contains $\sim 290$ milliosmoles/L of solutes can be computed from the van't Hoff equation (see Equation 20-9, reproduced here):

$$
\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}=R T \Delta[X]
$$

(NE 20-9)
As described in (D) N20-8, RT can be expressed as $19,332 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} \cdot \mathrm{L} \cdot \mathrm{mole}^{-1}$. Thus, for a $\Delta[\mathrm{X}]$ of 0.29 moles $/ \mathrm{L}$ (i.e., 290 mOsm ),

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}=R T \Delta[X] \\
=\left(\frac{19,332 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} \times \mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{mole}}\right) \times\left(0.29 \frac{\mathrm{mole}}{\mathrm{~L}}\right)=5597 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}
\end{gathered}
$$

(NE 20-11)
This pressure of 5597 mm Hg corresponds to 7.4 atm . If distilled water were on the opposite side of the capillary endothelium, and if the capillary wall reflected all of the solutes in the blood plasma (i.e., if the wall were perfectly impermeable to all solutes, but permeable to water), then the osmotic pressure difference across the capillary wall would be 7.4 atm . However, these conditions are not valid. First, most of the solutes in blood plasma are also in the interstitial fluid at approximately the same concentrations. Second, even when small concentration differences exist across the capillary wall for these small solutes such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(sometimes called crystalloids), these solutes do not exert any effective osmotic pressure across the capillary wall because they pass with great ease through the capillary wall. That is, these crystalloids have a reflection coefficient in (D) N20-8) of zero.

As stated in the text (see p. 470), the colloid osmotic pressure $\left(\pi_{c}\right)$ of blood plasma is only 25 mm Hg , which is minuscule compared to the total osmotic pressure ( 5597 mm Hg ). The colloid osmotic pressure is generated solely by the concentration difference across the capillary wall of solutes with a reflection coefficient of -1 , that is, the proteins in the blood plasma. The concentration difference for these proteins is $\sim 1.3 \mathrm{mM}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi_{c} & =R T \Delta[X] \\
& =(19.3 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{mM}) \times(1.3 \mathrm{mM}) \\

## N20-11 Effects of Changes in Plasma $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ on Colloid Osmotic Pressure

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

The curves in Figure 20-8 show a nonlinear dependence of colloid osmotic pressure on the concentration of plasma proteins. The nonlinearity of the curves becomes clinically significant when a gain or loss of plasma water alters the plasma protein concentration. As expected, identical increases or decreases in plasma $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$-caused by gain or loss in extracellular fluid-exert changes in colloid osmotic pressure that are of opposite sign. However, the changes in colloid osmotic pressure are not identical in magnitude.

For instance, if we assume a normal plasma volume of 3000 mL and a plasma protein concentration of $7.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, then a $300-\mathrm{mL}$ loss of plasma $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ will increase plasma protein concentration to $7.78 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ (a gain of $0.78 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), whereas a $300-\mathrm{mL}$ gain of plasma $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ will decrease plasma protein concentration to $6.36 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ (a loss of $0.64 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). These two identical changes in plasma $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ do not result in the same change in colloid osmotic pressure. First, the absolute change in plasma protein concentration is less for 300 mL of overhydration than for 300 mL of dehydration. Second, because the "Normal plasma" curve in Figure 20-8 is nonlinear, the change in colloid osmotic pressure is larger in the direction of increased protein concentration (i.e., during dehydration, when the curves in Fig. 20-8 are becoming steeper) than in the direction of decreased protein concentration (i.e., during an equivalent overhydration).

# N20-12 Donnan Effect Across the Capillary Wall 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Plasma proteins do more than act as osmotic agents. They also carry net negative charges. Thus, albumin and other plasma proteins can act as the counterbalancing anion for some of the cations in blood plasma. Because the endothelium is relatively impermeable to proteins, the protein concentration in the interstitial fluid is lower than that in the capillary. The result is a "Donnan effect" (see p. 104) across the endothelial wall, so that at equilibrium the composition of cations and anions in the interstitial fluid is not identical to that in the protein-free plasma of the capillary (see Table 5-2). If we make the simplifying assumption that the capillary wall excludes all proteins from the interstitial fluid, the equilibrium concentration ratios for monovalent cations and anions are as follows:
$\frac{[\text { Cation }]_{\text {interstitial fluid }}}{[\text { Cation }]_{\text {Protein-freePlasma }}} \cong 0.95$ (for monovalent cations)
$\frac{[\text { Anion }]_{\text {interstitialFluid }}}{[\text { Anion }]_{\text {Protein-freePlasma }}} \cong 1.05$ (for monovalent anions)
(NE 20-13)
Thus, the Donnan effect causes the capillary lumen to contain higher concentrations of cations and lower concentrations of anions than the protein-free solution of the interstitium.

As noted on page 129, it is a general property of a GibbsDonnan equilibrium that, after the permeant ions achieve the predicted electrochemical equilibrium across a barrier separating two compartments, the compartment containing the impermeant ions has a higher osmolality than the compartment from which the impermeant ions are excluded (see Fig. 5-15). Thus, just as the presence of impermeant proteins in the cytoplasm leads to cell swelling because of Donnan forces, the presence of impermeant anions in the capillary lumen leads to the movement of water from the interstitium into the capillary lumen.

Note that the water movement we have chosen to discuss so far is not due to the osmotic pressure exerted by the plasma proteins per se. Rather, we are considering the osmotic pressure difference that arises from the unequal distribution of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$between capillary lumen (c) and interstitial fluid (if). By analogy to the calculation shown in Equation 5-31, we can calculate the theoretically predicted osmotic force ( $\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}$ ) caused by the difference in the osmolalities of small, permeant ions ( $\Delta \mathrm{Osm}$ ):

$$
\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}=R T \Delta \mathrm{Osm}
$$

(NE 20-14)
Of course, it was the Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium that set up this difference in total osmolality across the capillary wall. Because the major small ions on either side of the capillary wall are $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$,

$$
\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}=R T\left[\left(\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}+\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}\right)-\left(\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{e}}+\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{e}}\right)\right] \quad \text { (NE 20-15) }
$$

Using the values in Table 5-2 for protein-free plasma and interstitial fluid, we have the following:
$\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}=R T\left[\left(\left[153 \mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{c}}+\left[110 \mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{e}}\right)-\left(\left[145 \mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{e}}+\left[116 \mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{e}}\right)\right]\right.\right.\right.$
$\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}=R T[2 \mathrm{mM}]$
(NE 20-16)
Because $R T$ at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ equals $19,332 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{M}$, an osmolality difference of 1 mM exerts an ideal osmotic pressure of 19.332 mm Hg. Thus, the Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$causes a theoretical osmotic pressure difference of

$$
\Delta \pi_{\text {theory }}=38.7 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} \text { (due to } \mathrm{Na}^{+} \text {and } \mathrm{Cl}^{-} \text {) }
$$

(NE 20-17)
Physiologically, the osmotic difference of 38.7 mm Hg caused by the unequal distribution of small ions is of no consequence for water movement across the capillary wall because the capillary does not reflect $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(i.e., $\sigma_{\mathrm{Na}}=\sigma_{\mathrm{Cl}}=0$ ), and therefore these solutes generate no effective osmotic pressure. See 3 N20-8 for a discussion of the reflection coefficient ( $\sigma$ ).

As introduced on page 129 and discussed more fully on page 469, the only effective osmotic pressure difference across the capillary wall is that caused directly by the plasma proteins themselves, acting as solutes. This effective osmotic pressure difference is the colloid osmotic pressure, which tends to pull water into the capillary lumen.

$$
\Delta \pi=\pi_{\mathrm{c}}-\pi_{\mathrm{e}} \cong 25 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} \text { (due to colloids) }
$$

(NE 20-18)
As shown in Table 20-6, the physiological force opposing the colloid osmotic pressure ( $\Delta \sigma$ ) is the difference between the capillary hydrostatic pressure $\left(P_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$ and the interstitial hydrostatic fluid pressure $\left(P_{\mathrm{e}}\right)$.

In the preceding discussion, we saw that because the capillary wall is freely permeable to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, the only transmural concentration differences that count are those for the colloids. What would happen if the capillary wall were an ideal osmotic membrane, permeable to water but not to any solutes (i.e., neither ions nor proteins)? In such a hypothetical case, the total osmotic pressure difference across the capillary wall would be the sum of the $\Delta \pi_{\text {small ions }}$ (or 38.7 mm Hg ) caused by the small ions and the $\Delta \pi$ (or 25 mm Hg ) caused by the colloids, which totals $\sim 64 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Of course, the hydrostatic pressure difference $\left(P_{\mathrm{c}}-P_{\mathrm{e}}\right)$ would never be large enough to prevent the net movement of water into the lumen of the typical capillary.

# BOX 20-1 Interstitial Edema 

Edema (from the Greek oidema [swelling]) is characterized by an excess of salt and water in the extracellular space, particularly in the interstitium. Edema may be associated with any disease leading to salt retention and expansion of the extracellular fluid volume-in particular, renal, cardiac, and hepatic disease (see p. 838). However, interstitial edema can also occur without overall salt and water retention because of microcirculatory alterations that affect the Starling forces. Regardless of the cause, the resulting edema can be either generalized (e.g., widespread swelling of subcutaneous tissue, often first evident in facial puffiness) or localized (e.g., limited to the dependent parts of the body). In this box, we focus on how edema can result from changes in parameters that are included in the Starling equation.

## Hydrostatic Forces

When a person is standing for a sustained time, venous pressure and thus capillary pressure $\left(P_{c}\right)$ in the legs increase because of gravity. The result is movement of fluid into the tissue space. In most cases, the lymphatic system can take up the extra interstitial fluid and return it to the vascular space, maintaining proper fluid balance. The return of fluid requires contractions of the leg muscles to compress the veins and lymphatics and to propel the fluid upward through the valves in these vessels and toward the heart (see pp. 474-476). If the standing person does not contract these muscles, the transudation of fluid can exceed the lymphatic return, causing interstitial edema.

An organ that is particularly sensitive to proper fluid balance is the lung. Slight increases in the hydrostatic pressure of the pulmonary capillaries (pulmonary hypertension) can lead to pulmonary edema. This condition decreases lung compliance (making lung inflation more difficult; see p. 610) and also may severely compromise gas exchange across the pulmonary capillary bed (see pp. 661-663). Left-sided heart failure causes blood to back up into the vessels of the lung, which raises pulmonary vascular pressures and causes pulmonary edema.

In right-sided heart failure, blood backs up into the systemic veins. As a result, there is a rise in central venous pressure (i.e., the pressure inside the large systemic veins leading to the right heart), causing an increase in the $P_{c}$ in the lower extremities and abdominal viscera. Fluid transudated from the hepatic and intestinal capillaries may leave the interstitial space and enter the peritoneal cavity, a condition called ascites. ( $\mathbf{N 2 0 - 1 8}$

## Colloid Osmotic Forces

In nephrotic syndrome, a manifestation of a number of renal diseases, protein is lost in the urine. The result is a fall in plasma
colloid osmotic pressure, a decrease in the ability of the capillaries to retain fluid, and generalized peripheral edema.

In pregnancy, synthesis of plasma proteins by the mother does not keep pace with the expanding plasma volume and nutritional demands of the fetus. As a result, maternal plasma protein levels fall. The same occurs in protein malnutrition. Although it is less severe than in nephrotic syndrome, the lower capillary colloid osmotic pressure nevertheless leads to edema in the extremities.

The opposite effect is seen in dehydration. A deficit of salt and water causes an increase in the plasma protein concentration, increasing the capillary colloid osmotic pressure and thus pulling fluid out of the interstitial space. The result is reduced turgor of the interstitial space. This effect is easily noticed by pinching the skin, which is unable to spring back to its usual firm position.

## Properties of the Capillary Wall

Inflammation causes the release of vasodilators, such as histamine and cytokines, into the surrounding tissue. Vasodilation increases the number of open capillaries and therefore the functional surface area (S). Cytokines also cause widening of interendothelial clefts and a fall in the reflection coefficient ( $\alpha$ ) for proteins. The net effect is enhanced filtration of fluid from capillary lumen to interstitium, so that tissue swelling is one of the hallmarks of inflammation.

Severe head injuries can result in cerebral edema, a result of the breakdown of the normally tight endothelial barrier of the cerebral vessels (see pp. 285-286). Because the rigid skull prevents expansion of the brain, cerebral edema can lead to occlusion of the cerebral microcirculation.

During ischemia-when blood flow to a tissue is severely reduced or completely stopped-blood vessels deteriorate, which causes hydraulic conductivity $\left(L_{c}\right)$ to increase and reflection coefficient to decrease. Once blood flow is reestablished (reperfusion), these changes lead to local edema. If the increased leakiness is substantial, large quantities of plasma proteins freely move into the interstitial space, dissipating the colloid osmotic gradient across the capillary wall and aggravating the edema.

## Lymphatic Drainage

Lymphatic drainage may become impaired after lymph nodes are removed in cancer surgery or when lymph nodes are obstructed by malignant neoplasms. The reduction in the lymphatic drainage leads to local edema upstream from the affected nodes.
average value for $\pi_{c j}$ is $\sim 3 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, substantially less than the value of 25 mm Hg for $\pi_{c}$ in the capillary lumen.

The $\pi_{c j}$ appears to increase along the axis of the capillary (Table 20-6). The lowest values are near the arteriolar end, where the interstitium receives protein-free fluid from the capillary as the result of filtration. The highest values are near the venular end, where the interstitium loses protein-free fluid to the capillary as the result of absorption.

## The Starling principle predicts ultrafiltration at the arteriolar end and absorption at the venular end of most capillary beds

The idealized forces acting on fluid movement across a capillary are shown in Figure 20-9A. Using the Starling equation and the values in Table 20-6, we can calculate the net transfer of fluid $\left(J_{V}\right)$ at both the arteriolar and venular ends of a typical capillary:

# N20-18 Transcapillary Refill 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

The opposite of the changes responsible for interstitial edema occurs when there is significant hemorrhage. During severe hemorrhagic hypotension, capillary pressure drops and fluid moves from the tissue space into the vascular space, as discussed on pages 585-586. This fluid movement—known as transcapillary refill-helps replace the fluid lost in the hemorrhage and thereby serves as a compensatory mechanism for blood loss. The amount of fluid that can be replaced from the interstitium of the skeletal muscle is significant. Because this fluid is cell free, it lowers the hematocrit of the blood, a condition known as hemodilution.

*The low effective colloid osmotic pressure prevails only in the subcalyx fluid compartment (see Fig. 20-10B).

& =L_{\mathrm{p}}(-5 \mathrm{mmHg})
\end{aligned}
$$

The net filtration pressure is thus positive (favoring filtration) at the arteriolar end, and it gradually makes the transition to negative (favoring absorption) at the venular end (see Fig. 20-9B). At the point where the filtration and reabsorptive forces balance each other, an equilibrium exists, and no net movement of water occurs across the capillary wall.

Net filtration pressure varies-sometimes considerablyamong tissues. For example, in the intestinal mucosa, $P_{c}$ is so much lower than $\pi_{c}$ that absorption occurs continually along the entire length of the capillary. On the other hand, in glomerular capillaries, $P_{c}$ exceeds $\pi_{c}$ throughout most of the network, so that filtration may occur along the entire capillary (see pp. 745-746). Hydraulic conductivity also can affect the filtration/absorption profile along the capillary. Because the interendothelial clefts become larger toward the venular end of the capillary, $L_{\mathrm{p}}$ increases along the capillary from the arteriolar to the venular end.

Ignoring glomerular filtration in the kidney, Landis and Pappenheimer calculated a filtration of $-20 \mathrm{~L} /$ day at the arteriolar end of the capillary and an absorption of about 16 to $18 \mathrm{~L} /$ day at the venular end, for a net filtration of about 2 to $4 \mathrm{~L} /$ day from blood to interstitial fluid. This 2 to 4 L of net filtration does not occur uniformly in all capillary beds. The flow of fluid across a group of capillaries $(F)$ is the product of the flux $\left(J_{\mathrm{V}}\right)$ and the functional surface area $\left(S_{\mathrm{f}}\right): F=J_{\mathrm{V}}$. $S_{\mathrm{f}}$. Thus, net filtration of fluid in an organ depends not only on the net filtration pressure and the hydraulic conductivity of the capillary wall (terms that contribute to $J_{\mathrm{V}}$ ) but also on the surface area of capillaries that happen to be perfused. For example, exercise recruits additional open capillaries in muscle, raising $S_{\mathrm{f}}$ and thereby increasing filtration.

## For continuous capillaries, the endothelial barrier for fluid exchange is more complex than considered by Starling

The contribution of Landis and Pappenheimer was to insert experimentally measured values into the Starling equation (see Equation 20-8) and to calculate the total-body filtration and absorption rates and, by difference, net filtration. Because the estimate of 2 to 4 L for the net filtration rate agreed so well with total lymph flow, the scientific public accepted the
entire Landis-Pappenheimer analysis. However, for continuous capillaries, the Landis-Pappenheimer estimates of filtration and absorption are far higher than those indicated by the modern experimental data. Two major reasons for the discrepancy have emerged. First, Starling's assumptions about the nature of the capillary barrier were overly simplistic. Namely, he assumed that a single barrier separated two well-defined, uniform compartments (Fig. 20-10A). Thus, according to Equation 20-8, the dependence of $J_{\mathrm{V}}$ on net filtration pressure ought to be linear, as indicated by the plot in the inset of Figure 20-10A. Second, Landis and Pappenheimer used (1) $P_{c}$ values that are valid only at the level of the heart (i.e., ignoring gravity), (2) $P_{c}$ values that are not subject to the vagaries of vasomotion, (3) unrealistically low values of $\pi_{\mathrm{if}}$ (which would predict a greater absorption), and (4) $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{if}}$ and $\pi_{\mathrm{if}}$ values that are invariant. ( $\bigcirc$ N20-13

A revised model has emerged for fluid exchange across continuous endothelia (see p. 462) with interendothelial junctions (see p. 461) to account for discrepancies between the classical Starling predictions and the modern data. The revised model has two major features. First, the primary barrier for colloid osmotic pressure-that is, the semipermeable "membrane" that reflects proteins but lets water and small solutes pass-is not the entire capillary but only the luminal glycocalyx, in particular the glycocalyx overlying the paracellular clefts (see Fig. 20-10B). Second, the abluminal surface of the glycocalyx is not in direct contact with the bulk interstitial fluid but is bathed by the subglycocalyx fluid at the top of the long paracellular cleft-a third compartment. Thus, the flow across the glycocalyx barrier depends not on $P_{\mathrm{if}}$ and $\pi_{\mathrm{if}}$ in the bulk interstitial fluid but on the comparable parameters in the subglycocalyx fluid ( $P_{\mathrm{sg}}$ and $\pi_{\mathrm{sg}}$ ):

$$
J_{\mathrm{V}}=L_{\mathrm{p}}\left[\left(P_{\mathrm{c}}-P_{\mathrm{sg}}\right)-\sigma\left(\pi_{\mathrm{c}}-\pi_{\mathrm{sg}}\right)\right]
$$

Let us now examine the predictions of this equation for three states.

1. During ultrafiltration (i.e., $J_{\mathrm{V}}$ is positive). Here, the hydrostatic pressure in the subglycocalyx fluid-that is, the fluid in direct contact with the abluminal surface of the glycocalyx-is higher than that in the bulk interstitial fluid (i.e., $P_{\mathrm{sg}}>P_{\mathrm{if}}$ in Fig. 20-10B). Thus, fluid moves from the subglycocalyx space, along the paracellular cleft, to the bulk interstitial fluid. Moreover, as long as proteinfree ultrafiltrate enters the subglycocalyx space, the colloid osmotic pressure in the subglycocalyx fluid is low $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{sg}}<\pi_{\mathrm{if}}\right)$. Both the rise in $P_{\mathrm{sg}}$ and the fall in $\pi_{\mathrm{sg}}$ tend to oppose filtration.

Because proteins enter the interstitium through the large-pore pathway (see p. 467), $\pi_{\mathrm{if}}$ in the bulk interstitial

# N20-13 Assumptions of Landis and Pappenheimer 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Direct measurements of the four parameters of the Starling equation $\left(P_{o}, P_{d}, \pi_{e}, \pi_{d}\right)$ in organs with low lymph flow such as skeletal muscle indicate that $P_{o}>\left[P_{d}+\sigma\left(\pi_{e}-\pi_{d}\right)\right]$ throughout the length of the capillary. These values would predict unrealistically high net filtration rates that are incompatible with the observed low lymph flow.

Landis and Pappenheimer had estimated only 2 to 4 L of net total-body filtration (excluding renal glomerular filtration), which agreed well with total lymph flow, because of the particular values that they used in the classical Starling equation.

1. Landis and Pappenheimer used arterial and venous values of $P_{o}$ that can be correct only at the level of the heart. As shown in Figure 17-8 on page 418, gravity can add 95 mm Hg to the transmural pressure in feed arteries of the dependent limb and can raise $P_{o}$ to 90 to 100 mm Hg , which predicts filtration throughout the length of the capillary.
2. Landis and Pappenheimer ignored dynamic changes in $P_{o}$. Vasomotion causes $P_{o}$ to cycle between high and low values, creating alternating periods of filtration and reabsorption.
3. Landis and Pappenheimer assumed low arterial values of $\pi_{d}$.
4. Landis and Pappenheimer assumed that values of $P_{d}$ and $\pi_{d}$ were clamped in time, whereas the rate of filtration itself determines $P_{d}$ and $\pi_{d}$. At high filtration rates, $P_{d}$ tends to rise, opposing further filtration. At high filtration rates, $\pi_{d}$ tends to fall, also opposing further filtration.
In reality, as noted on page 472, net total-body filtration (excluding renal glomerular filtration) is even much less than the 2 to 4 L estimated by Landis and Pappenheimer because the endothelial barrier is not a single membrane separating two
well-stirred clamped compartments and the barrier effectively exhibits osmotic asymmetry. Placing the protein osmotic barrier at the glycocalyx and considering a dynamic range of subglycocalyx colloid osmotic pressures $\left(\pi_{o g}\right)$ independent of bulk $\pi_{d}$ carries important implications. First, the net filtration pressure is far less than expected from the Starling equation, and this explains why actual lymph flows are less than the net filtration rates postulated from bulk values of $P_{o}, P_{d}, \pi_{e}$, and $\pi_{d}$. Second, during reversal of flow (i.e., absorption), protein in the subcalyx fluid should quickly concentrate to prevent all absorption. Thus, overall fluid balance of the interstitium is primarily maintained not by venous absorption but by lymphatic function.

compartment is about that of lymph. However, at high rates of ultrafiltration, this $\pi_{\mathrm{uf}}$ has no osmotic effect on the glycocalyx barrier because the protein cannot diffuse against the convective flow of fluid from lumen to interstitium. On the other hand, if the ultrafiltration rate is low, interstitial proteins can diffuse from the bulk interstitial space into the paracellular cleft, raising $\pi_{\mathrm{ng}}$ and promoting more ultrafiltration.
2. When net flow falls to nearly zero (i.e., $J_{\mathrm{V}}$ is $\sim \mathbf{0}$ ). Here, the parameters in the subglycocalyx fluid (i.e., $P_{\mathrm{ng}}$ and $\pi_{\mathrm{ng}}$ ) should thus be very close to their values in the bulk interstitial fluid (i.e., $P_{\mathrm{uf}}$ and $\pi_{\mathrm{uf}}$ ), and the revised model simplifies to the classical Starling model (see Fig. 20-10A).
3. During absorption (i.e., reversal of flow, where $J_{\mathrm{V}}$ is negative). Here, water and small solutes move from the subglycocalyx space to the capillary lumen, leaving behind and thereby concentrating the protein in the subglycocalyx space (see Fig. 20-10C). The resulting rise of $\pi_{\mathrm{ng}}$ (see Equation 20-11) opposes further absorption and, indeed, can quickly bring it to a halt. This effect explains why the plot is nearly flat in the left lower quadrant of the inset between Figure 20-10B and C.

Thus, a more sophisticated understanding of the structure of the endothelial barrier for proteins correctly makes two predictions. First, the fluxes are smaller than predicted by Starling for bulk driving forces because the actual driving force across the glycocalyx barrier (see Equation 20-11) is smaller than the net driving force in the Starling equation (see Equation 20-8). Second, the magnitude of the flux for a given net driving force is greater for ultrafiltration than for absorption-osmotic asymmetry or rectification.

## LYMPHATICS

## Lymphatics return excess interstitial fluid to the blood

Lymphatics arise in the interstitium as small, thin-walled channels of endothelial cells that then join together to form increasingly larger vessels (Fig. 20-11). The initial lymphatics (previously called terminal lymphatics) are similar to capillaries but with many interendothelial junctions that behave like one-way microvalves, also called primary lymph valves. Anchoring filaments tether the initial lymphatics to surrounding connective tissue. The walls of the larger

Figure 20-11 Flow of lymph into initial and collecting lymphatics.

collecting lymphatics are similar to those of small veins, consisting of endothelium and sparse smooth muscle. The large lymphatic vessels, like the veins, have secondary lymph valves that restrict retrograde movement of lymph. Lymph nodes are located along the path of the collecting lymphatics. The large lymphatics ultimately drain into the left and right subclavian veins.

At the level of the initial lymphatics, interendothelial junctions have few tight junctions or adhesion molecules connecting neighboring endothelial cells. As a result, flaps of endothelial cells can overlap with each other and act as the microvalve discussed above. Although initial lymphatics may appear collapsed and show no contractile activity, a pressure gradient from the interstitial fluid to the lymphatic lumen deforms the endothelial cells so that the microvalves open and fluid enters the initial lymphatic during the expansion phase (see Fig. 20-11A). During this time, the secondary lymph valves are closed.

External pressure (e.g., from skeletal muscle) shuts the microvalves and causes fluid to enter larger lymphatics through the now open secondary lymph valves (see Fig. 20-11B).

Most organs contain both initial and collecting lymphatics, but skeletal muscle and intestine have only initial lymphatics within their tissue. Lymphatics are absent from the brain. They are most prevalent in the skin and the genitourinary, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tracts.

As we have already seen, filtration at the arteriolar end of capillaries is estimated to exceed absorption at the venular end by 2 to $4 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. However, fluid does not normally accumulate in the interstitium because this excess fluid and protein move into the lymphatics. Thus, each day, the lymphatics return to the circulation 2 to 4 L of interstitial fluid, maintaining a steady state. In a model of congenital lymphedema, mice with genetic absence of initial lymphatics have elevated $P_{\mathrm{if}}$ and $\pi_{\mathrm{if}}$ as well as interstitial volume expansion (i.e., edema), a finding that emphasizes the role of the lymphatics in returning fluid and protein from the interstitial space to the blood.

Flow in Initial Lymphatics Hydrostatic pressure in the initial lymphatics ( $P_{\text {lymph }}$ ) ranges from -1 mm Hg to +1 mm Hg . Inasmuch as the mean interstitial fluid pressure is somewhat more negative than these values, what provides the driving force for interstitial fluid to move into the terminal lymphatics? Transient increases in $P_{\mathrm{if}}$ temporarily raise $P_{\mathrm{if}}$ above $P_{\text {lymph }}$. Indeed, increases in mean $P_{\mathrm{if}}$ cause an increase in lymph flow (Fig. 20-12).

Because the interstitium exhibits a variable compliance (see p. 470), fluid added to the interstitium in its lowcompliance range raises the $P_{\mathrm{if}}$ substantially, providing the driving force for fluid to enter the lymphatics. In this same range of $P_{\mathrm{if}}$ values, lymphatic flow is especially sensitive to increases in $P_{\mathrm{if}}$ (steep portion of curve in Fig. 20-12). Thus, lymphatic efflux nicely matches the excess capillary filtration, so that the interstitial fluid volume changes very little. The situation is very different if the interstitium is already expanded and in its high-compliance range. In this case, fluid added to the interstitium raises the already elevated $P_{\mathrm{if}}$ only moderately (e.g., from +2 to +4 mm Hg ). In this range of $P_{\mathrm{if}}$ values, lymphatic uptake is not very
![bo8285266204](bo8285266204.jpg)

Figure 20-12 Dependence of lymph flow on interstitial pressure.
responsive to increases in $P_{\mathrm{if}}$ (flat portion of the curve in Fig. 20-12). Thus, in this case, lymphatic return does not compensate well for the excess capillary filtration, so that interstitial fluid volume increases further (i.e., edema begets more edema).

Intermittent compression and relaxation of lymphatics occur during respiration, walking, and intestinal peristalsis. When $P_{\text {lymph }}$ in a downstream segment falls below that in an upstream segment, fluid aspiration produces unidirectional flow. This suction may be largely responsible for the subatmospheric values of the $P_{\mathrm{if}}$ observed in many tissues.

Flow in Collecting Lymphatics Pressures in the collecting lymphatics range from +1 to +10 mm Hg , and they increase progressively with each valve along the vessel. As $P_{\text {lymph }}$ rises in the collecting lymphatic vessels, smooth muscle in the lymphatic walls actively contracts by an intrinsic myogenic mechanism that, as discussed below, also plays a role in blood vessels. Thus, downstream occlusion of a lymphatic vessel increases $P_{\text {lymph }}$ and hence the frequency of smoothmuscle contractions, whereas an upstream occlusion does the opposite. Because of the presence of one-way valves, smooth-muscle contraction drives lymph toward the veins. The rhythmic contraction and relaxation of VSMCs that we will discuss for blood vessels-vasomotion-also occurs in lymphatics and is essential for the propulsion of lymph.

In addition to vasomotion, passive processes also propel lymph toward the blood. As is the case for the initial lymphatics, skeletal muscle contraction, respiratory movements, and intestinal contractions all passively compress the collecting lymphatics. This intermittent pumping action moves lymph into the veins.

Transport of Proteins and Cells Proteins that entered interstitial fluid from the capillary cannot return to the circulation because of the adverse chemical gradient across the capillary endothelial wall. The buildup of these macromolecules in the interstitium creates a diffusional gradient from the interstitium to the lymph that complements the convective movement of these macromolecules (along with fluid)

into the lymphatic system. In an average person, the lymphatics return 100 to 200 g of proteins to the circulation each day. Even before lymph reaches lymph nodes, it contains leukocytes-which had moved from the blood into the interstitium-but no RBCs or platelets. Cycles of lymphatic compression and relaxation not only enhance fluid movement but also greatly increase the leukocyte count of lymph.

## The circulation of extracellular fluids involves three convective loops: blood, interstitial fluid, and lymph

Extracellular fluid moves in three convective loops (Fig. 20-13). The first is the cardiovascular loop. Assuming a
cardiac output of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, the convective flow of blood through the circulation at rest is $7200 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. The second is the transvascular loop, in which fluid moves out of the capillaries at their arteriolar end and into the capillaries at their venular end. Not counting the kidney, whose glomeruli filter a vast amount of fluid (see p. 739), Landis and Pappenheimer estimated that all the other tissues of the body filter $\sim 20 \mathrm{~L} /$ day at the arteriolar end of their capillaries and reabsorb 16 to 18 L at the venular end. As noted above (see pp. 472-474), both the filtration and absorption values are probably vast overestimates. Nevertheless, the difference between filtration and absorption, 2 to $4 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, is a reasonable estimate of the third fluid loop, the lymphatic loop.

In addition to convective exchange, a diffusional exchange of water and solutes also occurs across the capillaries. The diffusional exchange of water occurs at a much higher rate than does convective movement. Using deuterium oxide as a marker, investigators have found that this diffusional exchange is $\sim 80,000 \mathrm{~L} /$ day across all of the body's systemic capillaries. This value is about an order of magnitude greater than blood flow in the cardiovascular loop and three orders of magnitude larger than the convective flow in the transvascular filtration/absorption loop of the microcirculation. However, the diffusion of water molecules is an exchange process that does not contribute appreciably to the net movement of water. In other words, every day, $80,000 \mathrm{~L}$ of water diffuses out of the capillaries and $80,000 \mathrm{~L}$ diffuses back.

For small solutes that can diffuse across the capillary endothelium, the traffic is quite different from the convective loops for water. Take glucose as an example. The plasma contains $\sim 100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ glucose, RBCs have little glucose, and the cardiac output of plasma is $\sim 2.75 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ (assuming a hematocrit of $45 \%$ ). Therefore, each day, the heart pumps $\sim 4000 \mathrm{~g}$ of glucose. This glucose can enter the interstitium by two mechanisms. First, glucose is dissolved in the water filtered from the arteriolar end of the capillaries. Each day, this filtration process carries $20 \mathrm{~L} \times 100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}=20 \mathrm{~g}$ of glucose into the interstitium. Second, each day, $\sim 20,000 \mathrm{~g}$ of glucose enters the interstitium by diffusion. Convection can supply only a small fraction of the $\sim 400 \mathrm{~g}$ of glucose that the body consumes each day. Instead, diffusion supplies the majority of the glucose. Nevertheless, the $400 \mathrm{~g} /$ day of metabolized glucose is a minuscule fraction of the amount that enters the interstitium by diffusion. Thus, most of the glucose that diffuses into the interstitium diffuses back out again.

Protein traffic provides yet another pattern of circulatory loops. Plasma contains $7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ of proteins, and-assuming a plasma volume of 3 L in a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ human-total plasma protein content is $\sim 210 \mathrm{~g}$. Given a cardiac plasma output of $2.75 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, the heart pumps $\sim 277,000 \mathrm{~g}$ of protein through the circulation every day. Of this protein, 100 to 200 g nearly the entire plasma content of proteins-moves daily across the capillary walls through the large-pore system via a transcellular route (see p. 467) and to a lesser extent by solvent drag (see p. 467). Because only very small amounts of filtered protein return to the circulation by solvent drag at the venular end of capillaries ( $\sim 5 \mathrm{~g} /$ day), nearly all of the filtered protein ( 95 to $195 \mathrm{~g} /$ day) depends on the convective lymphatic loop for its ultimate recovery.

## REGULATION OF THE MICROCIRCULATION

## The active contraction of vascular smooth muscle

regulates precapillary resistance, which controls capillary blood flow

Smooth-muscle tone in arterioles, metarterioles, and precapillary sphincters (see pp. 459-460) determines the access resistance to the capillary beds. This resistance upstream of the capillary bed is also known as the afferent or precapillary resistance $\left(R_{\text {pre }}\right)$. The overall resistance of a microcirculatory bed is the sum of $R_{\text {pre }}$, the resistance of the capillary bed itself ( $R_{\text {cap }}$ ), and the efferent or postcapillary resistance $\left(R_{\text {post }}\right)$.

How do these resistances influence the flow of blood ( $F_{\text {cap }}$ ) through a capillary bed? We can answer this question by rearranging the Ohm's law-like expression that we introduced as Equation 17-1:

$$
F_{\text {cap }}=\frac{\Delta P}{R_{\text {total }}}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{a}}-P_{\mathrm{v}}}{R_{\text {pre }}+R_{\text {cap }}+R_{\text {post }}}
$$

$P_{\mathrm{a}}$ is the pressure just before the beginning of the precapillary resistance, and $P_{\mathrm{v}}$ is the pressure just after the end of the postcapillary resistance. Because the aggregate $R_{\text {cap }}$ is small, and $R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}$ is usually $\sim 0.3, R_{\text {pre }}$ is usually much greater than $R_{\text {cap }}+R_{\text {post }}$. Because $R_{\text {pre }}$ is the principal determinant of total resistance, capillary flow is roughly inversely proportional to $R_{\text {pre }}$. Thus, modulating the contractility of VSMCs in precapillary vessels is the main mechanism for adjusting perfusion of a particular tissue.

Smooth-muscle cells can function as a syncytium when they are coupled through gap junctions (unitary smooth muscle), or they can function independently of one another as do skeletal muscle fibers (multiunit smooth muscle; see p. 243). Most vascular smooth muscle has a multiunit organization. In contrast to skeletal muscle, VSMCs receive multiple excitatory as well as inhibitory inputs (see p. 251). Moreover, these inputs come not only from chemical synapses (i.e., neural control) but also from circulating chemicals (i.e., humoral control). The actual contraction of VSMCs may follow smooth-muscle electrical activity in the form of action potentials, slow waves of depolarization, or graded depolarizations without spikes. VSMCs can show spontaneous rhythmic variations in tension leading to periodic changes in vascular resistance and microcirculatory flow in a process called vasomotion. These spontaneous, rhythmic smooth-muscle contractions result either from pacemaker currents or from slow waves of depolarization and associated $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ increases in the VSMCs (see p. 244). Humoral agents can also directly trigger contraction of VSMCs via increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ without measurable fluctuations in membrane potential (pharmacomechanical coupling; see p. 247).

VSMCs rely on a different molecular mechanism of contraction than skeletal muscle does, although an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is the principal trigger of contraction in both cases. Whereas an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in skeletal muscle elicits contraction by interacting with troponin C , an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in VSMCs elicits contraction by activating calmodulin (see p. 60). The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}\right)$ complex activates myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK; see p. 247), which in turn phosphorylates the regulatory myosin light chain (MLC) on
each myosin head (see p. 247). Phosphorylation of MLC allows the myosin to interact with actin, producing contraction. Relaxation occurs when MLC phosphatase dephosphorylates the MLC. In addition to changes in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, changes in the activity of MLCK itself can modulate the contraction of VSMCs. Phosphorylation of MLCK by cAMPdependent protein kinase (protein kinase A, or PKA) or cGMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase G, or PKG) inactivates the enzyme and thus prevents contraction. Thus, intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, cAMP, and cGMP are the principal second messengers responsible for modulating vascular tone.

Contraction of Vascular Smooth Muscle The following changes promote contraction:

- $\uparrow\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i} \rightarrow \uparrow \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM} \rightarrow \uparrow$ MLCK activity $\rightarrow$ $\uparrow$ phosphorylation of MLC $\rightarrow$ VSMC contraction.

- $\downarrow[\mathrm{cGMP}]_{i} \rightarrow \downarrow \mathrm{PKG} \rightarrow \downarrow$ phosphorylation of MLCK $\rightarrow$ $\uparrow$ MLCK activity $\rightarrow \uparrow$ phosphorylation of MLC $\rightarrow$ VSMC contraction.

Relaxation of Vascular Smooth Muscle The following changes promote relaxation:

- $\downarrow\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i} \rightarrow \downarrow \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM} \rightarrow \downarrow$ MLCK activity $\rightarrow$ $\downarrow$ phosphorylation of MLC $\rightarrow$ VSMC relaxation.
- $\downarrow[\mathrm{cAMP}]_{i} \rightarrow \uparrow \mathrm{PKA} \rightarrow \uparrow$ phosphorylation of MLCK $\rightarrow$ $\downarrow$ MLCK activity $\rightarrow \downarrow$ phosphorylation of MLC $\rightarrow$ VSMC relaxation.
- $\uparrow[\mathrm{cGMP}]_{i} \rightarrow \uparrow \mathrm{PKG} \rightarrow \uparrow$ phosphorylation of MLCK $\rightarrow$ $\downarrow$ MLCK activity $\rightarrow \downarrow$ phosphorylation of MLC $\rightarrow$ VSMC relaxation.

Various membrane proteins (channels, transporters, and receptors) play a role in controlling the tone of VSMCs. Together with their associated signal-transduction pathways, these membrane proteins lead to either contraction (i.e., vasoconstriction) or relaxation (i.e., vasodilation). Table 20-7 lists neural mechanisms of VSMC regulation. Table 20-8 lists paracrine/endocrine mechanisms of VSMC regulation.

## Tissue metabolites regulate local blood flow in specific vascular beds, independently of the systemic regulation

VSMCs not only control the resistance of arterioles (i.e., $R_{\text {pre }}$ ) and thus local blood flow, they also control the resistance of small terminal arteries and thereby play an important role in regulating systemic arterial blood pressure. In Chapter 23, we discuss this control of arterial blood pressure (a wholebody function) via VSMCs of small arteries and arterioles, both of which are under the control of central mechanismsthe autonomic nervous system and systemic humoral agents (e.g., angiotensin II). However, the subject of the present discussion is local regulatory mechanisms that use the arterioles to regulate blood flow through specific vascular beds. These local control mechanisms can override any of the neural or systemic humoral influences.

Mechanisms of local control involve (1) myogenic activity, and (2) local chemical and humoral factors. Myogenic regulation refers to an intrinsic mode of control of activity

in which stretch of the VSMC membrane activates stretchsensitive nonselective cation channels. The result is a depolarization that affects pacemaker activity, thereby eliciting contraction of the VSMC.

The most prominent chemical factors are interstitial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH as well as local concentrations of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, lactic acid, ATP, ADP, and adenosine (Table 20-9). Total osmolality may also make a contribution. The local regulation of VSMCs by interstitial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH is distinct from the regulation of systemic blood pressure by the peripheral chemoreceptors, which respond to changes in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH (see pp. 710-713) and initiate a complex neural reflex that modulates VSMC activity (see p. 544). In the case of local control, chemical changes in interstitial fluid act directly on the VSMCs through one of the three aforementioned principal second-messenger systems (i.e., intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, cAMP, cGMP). Changes that typically accompany increased metabolism (e.g., low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and low pH ) vasodilate
vessels in the systemic circulation. Such local changes in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH have opposite effects in the pulmonary circulation (see p. 687).

Because blood flow itself can wash out the metabolic intermediates listed above, vasomotion (see p. 475) can arise from a local feedback system. For example, if interstitial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ falls as a result of increased local $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption, the ensuing vasodilation will increase $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to the metabolizing cells and in turn will tend to cause the local interstitial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ to increase. As the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ now increases, vascular tone will increase. The timing of release and washout of the chemical factors determines the frequency of the vasomotion. The interstitial fluid volume around the active cells-the volume in which vasoactive metabolites are distributed-also affects this periodicity because it affects the time lag for the concentration of vasoactive substances to rise or to fall. Finally, spontaneous fluctuations in metabolism may confer an additional periodicity to vasomotion.

## The endothelium of capillary beds is the source of several vasoactive compounds, including nitric oxide, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, and endothelin

Table 20-10 lists several endothelial factors that act on blood vessels.

Nitric Oxide Originally called endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator. NO also inhibits platelet aggregation, induces platelet disaggregation, and inhibits platelet adhesion. Bradykinin and acetylcholine both stimulate the NO synthase III (NOS III, or eNOS) isoform of NOS (see p. 66) that is constitutively present in endothelial cells. Increases in shear stress-the force acting on the endothelial cell along the axis of blood flow-can also stimulate the enzyme. NOS III, which depends on both $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and CaM for its activity, catalyzes the formation of NO from arginine. NO, a lipophilic gas with a short half-life, exits the endothelial cells, diffuses locally, and enters VSMCs. Inside the VSMC is the "receptor" for NO, a soluble guanylyl cyclase (see pp. 66-67) that converts GTP to cyclic GMP (cGMP). cGMP-dependent protein kinase (i.e., PKG) then phosphorylates MLCK (see p. 247), SERCA Ca pumps (see p. 118), and $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}} \mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see Table 6-2, family No. 2). Phosphorylation inhibits the MLCK, thus leading to a net decrease in the phosphorylation of MLC and
a decrease in the interaction between myosin and actin. Phosphorylation activates SERCA, thereby decreasing $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Finally, phosphorylation activates $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, causing hyperpolarization. By these three complementary effects, the NO released by endothelial cells relaxes VSMCs, producing vasodilation.

The NO-mediated cascade is one of the most important mechanisms for vasodilation in the circulatory system. Physicians have used exogenous organic nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin) for decades to dilate peripheral vessels for relief of the pain of angina pectoris. These powerful vasodilators exert their activity by breaking down chemically, thereby releasing NO near VSMCs. A similar pathway of NO-mediated smooth-muscle relaxation is involved in the physiology of penile erection (see p. 1106) as demonstrated by the action of drugs for erectile dysfunction such as Viagra (sildenafil), which inhibit the phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme to decrease hydrolysis of cGMP and thus raise $[\mathrm{cGMP}]_{o}$.

Endothelium-Derived Hyperpolarizing Factor In addition to releasing NO, endothelial cells release another relaxing factor in response to acetylcholine, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). EDHF causes VSMC relaxation by making the membrane potential more negative.

Prostacyclin (Prostaglandin $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ ) Prostacyclin synthase (see Fig. 3-11) metabolizes arachidonic acid to the vasodilator prostacyclin (prostaglandin $\mathrm{I}_{2}$, or $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ ). This agent acts by increasing [cAMP] and promoting the phosphorylation of MLCK, which ultimately decreases the phosphorylation of MLCs. $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ is especially important for dilation of pulmonary vessels at birth (see p. 1162).

Endothelins Endothelial cells produce 21-residue peptides that cause an extremely potent and long-lasting vasoconstriction in most VSMCs. Many acute and chronic pathological conditions, including hypoxia, promote the release of endothelin (ET), which exists as three isopeptides: ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3. The precursor of ET-1 is preproendothelin, which the endothelial cell converts first to proendothelin and then to the mature endothelin, which it releases. The ET receptor subtype for vasoconstriction is $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{A}}$. Other ET receptors also exist. $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{B} 1}$ mediates vasodilation, $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{B} 2}$ mediates vasoconstriction, and $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{C}}$ has as yet no clearly defined function. $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors predominate in highpressure parts of the circulation, whereas $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{B}}$ receptors predominate in low-pressure parts of the circulation.

The binding of an ET to any ET receptor subtype ultimately results in an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. In the vasoconstriction response, ET-1 binding to $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors acts through the phospholipase C pathway to generate inositol trisphosphate, to release $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores, and to raise $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ (see p. 60). In a second, delayed phase, which is not well understood, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entering from the outside contributes to the increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. 14 14 The increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ activates $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$, stimulating MLCK to phosphorylate MLCs and culminating in contraction.

Thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ Endothelial cells and platelets metabolize arachidonic acid via the cyclooxygenase pathway to produce thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}\left(\mathrm{TXA}_{2}\right)$ see p. 64). This agent

Endothelin may mediate the second, delayed phase of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ increase through multiple pathways, including $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, nonselective cation channels, kinases, and other secondmessenger systems.

## N20-17 Vasodilation Caused by Increases in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Why does a transient increase in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ cause a transient paradoxical hyperpolarization, rather than the depolarization that one might expect from the Nernst equation (see Equation 6-5)?

First of all, the effect is transient because the increase in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ is short-lived-the ensuing vasodilation will wash away the excess extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.

Second, the rise in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ causes $V_{r o}$ (membrane potential) to become more negative (a hyperpolarization) even though $E_{k}$ (the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$) becomes more positive (see Equation 6-5). The reason is that the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance of VSMCs depends largely on inwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels ( Kir channels; see Fig. 7-20). A peculiar property of Kir channels is that an increase in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ not only causes $E_{k}$ to shift to more positive values, but also increases the slope conductance (i.e., the slope of the current voltage relationship at $E_{k}$ ). VSMCs normally do not live at $E_{k}$, but at more positive voltages ( -30 to -40 mV ), reflecting the contributions from other conductances (e.g., $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$) with more positive equilibrium potentials. In the text, we introduced Equation 6-12 (shown here as Equation NE 20-19):

$$
V_{r o}=\frac{G_{k}}{G_{m}} E_{k}+\frac{G_{k p}}{G_{m}} E_{n o}+\frac{G_{k p}}{G_{m}} E_{n o}+\frac{G_{m}}{G_{m}} E_{c j} \cdots
$$

Here, $G_{k}, G_{N o}, G_{C o}, G_{C o}$ etc. represent membrane conductances for each ion, whereas $G_{m}$ represents the total membrane conductance. Thus, $G_{k} / G_{m}$ represents the fractional conductance for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Therefore, the equation tells us that $V_{r o}$ not only depends on the various equilibrium potentials, but also on their respective fractional conductances. Thus, if an increase in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ simultaneously causes (1) a slight decrease in the absolute value of $E_{k}$ and (2) a larger increase $G_{k}$, the absolute value of the product $\left(G_{k} / G_{m}\right) E_{k}$ will be larger. Because $\left(G_{k} / G_{m}\right) E_{k}$ is a negative number, the net effect is that the computed value of $V_{r o}$ is more negative (i.e., a hyperpolarization).

In principle, a second phenomenon can contribute to the hyperpolarization. The increase in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ will enhance the activity of the electrogenic Na-K pump, resulting an increase in the pump's outward current, and therefore a hyperpolarization.

activates $\mathrm{TXA}_{2} /$ prostaglandin $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{TP})$ receptors, which leads to opening of L-type Ca channels and a consequent increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. In addition, TP activation increases the levels of superoxide anion radical $\mathrm{O}_{2}^{--}$(see p. 1238) in VSMCs. In turn, $\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$reacts with NO, thereby reducing the vasodilating effect of NO.

Other Endothelial Factors In some systemic arteries of the dog, anoxia produces an unexpected effect: an endotheliumdependent increase in tension mediated by a putative factor, $\mathrm{EDCF}_{1}$ (endothelium-derived constricting factor 1). In some dog arteries, rapid stretch evokes a contraction that is also endothelium dependent. This putative factor, $\mathrm{EDCF}_{2}$, could be a superoxide anion because superoxide dismutase prevents the contractions.

## Autoregulation stabilizes blood flow despite large fluctuations in systemic arterial pressure

As we saw in Chapter 17, the pressure-flow relationship of an idealized rigid vessel is linear (Fig. 20-14, gray line). In most real (i.e., elastic) vessels, however, increases in pressure cause a dilation that reduces resistance and leads to a steeper-than-linear flow (see Fig. 20-14, red curve). However, some vascular beds behave very differently. Despite large changes in the systemic arterial pressure-and thus large changes in the driving pressure-these special vascular beds maintain local blood flow within a narrow range. This phenomenon is called autoregulation. These vascular beds behave more or less like rigid tubes at very low and at very high perfusion pressures (see Fig. 20-14, purple curve). However, in the physiological pressure range over which autoregulation occurs, changes in perfusion pressure have little effect on flow. Instead, increases in pressure lead to increases in resistance that keep blood flow within a carefully controlled range.

Autoregulatory behavior takes time to develop and is due to an active process. If the perfusion pressure were to increase abruptly, we would see that immediately after the pressure increase, the pressure-flow diagram would look much like the one for the rigid tube in Figure 20-14. However, the vascular arteriolar tone then slowly adjusts itself to produce the characteristic autoregulatory pressure-flow diagram. The contraction of VSMCs that underlies autoregulation is autonomous; that is, it is entirely local and independent of neural and endocrine mechanisms. Both myogenic and

TABLE 20-11 Agents That Affect Vascular Growth

| PHOMOTERS | INHIBITORS |
| :-- | :-- |
| Vascular endothelial growth factor <br> (VEGF) | Endostatin |
| Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) | Angiostatin |
| Angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1) | Angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) |

metabolic mechanisms play an important role in the adjustments of smooth-muscle tone during autoregulation. For example, the stretch of VSMCs that accompanies the increased perfusion pressure triggers a myogenic contraction that reduces blood flow. Also, the increase in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (or decrease in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, or increase in pH ) that accompanies increased perfusion pressure triggers a metabolic vasoconstriction that reduces blood flow (see Table 20-9).

Autoregulation is useful for at least two reasons. First, with an increase in perfusion pressure, autoregulation avoids a waste of perfusion in organs in which the flow is already sufficient. Second, with a decrease in perfusion pressure, autoregulation maintains capillary flow and capillary pressure. Autoregulation is very important under these conditions for organs that are very sensitive to ischemia or hypoxia (particularly the heart, brain, and kidneys) and for organs whose job it is to filter the blood (again, the kidney).

## Blood vessels proliferate in response to growth factors by a process known as angiogenesis

In adults, the anatomy of the microcirculation remains rather constant. Notable exceptions are the growth of new vessels during wound healing, inflammation, and tumor growth and in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle. Increased capillary density is important in physical training (see pp. 1220-1222) and in acclimatization to altitude (see p. 1232).

The development of new vessels is called angiogenesis. The first step is dissolution of the venular basement membrane at a specific site, followed by activation and proliferation of previously quiescent endothelial cells. The new cells, attracted by growth factors, migrate to form a tube. Eventually, the budding tubes connect with each other, allowing the flow of blood and the development of vascular smooth muscle as the new microvascular network establishes itself. Angiogenesis relies on a balance between positive and negative regulation. The body normally produces some factors that promote angiogenesis and others that inhibit it (Table 20-11).

Promoters of Vessel Growth The principal peptides that induce angiogenesis are two polypeptides: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Both interact with endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine kinases (see pp. 68-70). VEGF-related to plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) and a mitogen for vascular endothelial cells-is produced by fibroblasts and, frequently, by cancer cells. Activated coagulation factor VII (FVIIa; see p. 442) promotes VEGF production.

FGF mediates many cellular responses during embryonic, fetal, and postnatal development. At least 22 different FGFs

exist in humans. FGF2 (also known as basic fibroblast growth factor or bFGF) has particular angiogenic activity.

VEGF and FGF2 promote expression of NOS. The resulting NO promotes proliferation and migration of endothelial cells as well as differentiation of vascular tubes.

The difficulty in achieving targeted delivery of these growth factors is a major obstacle in their therapeutic use. One approach has been to link the growth factor to small beads delivered into the coronary circulation. Clinical trials with local or systemic administration of FGF2 to patients with ischemic heart disease have shown mixed efficacy. A recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF (Avastin) is being used in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.

Other growth factors have indirect angiogenic effects that are distinct from those of VEGF or FGF. Angiopoietins (ANGPT1 and ANGPT2) are proteins that act through a receptor tyrosine kinase (Tie2) expressed almost exclusively in endothelial cells. ANGPT1 is required for embryonic vascular development, and ANGPT2-normally an antagonist of ANGPT1 at the Tie2 receptor-is required for postnatal angiogenic remodeling. Angiogenin, (○) N20-15 a member of the ribonuclease (RNase) family, is normally present in plasma, but at levels too low to produce proliferative effects. Plasma angiogenin levels rise in cancer patients. Regulated surface receptors on endothelial cells bind angiogenin, which after endocytosis translocates to the nucleus, where its RNase activity is essential for its angiogenic effect.

Inhibitors of Vessel Growth The concept of antiangiogenesis was first advanced by Judah Folkman as a strategy to stop the growth of tumors. He and his colleagues have described
two peptides, angiostatin and endostatin, that are inhibitors of angiogenesis.

Angiostatin is a kringle-containing fragment of plasminogen, a key fibrinolytic protein (see p. 446). Angiostatin arises by proteolytic cleavage of plasminogen by connective tissue enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases and elastase. Angiostatin inhibits angiogenesis by enhancing apoptosis of endothelial cells and inhibiting migration and tube formation, rather than by affecting proliferation. Recombinant angiostatin is being tested in patients with advanced lung cancer.

Endostatin is a peptide breakdown product of collagen XVIII. It is produced by the extracellular matrix of tumors.

We can illustrate the importance of angiogenesis by highlighting three clinical situations in which angiogenesis plays an important role. First, enhancement of vessel growth is important during coronary artery disease, when chronic ischemia of the heart leads to the development of new vessels and thus collateral circulation. Second, angiogenesis enhances the blood supply to a tumor, thereby promoting its growth and opening the principal route by which tumor cells exit the primary tumor during metastasis. Oncologists are exploring the use of angiogenesis inhibitors to treat cancer. Third, angiogenesis may also be important in diabetic retinopathy, in which blood vessel proliferation can cause blindness.

# N20-15 Angiogenin 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Although initially identified in the media of cultured tumor cells, angiogenin is present in normal plasma and it is a mitogen for normal endothelial cells. Angiogenin-a soluble 14-kDa protein-mediates a number of functions in addition to angiogenesis. For example, angiogenin is a microbicidal agent that plays a role in innate immunity.

Angiogenin belongs to a superfamily of ribonucleases (RNases; see p. 98). RNase A is the prototype of that family, and angiogenin has been classified as RNase 5. Critical structural differences between angiogenin and the other RNases are apparent in the ribonucleolytic site and the receptorbinding site. The ribonucleolytic activity and angiogenic activity of angiogenin can be separated because the protein can be modified and as a result retain its ribonucleolytic activity but lose its angiogenic activity.

Angiogenin-responsive endothelial cells express a specific receptor on the cell membrane. After binding to the receptor, some angiogenin is rapidly endocytosed and translocated to the nucleus. Indeed, angiogenin contains a specific nuclearlocalization sequence. In addition, another portion of the angiogenin bound to its receptor may trigger a number of intracellular signaling cascades. Both pathways lead to cell growth and neovascularization. Angiogenin plays a role in vascularization not only in malignancies, but also in nonmalignant pathologic conditions (e.g., in diabetic retinopathy).

# CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY AND THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM 

W. Jonathan Lederer

Different cardiac cells serve different and very specialized functions, but all are electrically active. The heart's electrical signal normally originates in a group of cells high in the right atrium that depolarize spontaneously; it then spreads throughout the heart from cell to cell (Fig. 21-1). As this action potential propagates through the heart-sometimes carried by cells that form specialized conducting pathways and sometimes by the very cells that generate the force of contraction-it assumes different appearances within the different cardiac cells (Fig. 21-2). Based on the speed of the upstroke, we can characterize action potentials as either slow (sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes) or fast (atrial myocytes, Purkinje fibers, and ventricular myocytes).

Because the excitation of cardiac myocytes triggers contraction-a process called excitation-contraction coupling (see p. 229)-the propagation of action potentials must be carefully timed to synchronize ventricular contraction and thereby optimize the ejection of blood. This chapter focuses on the membrane currents responsible for the generation and transmission of action potentials in heart tissue. We also examine how to record the heart's electrical flow by placing electrodes on the surface of the body to create one of the simplest and yet one of the most useful diagnostic tools available to the clinician-the electrocardiogram.

## ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY OF CARDIAC CELLS

The cardiac action potential starts in specialized muscle cells of the sinoatrial node and then propagates in an orderly fashion throughout the heart

The cardiac action potential originates in a group of cells called the sinoatrial (SA) node (see Fig. 21-1), located in the right atrium. These cells depolarize spontaneously and fire action potentials at a regular, intrinsic rate that is usually between 60 and 100 times per minute for an individual at rest. Both parasympathetic and sympathetic neural input can modulate this intrinsic pacemaker activity, or automaticity (see pp. 397-398).

Because cardiac cells are electrically coupled through gap junctions (Fig. 21-3A), the action potential propagates from cell to cell in the same way that an action potential in nerve conducts along a single long axon. A spontaneous action potential originating in the SA node will conduct from cell
to cell throughout the right atrial muscle and spread to the left atrium. The existence of discrete conducting pathways in the atria is still disputed. About one tenth of a second after its origination, the signal arrives at the atrioventricular (AV) node (see Fig. 21-1). The impulse does not spread directly from the atria to the ventricles because of the presence of a fibrous atrioventricular ring. Instead, the only available pathway is for the impulse to travel from the AV node to the His-Purkinje fiber system, a network of specialized conducting cells that carries the signal to the muscle of both ventricles.

## The cardiac action potential conducts from cell to cell via gap junctions

The electrical influence of one cardiac cell on another depends on the voltage difference between the cells and on the resistance of the gap junction connecting them. A gap junction (see p. 205) is an electrical synapse (see Fig. 21-3A) that permits electrical current to flow between neighboring cells. According to Ohm's law, the current flowing between cell A and the adjacent cell $\mathrm{B}\left(I_{\mathrm{AB}}\right)$ is proportional to the voltage difference between the two cells $\left(\Delta V_{A B}\right)$ but inversely proportional to the electrical resistance between them $\left(R_{\mathrm{AB}}\right)$ :

$$
I_{A B}=\frac{V_{A}-V_{B}}{R_{A B}}=\frac{\Delta V_{A B}}{R_{A B}}
$$

When $R_{\mathrm{AB}}$ is very small (i.e., when the cells are tightly coupled), the gap junctions are minimal barriers to the flow of depolarizing current.

Imagine that several interconnected cells are initially all at their normal resting potentials (see Fig. 21-3B). An action potential propagating from the left of cell A now injects depolarizing current into cell A. As a result, the cell depolarizes to $V_{\mathrm{A}}$, which is now somewhat positive compared with $V_{\mathrm{B}}$. Thus, a small depolarizing current (i.e., positive charges) will also move from cell A to cell B and depolarize cell B. In turn, current flowing from cell B will then depolarize cell C. By this process, the cells closest to the current source undergo the greatest depolarization.

Imagine that the injected current, coming from the active region of the heart to the left, depolarizes cell A just to its threshold (see Fig. 21-3C, red curve) but that cell A has not

yet fired an action potential. At this instant, the current passing from cell A to cell B cannot bring cell B to its threshold. Of course, cell A will eventually fire an action potential and, in the process, depolarize enough to inject enough current into cell B to raise cell B to its threshold. Thus, the action potential propagates down the chain of cells, but relatively slowly. On the other hand, if the active region to the left injects more current into cell A (see Fig. 21-3C, blue curve)—producing a larger depolarization in cell A-the current passing from cell A to cell B will be greater and sufficient to depolarize cell B beyond its voltage threshold for a regenerative action potential. However, at this instant, the current passing from cell B to cell C is still not sufficient to trigger an action potential in cell C. That will have to wait until the active region moves closer to cell C, but the wait is not as long as in the first example (red curve in Fig. 21-3C). Thus, the action potential propagates more rapidly in this second example (blue curve in Fig. 21-3C).

In principle, we could make the action potential propagate more rapidly down the chain of cells in two ways. First, we could allow more ion channels to open in the active region of the heart, so that depolarizing current is larger (blue curve in Fig. 21-3C). Second, we could lower the threshold for the regenerative action potential ("more negative threshold" in Fig. 21-3C), so that even the small current represented by the red curve is now sufficient to trigger cell B.

Just as in a nerve axon conducting an action potential, the intracellular and extracellular currents in heart muscle must be equal and opposite. In the active region of the heart (to the left of cell A in Fig. 21-3B), cells have reached threshold and their action potentials provide the source of current that depolarizes cells that are approaching threshold (e.g.,
cells A and B). As cell A itself is depolarizing to and beyond threshold, its $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are opening, enabling these cations (i.e., positive charge) to enter. The positive charge that enters cell A not only depolarizes cell A but also produces a flow of positive charge to cell B -intracellular current. This flow of positive charge discharges the membrane capacitance of cell B, thereby depolarizing cell B and releasing extracellular positive charges that had been associated with the membrane. The movement of this extracellular positive charge from around cell B toward the extracellular region around cell A constitutes the extracellular current. The flow of intracellular current from cell A to cell B and the flow of extracellular current from around cell B to around cell A are equal and opposite. It is the flow of this extracellular current in the heart that gives rise to an instantaneous electrical vector, which changes with time. Each point on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is the sum of the many such electrical vectors, generated by the many cells of the heart.

## Cardiac action potentials have as many as five distinctive phases

The initiation time, shape, and duration of the action potential are distinctive for different parts of the heart, reflecting their different functions (see Fig. 21-2). These distinctions arise because the myocytes in each region of the heart have a characteristic set of channels and anatomy. Underlying cardiac action potentials are four major time-dependent and voltage-gated membrane currents (Table 21-1): 0 N21-1

1. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current $\left(I_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$ is responsible for the rapid depolarizing phase of the action potential in atrial and ventricular muscle and in Purkinje fibers.

# N21-1 Cardiac Ion Channels 

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer

The number of distinct ion channels found in heart cells has grown dramatically with the development of new tools. While the cellular and organ-level function follows the presentation in the text and this webnote, important subtleties in the detailed function can depend on the additional channel subtypes that may be expressed at varying levels and that can change under stress or during disease. For example, heart cells express not only the "cardiac" sodium channel (Nav1.5) but also other sodium channel types (e.g., Nav1.4, which is normally found in skeletal muscle; see Table 7-1). In addition to the L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel, cardiac myocytes may also express the T-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel
(see Table 7-2). In many diseases, the expression of the T-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel increases. Ventricular and atrial myocytes may express $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels in a diversity much greater than described in the text. Moreover, the array of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels often changes in disease processes. eFigure 21-1 lists some of the prominent channels and how they contribute to the cardiac action potential.

2. The $\mathbf{C a}^{2+}$ current $\left(I_{\mathrm{Ca}}\right)$ is responsible for the rapid depolarizing phase of the action potential in the SA node and AV node; it also triggers contraction in all cardiomyocytes.
3. The $\mathbf{K}^{+}$current $\left(I_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$ is responsible for the repolarizing phase of the action potential in all cardiomyocytes.
4. The pacemaker current $\left(I_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ is responsible, in part, for pacemaker activity in SA nodal cells, AV nodal cells, and Purkinje fibers.

Besides these four currents, channels carry numerous other currents in heart muscle. In addition, two electrogenic transporters (5) N21-2 carry current across plasma membranes: the type 1 Na -Ca exchanger (NCX1; see pp. 123-124) and the Na-K pump (see pp. 115-117).

Traditionally, the changes in membrane potential $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ during the cardiac action potential are divided into separate phases, as illustrated in Figure 21-4A for cardiac action potentials from the SA node and in Figure 21-4B for those from ventricular muscle.

Phase 0 is the upstroke of the action potential. If the upstroke is due only to $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ (see Fig. 21-4A), it will be slow. If the upstroke is due to both $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ (see Fig. 21-4B), it will be fast.

Phase 1 is the rapid repolarization component of the action potential (when it exists). This phase is due to almost total inactivation of $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ or $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ and may also depend on the activation of a minor $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current not listed previously, called $I_{\mathrm{ss}}$ (for transient outward current).

Phase 2 is the plateau phase of the action potential, which is prominent in ventricular muscle. It depends on the continued entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ or $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions through their major channels and on a minor membrane current due to the Na-Ca exchanger NCX1. (5) N21-2

Phase 3 is the repolarization component of the action potential. It depends on $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ (see Table 21-1).

Phase 4 constitutes the electrical diastolic phase of the action potential. $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ during phase 4 is termed the diastolic potential; the most negative $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ during phase 4 is the maximum diastolic potential. In SA and AV nodal cells, changes in $I_{\mathrm{K}}, I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, and $I_{\mathrm{f}}$ produce pacemaker activity during phase 4. Purkinje fibers also exhibit pacemaker activity but use only $I_{\mathrm{f}}$. Atrial and ventricular muscle have no timedependent currents during phase 4.

## The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current is the largest current in the heart

The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current (see Table 21-1) is the largest current in heart muscle, which may have as many as $200 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels per square micrometer of membrane. These channels are abundant in ventricular and atrial muscle, in Purkinje fibers, and in specialized conduction pathways of the atria. This current is not present in SA or AV nodal cells.

The channel that underlies $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ is a classic voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel, with both $\alpha$ and $\beta_{1}$ subunits (see pp. 182-185). The unique cardiac $\alpha$ subunit (Nav1.5) has several phosphorylation sites that make it sensitive to stimulation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (see p. 57). (5) N21-3

At the negative resting potentials of the ventricular muscle cells, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are closed. However, these channels rapidly activate (in 0.1 to 0.2 ms ) in response to local depolarization produced by conducted action potentials and produce a massive inward current that underlies most of the rapid upstroke of the cardiac action potential (phase 0 in Fig. 21-4B). If $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ remains at a positive level, these channels close in a time-dependent process known as inactivation. This process, which is slower than activation but still fairly rapid (half-time, $\sim 1 \mathrm{~ms}$ ), is partly responsible for the rapid repolarization of the action potential (phase 1). At the potentials maintained during the plateau of the cardiac action potential-slightly positive to 0 mV during phase 2 -a very small but important component of this current remains $\left(I_{\mathrm{Na}, \text { late }}\right)$. The sustained level of $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ helps prolong phase 2. (5) N21-4

In cardiac tissues other than the SA and AV nodes, the regenerative spread of the conducted action potential

# N21-2 Cardiac Currents Carried by Electrogenic Transporters 

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer

In addition to the channels listed in Table 21-1, numerous other channels are present in heart muscle. The distribution of this large array of time- and voltage-dependent membrane currents (see Table 21-1) differs in each of the different cardiac cell types. In addition, there are yet other membrane channels (not shown in Table 21-1) that are responsible for "background" currents that we have not discussed, that are not gated by voltage, and that are not time dependent. These background currents can be modulated by diverse factors and help to shape the action potential.

In addition to all of the channels, cardiac cells have two electrogenic transporters that also carry current across the plasma membranes: the Na-Ca exchanger and the Na-K pump.

## Na-Ca Exchanger

The Na-Ca exchanger (NCX; see pp. 123-124 and 126) is an electrogenic transporter that normally moves three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions into the cell in order to extrude one $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion, using the electrochemical gradient for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$as an energy source for transport. Under these conditions, the Na-Ca exchanger produces an inward or
depolarizing current (i.e., a net inward movement of positive charge). However, if this electrochemical gradient reverses, as it transiently does early during the cardiac action potential (due to the positive $\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{m}}$ ), the Na-Ca exchanger may be able to reverse and mediate entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and a net outward current. Later during the cardiac action potential, the Na-Ca exchanger returns to its original direction of operation (i.e., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ extrusion and inward current). During the plateau phase of the action potential, the inward current mediated by the Na-Ca exchanger tends to prolong the action potential.

## Na-K Pump

The Na-K pump is also an electrogenic transporter, normally moving two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions into the cell for every three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions that it transports out of the cell, using ATP as an energy source (see pp. 115-117). Therefore, this pump produces an outward or hyperpolarizing current. Cardiotonic steroids (such as digoxin and ouabain) inhibit the Na-K pump and thereby cause an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$. This inhibition also reduces the outward current carried by the pump and therefore depolarizes the cell.

## N21-3 Cardiac $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Channels

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

The channel that underlies $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ is a classic voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channel, with both an $\alpha$ and $\beta$, subunit (see p. 187 and Fig. 7-12A). The cardiac $\alpha$ subunit differs from the brain $\alpha$ subunit in having a long cytoplasmic loop connecting the first and second repeats of its six membrane-spanning segments. This long loop has several phosphorylation sites, and it conveys a unique quality to the cardiac channel: phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A, or PKA; see p. 57) stimulates the cardiac channel, but inhibits the brain channel.

## N21-4 Late $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Current

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer

Although the primary purpose of $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ in ventricular and atrial myocytes is to support the rapid depolarization of the membrane potential during the upstroke of the cardiac action potential and to provide the inward current needed for rapid conduction, there are other aspects of its function. A small residual fraction of the $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ channels may incompletely inactivate or exist in a distinct kinetic mode following phase 1 of the action potential. This enables these channels to contribute current, now dubbed $I_{\mathrm{Na}, \text { late }}$, that lingers long into phases 2 and 3 of the ventricular and atrial action potentials. Both the inward current and the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$influx attributed to $I_{\mathrm{Na}, \text { late }}$ can contribute to changes in myocyte behavior that are proarrhythmic. Since many disease conditions enhance $I_{\mathrm{Na}, \text { late }}$ there is an intense effort to identify and test therapeutic agents that block $I_{\mathrm{Na}, \text { late }}$ with minimal impact on the early or normal $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ (Maier and Sossalla, 2013). The specific post-translational modifications of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel protein subunits that underlie the late $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel state remain unknown but are under active investigation.

Figure 21-4 Phases of cardiac action potentials. The records in this figure are idealized. $I_{\mathrm{K}}, I_{\mathrm{Na}}, I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, and $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ are currents through $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and nonselective cation channels, respectively.
depends in large part on the magnitude of $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ (see Fig. 21-3C). The depolarization produced by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current not only activates $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ in neighboring cells but also activates other membrane currents in the same cell, including $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{K}}$. For example, unlike in skeletal muscle, in which the action potential duration is relatively short, in cardiac myocytes the
depolarization-initiated by Nav1.5-activates the L-type cardiac $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel (Cav1.2; see next section), which greatly prolongs the depolarizing phase of the cardiac action potential due to its long-duration opening events. Local anesthetic antiarrhythmic drugs, such as lidocaine, work by partially blocking $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$.

## The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current in the heart passes primarily through L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels

The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current $\left(I_{\mathrm{Ca}}\right)$ see Table 21-1) is present in all cardiac myocytes. The L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel (Cav1.2; see pp. 190-193) is the dominant one in the heart. T-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, with different biophysical and pharmacological properties, are also present but in smaller amounts.

In the SA node, the role of $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, like that of the other timeand voltage-dependent membrane currents, is to contribute to pacemaker activity. In both the SA and AV nodes, $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ is the inward current source that is responsible for the upstrokes (phase 0 ) of the SA and AV nodal action potentials. Because the nodal cells lack the larger $I_{\mathrm{Nn}}$, their upstrokes are slower than those in atrial and ventricular muscle (compare $A$ and $B$ of Fig. 21-4). Therefore, the smaller $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ discharges the membrane capacitance of neighboring cells in the SA and AV nodes less rapidly, so that the speed of the conducted action potential is much slower than that of any other cardiac tissue. This feature in the AV node leads to an electrical delay between atrial contraction and ventricular contraction that permits more time for the atria to empty blood into the ventricles.

Although it is smaller, $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ sums with $I_{\mathrm{Nn}}$ during the upstroke of the action potentials of the ventricular and atrial muscle and the Purkinje fibers. In this way, it increases the velocity of the conducted action potential in these tissues. Like $I_{\mathrm{Nn}}, I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ produces virtually no current at very negative potentials because the channels are closed. At more positive values of $V_{m}$, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels rapidly activate (in $\sim 1 \mathrm{~ms}$ ) and, by a completely separate and timedependent process, inactivate (half-time, 10 to 20 ms ). (5) N21-5 A small $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ remains during phase 2 of the action potential, helping to prolong the plateau. In atrial and ventricular muscle cells, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entering via L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels activates the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by calcium-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release (see pp. 242-243). Blockers of L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channelstherapeutic agents such as verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine-act by inhibiting $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$.

## The repolarizing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current turns on slowly

Cardiac action potentials last two orders of magnitude longer than action potentials in skeletal muscle because the repolarizing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current turns on very slowly and-in the case of atrial myocytes, Purkinje fibers, and ventricular myocytes-with a considerable delay. The repolarizing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current ( $I_{\mathrm{K}}$; see Table 21-1) is found in all cardiac myocytes and is responsible for repolarizing the membrane at the end of the action potential (phase 3 in Fig. 21-4A, B). Two currents underlie $I_{\mathrm{K}}$-a relatively rapid component $\left(I_{\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{K}}}\right)$ carried by heteromeric HERG/miRP1 channels and a relatively slow component $\left(I_{\mathrm{K}_{0}}\right)$ carried by heteromeric KvLQT1/minK channels (see Box 7-3). 0 N21-6 The $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ membrane current is very small at negative potentials. With depolarization, it slowly activates ( 20 to 100 ms ) but does not inactivate. In SA and AV nodal cells, it contributes to pacemaker activity by slowly deactivating at the diastolic voltage.

In addition to $I_{\mathrm{K}}$, several other $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents are present in cardiac tissue.

Early Outward K+ Current (A-type Current) Atrial and ventricular muscle cells have some early transient outward current $\left(I_{\mathrm{to}}\right)$. This current is activated by depolarization but rapidly inactivates. It contributes to phase 1 repolarization and is analogous to the A-type currents (see p. 193) seen in nerves. A Kv4.3 channel mediates the A-type current in heart and certain other cells.

G Protein-Activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Current Acetylcholine activates muscarinic receptors and, through the $\beta \gamma$ subunits of a G protein, activates an outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current mediated by GIRK $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels (see pp. 197-198). This current is prominent in SA and AV nodal cells, where it decreases pacemaker rate by cell hyperpolarization. When activated, this current also slows the conduction of the action potential through the AV node.
$\mathrm{K}_{\text {ATP }}$ Current ATP-sensitive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels ( $\mathrm{K}_{\text {ATP }}$; see p. 198), activated by low intracellular [ATP], are present in abundance and may play a role in electrical regulation of contractile behavior. These channels are octamers, consisting of four subunits (Kir6.1 or Kir6.2) forming the pore of an inwardrectifier channel and four sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1 or SUR2).

## The $I_{\mathrm{f}}$ current is mediated by a nonselective cation channel

The pacemaker current $\left(I_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ is found in SA and AV nodal cells and in Purkinje fibers (see Fig. 21-4A, blue curve). The channel underlying this current is a nonspecific cation channel called HCN (for hyperpolarization activated, cyclic nucleotide gated; see pp. 162-165), with HCN4 being dominant in the adult heart. Because the HCN channels conduct both $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, the reversal potential of $I_{\mathrm{f}}$ is around -20 mV , between the Nernst potentials for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(about -90 mV ) and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$(about +50 mV ). The HCN channels have the unusual property (hence the subscript $f$, for "funny" current) that they do not conduct at positive potentials but are activated by hyperpolarization at the end of phase 3. The activation is slow ( 100 ms ), and the current does not inactivate. Thus, $I_{\mathrm{f}}$ produces an inward, depolarizing current as it slowly activates at the end of phase 3. The $I_{\mathrm{f}}$ current is not the only current that contributes to pacemaker activity; in SA and AV nodal cells, $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ also contribute significantly to the phase 4 depolarization.

## Different cardiac tissues uniquely combine ionic currents to produce distinctive action potentials

The shape of the action potential differs among different cardiac cells because of the unique combination of various currents-both the voltage-gated/time-dependent currents discussed in the preceding four sections and the "background" currents-present in each cell type. (5) N21-7 In Chapter 6, we introduced Equation 6-12, which describes $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ in terms of the conductances for the different ions ( $G_{\mathrm{Nn}}, G_{\mathrm{K}}$, $G_{\mathrm{Ca}}, G_{\mathrm{Cl}}$ ) relative to the total membrane conductance $\left(G_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ and the equilibrium potentials $\left(E_{\mathrm{Nn}}, E_{\mathrm{K}}, E_{\mathrm{Ca}}, E_{\mathrm{Cl}}\right)$ :

$$
V_{\mathrm{m}}=\frac{G_{\mathrm{K}}}{G_{\mathrm{m}}} E_{\mathrm{K}}+\frac{G_{\mathrm{Na}}}{G_{\mathrm{m}}} E_{\mathrm{Na}}+\frac{G_{\mathrm{Ca}}}{G_{\mathrm{m}}} E_{\mathrm{Ca}}+\frac{G_{\mathrm{Cl}}}{G_{\mathrm{m}}} E_{\mathrm{Cl}} \ldots
$$

# N21-5 Time Course of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Current in Ventricular Muscle 

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer

In Figure 21-4B, the lower panel (red trace) illustrates the time course of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current during an action potential in a ventricular myocyte.

During phase 4, at rest, where $V_{m}$ is maximally negative, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are mostly closed and $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ is a very small inward current. Following the depolarization produced by the very fast $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel during phase 0 , the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels activate (in -1 ms ), producing the rapid downstroke of the red $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ record in Figure 21-4B.

Next, by a completely separate and time-dependent process, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels inactivate at positive potentials (half-time, 10 to 20 ms ), producing the slower decay of inward current toward the end of phase 1 in Figure 21-4B. Along with the inactivation of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and the opening of the $\mathrm{Kv} 4.3$ channels that underlie $I_{\mathrm{to}}$ the inactivation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels contributes to the small repolarization that defines phase 1 (see Fig. 21-4B).

Note that, for both activation and inactivation, the cardiac $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are about an order of magnitude slower than cardiac $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels.

During phase 2 of the action potential, a small $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ remains, helping to prolong the plateau. This phase is represented by the flat portion of the red $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ record displaced below the dashed zerocurrent line in Figure 21-4B.

During phase 3, as $V_{m}$ returns to negative potentials, two things happen to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. First, the still-active $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (which were activated by positive $V_{m}$ values) will go through a process of deactivation (caused by negative $V_{m}$ values). Second, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels that had been inactivated during phase 2 now begin to recover from inactivation. The net effect is that a minuscule $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current remains during phase $4 \ldots$ which takes us back to the beginning of this discussion.

## N21-6 Cardiac K ${ }^{+}$Currents

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

Table 21-1 lists five $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents:

- $I_{\mathrm{to}}$-the transient outward current-occurs during phase 1 of the action potential. Along with the inactivation of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels and (a bit later) the inactivation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, $I_{\mathrm{to}}$ contributes to the small repolarization that defines phase 1 (see Fig. 21-4B). The Shaker-type $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel (see pp. 193-196) Kv4.3 carries $I_{\mathrm{to}}$.
- $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$-the rapid repolarizing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current-is the current arising from heteromultimeric channels composed of HERG and miRP subunits.

## N21-7 Contribution of Ionic Currents to the Action Potential

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer

Equation 21-2 gives $V_{m}$ in terms of the weighted conductances of the various ions. Another, less general, way of expressing this concept is the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation, which we introduced in Chapter 6. The GHK equation (given as Equation 6-9 and reproduced here) relates $V_{m}$ to the cellular permeability to different ions $\left(P_{\mathrm{Na}}, P_{\mathrm{K}}, P_{\mathrm{D}}\right)$, as well as to the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of these ions:

$$
V_{\mathrm{rev}}=\frac{R T}{F} \ln \left(\frac{P_{0}\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{\mathrm{Na}}\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{\mathrm{D}}\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]}{P_{0}\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]+P_{\mathrm{Na}}\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]+P_{\mathrm{D}}\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}\right)
$$

Several assumptions underlie the GHK equation, including that (1) the voltage varies linearly with distance through the
membrane (constant-field assumption), (2) the ions move independently of one another, (3) the ions are driven only by their electrochemical gradients, (4) the permeabilities are constant, and (5) the total membrane current is zero (i.e., the individual ionic currents sum to zero and $V_{m}$ is constant). Although we derived this GHK equation with these assumptions-which are not strictly true during the action potential-the equation nevertheless embodies the notion that changes in permeabilities and concentrations of specific ions will affect the shape of the action potential.

Therefore, as the relative contribution of a particular membrane current becomes dominant, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ approaches the equilibrium potential for that membrane current (Table 21-2). How fast $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ changes during the action potential depends on the magnitude of each of the currents (Equation 21-2). Not only does each current independently affect the shape of the action potential, but the voltage- and timedependent currents interact with one another because they affect-and are affected by- $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. Other important influences on the shape of the cardiac action potential are the membrane capacitance of each cell and the geometry of the conduction pathway (e.g., AV node, bundle of His, ventricular muscle) as the action potential propagates from cell to cell in this functional syncytium via gap junctions. Therefore, it is easy to understand, at a conceptual level, how a particular cell's unique complement of ion channels, the properties of these channels at a particular instant in time, the intracellular ion concentrations, and the cell's geometry can all contribute to the shape of an action potential.

## The SA node is the primary pacemaker of the heart

The Concept of Pacemaker Activity The normal heart has three intrinsic pacemaking tissues: the SA node, the AV node, and the Purkinje fibers. The term pacemaker activity refers to the spontaneous time-dependent depolarization of the cell membrane that leads to an action potential in an otherwise quiescent cell. Any cardiac cell with pacemaker activity can initiate the heartbeat. The pacemaker with the highest frequency will be the one to trigger an action

potential that will propagate throughout the heart. In other words, the fastest pacemaker sets the heart rate and overrides all slower pacemakers. Thus, cardiac pacemakers have a hierarchy among themselves, based on their intrinsic frequency. Two fundamental principles underlie pacemaker activity. The first is that inward or depolarizing membrane currents interact with outward or hyperpolarizing membrane currents to establish regular cycles of spontaneous depolarization and repolarization. The second is that in a particular cell, these currents interact during phase 4 within a narrow range of diastolic potentials: between -70 and -50 mV in SA and AV nodal cells, and between -90 and -65 mV in Purkinje fibers.

SA Node The SA node is found in the right atrium and is the primary site of origin of the electrical signal in the mammalian heart (Table 21-3). It is the smallest electrical region of the heart and constitutes the fastest normal pacemaker, with an intrinsic rate of about 60 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$, or faster in an individual at rest. SA nodal cells are stable oscillators whose currents are always varying with time. (○) N21-9 The interactions among three time-dependent and voltage-gated membrane currents ( $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}, I_{\mathrm{K}}$, and $I_{\mathrm{f}}$ ) control the intrinsic rhythmicity of the SA node. The sum of a decreasing outward current ( $I_{\mathrm{K}}$; green curve in Fig. 21-4A) and two increasing inward currents ( $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{f}}$ red and blue curves in Fig. 21-4A) produces the slow pacemaker depolarization (phase 4) associated with the SA node. The maximum diastolic potential (i.e., the most negative $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ ) of the SA nodal cells, which occurs during phase 4 of the action potential, is between -60 and -70 mV . As $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ rises toward the threshold of about -55 mV , $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ becomes increasingly activated and eventually becomes regenerative, producing the upstroke of the action potential. This depolarization rapidly turns off (i.e., deactivates) $I_{\mathrm{b}}$ and the whole process begins again. (○) N21-10

The membrane currents discussed in the previous paragraph are under the control of local and circulating agents (e.g., acetylcholine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine) and are also targets for therapeutic agents designed to modulate the heart's rhythm (e.g., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel blockers and $\beta$ adrenergic blockers).

AV Node The AV node, located just above the AV ring, is the secondary site of origin of the electrical signal in the

## N21-8 Mathematical Modeling of the Heart

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer

In this chapter and throughout the text, reference is often made to mathematical models and the way they are used to test interpretations of data and to integrate specific experimental findings into a larger physiological context. This approach is used increasingly in teaching, drug testing, and experimental investigations, and will be used in the future in personalized medicine. In heart and other organs, tissues, and cells, the primary weakness of mathematical models is model validation: How do we know that the choice of unknown or uncertain variables placed into the mathematical model is optimal and unprejudiced? This selection is now being done through optimization programs and approaches that, if successful, can be used to improve personalized medicine. Courses are available to begin the application of "systems biology" methods for all.

## N21-10 Control of Pacemaker Activity

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer

The interactions of three membrane currents ( $I_{\mathrm{s}}, I_{\mathrm{CL}}$ [L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel current], and $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ ) contribute to pacemaker activity in SA node and AV node in heart as presented in the text. Two other inward currents are considered possible contributors to pacemaker activity under normal conditions, $I_{\mathrm{CA}, 7}$ and $I_{\mathrm{HCV}}$ (the T-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel current and the $\mathrm{Na} \mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{a}}$ exchanger current, respectively). Mathematical models $\mathbf{\leftarrow} \mathbf{N 2 1 - 8}$ and experimental evidence support the roles that these mechanisms could play in influencing pacemaker activity under normal conditions. Active investigations by many laboratories seek to determine the extent to which these additional mechanisms may influence normal and pathological pacemaker activity. The Na-Ca exchanger-dependent contribution has been dubbed the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ clock. The essence of the "clock" is the time-dependent subcellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release ( $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks) from the SR in SA and AV nodal cells. When this occurs the subcellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks activate an inward (depolarizing) $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{HCV}}$.

## N21-9 Action Potential of the Sinoatrial Node

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer

Figure 21-4A illustrates the phases of the SA node action potential and the underlying currents.

During phase 0 of the action potential, $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ activates regeneratively (see red record in bottom panel of Fig. 21-4A, specifically the rapid downstroke), producing a rapid upstroke of $V_{\mathrm{in}}$. Underlying $I_{\mathrm{CA}}$ are both T-type and L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels.

At the transition between phases 0 and $3, I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ then begins to inactivate, a feature that begins the repolarization process. Note that phases 1 and 2 are not seen in the SA node because the inactivation of $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ combines with the slow activation of $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ to bring about the phase 3 repolarization of the action potential.

As $V_{\text {in }}$ approaches the maximum diastolic potential at the beginning of phase 4 , three slow changes in membrane current take place that underlie phase 4 pacemaker activity:

1. $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ deactivates slowly with time (over hundreds of milliseconds), producing a decreasing outward current (see green record in middle panel of Fig. 21-4A, specifically the slow decline of outward current during phase 4).
2. $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ contributes inward (i.e., depolarizing) current in the following way. Even though $V_{\text {in }}$ has become more negative at the end of phase $3, V_{\text {in }}$ is still positive enough to keep $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ partially activated (albeit to only a small extent) from the previous action potential. Additionally, at the end of phase $3, V_{\text {in }}$ is still negative enough to cause $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ to recover slowly from inactivation (remember that recovery from inactivation and activation of $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ are independent processes). Thus, as $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ recovers from inactivation over hundreds of milliseconds, there is a small, increasingly inward $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ that tends to depolarize the SA nodal cells during phase 4 (see red record in lower panel of Fig. 21-4A, specifically the slow downstroke of inward current during phase 4).
3. $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ slowly activates as $V_{\text {in }}$ becomes sufficiently negative at the end of phase 3 . The result is a slowly growing inward (i.e., depolarizing) current (see blue record in middle panel of Fig. 21-4A, specifically the rather rapid downstroke of inward current during phase 4).
Thus, during phase 4, the sum of a decreasing outward current $\left(I_{\mathrm{s}}\right)$ and two increasing inward currents ( $I_{\mathrm{CA}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ ) produces the slow pacemaker depolarization associated with the SA node.

As $V_{\text {in }}$ rises from about -65 mV toward the threshold of about -55 mV during the pacemaker depolarization, $I_{\mathrm{CA}}$ becomes increasingly activated and eventually becomes regenerative, producing the rapid upstroke of the action potential ... which takes us back to the beginning of this discussion. Note that the turning off of $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ tends to oppose the rapid upstroke of $V_{\text {in }}$ during phase 0 . However, the activation of $I_{\mathrm{CA}}$ overwhelms the turning off of $I_{\mathrm{s}}$.

mammalian heart. Normally, the AV node may be excited by an impulse reaching it by way of the specialized atrial conduction pathways (see below). Like that of the SA node, the intrinsic rhythmicity of the AV node depends on the interaction of three time-dependent and voltage-gated currents: $I_{\mathrm{K}}$, $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, and $I_{\mathrm{f}}$. Electrically, the SA and AV nodes share many properties; they have similar action potentials, pacemaker mechanisms, and drug sensitivities and a similarly slow conduction of action potentials. Because the intrinsic pacemaker rate of the AV node is slower ( $\sim 40$ beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ ) than that of the SA node, it does not set the heart rate; its pacemaker activity is considered secondary. However, if the SA node should fail, the AV node can assume control of the heart and drive it successfully.

Purkinje Fibers The His-Purkinje fiber system originates at the AV node with the bundle of His and splits to form the left and right bundle branches (see Fig. 21-1). The right bundle conducts the electrical signal to the right ventricle, and the left bundle conducts the signal to the left ventricle. The anatomy of the left bundle is variable, but this bundle frequently divides into two main branches-the left anterosuperior fascicle (or hemibundle) and the left posteroinferior fascicle.

Purkinje fiber cells have the slowest intrinsic pacemaker rate ( 20 beats/min or less). Thus, Purkinje fiber cells become functional pacemakers only if the SA and AV pacemakers fail, and are considered tertiary pacemakers. On the other hand, the bundle of His and the Purkinje fibers are an effective conduction system within the ventricles because they conduct action potentials more quickly than any other tissue within the heart (Table 21-4).

The action potential of the Purkinje fibers depends on four time- and voltage-dependent membrane currents: $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ (not present in the SA and AV nodal cells), $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}, I_{\mathrm{K}}$, and $I_{\mathrm{f}}$. The maximum diastolic potential is about -80 mV . From that negative $V_{\mathrm{m}}$, these cells produce a very slow pacemaker depolarization (phase 4) that depends on $I_{\mathrm{f}}$. 0 N21-11 Because of their low rate of pacemaker depolarization and therefore the uncertainty of reaching the threshold for triggering of an action potential, Purkinje fiber cells are unreliable as pacemakers. Normally, the action potential passing through the AV node activates the Purkinje fiber cells, resulting in a rapid upstroke (phase 0 ), mediated by $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$. Because $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ is large, Purkinje fibers conduct action potentials rapidly.

## Atrial and ventricular myocytes fire action potentials but do not have pacemaker activity

The resting potential of atrial and ventricular myocytes is substantially more negative (about -80 mV ) than the maximum diastolic potential of SA and AV node pacemaker cells (see Fig. 21-1).

Atrial Muscle Within each atrium, the action potential spreads among cardiac myocytes via a direct cell-to-cell pathway. The atrial action potential depends on three primary time- and voltage-dependent membrane currents: $I_{\mathrm{Na}}, I_{\mathrm{K}}$, and $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$. There is no normal spontaneous (i.e., pacemaker) activity in atrial muscle. It has been proposed that atrial muscle has four special conducting bundles (see Fig. 21-1). One, Bachmann's bundle (anterior interatrial myocardial band), is interatrial and conducts the cardiac action potential from the SA node to the left atrium. Three other internodal pathways-the anterior, middle, and posterior internodal pathways-appear to conduct the action potential from the SA node to the AV node. Therefore, the first step in propagation of the cardiac action potential is the depolarization of the atria, following a general axis from right to left and downward (Fig. 21-5, step 1).

If the conduction path through the AV node is blocked, the ventricles will not be activated electrically and will not contract. The spontaneous activity that can arise in the Purkinje fiber cells may provide the necessary electrical signal to activate the ventricles, but this activation occurs normally only at a very low rate, and Purkinje fiber pacemaker activity is fairly unreliable.

Ventricular Muscle After the action potential reaches the AV node, it travels to the His-Purkinje fiber network and out into the ventricular muscle. The only normal electrical access between atrial muscle and the ventricles is the AV node. Because of this single electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles, there is a well-defined and orderly sequence of electrical activity through the rapidly conducting His-Purkinje network to the ventricles. Within the ventricular muscle, the action potential conducts from cell to cell. Steps 2 to 6 in Figure 21-5 summarize the sequence of events in ventricular activation, which is completed in $\sim 100 \mathrm{~ms}$ :

Step 2: The septum depolarizes from left to right.
Step 3: The anteroseptal region depolarizes.
Step 4: The myocardium always depolarizes from the endocardium (the cells lining the ventricles) toward the epicardium (cells on the outer surface of the heart). The left ventricle depolarizes at the apex while the Purkinje fibers are still in the process of conducting the action potential toward the base of the left ventricle.
Step 5: Depolarization spreads from the apex toward the base, carried by the Purkinje fibers. This spread to the base begins even as the signal in the apex is still spreading from the endocardium to the epicardium. The last region to depolarize is the posterobasal region of the left ventricle.
Step 6: The ventricles are fully depolarized.

# N21-11 Action Potential of the Purkinje Fiber 

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer

As pointed out in the text, the action potential of the Purkinje fibers depends on four time- and voltage-dependent membrane currents:

- $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ (not present in the SA and AV nodal cells)
- $I_{\mathrm{CA}}$
- $I_{\mathrm{K}}$
- $I_{\mathrm{s}}$
- As in ventricular muscle, the maximum diastolic potential of Purkinje fibers ( -80 mV ) is sufficiently negative that little if any $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ remains active during phase 4 of the action potential (see orange curve in middle panel of Fig. 21-4B for ventricular muscle).

In contrast to the SA and AV nodes, in Purkinje fibers the maximum diastolic potential also is sufficiently negative that little if any $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ remains active during phase 4 of the action potential (see red curve in lower panel of Fig. 21-4A for the SA node).

Also in contrast to the SA and AV nodal cells, in Purkinje fiber cells $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ deactivates quickly and does not appear to contribute to pacemaker depolarization during phase 4 of the action potential (see green curve in middle panel of Fig. 21-4A for the SA node).

However, at the more negative values of $V_{m}$ prevailing in Purkinje fiber cells, $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ activates more fully than in SA or AV nodal cells during phase 4 of the action potential (see blue curve in middle panel of Fig. 21-4A for the SA node). The time-dependent activation of $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ produces an inward (i.e., depolarizing) current that underlies the depolarization of pacemaker activity. However, this pacemaking happens at a very low rate, so that the pacemaker activity of the Purkinje cells does not normally determine the "heart rate" of the ventricles.

Normally, the Purkinje fiber cells are activated by the conducted action potential that passes through the AV node. The rapid upstroke (phase 0) is mediated by $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{CA}}$. The rapid repolarization (phase 1) occurs because of the inactivation of $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and the activation of $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ (see Table 21-1 and p. 485). The plateau (phase 2) mainly reflects a small maintained inward current via $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{CA}}$. Finally, the repolarization (phase 3) begins with the activation of $I_{\mathrm{K}}$.

As is the case for the other pacemaker tissues in the heart, the intrinsic rhythmicity of the Purkinje fibers is the target of therapeutic agents, neurohormones, and physiological changes (e.g., changes in heart rate).

![bo9185266204](bo9185266204.jpg)

Figure 21-5 Sequence of depolarization in cardiac tissue.

Ventricular muscle has three major time- and voltagegated membrane currents: $I_{\mathrm{Na}}, I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, and $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ (see Fig. 21-4B). Ventricular muscle has no $I_{\mathrm{D}}$ and healthy ventricular muscle cells show no pacemaker activity. Starting from a resting potential of -80 mV , the rapid upstroke of the ventricular action potential results from the activation of $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ by an external stimulus (e.g., an impulse conducted to the muscle by a Purkinje fiber or by a neighboring ventricular muscle cell). The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current is of particular importance to ventricular muscle because it provides the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx that activates the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the SR. The rapid repolarization (phase 1), the plateau (phase 2), and the repolarization (phase 3) all appear to be governed by mechanisms similar to those found in the Purkinje fibers. ( $\mathbf{N 2 1 - 1 1}$ However, the plateau phase is prolonged in ventricular muscle because the inward and outward currents are rather stable during that time (green, orange, and red curves in Fig. 21-4B).

Once a ventricular muscle cell is activated electrically, it is refractory to additional activation. This effective refractory period arises because the inward currents ( $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ ) that are responsible for activation are largely inactivated by the membrane depolarization (see Fig. 21-4B). The effective refractory period is the same as the absolute refractory period in nerve and skeletal muscle. During the effective refractory period, an additional electrical stimulus has no effect on the action potential. At the end of the plateau, the cell begins to repolarize as $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ increases in magnitude. As $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ begin to recover from inactivation, the relative refractory period begins. During this period, an additional electrical stimulus can produce an action potential, but a smaller one than usual. Refractoriness provides the heart with a measure of electrical safety because it prevents extraneous pacemakers (which may arise pathologically) from triggering ectopic beats. An extrasystolic contraction would make the heart a less efficient pump. Refractoriness also prevents tetanus (see p. 241), a feature observed in skeletal muscle. Tetanus of the heart would mean perpetual systole and no further contractions.

## Acetylcholine and catecholamines modulate pacemaker activity, conduction velocity, and contractility

In principle, three mechanisms can slow the firing rate of the SA node (i.e., negative chronotropic effect). First, the steepness of the depolarization during phase 4 can decrease, thereby lengthening the time necessary for $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ to reach threshold (Fig. 21-6A, blue curve). In this way, diastole is longer and the heart rate falls. Second, the maximum diastolic potential can become more negative (see Fig. 21-6B, green curve). In this case, $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ starts phase 4 at a more negative potential and thus takes longer to reach threshold, assuming that the steepness of the phase 4 depolarization has not changed. Third, the threshold for the action potential can become more positive (see Fig. 21-6C, purple curve). Assuming no change in either the maximum diastolic potential (i.e., starting point) or the steepness of the phase 4 depolarization, $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ requires a longer time to reach a more positive threshold. Obviously, a combination of these three mechanisms would have an enhanced effect. Conversely, the SA nodal cells can use each of these three mechanisms in the

opposite sense to increase their firing rate (positive chronotropic effect).

Acetylcholine The vagus nerve, which is parasympathetic (see p. 339), releases acetylcholine ( ACh ) onto the SA and AV nodes and slows the intrinsic pacemaker activity by all three mechanisms discussed in the preceding paragraph. First, ACh decreases $I_{\mathrm{f}}$ in the SA node (see Table 21-1), reducing the steepness of the phase 4 depolarization (see Fig. 21-6A). Second, ACh opens GIRK channels, increasing relative $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance and making the maximum diastolic potential of SA nodal cells more negative (see Fig. 21-6B). Third, ACh reduces $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ in the SA node, thereby reducing the steepness of the phase 4 depolarization (see Fig. 21-6A) and also moving the threshold to more positive values (see Fig. 21-6C). All three effects cooperate to lengthen the time for the SA node to depolarize to threshold; the net effect is to lower the heart rate.

The effects of ACh on currents in the AV node are similar to its effects on those in the SA node. However, because the
pacemaker normally does not reside in the AV node, the physiological effect of ACh on the AV node is to slow conduction velocity. The mechanism is an inhibition of $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ that also makes the threshold more positive for AV nodal cells. Because it is more difficult for one cell to depolarize its neighbors to threshold, conduction velocity falls. ( $\mathbf{N 2 1 - 1 2}$

Catecholamines Sympathetic innervation to the heart is plentiful, releasing mostly norepinephrine. In addition, the adrenal medulla releases epinephrine into the circulation. Catecholamines, which act through $\beta_{1}$-adrenergic receptors, produce an increase in heart rate by two mechanisms. First, catecholamines increase $I_{\mathrm{f}}$ in the nodal cells, thereby increasing the steepness of the phase 4 depolarization (i.e., opposite to the effect in Fig. 21-6A). Second, catecholamines increase $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ in all myocardial cells. The increase in $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ in the SA and AV nodal cells steepens the phase 4 depolarization (i.e., opposite to the effect in Fig. 21-6A) and also makes the threshold more negative (i.e., opposite to the effect in Fig. 21-6C). Note that catecholamines do not appear to change

# N21-12 Effect of Acetylcholine on Purkinje Fiber Conduction Velocity 

Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer
As noted in the text, ACh slows conduction in both the SA and AV nodes. Purkinje fibers are the third (and slowest) group of cells in the heart with intrinsic pacemaker activity. Recent reports suggest that ACh also decreases the intrinsic activity of Purkinje fibers, presumably via a reduction of $\ell$.

## BOX 21-1 Vagal Maneuvers

I a patient has an atrial tachycardia, such as atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation, electrical impulses from the AV node and above may pummel the ventricles and drive them at a very high rate. The ventricular rate may become so high that the effectiveness of the ventricles' pumping is hindered. Because all impulses activating the ventricles must pass through the AV node, use of ACh to slow impulse conduction through the AV node can slow the ventricular rate. Thus, so-called vagal maneuvers, which increase parasympathetic activity, can also decrease ventricular rate. One example is the release from a Valsalva maneuver. During a Valsalva maneuver, one makes a forced expiratory effort against a closed airway (e.g., grunting while lifting a heavy object), raising intrathoracic pressure. Subsequently, opening of the airway allows intrathoracic pressure to fall, so that the now-increased transmural pressure stretches the aorta, stimulating the aortic baroreceptors and triggering a reflex activation of the vagus nerve (see p. 534). Alternatively, massage of the bifurcation of the carotid artery in the neck directly stretches the wall of the carotid sinus, thereby stimulating the baroreceptors. Therefore, by either maneuver, the baroreceptor output signals brainstem centers to stimulate the vagus nerve, thereby slowing the heart.

Digitalis compounds (see p. 117) may also be used to treat supraventricular tachycardias because these drugs may increase vagal tone and decrease sympathetic tone, thereby slowing the conduction of atrial impulses through the AV node. Patients with congestive heart failure may have a low baseline vagal tone and a high baseline sympathetic tone. In these patients, digitalis-like drugs increase myocardial contractility (see p. 530) and cardiac output, causing a reflex increase in vagal tone. (5) N21-17
the maximum diastolic potential. They do, however, produce shorter action potentials as a result of the actions they have on several specific currents.

In atrial and ventricular muscle, catecholamines cause an increase in the strength of contraction (positive inotropic effect) for four reasons. First, the increased $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ (i.e., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx) leads to a greater local increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and also a greater $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release (see pp. 242-243) from the SR. Second, the catecholamines increase the sensitivity of the $\mathrm{SR} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel to cytoplasmic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (see p. 230). Third, catecholamines also enhance Ca pumping into the SR by stimulation of the SERCA Ca pump (see p. 118), thereby increasing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores for later release. Fourth, the increased $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ presents more $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to SERCA, so that $\mathrm{SR} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores increase over time. The four mechanisms make more $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ available to troponin C , enabling a more forceful contraction (Box 21-1).

## THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM

## An ECG generally includes five waves

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the standard clinical tool used to measure the electrical activity of the heart. It is a recording of the small extracellular signals produced by the movement of action potentials through cardiac myocytes. To
obtain a standard 12-lead ECG, one places two electrodes on the upper extremities, two on the lower extremities, and six on standard locations across the chest. In various combinations, the electrodes on the extremities generate the six limb leads (three standard and three augmented), and the chest electrodes produce the six precordial leads. In a lead, one electrode is treated as the positive side of a voltmeter and one or more electrodes as the negative side. Therefore, a lead records the fluctuation in voltage difference between positive and negative electrodes. By variation of which electrodes are positive and which are negative, a standard 12-lead ECG is recorded. Each lead looks at the heart from a unique angle and plane; that is, from what is essentially its own unique point of view.

The fluctuations in extracellular voltage recorded by each lead vary from fractions of a millivolt to several millivolts. These fluctuations are called waves and are named with the letters of the alphabet (Fig. 21-7). (5) N21-13 The $\mathbf{P}$ wave reflects depolarization of the right and left atrial muscle. The QRS complex represents depolarization of ventricular muscle. The $\mathbf{T}$ wave represents repolarization of both ventricles. Finally, the rarely seen $\mathbf{U}$ wave may reflect repolarization of the papillary muscle. The shape and magnitude of these waves are different in each lead because each lead views the electrical activity of the heart from a unique position in space. For his discovery of the mechanism of the ECG, Willem Einthoven was awarded the 1924 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (5) N21-14

Because the ECG machine uses electrodes attached to the skin to measure the sum of the heart's electrical activity, it requires special amplifiers. The ECG machine also has electrical filters that reduce the electrical noise. Moving the limbs, breathing, coughing, shivering, and faulty contact between the skin and an electrode produce artifacts on the recorded ECG.

Because the movement of charge (i.e., the spreading wave of electrical activity in the heart) has both a three-dimensional direction and a magnitude, the signal measured on an ECG is a vector. The system that clinicians use to measure the heart's three-dimensional, time-dependent electrical vector is simple to understand and easy to implement, but it can be challenging to interpret.

## A pair of ECG electrodes defines a lead

To record the complicated time-dependent electrical vector of the heart, the physician or ECG technician constructs a system of leads in two planes that are perpendicular to each other. One plane, the frontal plane, is defined by the six limb leads (Fig. 21-8A). A perpendicular transverse plane is defined by the six precordial leads (see Fig. 21-8B). Each lead is an axis in one of the two planes, onto which the heart projects its electrical activity. The ECG recording from a single lead shows how that lead views the time-dependent changes in voltage of the heart.

Older ECG machines recorded data from the 12 leads one at a time, sequentially. Thus, relatively rare events captured by the recording in one lead might not be reflected in any of the others, which were obtained at different times. Modern ECG machines record from leads synchronously in groups of 3 or 12 . Because the real electrical vector of the heart

![bo9585266204](bo9585266204.jpg)

Figure 21-7 Components of the ECG recording.
consists of just one time-dependent vector signal, you might think that a three-lead recording would suffice to localize the vector signal in space. In principle, this is true: only two leads in one plane and one lead in another plane are needed to fully define the original electrical vector of the heart at all moments. However, recording from all 12 leads is extremely useful because a signal of interest may be easier to see in one lead than in another. For example, an acute myocardial infarction involving the inferior (diaphragmatic) portion of the heart might be easily visualized in leads II, III, and aVF but go completely undetected (or produce so-called reciprocal changes) in the other leads.

The Limb Leads One obtains a 12-lead ECG by having the patient relax in a supine position and connecting four electrodes to the limbs (see Fig. 21-8A). Electrically, the torso and limbs are viewed as an equilateral triangle (Einthoven's triangle) with one vertex on the groin and the other two on the shoulder joints (Fig. 21-9A). Because the body is an electrical "volume conductor," an electrical attachment to an arm is electrically equivalent to a connection at the shoulder joint, and an attachment to either leg is equivalent to a connection at the groin. By convention, the left leg represents the groin. The fourth electrode, connected to the right leg, is used for electrical grounding. The three initial limb leads represent the difference between two of the limb electrodes:

- I (positive connection to left arm, negative connection to right arm). This lead defines an axis in the frontal plane at 0 degrees (see Fig. 21-9A, B).
- II (positive to left leg, negative to right arm). This lead defines an axis in the frontal plane at 60 degrees.
- III (positive to left leg, negative to left arm). This lead defines an axis in the frontal plane at 120 degrees.

An electronic reconstruction of the three-limb connection defines an electrical reference point in the middle of the heart (see Fig. 21-9A) that constitutes the negative connection for the augmented "unipolar" limb leads and for
the chest leads. The three augmented unipolar limb leads compare one limb electrode to the average of the other two:

- aVR (positive connection to right arm, negative connection is electronically defined in the middle of the heart): The axis defined by this limb lead in the frontal plane is -150 degrees (see Fig. 21-9B). The $a$ stands for augmented, and the $V$ represents unipolar.
- aVL (positive to left arm, negative is middle of the heart): The axis defined by this limb lead in the frontal plane is -30 degrees.
- aVF (positive to left leg [foot], negative is middle of the heart): The axis defined by this limb lead in the frontal plane is +90 degrees.

Thus, the positive and negative ends of these six leads define axes every 30 degrees in the frontal plane (see Fig. 21-9B).

The Precordial Leads The precordial leads lie in the transverse plane, perpendicular to the plane of the frontal leads. The positive connection is one of six different locations on the chest wall (see Fig. 21-8B), and the negative connection is electronically defined in the middle of the heart by averaging of the three limb electrodes. The resultant leads are named $\mathrm{V}_{1}$ to $\mathrm{V}_{6}$, where the $V$ stands for unipolar:

- $\mathbf{V}_{1}$; fourth intercostal space to the right of the sternum
- $\mathbf{V}_{2}$; fourth intercostal space to the left of the sternum
- $\mathbf{V}_{3}$; fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line
- $\mathbf{V}_{4}$; halfway between $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{4}$
- $\mathbf{V}_{6}$; fifth intercostal space at the midaxillary line
- $\mathbf{V}_{5}$; halfway between $\mathrm{V}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{6}$

It is also possible, on rare occasions, to generate special leads by employing the same negative connection used for the unipolar limb and precordial leads and a positive "probe" connection. Special leads that are used include esophageal leads and an intracardiac lead (e.g., that used to obtain a recording from the His bundle).

## A simple two-cell model can explain how a simple ECG can arise

We can illustrate how the ECG arises from the propagation of action potentials through the functional syncytium of myocytes by examining the electrical activity in two neighboring cardiac cells, A and B, connected by gap junctions (Fig. 21-10A). The depolarization and action potential begin first in cell A ( $V_{\mathrm{A}}$ in Fig. 21-10A, green record). The current from cell A then depolarizes cell B through the gap junctions and a brief time later triggers an action potential in cell B $\left(V_{\mathrm{B}}\right)$. If we subtract the $V_{\mathrm{B}}$ record from the $V_{\mathrm{A}}$ record, we obtain a record of the intracellular voltage difference $V_{\mathrm{A}}-V_{\mathrm{B}}$ (see Fig. 21-10B).

We have already seen that according to Ohm's law (see Equation 21-1), the intracellular current from cell A to cell $\mathrm{B}\left(I_{\mathrm{AB}}\right)$ is proportional to $\left(V_{\mathrm{A}}-V_{\mathrm{B}}\right)$. The extracellular current flowing from the region of cell B to the region of cell A is equal but opposite in direction to the intracellular current flowing from cell A to cell B. Imagine that an extracellular voltmeter has its negative electrode placed to the left of cell A and its positive electrode to the right of cell B (forming a lead with an axis of 0 degrees). During the upswing in the action potential of cell A , while cell B is still at rest, $\left(V_{\mathrm{A}}-V_{\mathrm{B}}\right)$ and $I_{\mathrm{AB}}$ are both positive, and the voltmeter detects a positive difference in voltage (see Fig. 21-10C)—analogous to the QRS complex in a real ECG. Later, during the recovery from the action potential in cell A , while cell B is still depolarized, $\left(V_{\mathrm{A}}-V_{\mathrm{B}}\right)$ and $I_{\mathrm{AB}}$ are both negative, and the voltmeter would detect a negative difference in voltage. From the extracellular voltage difference in Figure 21-10C, we can conclude that when the wave of depolarization moves toward the positive lead, there is a positive deflection in the extracellular voltage difference.

If we place the two electrodes at the junction between the two cells, with the positive connection on the bottom and the negative connection on the top, we create a lead with an axis of 90 degrees to the direction of current flow (see Fig. 21-10D). Under these conditions, we observe no voltage
difference because both extracellular electrodes sense the same voltage at each instant in time. Thus, when a lead is perpendicular to the wave of depolarization, the measured deflection on that lead is isoelectric.

If we put our extracellular electrodes in yet a third configuration-with the positive electrode on the left and the negative electrode on the right-we observe a negative deflection during the depolarization of cell A because the wave of depolarization is moving away from the positive electrode (see Fig. 21-10E).

This simple two-cell model demonstrates that the wave of depolarization behaves like a vector, with both magnitude and direction. Two practical methods to determine the direction (or axis) of the vector are presented in Box 21-2.

The QRS equivalent in the extracellular voltage record of our simplistic two-cell analysis is due to a spreading wave of depolarization. The T-wave equivalent is negative compared with the QRS equivalent, and it reflects the wave of repolarization. If cell A has an action potential that is much longer than that of cell B (so that positive current again propagates from A to B after the action potential in B is completed), then the T-wave equivalent will be upright, as it is in most ECGs. Thus, on average, the ventricular myocytes that depolarize last are the first to repolarize. In other words, the B cells have shorter action potentials than the A cells.

What happened to the P wave that we see in a real ECG? The P wave reflects the depolarization of the atrial myocytes. In our model, we could represent the P wave by introducing a second pair of myocytes (i.e., the atrial cells) and allowing them to fire their action potentials much earlier than the two ventricular myocytes.

## CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS

Any change in cardiac rhythm from the normal sinus rhythm is defined as an arrhythmia. Although some arrhythmias are

pathological and even life-threatening, others are normal and appropriately adaptive, including sinus tachycardia and sinus arrhythmia.

Sinus tachycardia is a heart rate faster than normal, driven by the sinus node. This arrhythmia is seen in frightened or startled individuals or during normal exercise. Rarely, sinus tachycardia can be pathological-for example, in patients with acute hyperthyroidism (see pp. 1011-1013).

Sinus arrhythmia is the name given to a normal phenomenon: a subtle change in heart rate that occurs with each respiratory cycle. Inspiration accelerates the heart rate (see pp. 547-548); expiration slows it. Deepening of the respirations exaggerates these cyclic changes. The magnitude of the effect can vary significantly among individuals. The heart

rate is still under the control of the SA node, but cyclic variations in sympathetic and parasympathetic tone modulate the SA node's pacemaker rate. The loss of sinus arrhythmia can be a sign of autonomic system dysfunction, as may be seen in patients with diabetes.

Although the list of pathological arrhythmias is long, two basic problems are responsible for nearly all arrhythmias: altered conduction and altered automaticity (Box 21-3).

## Conduction abnormalities are a major cause of arrhythmias

Disturbances of conduction make up the first major category of cardiac arrhythmias. Conduction disturbances can have

# B0X 21-2 Basic Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram 

An ECG provides a direct measurement of the rate, rhythm, and time-dependent electrical vector of the heart. It also provides fundamental information about the origin and conduction of the cardiac action potential within the heart. Because the different parts of the heart activate sequentially, we can attribute the time-dependent changes in the electrical vector of the heart to different regions of the heart. The P wave reflects the atrial depolarization. The QRS complex corresponds to ventricular depolarization. The T wave reflects ventricular repolarization.

ECG paper has a grid of small 1-mm square boxes and larger $5-\mathrm{mm}$ square boxes. The vertical axis is calibrated at $0.1 \mathrm{mV} / \mathrm{mm}$; the horizontal (time) axis, at $0.04 \mathrm{~s} / \mathrm{mm}$ (small box) or $0.2 \mathrm{~s} / 5 \mathrm{~mm}$ (large box). Thus, five large boxes correspond to 1.0 second (Fig. 21-11). Table 21-5 summarizes the steps for interpretation of an ECG.

## Rate

We can measure rate in two ways. The direct method is to measure the number of seconds between waves of the same type, for example, the R-R interval. The quotient of 60 divided by the interval in seconds is the heart rate in beats per minute.

A quick alternative method is quite popular (Table 21-6). Measure the number of large boxes that form the R-R interval and remember the series $300,150,100,75,60,50$-which corresponds to an interval of one, two, three, four, five, or six large boxes. Thus, rate $=300$ (number of large boxes). For example, if four large boxes separate the $R$ waves, the heart rate is 75 beats/min.

## Rhythm

The determination of rhythm is more complex. One must answer the following questions: Where is the heart's pacemaker? What is the conduction path from the pacemaker to the last cell in the ventricles? Is the pacemaker functioning regularly and at the correct speed? The normal pacemaker is the SA node; the signal then propagates through the AV node and activates the ventricles. When the heart follows this pathway at a normal rate and in this sequence, the rhythm is called a normal sinus rhythm.

## 0 N21-18

Careful examination of the intervals, durations, and segments in the ECG tracing can reveal a great deal about the conducted action potential (see Fig. 21-7). The P-wave duration indicates how long atrial depolarization takes. The PR interval indicates how long it takes the action potential to conduct through the AV node before activating the ventricles. The QRS duration reveals how long it takes for the wave of depolarization to spread throughout the ventricles. The QT interval indicates how long the ventricles remain depolarized and is thus a rough measure of the duration of the overall "ventricular" action potential. The QT segment gets shorter as the heart rate increases, which reflects the shorter action potentials that are observed at high rates. In addition, many other alterations in these waves-and the segments separating them-reflect important physiological and pathophysiological changes in the heart.

## Vector (or Axis) of a Wave in the Frontal Plane

Determination of the vector of current flow through the heart is not just an intellectual exercise but can be of great clinical importance. The normal axis of ventricular depolarization in the frontal plane lies between -30 and +90 degrees. However, this axis can change in a number of pathological situations, including
hypertrophy of one or both ventricular walls (a common sequela of severe or prolonged hypertension) and conduction blocks in one or several of the ventricular conducting pathways.

We can use two approaches to measure the axis of a wave within the frontal plane (i.e., with use of limb leads). The first is more accurate but the second is quicker and easier and is usually sufficient for clinical purposes.

The first approach is a geometric method. It uses our knowledge of the axes of the different leads and the measured magnitude of the wave projected onto at least two leads in the frontal plane. It involves five steps:
Step 1: Measure the height of the wave on the ECG records in two leads, using any arbitrary unit (e.g., number of boxes). A positive deflection is one that rises above the baseline, and a negative deflection is one that falls below the baseline. In the example in Figure 21-12A, we are estimating the axis of the $R$ wave of the QRS complex. The $R$ wave is +2 units in lead II and -1 unit in lead aVR.
Step 2: Mark the height of the measured deflections on the corresponding lead lines on a circle of axes. Any unit of measure will suffice, as long as you use the same unit for both markings. Starting at the center of the circle, mark a positive deflection toward the arrowhead and a negative deflection toward the tail of the arrow.
Step 3: Draw lines perpendicular to the lead axes through each of your two marks.
Step 4: Connect the center of the circle of axes (tail of the vector) to the intersection of the two perpendicular lines (head of the vector). In our example, the intersection is close to the aVF axis.
Step 5: Estimate the axis of the vector that corresponds to the $R$ wave, using the "angle" scale of the circle of axes. In this case, the vector is at about 95 degrees, just clockwise to the aVF lead (i.e., 90 degrees).
The second approach is a qualitative inspection method. It exploits the varying magnitudes of the wave of interest in recordings from different leads. When the wave is isoelectric (i.e., no deflection, or equal positive and negative deflections), then the electrical vector responsible for that projection must be perpendicular to the isoelectric lead, as we already saw for the two-cell model in Figure 21-10D. The inspection approach requires two steps:
Step 1: Identify a lead in which the wave of interest is isoelectric (or nearly isoelectric). In the example in Figure 21-12B, the QRS complex is isoelectric in aVL ( -30 degrees). The vector must be perpendicular (or nearly perpendicular) to that lead (i.e., aVL). In our example, the vector must point 90 degrees from -30 degrees and therefore is at either +60 degrees or -120 degrees. Because the leads in the frontal plane define axes every 30 degrees, every lead has another lead to which it is perpendicular.
Step 2: Identify a lead in which the wave is largely positive. In Figure 21-12B, this would be lead II. The vector must lie roughly in the same direction as the orientation of that lead. Because lead II is at +60 degrees, the axis of the vector of the QRS wave must be about +60 degrees and not -120 degrees.
If the wave of interest is not isoelectric in any lead, then find two leads onto which the projections are of similar magnitude and sign. The vector has an axis halfway between those two leads.

## N21-13 Nomenclature and Durations of Electrocardiographic Waves

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep (and requested by Walter Boron)

The various waves of the ECG are named P, Q, R, S, T, and $U$.

- P wave: a small, usually positive, deflection before the QRS complex
- QRS complex: a group of waves that may include a Q wave, an R wave, and an S wave; note, however, that not every QRS complex consists of all three waves
- Q wave: the initial negative wave of the QRS complex
- R wave: the first positive wave of the QRS complex, or the single wave if the entire complex is positive
- S wave: the negative wave following the $R$ wave
- QS wave: the single wave if the entire complex is negative
- R' wave: extra positive wave, if the entire complex contains more than two or three deflections
- S' wave: extra negative wave, if the entire complex contains more than two or three deflections
- T wave: a deflection that occurs after the QRS complex and the following isoelectric segment (i.e., the ST segment that we will define below)
- U wave: a small deflection sometimes seen after the $T$ wave (usually of the same sign as the T wave) In addition to the totally qualitative wave designations defined above, cardiologists may use uppercase and lowercase letters as a gauge of the amplitude of $Q, R$, and $S$ waves.
- Capital letters $\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{R}, \mathbf{S}$ are used for deflections of relatively large amplitude.
- Lower case letters q, r, s are used for deflections of relatively small amplitude. For instance: an $\mathbf{r S}$ complex indicates a small R wave followed by a large S wave. The various intervals are as follows:
- PR interval: measured from the beginning of the $P$ wave to the beginning of the QRS complex; normal duration is between 0.12 and 0.2 second (three to five small boxes on the recording)
- QRS interval: measured from the beginning to the end of the QRS complex, as defined above; normal duration is $<0.12$ second
- QT interval: measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave; the QT interval is an index of the length of the overall ventricular action potential; duration depends on heart rate because the action potential shortens with increased heart rate
- R-R interval: the interval between two consecutive QRS complexes; duration is equal to the duration of the cardiac cycle
- ST segment: from the end of the QRS complex to the beginning of the T wave

## N21-17 How Does Digitalis Increase Vagal Tone?

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The effect of digitalis drugs to increase vagal tone is probably indirect. Digitalis compounds increase myocardial contractility (see p. 530), which increases cardiac output. The resulting increase in effective circulating volume (see pp. 554-555) relieves high-pressure (see pp. 534-536) and low-pressure baroreceptor reflexes (see pp. 546-547), thereby increasing parasympathetic tone and having the opposite effect on sympathetic tone.

# BOX 21-3 Myocardial Infarction 

An acute myocardial infarction, or heart attack, begins with the occlusion of a coronary artery. The region of myocardium subserved by that coronary artery is deprived of oxygen and will die unless blood flow resumes shortly. During the initial stages, the myocardial cells are electrically active but their function is impaired, which produces characteristic changes in the ECG. Complete but transient blockade of blood flow to the myocardium-even though it does not lead to cell death-may result in a pattern of ECG changes similar to that seen during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. Because blood flow is regional, the areas of infarction are also regional. Thus, the physician can best observe the changes in electrical activity by examining the specific ECG leads that provide the best view of the involved region of myocardium.

The first electrical change associated with an acute myocardial infarction is peaking of the $\mathbf{T}$ waves, followed soon after by T-wave inversion. These T-wave changes are not specific for infarction and are reversible if blood flow is restored.

The next change, and one that is more characteristic of an acute myocardial infarction, is elevation of the ST segment. This change occurs because the myocytes closest to the epicardium become depolarized by the cellular anoxic injury, but they are still electrically coupled. Returning to the two-cell model (Fig. 21-13A), consider the cell on the left (cell A) to be normal and the cell on the right (cell B) to be damaged. Figure 21-13B shows the extracellular current, which is proportional to the differences in the action potentials of the two cells shown in Figure 21-13A. Because cell B has a more positive resting potential than cell A but the same plateau during the action potential, the difference in voltage between cell $A$ and cell $B$ is depressed everywhere but at the ST segment-which makes the ST segment appear elevated. This is also the ECG change that one views with an acute myocardial infarction.

Brief periods of coronary artery spasm can also produce ST elevation, presumably by the same mechanism. Rapid reperfusion of coronary arteries after acute blockage may lead to rapid and complete recovery of the myocardial cells, as indicated by the evanescent nature of the ECG changes.

Ischemia without cell death due to a fixed degree of occlusion (e.g., that caused by a thrombus or atherosclerosis) is often associated with changes in the ECG, typically ST-segment and T-wave changes. However, these changes are quite variable, presumably brought about by altered action potential duration in the affected regions. Patients experiencing exertional chest pain (anginal due to diminished coronary blood flow frequently have ECG changes during the anginal episode that include ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion.

With irreversible cell death, the ECG typically shows the evolution of deep Q waves (a large negative deflection at the beginning of the QRS complex). Q waves develop only in those leads overlying or near the region of the infarction. The Q waves indicate an area of myocardium that has become electrically silent. Because action potentials cannot propagate into the infarcted area, the net vector of the remaining areas of ventricular depolarization-by default-points away from this area. The result is a deep negative deflection on the ECG in the appropriate leads. Thus, an inferior wall infarction inscribes deep Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF. An infarction affecting the large muscular anterior wall of the heart will inscribe deep Q waves in some of the precordial leads $\left(V_{1}\right.$ through $\left.V_{9}\right)$.

Not all infarctions create deep Q waves; the only visible changes may be T-wave inversion and ST-segment depression. Clinically, these infarctions behave like incomplete infarctions, and patients are at risk of a second, completing event. Therefore, these patients are investigated and treated aggressively to prevent further infarction.

multiple causes and can occur at any point in the conduction pathway. Conduction disturbances can be partial or complete. The two major causes of conduction disturbances are depolarization and abnormal anatomy.

If a tissue is injured (e.g., by stretch or anoxia), an altered balance of ionic currents can lead to a depolarization. The depolarization, in turn, partially inactivates $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$,
slowing the spread of current (i.e., slowing conduction). As a result, the tissue may become less excitable (partial conduction block) or completely inexcitable (complete conduction block).

Another type of conduction disturbance is the presence of an aberrant conduction pathway, reflecting abnormal anatomy. One such example is an accessory conduction

pathway that rapidly transmits the action potential from the atria to the ventricles, bypassing the AV node, which normally imposes a conduction delay. Patients with the common Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome have a bypass pathway called the bundle of Kent. The existence of a second pathway between the atria and ventricles predisposes affected individuals to supraventricular arrhythmias (see pp. 504-505).

Partial (or Incomplete) Conduction Block Three major types of partial conduction block exist: slowed conduction, intermittent block, and unidirectional block. We defer the discussion of unidirectional block until we consider re-entry phenomena.

In slowed conduction, the tissue conducts all the impulses, but more slowly than normal. First-degree AV block reflects a slowing of conduction through the AV node. On an ECG, first-degree AV block appears as an unusually long PR interval (compare $A$ and $B$ in Fig. 21-14).

A second example of partial conduction block is intermittent block, in which the tissue conducts some impulses but not others. In the AV node, intermittent block leads to second-degree AV block, of which there are two types. Both reflect incomplete (i.e., intermittent) coupling of the atria to the ventricles. In a Mobitz type I block (or Wenckebach block), the PR interval gradually lengthens from one cycle to the next until the AV node fails completely, skipping a ventricular depolarization (see Fig. 21-14C). With Mobitz type I block, it is most common to see every third or fourth atrial beat fail to conduct to the ventricles. In a Mobitz type II block, the PR interval is constant from beat to beat, but every nth ventricular depolarization is missing. In Figure 21-14D, the first cardiac cycle is normal. However, the second P wave is not followed by a QRS or T. Instead, the ECG record is flat until the third P wave arrives at the expected time, followed by a QRS and a T. Thus, we say that every second QRS is dropped ( $2: 1$ block).

Another form of intermittent conduction block, called rate-dependent block, reflects disease often seen in the large branches of the His-Purkinje fiber system (i.e., the bundle branches). When the heart rate exceeds a critical level, the ventricular conduction system fails, presumably because a part of the conducting system lacks sufficient time to repolarize. With intermittent failure of the His-Purkinje fiber system, the impulse is left to spread slowly and inefficiently through the ventricles by conducting from one myocyte to the next. Such a failure, whether intermittent or continuous, is known as a bundle branch block and appears on the ECG as an intermittently wide QRS complex (see Fig. 21-14E). Because this block impairs the coordinated spread of the action potential throughout the ventricles, the resulting contraction loses some efficiency.

Complete Conduction Block In complete block, or thirddegree AV block, no impulses conduct through the affected area, in either direction. For example, complete block at the AV node stops any supraventricular electrical impulse from triggering a ventricular contraction. Thus, AV nodal block electrically severs the atria and ventricles, each of which beats under control of its own pacemakers. This situation is called AV dissociation. The only ventricular pacemakers that are available to initiate cardiac contraction are the

Purkinje fiber cells, which are notoriously unreliable and slow. Thus, cardiac output may fall, and blood pressure along with it. AV dissociation can therefore constitute a medical emergency, and placement of an artificial ventricular pacemaker can prove lifesaving. On an ECG, complete block appears as regularly spaced P waves (i.e., the SA node properly triggers the atria) and as irregularly spaced QRS and T waves that have a low frequency and no fixed relationship to the P waves (see Fig. 21-14F).

Re-Entry An independent focus of pacemaker activity can develop as a consequence of a conduction disturbance. This class of conduction disturbance is called re-entry (or re-entrant excitation or circus movement). It is one of the major causes of clinical arrhythmias. It occurs when a wave of depolarization travels in an apparently endless circle. Re-entry has three requirements: (1) a closed conduction loop, (2) a region of unidirectional block (at least briefly), and (3) a sufficiently slow conduction of action potentials around the loop.

Before further considering re-entry, we need to discuss a conduction defect that is essential for re-entry-unidirectional block. Unidirectional block is a type of partial conduction block in which impulses travel in one direction but not in the opposite one. Unidirectional block may arise as a result of a local depolarization or may be due to pathological changes in functional anatomy. Normal cardiac tissue can conduct impulses in both directions (Fig. 21-15A). However, after an asymmetric anatomical lesion develops, many more healthy cells may remain on one side of the lesion than on the other. When conduction proceeds in the direction from the many healthy cells to the few healthy cells, the current from the many may be sufficient to excite the few (right to left in Fig. 21-15B). On the other hand, when conduction proceeds in the opposite direction, the few healthy cells cannot generate enough current to excite the region of many healthy cells (left to right in Fig. 21-15B). The result is a unidirectional block.

We return now to the problem of re-entry. Imagine that an impulse is traveling down a bifurcating Purkinje fiber and is about to reach a group of ventricular myocytes-a closed conduction loop (see Fig. 21-15C). However, the refractory zones prevent the re-entry of impulses from the right to the left, and vice versa. We now introduce a lesion that causes a unidirectional conduction block in the left branch of the Purkinje fiber. When the impulse reaches the fork in the road, it spreads in both directions (see Fig. 21-15D, step 1). However, the impulse cannot continue past the unidirectional block in the left branch. The impulse traveling down the right branch stimulates the distal conducting cells (see Fig. 21-15D, step 2), leaving them in an effective refractory period (see p. 491). When the impulse reaches the ventricular muscle, it begins to travel back toward the damaged left branch (step 3). At this point, the cells in the normal right branch may still be refractory to excitation. The impulse finally reaches the damaged left branch and travels in a retrograde fashion up this branch, reaching and passing through the region of the unidirectional conduction block (step 4). Finally, the impulse again reaches the bifurcation (step 5). Because enough time has elapsed for the cells at the bifurcation as well as in the right branch to recover from their

refractory period, the impulse can now travel retrograde up the main part of the Purkinje fiber as well as orthograde down the right branch-for a second time.

If this re-entrant movement (steps $2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 2$, and so on) continues, the frequency of re-entry will generally outpace the SA nodal pacemaker (frequency of step 1) and is often
responsible for diverse tachyarrhythmias because the fastest pacemaker sets the heart rate. Re-entry excitation may be responsible for atrial and ventricular tachycardia, atrial and ventricular fibrillation, and many other arrhythmias. Re-entry can occur in big loops (see Fig. 21-15D) or in small loops consisting entirely of myocardial cells.

Figure 21-15 Abnormal conduction.

Accessory Conduction Pathways Wolff-ParkinsonWhite (WPW) syndrome, briefly mentioned above (see pp. 501-502), is a common example of an accessory conduction pathway, which in this case provides a short circuit (i.e., bundle of Kent) around the delay in the AV node. The fast accessory pathway is composed not of Purkinje fibers but instead of muscle cells. It conducts the action potential directly from the atria to the ventricular septum, depolarizing some of the septal muscle earlier than if the
depolarization had reached it via the normal, slower AV nodal pathway. As a result, ventricular depolarization is more spread out in time than is normal, giving rise to a broader-than-normal QRS complex. The general direction of ventricular depolarization is reversed, so that the events normally underlying the Q wave of the QRS complex have an axis opposite to that normally seen. This early depolarization, or pre-excitation, appears as a small, positive delta wave at the beginning of the QRS complex (see Fig. 21-14G).

In addition, because the time between atrial depolarization and ventricular depolarization (i.e., beginning of delta wave) is shortened, the interval between the P wave and the QRS complex is shortened.

The aberrant conduction pathway in WPW syndrome also establishes a loop that may meet the requirements for re-entry and may therefore be associated with a supraventricular tachycardia. Although in general a benign condition, WPW syndrome is associated with at least one attack of supraventricular tachycardia in at least $50 \%$ of affected individuals. The two most common supraventricular tachycardias seen in this population are paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (described below). Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is a regular tachycardia with a ventricular rate usually exceeding 150 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$. Because ventricular depolarization still occurs via the normal conducting pathways, the QRS complex appears normal.

If, during an episode of PSVT, the conduction direction for re-entry is in the reverse direction (i.e., down the accessory pathway and back up through the AV node), the QRS shape may be unusual. This arrangement may produce a PSVT with wide and bizarre QRS complexes because ventricular depolarization does not occur along the normal bundle branches. A small number of people with WPW syndrome have more than one accessory pathway, so that multiple re-entry loops are possible.

Fibrillation In fibrillation, many regions of re-entrant electrical activity are present, creating electrical chaos that is not associated with useful contraction. Atrial fibrillation ( $\mathbf{N} 21-15$ (see Fig. 21-14H) is commonly found in elderly patients, sometimes with mitral valve or coronary artery disease, but often without any evidence of underlying cardiac disease. The re-entry loop within the atria moves wildly and rapidly, generating a rapid succession of action potentialsas many as 500 per minute. This wandering re-entry circuit easily becomes the fastest pacemaker in the heart, outpacing the SA node and bombarding the AV node. Fortunately, the AV node cannot repolarize fast enough to pass along all of these impulses. Only some make it through to the ventricles, resulting in the irregular appearance of QRS complexes without any detectable P waves. The baseline between QRS complexes may appear straight or may show small, rapid fluctuations. Although only some atrial impulses reach the ventricles, the ventricular rate can still be quite high.

Because the atria function mainly as a booster pump (see p. 508), many patients tolerate atrial fibrillation without harm and may even be unaware that they have it. Others may suffer greatly from the loss of a coordinated atrial contraction, particularly the elderly or those with coexisting cardiac disease. In most individuals, attempts should be made to convert the rhythm back to normal sinus rhythm if possible, by either electrical or chemical means. If this is not possible, then attempts can be made to at least slow conduction through the AV node. For example, digitalis compounds increase parasympathetic and decrease sympathetic stimulation to the AV node, decreasing the speed of AV conduction and thus reducing the ventricular rate (see p. 493). $\beta$-adrenergic blockers or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel blockers are also used to control ventricular rate.

Ventricular fibrillation (see Fig. 21-14I) is a lifethreatening medical emergency. The heart cannot generate cardiac output because the ventricles are not able to pump blood without a coordinated ventricular depolarization.

## Altered automaticity can originate from the sinus node or from an ectopic locus

The automaticity of any cardiac tissue can change. Pacemaker cells can experience an alteration in or even a complete absence of automaticity. Conversely, other cells that normally have no automaticity (e.g., ventricular muscle) can become "ectopic" pacemakers. These disturbances of automaticity make up the second major category of cardiac arrhythmias.

Depolarization-Dependent Triggered Activity A positive shift in the maximum diastolic potential brings $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ closer to the threshold for an action potential and can induce automaticity in cardiac tissue that otherwise has no pacemaker activity. The development of depolarization-induced triggered activity depends on the interaction of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current $\left(I_{\mathrm{Ca}}\right)$ and the repolarizing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current $\left(I_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$. This mechanism can produce a more rapid pacemaker depolarization in the SA or AV nodal cells, causing them to accelerate their pacemakers. It can also increase the intrinsic pacemaker rate in Purkinje fiber cells, which normally have a very slow pacemaker.

Depolarization-induced triggered activity is particularly dramatic in nonpacemaker tissues (e.g., ventricular muscle), which normally exhibit no diastolic depolarization. Factors that significantly prolong action potential duration can cause depolarization-dependent triggered activity. During the repolarization phase, $I_{\mathrm{N}}$, remains inactivated because the cell is so depolarized (Fig. 21-16A). On the other hand, $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ has had enough time to recover from inactivation andbecause the cell is still depolarized-triggers a slow, positive deflection in $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ known as an early afterdepolarization (EAD). ( $\mathbf{N} 21-16$ Eventually, $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ increases and returns $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ toward the resting potential. Such EADs, if they are larger than the one shown in Figure 21-16A, may trigger an extrasystole. Isolated ventricular extrasystoles (known by many names, including premature ventricular contractions, or PVCs) may occur in normal individuals. Alterations in cellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ metabolism (discussed in the next section) may increase the tendency of a prolonged action potential to produce an extrasystole. Ironically, a class of drugs used to treat arrhythmias can become arrhythmogenic by producing EADs. For example, quinidine can produce this dangerous adverse effect, presumably by inhibiting $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and some $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and thus prolonging the ventricular muscle action potential.

More than one extrasystole-a run of extrasystoles (see Fig. 21-16B)—is pathological. A run of three or more ventricular extrasystoles is the minimal requirement for diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia. This arrhythmia is lifethreatening, because it can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (see Fig. 21-14I), which is associated with no meaningful cardiac output. The heart rate in ventricular tachycardia is much faster than normal, usually between 120 and 150 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ (or faster), and the pacemaker driving the

## N21-15 Atrial Fibrillation

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. It frequently presents with modest or no symptoms and may be diagnosed on a routine ECG when no clear $P$ wave can be identified on the ECG and the QRS complex occurs at "irregularly irregular" intervals. Compared to ventricular fibrillation with its extreme and rapid lethality, AF has more modest pathology. It is an arrhythmia that depends on altered cellular electrical properties, on tissue organization problems (e.g., fibrosis), and on diverse background issues (e.g., increased blood pressure, increased vascular volume, duration of the fibrillation). Cardioversion works best only when applied early in the course of the disease and often yields only a short-term improvement. Because AF is frequently found in the context of much atrial fibrosis and widespread electrical re-entry sites in both atria, invasive structural changes in the atrial conduction pathways may be beneficial. Conceptually these procedures seek to prevent the electrical activity from multiple re-entry sites from impinging on the AV node. Introducing atrial scars to block conduction out of re-entry regions can help. These are frequently referred to as "maze" ablations and involve procedures such as controlled freezing or radiofrequency destruction in a complex maze pattern in the affected regions of the atria. There is often a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent component of AF , and therapeutic drugs are often used to mitigate this $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent component.

## N21-16 Triggered Activity

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer

Both the early afterdepolarizations (EADs; see p. 505) and the delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs; see p. 506) are the impetus for a form of arrhythmia called triggered activity, which is a spontaneous abnormal beat or series of beats.

The natural automaticity generated by pacemaker cells (e.g., in the SA node) can occur without any preceding action potentials. In contrast, triggered activity requires at least one preceding action potential. Thus, if an afterdepolarization occurs but does not reach threshold, the cell will eventually return to its resting potential and no triggered activity will occur. If, however, an afterdepolarization reaches threshold, it can generate an unusual action potential from which another afterdepolarization may or may not arise. Thus, it is possible to generate a train of spontaneous depolarizations before the cell finally returns to its resting potential. In the case of a single unusual action potential, the electrical activity can generate an extrasystole. In the case of a train of depolarizations, the electrical activity can generate a run of extrasystoles.

The difference between EADs and DADs is that the additional depolarization in an early afterdepolarization occurs during phase 2 or 3 . On the other hand, with a delayed afterdepolarization, the additional depolarization takes place during phase 4. The ventricular tachyarrhythmias seen in long QT syndrome (LQTS) are an example of arrhythmias caused by early afterdepolarizations. Some digitalis-induced arrhythmias are examples of arrhythmias caused by delayed afterdepolarizations.

Figure 21-16 Abnormal automaticity in ventricular muscle. The records in this figure are idealized. A, The prolonged action potential keeps $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ inactivated but permits $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{S}}$ to interact and thereby produce a spontaneous depolarization-the early afterdepolarization. B, The afterdepolarization reaches threshold, triggering a sequence of several slow pacemaker-like action potentials that generate extrasystoles.
heartbeat is located in the ventricle itself. The heart rate in ventricular tachycardia may be so fast that the heart cannot pump blood effectively.

Long QT Syndrome Patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS) have a prolonged ventricular action potential and are prone to ventricular arrhythmias. In particular, these patients are susceptible to a form of ventricular tachycardia called torsades de pointes, or "twisting of the points," in which the QRS complexes appear to spiral around the baseline, constantly changing their axes and amplitude. LQTS can be congenital or acquired. The congenital form can involve mutations of cardiac $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (see pp. 188-189) or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see p. 195). The acquired form of LQTS, which is much more common, can result from various electrolyte disturbances (especially hypokalemia and hypocalcemia) or from prescribed or over-the-counter medications (e.g., several antiarrhythmic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, and some nonsedating antihistamines when they are taken together with certain antibiotics, notably erythromycin).

## $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ overload and metabolic changes can also cause arrhythmias

$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Overload $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ overload in the heart has many potential causes. One frequent factor is digitalis intoxication. Another is injury-related cellular depolarization. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ overload occurs when $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ increases, causing the SR to sequester too much $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Thus overloaded, the SR begins to cyclically-and spontaneously-dump $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and then take it back up. The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release may be large enough to stimulate a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated nonselective cation channel and the Na-Ca exchanger (see pp. 123-124). 0 N21-2 These
current sources combine to produce $I_{0}$, a transient inward current that produces a delayed afterdepolarization (DAD). 0 N21-16 When it is large enough, $I_{0}$ can depolarize the cell beyond threshold and produce a spontaneous action potential.

Metabolism-Dependent Conduction Changes During ischemia and anoxia, many cellular events take place, including a fall in intracellular ATP levels. This fall in [ATP]_{i} activates the ATP-sensitive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel ( $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{ATP}}$ ), which is plentiful in cardiac myocytes. Thus, when [ATP] ${ }_{i}$ falls sufficiently, $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{ATP}}$ is less inhibited and the cells tend to become less excitable (i.e., $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{ATP}}$ helps keep $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ close to $E_{\mathrm{K}}$ ). The activation of this channel may explain, in part, the slowing or blocking of conduction that may occur during ischemia or in the periinfarction period.

Electromechanical Dissociation Rarely, patients being resuscitated from cardiac arrest exhibit a phenomenon called electromechanical dissociation in which the heart's ECG activity is not accompanied by the pumping of blood. In many cases, the basis of electromechanical dissociation is not understood. However, in other cases, the cause is obvious. For example, the heart of a patient with a large pericardial effusion may manifest normal electrical activity, but the fluid between the heart and the pericardium may press in on the heart (cardiac tamponade) and prevent effective pumping.

# THE HEART AS A PUMP 

Emile L. Boulpaep

## THE CARDIAC CYCLE

The sequence of mechanical and electrical events that repeats with every heartbeat is called the cardiac cycle. The duration of the cardiac cycle is the reciprocal of the heart rate:

$$
\text { Duration }(\mathrm{s} / \text { beat })=\frac{60(\mathrm{~s} / \mathrm{min})}{\text { Heart rate (beats } / \mathrm{min})}
$$

For example, for a heart rate of 75 beats/min, the cardiac cycle lasts 0.8 s or 800 ms .

## The closing and opening of the cardiac valves define four phases of the cardiac cycle

The cardiac pump is of the two-stroke variety. Like a pump with a reciprocating piston, the heart alternates between a filling phase and an emptying phase. Under normal circumstances, the electrical pacemaker in the sinoatrial node (see pp. 489-490) determines the duration of the cardiac cycle, and the electrical properties of the cardiac conduction system and cardiac myocytes determine the relative duration of contraction and relaxation. As long as the heart rate remains unchanged, this pattern remains steady.

The cardiac atria are small chambers. The right atrium receives deoxygenated systemic venous return from the inferior and superior venae cavae. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs through the pulmonary circulation. Both atria operate more as passive reservoirs than as mechanical pumps. However, they do contract, and this contraction does enhance ventricular filling and cardiac output to a small degree (Box 22-1).

The inlet valves of the ventricles are called the AV (atrioventricular) valves. They permit blood to flow in one direction only, from the atria to the ventricles. The valve located between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve because it has three flaps, or cusps. The valve located between the left atrium and the left ventricle is the mitral valve because it has only two cusps, which resemble a bishop's miter.

The outlet valves of the ventricles are called semilunar valves. They also allow blood to flow in just a single direction, from each ventricle into a large outflow-tract vessel.

Both the pulmonary valve, located between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery, and the aortic valve, located between the left ventricle and aorta, have three cusps.

Cardiac valves open passively when upstream pressure exceeds downstream pressure. They close passively when downstream pressure exceeds upstream pressure. The movement of the valve leaflets can be detected by echocardiography (see p. 427); their closure makes heart sounds that can be heard with a stethoscope. The stethoscope can also detect leaks in the valves that permit jets of blood to flow backward across the valvular orifice (i.e., regurgitation), as well as stenotic lesions that narrow the valve opening, forcing the blood to pass through a narrower space (i.e., stenosis). During certain parts of the cardiac cycle, blood passing through either regurgitant or stenotic lesions makes characteristic sounds that are called murmurs (see Box 17-1).

The cardiac cycle can be artificially divided into phases in any number of ways. However, from the point of view of the ventricles and the positions of their valves, we must consider a minimum of four distinct phases:

- Inflow phase. The inlet valve is open and the outlet valve is closed.
- Isovolumetric contraction. Both valves are closed, with no blood flow.
- Outflow phase. The outlet valve is open and the inlet valve is closed.
- Isovolumetric relaxation. Both valves are closed, with no blood flow.

Table 22-1 summarizes these four phases and the key events of the cardiac cycle. Note that the same events occur in the right heart as in the left heart.

It is common to separate these phases into two parts. Systole includes phases 2 and 3, when the ventricles are contracting, whereas diastole includes phases 4 and 1 , when the ventricles are relaxing. At a heart rate of 75 beats/min (cycle duration $=800 \mathrm{~ms}$ ), systole occupies $\sim 300 \mathrm{~ms}$, and diastole $\sim 500 \mathrm{~ms}$. With increasing heart rate-and thus decreasing cycle length-diastole shortens relatively more than systole does.

For convenience, the events in Table 22-1 start a short time after the beginning of diastole, with the opening of the AV valves and the start of ventricular filling (phase 1).

The relative importance of atrial contraction to overall cardiac function is evident in patients who develop atrial fibrillation (see Fig. 21-14H), an arrhythmia associated with loss of this atrial "kick." In atrial fibrillation, chaotic electrical activity, bombarding the atria with as many as 500 impulses per minute from all directions, prevents the concerted action of atrial cardiac muscle fibers that is necessary for coordinated atrial contraction. As a result, the atria fibrillate-they look like a wriggling bag of worms. In healthy persons with otherwise normal hearts, the loss of atrial contraction usually causes no symptoms at rest, or perhaps only a sensation of an irregular or rapid heartbeat (i.e., the result of atrial fibrillation). However, if the patient already has a compromised myocardium (e.g., from ischemic
heart disease, prolonged hypertension, or mitral stenosis), or if the patient is debilitated by dysfunction of other organs (e.g., chronic emphysema), the loss of the atrial contraction may further reduce cardiac output just enough to send the patient into florid congestive heart failure (see Box 22-4) or even shock (i.e., arterial pressure so low that it compromises perfusion of peripheral tissues). The physician may treat a patient with an otherwise normal heart in a leisurely fashion, or perhaps not at all-keeping in mind that patients with atrial fibrillation are at high risk for development of atrial thrombosis and thus possibly cerebral embolism and stroke. In patients with a compromised myocardium, emergency chemical or electrical cardioversion may be necessary.

## Changes in ventricular volume, pressure, and flow accompany the four phases of the cardiac cycle (1) N22-1

Figure 22-1 illustrates the changes in pressure and volume that occur during the cardiac cycle. The four vertical lines indicate the timing of the four valvular events that terminate each of the four phases defined previously:

- AV valve closure terminates phase 1.
- Semilunar valve opening terminates phase 2.
- Semilunar valve closing terminates phase 3.
- AV valve opening terminates phase 4.

The shapes of pressure tracings for the right heart (see Fig. 22-1A) and the left heart (see Fig. 22-1B) are quite similar except that the pressures on the right are a scaled-down version of those on the left. In both cases, the tracings begin in the middle of phase 1 ; that is, the period of decreased filling toward the end of diastole called diastasis (from the Greek dia [apart] + histanaí [to stand]). Note that the volume changes in the left ventricle are exactly the same as those in the right ventricle because the cardiac outputs of the right and left hearts are virtually identical (see p. 414). For purposes of illustration, we now focus on the records for the left heart (see Fig. 22-1B).

Diastasis Period (Middle of Phase 1) During the diastasis, the mitral valve is open, but little blood flows from the left atrium to the left ventricle; ventricular volume slowly rises and approaches a plateau. The pressures in both the left
atrium and the left ventricle rise slowly, driven by the pressure in the pulmonary veins, which is only slightly higher. The atrial pressure parallels-and is only slightly above-the ventricular pressure because the mitral valve is wide open, and the flow between the two chambers is minimal. The P wave of the electrocardiogram (ECG; see p. 493), which corresponds to atrial excitation, occurs at the end of this phase.

Atrial Contraction (End of Phase 1) Immediately following the P wave is the atrial contraction, which causes a variable amount of blood to enter the left ventricle. In a person at rest, the atrial contraction transfers into the left ventricle a volume of blood that represents $<20 \%$ of the subsequent stroke volume and often only a few percent. During heavy exercise, this figure can rise to $40 \%$ (see Box 22-1). Atrial contraction causes a slight rise in intra-atrial pressure, and a comparable rise in ventricular pressure and volume. All during this period, the aortic pressure decreases as blood flows out to the periphery.

Isovolumetric Contraction (Phase 2) When the ventricles begin to depolarize, as evidenced by the QRS complex on the ECG, systole commences. The ventricles contract, and very soon the pressure in the left ventricle exceeds that in the left atrium (first crossover of blue and orange pressure tracings in Fig. 22-1B, top). As a result, the mitral valve closes. The aortic valve has been closed this entire time. Thus, the left ventricle contracts with both mitral and aortic valves closed. Because the blood has no place to go, the result is an

isovolumetric contraction that causes the pressure in the left ventricle to rise rapidly, eventually exceeding the pressure in the aorta (first crossover of blue and red tracings) and causing the aortic valve to open.

Ejection or Outflow (Phase 3) As the aortic valve opens, the ejection phase begins. During the first part of phase 3-rapid ejection-ventricular pressure (blue tracing in Fig. 22-1B, top) continues to rise, closely followed by a rapid elevation of aortic pressure, which, at first, is slightly less (red tracing). Accompanying these rapid pressure increases is a precipitous reduction in ventricular volume (see Fig. 22-1B, bottom), as blood flows into the aorta. Aortic pressure continues to rise and eventually exceeds ventricular pressure (second crossover of blue and red tracings in Fig. 22-1B, top) just before both the aortic and ventricular pressures begin to fall. Despite the reversal of the pressure gradient across the aortic valve, the cusps of the aortic valve do not immediately snap shut because of the inertia of blood flow, (1) N22-2 which imparts
considerable kinetic energy to the blood. During the latter part of phase 3-decreased ejection-the decrease in ventricular volume becomes less rapid, and both the ventricular and aortic pressures fall off. During the entire ejection phase, about 70 mL of blood flows into the aorta, leaving about 50 mL behind in the ventricle.

Isovolumetric Relaxation (Phase 4) Late in the ejection phase, blood flow across the aortic valve falls to extremely low values, until it actually reverses direction (i.e., retrograde or negative flow). At this point, the aortic valve closes, defining the onset of diastole. As blood flow in the aorta again becomes briefly positive (i.e., forward), there is a small upward deflection in the aortic pressure trace. The result is the dicrotic notch (from the Greek dikrotos [double-beat]), or incisura, and the subsequent dicrotic wave, which interrupts the generally downward trend of aortic pressure. Because both the aortic and mitral valves are closed, and no blood can enter the left ventricle, this is the period of

# N22-2 Inertial Component of Flow in the Aorta 

## Contributed by Emile L. Boulpaep

As discussed in $\mathbf{0}$ N22-3, when pressure and flow fluctuate, the simple Ohm's law-like relationship $\Delta P=F \cdot R$ should be replaced by $\Delta P=F \cdot Z$, where $Z$ is a complex mechanical impedance. Within the impedance term are components that describe compliant impedance, viscous (or resistive) impedance, and inertial impedance.

In Figure 22-1B (and also in the top panel of Fig. 22-2), the pressure curves for the left ventricle (blue curve) and the aorta (red curve) cross over in the middle of the ejection phase. Yet, the aortic valve does not close at that instant, despite the apparent reversal of the pressure gradient. The flow curve in the aorta (black curve in the second panel of Fig. 22-2) is further proof that the aortic valve remains open: even after the apparent pressure gradient reverses just past the peak ejection, blood flow remains positive during the remainder of the ejection phase.

Blood flow in the aorta is a good example of a case in which the flow dynamics is primarily inertial in character. During ejection, the aorta receives the entire stroke volume of the left ventricle at a high linear velocity. Thus, the kinetic energy $\left(\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{mv}^{2}\right)$ is large, because aortic flow carries a large mass of blood ( $m$ ) at a high velocity ( $v$ ). The compliance term (mostly
radial compliance) within the complex impedance of the aorta is not so important because axial flow is much more important than radial flow. Finally, the viscous-resistance term within the complex impedance of the aorta is minimal because the radius of the aorta is large and resistance is inversely proportional to $r^{4}$ (see Equation 17-11). Thus, in the aorta, the inertial impedance becomes the major determinant of the overall impedance $Z$.

The dominance of the inertial impedance is illustrated by the finding that the aortic valve does not close despite a reversal of the pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the aortic arch as recorded by indwelling catheters with side openings. As shown in Figure 17-11, the "side pressure" measurement does not take into account the kinetic momentum (i.e., Bernouilli forces) along the axis of blood flow. If we had included the inertial component in our measurement of $\Delta P$-by measuring pressure with catheters that face upstream, as shown by the uppermost catheter in Figure 17-11-we would observe no reversal of the pressure. Thus, there is no violation of the principle that $\Delta P=$ $F \cdot Z$, which is to say that blood is still flowing down an energy gradient.

Top, A repeat of Figure 22-1B, with three modifications: (1) the cardiac cycle begins with atrial contraction; (2) phase 1 of the cardiac cycle has three subparts: rapid ventricular filling, decreased ventricular filling, and atrial systole; (3) phase 3 has two subparts: rapid and decreased ventricular ejection.
isovolumetric relaxation. Pressure falls rapidly in the left ventricle.

Rapid Ventricular Filling Period (Beginning of Phase 1) When ventricular pressure falls below that in the left atrium (second crossover of blue and orange tracings in Fig. 22-1B), the mitral valve opens. Immediately following mitral valve opening, left ventricular volume begins to increase rapidly (see Fig. 22-1B, bottom). During this period of rapid ventricular filling, the left atrial and ventricular pressures evolve in parallel because the mitral valve is wide open. A period of relatively decreased filling follows, the period of diastasis with which we began our discussion. Thus, diastole includes both the rapid ventricular filling period and diastasis. As already noted, the length of diastole decreases with elevations in heart rate. This decrease comes first at the expense of the period of slower ventricular filling (i.e., diastasis).

During rapid ventricular filling, the aortic valve remains closed. Because blood continues to flow out to the periphery, owing to the recoil of the aorta's elastic wall (see Box 22-2), the aortic pressure falls. This fall continues during diastasis.

## The ECG, phonocardiogram, and echocardiogram all follow the cyclic pattern of the cardiac cycle

Accompanying the basic cyclic pattern of cardiac pressure and volume changes are characteristic mechanical, electrical, acoustic, and echocardiographic changes. Figure 22-2 illustrates these events for the left heart and the systemic circulation. Notice that the pressure records in the top panel of Figure 22-2 start with the atrial contraction-that is, slightly later than in Figure 22-1.

Aortic Blood Flow Blood flow from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta (see Fig. 22-2, second panel from top) rises most rapidly during the rapid ejection phase of the left ventricle. The peaking of aortic flow defines the beginning of the decreased-ejection phase.

Jugular Venous Pulse The third panel of Figure 22-2 includes the jugular venous pulse, for comparison with the timing of other events. We will discuss the jugular venous pulse below in the chapter.

Electrocardiogram The ECG (see Fig. 22-2, fourth panel from top, and pp. 493-496) begins with the middle of the P wave (atrial depolarization). The QRS complex (ventricular depolarization) is the prelude to the upswing in ventricular pressure. The T wave (ventricular repolarization) occurs in the decreased-ejection phase.

TABLE 22-2 The Heart Sounds

| SOUND | DESCRIPTION | ASSOCIATED EVENTS |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $S_{1}$ | First heart sound (sounds like "lub") Two bursts, a mitral $M_{1}$ and a tricuspid $T_{1}$ component | Closure of mitral and tricuspid valves |
| $S_{2}$ | Second heart sound (sounds like "dub") An aortic $A_{2}$ and a pulmonary $P_{2}$ component | Closure of aortic and pulmonary valves |
| OS | Opening snap | Opening of a stenotic mitral valve |
| $S_{3}$ | Third heart sound | Diastolic filling gallop or ventricular or protodiastolic gallop |
| $S_{4}$ | Fourth heart sound | Atrial sound that creates an atrial or presystolic gallop |

Phonocardiogram and Heart Sounds The opening and closing of the valves are accompanied by heart sounds (see Fig. 22-2, fifth panel from top), easily heard through a stethoscope or recorded with a digital stethoscope and stored as a phonocardiogram (Table 22-2). The dominant frequencies of heart sounds are lower ( 110 to 180 Hz ) than those of heart murmurs (see Box 17-1), which result from turbulence (180 to 500 Hz ). Each of the vertical dotted lines in Figure 22-2 indicates the movement of two valves, one on the right heart and one on the left. Thus, two valves can contribute to a single heart sound, although the two components can often be separated by the ear. The phonocardiogram in Figure 22-2 shows the timing of the two major, or physiological, heart sounds ( $\mathrm{S}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{S}_{2}$ ), as well as two other sounds ( $\mathrm{S}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{S}_{4}$ ) that are occasionally heard.

The physiological heart sounds $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are heard following the closure of the cardiac valves: the mitral and tricuspid valves for $S_{1}$, and the aortic and pulmonary valves for $S_{2}$. However, the actual apposition of the valve leaflets (i.e., "slamming the door") does not produce the sound. Instead, vibrations resulting from sudden tension in the AV valves and the adjacent ventricular walls produce the first heart sound, $S_{1}$. Similarly, vibrations of the large vessel walls and columns of blood produce the second heart sound, $S_{2}$, following closure of the semilunar valves. These vibrations propagate through adjacent tissues to the chest wall, where one can normally hear the first and second heart sounds through a stethoscope. $S_{1}$ is usually stronger, longer, and of lower frequency than $\mathrm{S}_{2}$.

Although the four vertical lines that define the four phases of the cardiac cycle are very similar for the right and left hearts, they do not line up perfectly with one another, as can be seen by comparing Figure 22-1A and B. For example, the aortic valve usually closes just before the pulmonary valve. This timing difference produces the physiological splitting of the $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ (i.e., aortic) and $\mathrm{P}_{2}$ (i.e., pulmonary) components of the second heart sound. As we shall see below (see pp. 517-519), inspiration accentuates the splitting of $S_{2}$. Pathological changes that accentuate the asynchrony between
the left and right hearts (e.g., right bundle branch block) may also lead to splitting of the first heart sound.

With stiffening of the mitral valve, seen in mitral stenosis, the opening of the mitral valve may produce an additional sound, an opening snap (OS), in early diastole just after $\mathrm{S}_{2}$.

A physiological third heart sound, $\mathbf{S}_{3}$, is present in some normal individuals, particularly children. $S_{3}$ occurs in early diastole when rapid filling of the ventricles results in recoil of ventricular walls that have a limited distensibility. An $S_{3}$ also can be heard in adults when the ventricle is so overfilled at the end of systole that the addition of 70 mL more blood during diastole brings the ventricle into a volume range in which ventricular compliance is very low. The result is an accentuated recoil, heard as an $S_{3}$. An $S_{3}$ can originate from the left or the right heart. A "gallop rhythm" is a grouping of three heart sounds that, together, sound like hoofs of a galloping horse. Thus, the addition of an $S_{3}$ to the physiological $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ creates a three-sound sequence, $S_{1}-S_{2}-S_{3}$, that is termed a protodiastolic gallop or ventricular gallop.

When present, a fourth heart sound, $\mathbf{S}_{4}$, coincides with atrial contraction. It is usually heard in pathological conditions in which an unusually strong atrial contraction occurs in combination with low compliance of the left ventricle. The addition of an $S_{4}$ produces another three-sound sequence, $S_{4}-S_{1}-S_{2}$, which is also a gallop rhythm, a presystolic gallop or atrial gallop.

Echocardiogram We discussed echocardiography on page 427. The echocardiogram in the bottom panel of Figure 22-2 shows that the separation between the anterior and posterior leaflets of the mitral valve increases during atrial contraction. The leaflets meet at the beginning of phase 2 and remain together until rapid ventricular filling occurs in the beginning of phase 1 , when the separation between leaflets becomes maximal. During the decreased phase of ventricular filling, the leaflets once again move closer together, until the next atrial contraction.

## The cardiac cycle causes flow waves in the aorta and peripheral vessels

With the closing and opening of the heart's exit valves (i.e., pulmonary and aortic valves), blood flow and blood velocity across these valves oscillate from near zero, when the valves are closed, to high values, when the valves are open. Blood flow in the aortic arch actually oscillates between slightly negative and highly positive values (Fig. 22-3A, panel 1). Pressure in the aortic arch typically oscillates between $\sim 80$ and $\sim 120 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (see Fig. 22-3B, panel 1), but varies greatly among individuals. Phasic changes in pressure and flow also occur in the peripheral arteries. Arterial pressure is usually measured in a large artery, such as the brachial artery (see p. 421). Because very little pressure drop occurs between the aorta and such a large, proximate artery, the measured systolic and diastolic arterial pressures, as well as the pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure (see p. 418), closely approximate the corresponding aortic pressures.

If blood vessels were rigid tubes, so that the resistance $(R)$ were constant, and if the driving pressure $(\Delta P)$ were also

constant throughout the cardiac cycle, we could describe blood flow $(F)$ by a simple Ohm's law-like relationship, as we did in Equation 17-1. However, because blood vessels are compliant (so that $R$ varies with pressure; see Fig. 19-7B) and because both aortic pressure and flow vary during the cardiac cycle, we cannot describe real arteries in this way. In the field of hydraulics, oscillating flows and pressures have not only an amplitude, but also a phase. As a result, the ratio $\Delta P / F$ is no longer resistance-a simple, time-independent quantity-but a complex quantity called the mechanical impedance ( $\mathrm{N} 22-3$ that depends on the classical "resistance" as well as the compliance and inertial properties of the vessels and blood.

Because of these resistive, compliant, and inertial properties, the pressure and flow waves in vessels distal to the aorta are not quite the same as in the aorta. Instead, the farther the vessels are from the aorta, the more different the pressure and flow waves become.

Aortic Arch During the rapid-ejection phase, peak flow through the aortic arch is remarkably high, $\sim 30 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ (dark beige band in Fig. 22-3A, panel 1). The peak linear velocity is $\sim 100 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$, which makes it more likely that the blood will reach the critical Reynolds number value for turbulence (see p. 416). The rapid ejection of blood also causes a rapid rise of the pressure in the aorta to above that in the ventricle (see Fig. 22-3B, panel 1). Even though the pressure gradient across the valve reverses, the valve does not close, as is evidenced by the continuous flow of blood from the ventricle into the aorta. The reason that flow continues in the forward direction is the inertial component of the blood flow, which represents considerable kinetic energy. Eventually, blood in the aortic arch decelerates sufficiently that the flow becomes zero and eventually negative (producing reflux through the valve). As the aortic valve closes, it produces the dicrotic notch in the aortic pressure trace.

Thoracic-Abdominal Aorta and Large Arteries Just distal to the aortic arch, a transformation of the flow and pressure curves begins to occur. The records in panels 2 through 4 in Figure 22-3A show the flow curves for the abdominal aorta and some of its large branches. Peak systolic flow becomes smaller as one moves from the aorta toward the periphery (i.e., iliac and femoral arteries), as would be predicted because of the branching of the vessels. However, in the abdominal aorta, a new phenomenon is seen. As the elastic aorta-which stored blood during systole-releases blood during diastole, a second peak of flow appears. Note that this diastolic component of flow is larger in the abdominal aorta than in the more distal iliac artery, and is almost absent in the femoral artery. Of particular importance is the sizable diastolic flow in the carotid and renal arteries (see Fig. 22-3A, panels 5 and 6). The basis for the diastolic component of flow is the subject of Box 22-2.

## The cardiac cycle also causes pressure waves in the aorta and peripheral vessels

The pressure curves in Figure 22-3B show that, with increasing distance from the heart (panels 1 to 4), the rising portion of the wave becomes steeper and the peak narrower. Because
the peak gradually increases in height and the minimum pressure gradually decreases, the pulse pressure becomes greater. With increasing distance from the heart, an important secondary pressure oscillation appears during diastole (see Fig. 22-3B, fourth panel). Thus, although the pressure waves are distorted, they are not damped. Although it might seem counterintuitive that the peak arterial pressure should increase as we get farther from the heart (Is the blood flowing against a pressure gradient?), it turns out that the mean arterial pressure does fall very slightly with increasing distance from the heart.

Terminal Arteries and Arterioles In the smallest arteries, the flows must be small. Here, the trend toward an increased peak pressure reverses. Instead, the pulse wave gets damped out for two reasons. First, because we are dealing with many parallel vessels with a large aggregate wall area, the aggregate compliance increases, damping the pressure wave. Second, because these smaller arteries have a smaller radius and thus a far greater resistance, the mean arterial pressure must fall in proportion to the much higher resistance. Thus, in contrast to the situation in the larger arteries, damping predominates over distortion.

Capillaries By the time the blood reaches the capillaries, the damping is so severe that pulsations (i.e., pressure oscillations) do not normally occur-blood flow is continuous. The pulmonary capillaries are an exception; their upstream vessels are short, and they have low resistance and high compliance. The pulsation of systemic capillaries occurs only in cases of markedly increased pulse pressure, such as in patients with aortic regurgitation or hyperthyroidism, or in cases of generalized peripheral vasodilation.

## Distortion of pressure waves is the result of their propagation along the arterial tree

Imagine that you are listening to a patient's heart with a stethoscope while simultaneously feeling the pulse of the radial artery near the wrist. For each heartbeat that you hear, you feel a radial pulse. You know that the peak pressure in the left ventricle occurs about midway between the first and second heart sounds, but the delay between the midpoint of the two heart sounds and the peak of the radial pulse is only $\sim 0.1 \mathrm{~s}$. Red blood cells (RBCs) take several seconds to flow from the heart to the wrist. Why, then, are you able to feel the pulse so soon after the heartbeat?

The answer is that the blood vessels conduct the palpable pulse as a pressure wave. The linear velocity of RBCscarried in the blood by convection-ranges from $\sim 1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in the aorta to vanishingly small values in the capillaries (see p. 448). However, the pressure wave travels at a velocity of 5 to $6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in the aorta, increasing to 10 to $15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in the small arteries.

The following example illustrates the difference between the velocity of a pressure wave and that of convection. Imagine that two people are submerged in a river, floating downstream (convection). Now the person upstream makes a sound under water. The sound waves (an example of a pressure wave) travel to the person downstream with a velocity that is far greater than the velocity of the river.

# N22-3 Mechanical Impedance of Blood Flow 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

We began this chapter by drawing an analogy between the flow of blood and electrical current, as described by an Ohm's law of hydrodynamics: $\Delta P=F \times R$. We now know that there are other factors that influence pressure. In addition to the flow resistance $R$ (electrical analogy = ohmic resistor), we must also consider the compliance $C$ (electrical analogy = capacitance) as well as the inertiance $L$ (electrical analogy = inductance). A similar problem is faced in electricity when dealing with alternating (as opposed to direct) currents. In Ohm's law for alternating currents, $E=I \times Z$, where $Z$ is a complex quantity called the impedance. $Z$ depends on the electrical resistance $R$, the electrical capacitance $C$, and the electrical inductance $L$. Similarly, for blood flow, we can write $\Delta P=F \times Z$, where $Z$ is also a complex quantity, called mechanical impedance, that includes the following:

1. Compliant impedance that opposes volume change (compliance of the vessel).
2. Viscous (or resistive) impedance that opposes flow (shearing forces in the liquid). This term is the $R$ of Ohm's law of hydrodynamics: $\Delta P=F \times R$ (see Equation 17-1).
3. Inertial impedance that opposes a change of flow (kinetic energy of fluid and vessels).
Considering all these sources of pressure, we can state that the total pressure difference at any point in time, instead of being given by Ohm's law, is

$$
P_{\text {total }}=P_{\text {pawity }}+P_{\text {compliance }}+P_{\text {viscous resistance }}+P_{\text {inertance }} \quad(\mathrm{NE} 22-1)
$$

The $P_{\text {pawity }}$ term in the above equation is discussed on pages 418-419 in the section titled "Gravity Causes a Hydrostatic Pressure Difference When There Is a Difference in Height."

## BOX 22-2 Effect of Aortic Compliance on Blood Flow

Tere is a large diastolic component to total blood flow in the large arteries that lie close to the aorta, such as the carotid and renal arteries (see Fig. 22-3A, panels 5 and 6). This sizeable diastolic component is largely the result of the high compliance of the vessel walls and the radial expansion of the vessels that occurs during ventricular ejection. We can reach at least an intuitive understanding of the radial contribution to flow in the aorta and large arteries by examining the ability of the aorta to store and to give up energy during the acceleration and deceleration of flow.

Figure 22-4 compares two branches of a hydraulic system that are identical in radius and length. One branch (branch 1) is rigid and made of glass; the other (branch 2) is elastic and made of rubber. Both branches terminate in a spout with an outflow resistance that is analogous to the resistance of arterioles. We assume that the resistance of the spout is much greater than that of the glass or rubber tube, so that we can ignore the effect of small changes in the diameter of the rubber tube on overall resistance. If we apply a steady pressure to both branches, the flows through the two branches are continuous and identical (see Fig. 22-4A).

However, if we apply the pressure in square pulses, the flows in the two branches are quite different (see Fig. 22-4B). The flow through the glass tubing instantly rises to a maximum value with the onset of the pressure wave, and then instantly falls to zero when the driving pressure falls to zero. Thus, the plot of flow through the glass tube perfectly mirrors the plot of the applied square-wave pressure. The flow through the rubber tube has a very different profile. During the interval of peak pressure, the rubber vessel gradually dilates, storing a volume of fluid. Therefore, the flow rises slowly to its maximum value. During the interval of the cycle when the driving pressure falls to zero, the expanded rubber vessel delivers its stored volume downstream, which results in some forward flow despite the absence of any pressure head. The time-averaged outflow from the rubber tube exceeds that from the glass tube.

The aorta and large vessels behave like the rubber tube in Figure 22-4B. The oscillating pressure head in our model (i.e., between zero and a peak value) represents ventricular pressure. The maintenance of flow during interruption of the pressure head is equivalent to the continuing flow from the aorta during diastole.

Figure 22-4C shows an alternative mechanical model, that of a Windkessel (German for "wind chamber"), in which we replace the compliance of a distensible rubber tube with the compressible air within a chamber above the blood.

The two models illustrated in Figure 22-4B and $C$ show how compliant blood vessels can convert discontinuous flow into a more continuous flow. The so-called Windkessel action of the arterial system considerably improves the efficiency of the pump (i.e., the heart) because the vessels are able to convert the phasic flow peaks of the pump into a more continuous flow.

We can illustrate how pressure waves propagate along arteries by replotting the arterial pressure profiles from Figure 22-3B and stacking them one on top of the other. The four pressure waves in Figure 22-5 actually represent data obtained simultaneously in a dog with four catheters, the first placed in the aortic arch and the last three, each placed precisely 10 cm downstream from the previous one. The downstream propagation of the wave through the larger arteries is accompanied by a serious distortion of the pressure profile: it gets narrower and taller as we move downstream.

Effect of Frequency on Wave Velocity and Damping The pressure wave ( $\mathrm{N} 22-4$ moving from the aorta to the periphery is actually an ensemble of many individual waves, each with its own frequency. Higher-frequency waves travel faster and undergo more damping than low-frequency waves (Fig. 22-6A). Recombination of these waves at a more peripheral site thus produces a new wave with a shape that is a distorted version of the original aortic wave.

Effect of Wall Stiffness on Wave Velocity As the pressure wave ( $\mathrm{N} 22-4$ reaches vessels that have a stiffer wall (e.g., greater ratio of wall thickness to vessel diameter), the velocity of the wave increases (see Fig. 22-6B). Conversely, with a more compliant vessel, some of the energy of the pressure pulse goes into dilation of the vessel, so that the pressure wave spreads out and slows down. Because aging causes a

decrease in vessel compliance (i.e., distensibility), the velocity of propagation actually increases.

## Pressure waves in veins do not originate from arterial waves

We have seen above in this chapter that flow in capillaries is usually not pulsatile. Nevertheless, blood flow in systemic capillaries can exhibit slow oscillations unrelated to the cardiac cycle. The action of upstream vasomotor control elements in arterioles and precapillary sphincters can cause fluctuations. In addition, changes in tissue pressure (e.g., caused by muscle contraction) can compress capillaries

The vessel wall becomes progressively thicker, illustrating decreasing compliance downstream.

Both low- and highfrequency waves move faster and undergo more damping than their counterparts in Panel A.

Figure 22-6 Propagation of pressure waves. In $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, the flow is from left to right. The left pair of pressure waves is at the same early time, whereas the right pair of pressure waves is at the same late time. If on the right (i.e., end of the vessel) we sum waves of different frequencies at the same instant in time, then the composite wave is distorted (like the green femoral artery curve in Fig. 22-5).

# N22-4 Distortion of Propagated Waves 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

The peak of the arterial pressure profile gets taller and sharper as we move away from the heart (see Fig. 22-5). There are three major reasons for this:

1. The higher-frequency components of the wave travel faster. The pressure wave in the arch of the aorta is far more complex than a simple sine or cosine wave. Nevertheless, we can think of the complex waveform in the aortic arch as being the algebraic sum of many individual sine and cosine waves, each with its own amplitude, frequency, and phase (i.e., how much the wave's peak is shifted left or right along the time axis). The precise mathematical method by which complex waveforms are broken down into simpler components is called Fourier analysis. It turns out that waves of higher frequency propagate with a greater velocity than waves of lower frequency. Thus, the farther the high- and low-frequency waves travel down the vessel, the more separated they become from one another (a process termed dispersion; see Fig. 22-6A). It also turns out that even if we examine a single sine wave-which, of course, has a single frequency-the position of the peak will shift backward as the wave travels down the vessel (this is called a phase shift). The magnitude of the phase shift increases with increasing frequency. Furthermore, the blood vessels produce more damping on the peaks of higher-frequency waves than on those of low-frequency waves (see Fig. 22-6A). When we sum these various effects on the sine-wave and cosine-wave components downstream, the reconstructed pressure wave has a
different (i.e., distorted) shape compared with the original wave.
2. The vessels become stiffer toward the periphery, increasing wave velocity, especially for higher-frequency components. Vessel walls become stiffer progressing down the vascular tree. The smaller peripheral vessels have a thicker wall relative to their luminal diameter. Waves propagate faster in stiff vessels than in compliant ones. Thus, pressure waves travel faster in smaller arteries. Increased stiffness speeds up high-frequency waves more than low-frequency ones (see Fig. 22-6B).
3. The pressure waves bounce off the end of the arterial tree and reflect back up the vessels. The vascular circuit is not infinite, nor does the end of the vasculature have a device that completely absorbs a transmitted pressure wave. Therefore, some of the wave must reflect back up the artery and sum with the waves traveling in the forward direction. By themselves, reflected waves are not large enough to explain the large distortions in the arterial pressure profile. Moreover, if the wave distortions were due only to reflections, then the reflections at any one point in the vascular tree would have to be stable with time (i.e., the reflections would have to create a "standing wave"). However, the vascular tree is far too short to create standing waves of the appropriate frequencies. In addition, to create a standing wave, the heart would have to beat with an absolutely invariant rhythm, which, of course, is not the case. Thus, reflections make only a small contribution to the distortion.

and cause further fluctuations in capillary flow. Pulmonary capillaries are especially susceptible to changes in the surrounding alveolar pressure (see pp. 687-689).

Although systemic veins have pressure waves, these waves do not originate from arterial waves propagating through the capillary beds, which are nonpulsatile. Three mechanisms can contribute to the venous pulse: (1) retrograde action of the heartbeat during the cardiac cycle, (2) the respiratory cycle, and (3) the contraction of skeletal muscles.

Effect of the Cardiac Cycle A large vein close to the heart, such as the jugular vein, has a complex pulse wave (Fig. 22-7A) synchronized to the cardiac cycle. The three

maxima, or peaks, in the jugular pulse wave are labeled $a, c$, and $v$. The three minima, or dips, are labeled $a v, x$, and $y$. These pressure transients reflect events in the cardiac cycle:

- The $\boldsymbol{a}$ peak is caused by the contraction of the right atrium.
- The $\boldsymbol{a v}$ minimum is due to relaxation of the right atrium and closure of the tricuspid valve.
- The $\boldsymbol{c}$ peak reflects the pressure rise in the right ventricle early during systole and the resultant bulging of the tricuspid valve-which has just closed-into the right atrium.
- The $\boldsymbol{x}$ minimum occurs as the ventricle contracts and shortens during the ejection phase later in systole. The shortening heart-with tricuspid valve still closed-pulls on and therefore elongates the veins, lowering their pressure.
- The $\boldsymbol{v}$ peak is related to filling of the right atrium against a closed tricuspid valve, which causes right atrial pressure to rise. As the tricuspid valve opens, the $v$ peak begins to wane.
- The $\boldsymbol{y}$ minimum reflects a fall in right atrial pressure during rapid ventricular filling, as blood leaves the right atrium through an open tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. The increase in venous pressure after the $y$ minimum occurs as venous return continues in the face of reduced ventricular filling.

Effect of the Respiratory Cycle Poiseuille was the first to observe that the pressure in the jugular vein becomes negative during inspiration (see Fig. 22-7B). During inspiration, the diaphragm descends, causing intrathoracic pressure (and therefore the pressure inside the thoracic vessels) to decrease and intra-abdominal pressure to increase (see p. 607). Consequently, the venous return from the head and upper extremities transiently increases, as low-pressure vessels literally suck blood into the thoracic cavity. Simultaneously, the venous flow decreases from the lower extremities because of the relatively high pressure of the abdominal veins during inspiration. Therefore, during inspiration, pressure in the jugular vein falls while pressure in the femoral vein rises.

Effect of Skeletal Muscle Contraction ("Muscle Pump") The contraction of skeletal muscle can also affect pressure and flow in veins. Large veins in the lower limbs are equipped with valves that prevent retrograde movement of blood (see p. 419). When a person is at rest and in the recumbent position, all venous valves are open and venous blood flow toward the heart is continuous. Standing causes the venous pressure in the foot to rise gradually to the hydrostatic pressure dictated by the vertical blood column from the foot to the heart (see Fig. 22-7C). If the person begins to walk, the combination of the pumping action of the leg muscles on the leg veins and the action of the venous valves as hydrostatic relay stations causes the venous pressure in the foot to decrease. Each step causes both a small oscillation and a small net decrease in foot vein pressure. Once foot vein pressure has bottomed out, each step simply causes a small pressure oscillation. Walking causes a net decrease in pressure in both the superficial and deep foot veins, as well as in the corresponding capillaries. When the exercise ceases, the venous pressure again rises.

## CARDIAC DYNAMICS

The heart is a system of two pumps linked in series. The muscular wall of the left ventricle is thicker and more powerful than that of the right. The interventricular septum welding the two pumps together is even thicker. The thick muscular walls of the ventricles are responsible for exerting the heart's pumping action.

The heart does not depend on a rhythm generator in the brain, like the central pattern generators (see p. 390) that drive other rhythmic behaviors such as respiration, locomotion, chewing, and shivering. Instead, pacemaker cells within the heart itself initiate cardiac excitation. When the heart is in a normal sinus rhythm, the pacemaker cells setting the rate are located in the sinoatrial (SA) node of the right atrium (see p. 489). The action potential then spreads through atrial myocytes and specialized tracts or bundles. The impulse cannot cross from the atria to the ventricles except through the AV node. The AV node inserts a time delay into the conduction that is essential to allow the ventricles to finish filling with blood before contraction and ejection occur. From the AV node, the impulse spreads through the bundle of His and then the right and the left bundle branches, the latter of which divides in an anterior and posterior fascicle. Finally, the system of Purkinje fibers excites the ventricular myocytes, where the impulse propagates from cell to cell through gap junctions.

## The right ventricle contracts like a bellows, whereas the left ventricle contracts like a hand squeezing a tube of toothpaste

The two ventricles share a common envelope of spiral and circular muscle layers. The arrangement of the spiral bundles ensures that ventricular contraction virtually wrings the blood out of the heart, although incompletely. The apex contracts before some of the basal portions of the ventricle, a sequence that propels blood upward to the aortic and pulmonary valves.

The mechanical action of the right ventricle resembles that of a bellows used to fan a fire (Fig. 22-8A). Although the distance between the free wall and the septum is small, the free wall has such a large surface area that a small movement of the free wall toward the septum ejects a large volume.

The mechanism of emptying of the right ventricle involves three motions. First, the longitudinal axis of the right ventricle shortens when spiral muscles pull the tricuspid valve ring toward the apex. Second, the free wall of the right ventricle moves toward the septum in a bellows-like motion. Third, the contraction of the deep circular fibers of the left ventricle forces the septum into a convex shape, so that the septum bulges into the right ventricle. This bulging of the septum stretches the free wall of the right ventricle over the septum. These three motions are well suited for ejection of a large volume, but not for development of a high pressure. The right ventricle ejects the same blood volume as the left ventricle does, but it does so at much lower intraventricular pressures.

The mechanical action of the left ventricle occurs by a dual motion (see Fig. 22-8B): First, constriction of the circular muscle layers reduces the diameter of the chamber,
progressing from apex to base, akin to squeezing a tube of toothpaste. Second, contraction of the spiral muscles pulls the mitral valve ring toward the apex, thereby shortening the long axis. The first mechanism is the more powerful and is responsible for the high pressures developed by the left ventricle. The conical shape of the lumen gives the left ventricle a smaller surface-to-volume ratio than the right ventricle and contributes to the ability of the left ventricle to generate high pressures.

The contraction of the atria normally makes only a minor contribution to the filling of the two ventricles when the subject is at rest (see Box 22-1). However, the contraction of the atria is a useful safety factor in at least two circumstances. During tachycardia, when the diastolic intervaland thus the time for passive filling-is short, the atrial contraction can provide a much-needed boost. Atrial contraction is also useful in certain pathological conditions. For example, when a narrowed (i.e., stenotic) AV valve offers substantial resistance to the flow of blood from atrium to ventricle, the atrial pump can make an important contribution to ventricular filling.

## The right atrium contracts before the left, but the left ventricle contracts before the right

When the cardiac cycle was introduced above in the chapter, we assumed that the events in the right and left heart happen simultaneously. However, as we have already noted in our discussion of the splitting of heart sounds, the timing of the two hearts is slightly different (see Fig. 22-8C).

Atrial Contraction Because the SA node is located in the right atrium, atrial contraction begins and ends earlier in the right atrium than in the left (see Fig. 22-8C, "Contraction" panel).

Initiation of Ventricular Contraction Ventricular contraction starts slightly earlier on the left side, and the mitral valve closes before the tricuspid valve. However, this timing difference in the closure of the AV valves (see Fig. 22-8C, "Valve movements" panel) is so small that it is unusual to hear a split $\mathrm{S}_{1}$. On the other hand, the right ventricle has a briefer period of isovolumetric contraction because it does not need to build up as much pressure to open its semilunar (i.e., outflow) valve and to initiate ejection. Thus, the pulmonary valve opens slightly ahead of the aortic valve.

Ventricular Ejection Ejection from the right ventricle lasts longer than that from the left. The semilunar valves do not close simultaneously. The aortic valve, with its higher downstream pressure, closes before the pulmonary valve. Therefore, the pulmonary valve-with its lower downstream pressure-opens first and closes last. This timing difference in the closure of the semilunar valves explains the normal physiological splitting of $\mathrm{S}_{2}$ (see Fig. 22-8C, "Sounds" panel). During inspiration, the relatively negative intrathoracic pressure enhances filling of the right heart, causing it to have a larger end-diastolic volume and therefore more blood to eject. The additional time required for right ventricular ejection postpones the closure of the pulmonary

valve $\left(\mathrm{P}_{2}\right)$, broadening the physiological splitting of $\mathrm{S}_{2}$ (see p. 511).

Ventricular Relaxation Isovolumetric relaxation is briefer in the right heart than in the left. The pulmonary valve closes after the aortic valve, and the tricuspid valve opens before the mitral valve. Therefore, the right ventricle begins filling before the left.

## Measurements of ventricular volumes, pressures, and flows allow clinicians to judge cardiac performance

Definitions of Cardiac Volumes The cardiac output is the product of heart rate and stroke volume (see p. 414). The stroke volume (SV) is the difference between ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV) and ventricular end-systolic volume (ESV); that is, the difference between the maximal and minimal ventricular volumes. EDV is typically 120 mL , and ESV is 50 mL , so that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{SV} & =\mathrm{EDV}-\mathrm{ESV} \\
& =120 \mathrm{~mL}-50 \mathrm{~mL} \\
& =70 \mathrm{~mL}
\end{aligned}
$$

The ejection fraction (EF) is a dimensionless value, defined as the SV normalized to the EDV:

$$
\mathrm{EF}=\frac{\mathrm{SV}}{\mathrm{EDV}}
$$

In our example, the EF is $(70 \mathrm{~mL}) /(120 \mathrm{~mL})$ or $\sim 0.6$. The value should exceed $55 \%$ in a healthy person. Whereas the ejection fractions of the left and right ventricles as a rule are equal, clinicians normally measure left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

Measurements of Cardiac Volumes Clinicians routinely measure the volumes of the cardiac chambers by means of angiography or echocardiography (see pp. 426-428). Onedimensional (or M-mode) echocardiography allows one to assess left ventricular performance in terms of linear dimensions and velocities by providing measurements of (1) velocity of the posterior left ventricular wall, (2) fractional shortening of the left ventricular circumference, and (3) rate of fractional circumferential shortening. Two-dimensional echocardiography makes it possible to determine several ventricular volumes:

- Left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV)
- Left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV)
- Stroke volume (SV = LVEDV - LVESV)
- Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF = SV/LVEDV)

Measurement of Ventricular Pressures For right-sided heart catheterizations, clinicians use a Swan-Ganz catheter, which consists of three parallel tubes of different lengths. The longest is an end-hole catheter with a balloon flotation device that directs the tip in the direction of the blood flow. The other two tubes are side-hole catheters that terminate at two points proximal to the tip. The physician advances the catheter percutaneously through a large systemic vein, into the right heart, and then into the pulmonary circulation, where

TABLE 22-3 Comparison of Pressures in the Right and Left Circulations

the tip of the longest tube literally wedges in a small pulmonary artery. Because a continuous and presumably closed column of blood connects the probe's end and the left atrium, the wedge pressure is taken as an index of left atrial pressure. For left-sided heart catheterizations, clinicians insert a simple catheter percutaneously into an artery and then advance the catheter tip upstream to the left heart. Table 22-3 lists some of the most important pressure values for the right and left hearts.

Measurement of Flows The cardiologist can calculate flow from changes in ventricular volume, as measured by echocardiography and the Doppler ultrasound technique (see pp. 427-428), both of which measure the flow of blood in the outflow tract (i.e., aorta). Figure 22-8D and E illustrate the profiles of outflow pressure and velocity for the two ventricles. Although the two ventricles expel on average the same amount of blood in a single cardiac cycle, the peak velocity is much higher in the left ventricle. In addition, the velocity rises far more rapidly in the left ventricle, which indicates greater acceleration of the blood during ejection. The pressure wave is about five times larger in the left ventricle than in the right, and the rate at which the pressure rises $(\Delta P / \Delta t)$ is more rapid in the left ventricle.

## The pressure-volume loop of a ventricle illustrates the ejection work of the ventricle

In Figure 22-1, we saw separate plots of ventricular pressure against time and volume against time. If, at each point in time, we now plot pressure against volume, the result is a pressure-volume loop, as is shown in Figure 22-9 for the left ventricle. This loop is a "phase plot" that describes the relationship between left ventricular pressure and left ventricular volume during the cardiac cycle. Notice that, although time does not explicitly appear in this plot, as we make one complete counterclockwise cycle around the loop, we sequentially plot pressure and volume at all time points of

![bo14585266204](bo14585266204.jpg)

Figure 22-9 Pressure-volume loop of the left ventricle.
the cardiac cycle. However, the distance between two points on the loop is not proportional to elapsed time.

In examining this pressure-volume loop, we will arbitrarily start at point A in Figure 22-9, and then consider each of the segments of the loop (e.g., AB, BC, and so on) before again returning to point A. Although we use the left ventricle as an example, a similar analysis applies to the right ventricle.

Segment AB Point A in Figure 22-9 represents the instant at which the mitral valve opens. At this point, left ventricular volume is at its minimal value of $\sim 50 \mathrm{~mL}$, and left ventricular pressure is at the fairly low value of $\sim 7 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. As the mitral valve opens, the ventricle begins to fill passively, because atrial pressure is higher than ventricular pressure. During interval AB , ventricular pressure falls slightly to $\sim 5 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ because the ventricular muscle is continuing to relax during diastole. Thus, despite the rapid entry of blood, ventricular pressure falls to its lowest value in the cardiac cycle.

Segment BC During a second phase of ventricular filling, volume rises markedly from $\sim 70$ to $\sim 120 \mathrm{~mL}$, accompanied by a rather modest increase in pressure from $\sim 5$ to $\sim 10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. The modest rise in pressure, despite a doubling of ventricular volume $\Delta V$, reflects the high compliance ( $C=$ $\Delta V / \Delta P$ ) of the ventricular wall during late diastole. The relationship between pressure and volume during segment BC is similar to that in blood vessels (see p. 454).

Segment CD Point C in Figure 22-9 represents the closure of the mitral valve. At this point, ventricular filling has ended and isovolumetric contraction-represented by the vertical line CD-is about to begin. Thus, by the definition of isovolumetric, ventricular volume remains at 120 mL while left
ventricular pressure rises to $\sim 80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, about equal to the aortic end-diastolic pressure.

Segment DE Point D in Figure 22-9 represents the opening of the aortic valve. With the outlet to the aorta now open, the ventricular muscle can begin to shorten and to eject blood. During this period of rapid ejection, ventricular volume decreases from $\sim 120$ to $\sim 75 \mathrm{~mL}$. Notice that as contraction continues during interval DE, the ventricular pressure rises even farther, reaching a peak systolic value of $\sim 130 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at point E.

Segment EF Point E in Figure 22-9 represents the instant at which the ventricular muscle starts to relax. During this period of decreased ejection, ventricular pressure falls from $\sim 130$ to $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Nevertheless, blood continues to leave the ventricle, and ventricular volume falls from $\sim 75 \mathrm{~mL}$ at point E to $\sim 50 \mathrm{~mL}$ at point F. Point F represents endsystolic volume and pressure. Notice that the ventricle does not shrink to zero volume at the end of systole. In total, 120 $-50=70 \mathrm{~mL}$ of blood has left the ventricle during systole (i.e., between points D and F). Therefore, the stroke volume is substantially less than the maximum ventricular volume (i.e., EDV). The ejection fraction in this example is $\sim 60 \%$, which is in the normal range. Ejection occurs against aortic pressures ranging between 80 and 130 mm Hg . Therefore, ejection is not "isotonic" (see pp. 237-238).

Segment FA Point F in Figure 22-9 represents the closing of the aortic valve. At this point, ejection has ended and isovolumetric relaxation is about to begin. The ventricular volume remains at 50 mL , while left ventricular pressure falls from $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at point F to $\sim 7 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at point A . At the end of isovolumetric relaxation, the mitral valve opens and the cardiac cycle starts all over again with ventricular filling.

The six segments of the pressure-volume loop in Figure 22-9 correspond to different phases of the cardiac cycle:

- Phase 1, the inflow phase, includes segments AB and BC.
- Phase 2, isovolumetric contraction, includes segment CD.
- Phase 3, the outflow phase, includes segments DE and EF.
- Phase 4, isovolumetric relaxation, includes segment FA.

Segments CDEF represent systole, whereas segments FABC represent diastole.

## The "pumping work" done by the heart accounts for a small fraction of the total energy the heart consumes

The heart does its useful work as a pump by imparting momentum to the blood and propelling it against the resistance of the periphery.

Work, in its simplest definition, is the product of the force applied to an object and the distance the object moves ( $W=$ force $\times$ distance). In considering pressure-volume work, we must revise this definition. Imagine that we have a volume of blood in a syringe. If we apply a constant force to the plunger-that is, if we apply a constant pressure to the blood-the plunger moves a certain distance as we eject the blood through the needle, thereby reducing blood volume by an amount $\Delta V$. How much work have we done? For pressure moving a fluid, the external work is

![bo14685266204](bo14685266204.jpg)

Figure 22-10 External work of the left ventricle.

$$
W=P \cdot \Delta V
$$

If the aortic pressure were constant, the work done with each heartbeat would be simply the product of the aortic pressure $(P)$ and the stroke volume $(\Delta V=\mathrm{SV}=\mathrm{EDV}-\mathrm{ESV})$.

The pressure-volume relationships in Figure 22-10 illustrate the pressure-volume work of the left ventricle. The surface below the segment ABC (i.e., filling phase) is the work done by the blood (previously contained in the venous reservoirs and atria at a low pressure) on the ventricle (see Fig. 22-10A). The surface below DEF (i.e., ejection phase) is the work done by the heart on the blood during the ejection (see Fig. 22-10B). The difference between the areas in Figure 22-10A and $B$-that is, the area within the single-cycle loop-is the net external work done by the heart (see Fig. 22-10C). 0 N22-5

The pressure-volume diagram for the right ventricle has the same general shape. However, the area (i.e., net external work) is only about one fifth as large because the pressures are so much lower.

The area of the loop in Figure 22-10C-that is, the pressure-volume work $(P \cdot V)$-ignores the speed at which the ventricle pumps the blood (i.e., the acceleration that the heart imparts to the blood, or the time it takes to complete one cardiac cycle). Thus, the work per beat should also include the kinetic energy $\left(\dot{\gamma}_{s}^{\prime} m v^{2}\right)$ that the heart imparts to the ejected blood:

$$
\frac{W}{\text { Total }}=\frac{P \cdot V}{\text { Total }}+\frac{\dot{\gamma}_{s}^{\prime} m v^{2}}{\text { Arterial }} \text { Kinet } \\
\text { Arterial } \text { energy }
$$

Of its total external work, the heart delivers only a relatively small fraction as kinetic energy. Moreover, the total external work is itself only a small portion of the total energy that the heart actually expends. Like other muscles, the heart not only shortens and performs classical work (e.g., isotonic contraction), but it also maintains active tension without shortening (i.e., isometric contraction; see pp. 237-238). During the isovolumetric contraction, the ventricle develops and maintains a high pressure without performing any total
external work-just as we perform no useful work when we hold a weight without lifting it. However, in both isometric exercises, the muscle breaks down ATP as long as it maintains isometric tension; the energy ends up as heat. This type of energy cost in heart muscle is called tension heat, (0) N22-6 which is proportional to the product of the tension of the ventricular wall $(T)$ and the length of time $(\Delta t)$ that the ventricle maintains this tension (i.e., tension-time integral). In the case of the heart, the pressure against which the ventricle must pump is a major determinant of the wall tension.

The total energy transformed in one cardiac cycle is the sum of the total external work done on the blood and the tension heat:

$$
E=\underbrace{P \cdot V}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Pressure- } \\
\text { volume } \\
\text { work }
\end{array}}+\underbrace{\frac{\dot{\gamma}_{s}^{\prime} m v^{2}}{\text { Kinet }}+\underbrace{k \cdot T \cdot \Delta t}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Tension } \\
\text { heat }
\end{array}}}
$$

where $k$ is a proportionality constant that converts $T \cdot \Delta t$ into units of energy. The tension heat is the major determinant of the total energy requirements of the heart. Total external work represents a relatively small fraction (3\%) of the total energy needs of the heart at rest, rising to as much as $10 \%$ during exercise. The heat developed as part of the tensiontime integral remains the major component of the total energy consumption, even during exercise.

The tension heat is not only far more costly for the heart than the pressure-volume work but is also of considerable practical interest for the patient with coronary artery disease who wishes to step up cardiac output during increased physical activity. The major burden for such an individual may be not so much the total external work expended in driving additional blood through the circulation (i.e., increasing the cardiac output), but rather an increase in tension heat ( $k \cdot T$ - $\Delta t$ ). Thus, it is advantageous to the patient to have a low wall tension $(T)$-that is, a low blood pressure. It is also advantageous for the patient not to spend too much time $(\Delta t)$ in systole. The heart spends a greater fraction of its time in systole when the heart rate is high. Thus, the cardiac patient is better off to increase cardiac output at low pressure

## N22-5 "Pumping Work" Done by the Heart

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

In applying Equation 22-4,

$$
W=P \cdot \Delta V
$$

to the external work done by the heart, we assumed that the left ventricle pumps against a constant aortic pressure. In reality, of course, the aortic pressure is not constant. Thus, in Equation 22-4 we also should have included a $\boldsymbol{V} \cdot \Delta \boldsymbol{P}$ term to take into account the changing aortic pressure, so that Equation 22-4 becomes

$$
W=P \cdot \Delta V+\Delta P \cdot V
$$

(NE 22-2)
Nevertheless, our calculation of work using the area of the loop in Figure 22-10C does take this extra term into account.

## N22-6 Tension Heat

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

From the physical sciences, we know that we can define external mechanical work as the product of force and displacement. In the case of the heart, the external mechanical work is the product of the changes in pressure (i.e., force per unit area) and volume (i.e., displacement in three dimensions):

$$
W=P \cdot \Delta V+\Delta P \cdot V
$$

(NE 22-3)
This is the equation we introduced in $\mathbf{0}$ N22-5. The first term is particularly important during isovolumetric contraction, and the second term is particularly important during the ejection phase. However, as we noted on page 521, the heart consumes more energy than we can account for by the external mechanical work in the above equation.

Imagine that the left ventrical had to maintain itself for some time at point D in Figure 22-9. Here there is neither a change in pressure nor a change in volume, so that the above equation would tell us that the heart is performing no external mechanical work. Maintaining this isometric tension is like extending an arm holding a weight without lifting it-we do no external mechanical work, yet we burn ATP-tension heat. Moreover, this tension heat is proportional not only to the mass of the weight but also to how long we hold it! In contrast, if we transferred the weight from our arm to a nail in the wall, that nail could hold that weight for an indefinite period without consuming any energy.

If the path DEF in Figure 22-9 (i.e., ejection) were perfectly horizontal (a volume decrease at constant pressure), the external mechanical work would be $P \cdot \Delta V$ (i.e., the second term in the above equation). However, merely maintaining this constant pressure during the period of ejection requires energy-tension heat. Moreover, just as in our analogy with the extended arm holding the weight, the tension heat of the heart is proportional to the pressure (i.e., the tension) and the time the pressure is maintained, as described by the third term in Equation 22-6. Returning to Figure 22-9, we can increase the tension heat either by elevating the path DEF (i.e., raising the pressure) or increasing the time interval ( $\Delta t$ ) between D and F (i.e., slowing the ejection of the same volume). In practice, the $\Delta t$ for each ejection might increase with aortic stenosis, which increases the ejection time. Alternatively, cumulative $\Delta t$ (i.e., the aggregate $\Delta t$ over a minute's time) will increase with a high heart rate. Thus, performing the same external work at a high heart rate requires more total energy consumption than performing the same work at a low heart rate.

and low heart rate (i.e., a low $T \cdot \Delta t$ product). The only option left is to increase stroke volume.

The ratio of the ventricle's total external work $\left(P \cdot V+\right.$ $\left.\left.\right|\left\langle m v^{2}\right)\right.$ to the total energy cost (i.e., $W / E$ ) is the heart's mechanical efficiency. Note that the mechanical efficiency has nothing to do with how effective the ventricle is at expelling blood (i.e., ejection fraction).

## FROM CONTRACTILE FILAMENTS TO A REGULATED PUMP

In Chapter 9, we examined the general features of muscle contraction and compared the properties of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle. In this chapter, we examine how some of the features of cardiac muscle underlie cardiac performance.

## The entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the outside triggers $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum

Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in cardiac ventricular myocytes (see pp. 242 -243) is similar to EC coupling in skeletal muscle (see pp. 229-230). One major difference is that, in the case of skeletal muscle, the initiating event is the arrival of an action potential at the neuromuscular junction, the release of acetylcholine, and the initiation of an end-plate potential. In the ventricular myocyte, action potentials in adjacent myocytes depolarize the target cell through gap junctions (see p. 483) and thereby generate an action potential.

As in a skeletal muscle fiber (see pp. 229-230), the depolarization of the plasma membrane in the ventricular myocyte invades T tubules that run radially to the long axis of the myocyte. Unlike skeletal muscle cells, cardiac myocytes also have axial T tubules that run parallel to the long axis of the cell and interconnect adjacent radial T tubules.

Another major difference in EC coupling between cardiac and skeletal muscle is the way that the L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (Cav1.2, dihydropyridine receptors) in the T-tubule membrane activate the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels made up of four RYR2 molecules in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane. In skeletal muscle, the linkage is mechanical and does not require $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry per se. If you place skeletal muscle in a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-free solution, the muscle can continue contracting until its intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores become depleted. In contrast, cardiac muscle quickly stops beating. Why?

In cardiac muscle, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry through the L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel Cav1.2 (Fig. 22-11, black arrow No. 1) is essential for raising $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in the vicinity of the RYR2 on the SR. A subset of Cav1.2 channels may be part of caveolae. This trigger $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activates an adjacent cluster of RYRs in concert, causing them to release $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ locally into the cytoplasm by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release (CICR; see Fig. 22-11, black arrow No. 2). In the CICR coupling mechanism, the action of this $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is analogous to that of a neurotransmitter or chemical messenger that diffuses across a synapse to activate an agonist-gated channel, but in this case the synapse is the intracellular diffusion gap of $\sim 15 \mathrm{~nm}$ between plasmamembrane Cav channels and RYR channels on the SR membrane. The CICR mechanism is a robust amplification system whereby the local influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from small clusters of L-type

Cav channels in the plasma membrane triggers the coordinated release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the high-capacity $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores of the SR. Such single CICR events can raise $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ to as high as $10 \mu \mathrm{M}$ in microdomains of $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter. These localized increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ appear as calcium sparks (5) N9-3 when they are monitored with a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitive dye by confocal microscopy. If many L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels open simultaneously in ventricular myocytes, the spatial and temporal summation of many elementary $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks leads to a global increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. The time course of this global $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ increase in ventricular myocytes lasts longer than that of the action potential (compare blue and black curves in inset in Fig. 22-11) because the RYR $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels remain open for a longer time than L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels.

Atrial myocytes have a poorly developed T-tubule system. In atrial cells, depolarization-induced activation of L-type Cav channels on the plasma membrane triggers $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from RYR channels in the peripheral SR (i.e., closest to the plasma membrane), eliciting subsurface $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks. These peripheral $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks then activate a wave of CICR that propagates inwardly throughout the central SR network of the atrial myocyte.

## A global rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ initiates contraction of cardiac myocytes

The basic structure of the thin and thick filaments in cardiac muscle is the same as in skeletal muscle (see Fig. 9-5). After $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ increases, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to the cardiac isoform of troponin C (TNNC1; see Table 9-1), and the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-TNNC1 complex releases the inhibition of the cardiac isoform of troponin I (TNNI3) on actin. As a result, the tropomyosin (TPM1) filaments bound to cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) on the thin filament shift out of the way (see Fig. 9-6), allowing myosin to interact with active sites on the actin. ATP fuels the subsequent cross-bridge cycling (see Fig. 9-7). Because the heart can never rest, cardiac myocytes have a very high density of mitochondria and thus are capable of sustaining very high rates of oxidative phosphorylation (i.e., ATP synthesis).

The cross-bridge cycling causes thick filaments to slide past thin filaments, generating tension. The time course of cardiac tension development is delayed relative to the time course of the global surge in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ (compare red and blue curves in inset of Fig. 22-11).

When we discussed the mechanics of skeletal muscle in Chapter 9, we introduced the concept of a length-tension diagram (see Fig. 9-9C), which is a plot of muscle tension as a function of muscle length. The length parameter in such a plot can be either the length of the whole skeletal muscle or the length of a single sarcomere. For heart muscle, which wraps around the ventricle, the length parameter can be either the ventricular volume, which is analogous to wholemuscle length, or the sarcomere length. The sarcomere, stretching from one Z line to another, is the functional unit in both skeletal and cardiac muscle.

## Phosphorylation of phospholamban and of troponin I speeds cardiac muscle relaxation

With the waning of the phase 2 plateau of the cardiac action potential (see Fig. 21-4B, top panel), the influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$

![bo14785266204](bo14785266204.jpg)

through L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels decreases, which lessens the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ by the SR. By itself, halting of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry and release can only prevent a further increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. The actual relaxation of the contractile proteins depends on four processes: (1) extrusion of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the extracellular fluid (ECF), (2) reuptake of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the cytosol by the SR, (3) uptake of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the cytosol into the mitochondria, and (4) dissociation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from troponin C. Processes 2 and 4 are highly regulated.

Extrusion of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the ECF Even during the plateau of the action potential, the myocyte extrudes some $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. After the membrane potential returns to more negative values, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ extrusion (see Fig. 22-11, red arrow No. 1) gains the upper hand and $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ falls. In the steady state (i.e., during the course of several action potentials), the cell must extrude all the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that enters the cytosol from the ECF through L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. As in most other cells (see p. 126), this extrusion of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the ECF occurs by two pathways: (1) a sarcolemmal Na-Ca exchanger (NCX1), which operates
at relatively high levels of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$; and (2) a sarcolemmal Ca pump (cardiac subtypes 1, 2, and 4 of plasma-membrane Ca ATPase, or PMCA), which may function at even low levels of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. However, PMCA contributes only modestly to relaxation. Because PMCA is concentrated in caveolae, which contain receptors for various ligands, its role may be to modulate signal transduction.

Reuptake of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ by the SR Even during the plateau of the action potential, some of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ accumulating in the cytoplasm is sequestered into the SR (see Fig. 22-11, red arrow No. 2) by the cardiac subtype of the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca pump SERCA2a (see p. 118). Phospholamban (PLN), (5) N22-7 an integral SR membrane protein with a single transmembrane segment, is an important regulator of SERCA2a. In SR membranes of cardiac, smooth, and slow-twitch skeletal muscle, unphosphorylated PLN can exist as a homopentamer that may function in the SR as an ion channel or as a regulator of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels. The dissociation of the pentamer allows the

# N22-7 Phospholamban 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Phospholamban (PLN or PLB) is a 6-kDa integral membrane protein with 52 amino acids and a single transmembrane domain. The protein kinases that can phosphorylate PLN include PKA, sarcoplasmic reticulum calmodulin kinase (SRCaM kinase-a distinct $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-CaM-dependent protein kinase), and a cGMP-dependent kinase (see pp. 66-67).

As noted in the text, the phosphorylated PLN can exist as a homopentamer that may function in the SR as an ion channel. Structural biology studies of PLN indicate that, at its narrowest point, the pore radius is $1.8 \AA$.

hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain of PLN monomers to inhibit SERCA2a. However, phosphorylation of PLN by any of several kinases relieves PLN's inhibition of SERCA2a, allowing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ resequestration to accelerate. The net effect of phosphorylation is an increase in the rate of cardiac muscle relaxation. PLN-knockout mice have uninhibited SERCA2a Ca pumps and thus an increased velocity of muscle relaxation.

Phosphorylation of PLN by protein kinase A (PKA) explains why $\beta_{1}$-adrenergic agonists (e.g., epinephrine), which act through the PKA pathway (see p. 57), speed up the relaxation of cardiac muscle. Phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PP1) dephosphorylates PLN, thereby terminating $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reuptake.

Uptake of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ by Mitochondria The mitochondria take up a minor fraction of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ accumulating in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 22-11, red arrow No. 3). The inner mitochondrial membrane contains large-conductance, highly selective $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (MiCas) that are inwardly rectifying. At potentials of -160 mV , which are typical for energized mitochondria, the MiCa channels carry a substantial $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current. Unlike many other $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, MiCa does not inactivate as intramitochondrial $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ rises to micromolar concentrations.

Dissociation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from Troponin C As $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ falls, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ dissociates from troponin C (see Fig. 22-11, red arrow No. 4; see p. 233), blocking actin-myosin interactions and causing relaxation. $\beta_{1}$-adrenergic agonists accelerate relaxation by promoting phosphorylation of troponin I, which in turn enhances the dissociation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from troponin C .

## The overlap of thick and thin filaments cannot explain the unusual shape of the cardiac length-tension diagram

We discussed passive and active length-tension diagrams for skeletal muscle in conjunction with Figure 9-9C and D. We obtain a passive length-tension diagram by holding a piece of resting skeletal or cardiac muscle at several predefined lengths and measuring the tension at each length (Fig. 22-12A, turquoise and violet curves). We obtain the active length-tension diagram by stimulating the muscle at each predefined length (i.e., isometric conditions) and measuring the increment in tension from its resting or passive value (see Fig. 22-12A, turquoise and brown curves).

The passive length-tension diagrams for skeletal and cardiac muscle are quite different. The passive tension of a skeletal muscle (see Fig. 22-12A, green curve) is practically nil until the length of the sarcomere exceeds $2.6 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. Beyond this length, passive tension rises slowly. On the other hand, the passive tension of cardiac muscle (see Fig. 22-12A, violet curve) begins to rise at much lower sarcomere lengths and rises much more steeply. As a result, cardiac muscle will break if it is stretched beyond a sarcomere length of $2.6 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, whereas it is possible to stretch skeletal muscle to a sarcomere length of $3.6 \mu \mathrm{~m}$.

The reason for the higher passive tension is that the noncontractile (i.e., elastic) components of cardiac muscle are less distensible. The most important elastic component is the giant protein titin (see p. 234), which acts as a spring that
provides the opposing force during stretch and the restoring force during shortening (see Fig. 9-4B).

The active length-tension diagrams also differ between skeletal and cardiac muscle. The active tension of skeletal muscle (see Fig. 22-12A, turquoise curve) is high and varies only modestly between sarcomere lengths of 1.8 and $2.6 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. In Chapter 9, we attributed the shape of this curve to the degree of myofilament overlap (see pp. 238-240). In cardiac muscle (see Fig. 22-12A, brown curve), active tension has a relatively sharp peak when the muscle is prestretched to an initial sarcomere length of $-2.4 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. As the prestretched sarcomere length increases from 1.8 to $2.4 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, active tension rises steeply. We cannot account for this rise by an increase in the overlap of thick and thin filaments because the filament dimensions of cardiac and skeletal muscle are similar. Rather, the rise in tension at longer sarcomere lengths in cardiac muscle probably has two general causes: (1) Raising the sarcomere length above $1.8 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ increases the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensitivity of the myofilaments. One mechanism controlling the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensitivity may be interfilament spacing between thick and thin filaments, because fiber diameter varies inversely with fiber length. As we stretch the muscle to greater sarcomere lengths, the lateral filament lattice spacing is less than in an unstretched fiber so that the probability of cross-bridge interaction increases. Increased cross-bridge formation in turn increases the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ affinity of TNNC1, thereby recruiting more cross-bridges and therefore producing greater force. Another mechanism could be that, as the muscle elongates, increased strain on titin either alters lattice spacing or alters the packing of myosin molecules within the thick filament. (2) Raising the sarcomere length above $1.8 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ increases tension on stretch-activated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, thereby increasing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry from the ECF and thus enhancing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release.

As cardiac sarcomere length increases above $2.4 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, active tension declines precipitously, compared with the gradual fall in skeletal muscle. Once again, this fall-off does not reflect a problem in the overlap of thin and thick filaments. Instead, titin increases the passive stiffness of cardiac muscle and may also impede development of active tension at high sarcomere lengths.

## Starling's law states that a greater fiber length (i.e., greater ventricular volume) causes the heart to deliver more mechanical energy

Long before the development of the sliding-filament hypothesis and our understanding that active tension should depend on sarcomere length, Ernest Starling in 1914 anticipated the results of Figure 22-12A using an isolated heart-lung preparation. (○) N22-10 Starling's law states that "the mechanical energy set free on passage from the resting to the contracted state depends on the area of 'chemically active surfaces,' i.e., on the length of the fibres." Therefore, the initial length of myocardial fibers determines the work done during the cardiac cycle. Figure 22-12B shows the results of experiments that Starling performed on the intact heart. Starling assumed that the initial length of the myocardial fibers is proportional to the end-diastolic volume. Further, he assumed that tension in the myocardial fibers is proportional to the systolic pressure. Therefore, starting from a volume-

Figure 22-12 Length-tension diagram. Compared with $\mathbf{A}$, in $\mathbf{B}$ EDV on the $x$-axis is used as an index of sarcomere length. (Because EDV was difficult to measure before the days of echocardiography, Starling actually used left atrial pressure as an index of the degree of filling.) Starling measured pressure on the $y$-axis as an index of tension. Thus, systolic pressure replaces active tension, and diastolic pressure replaces passive tension. In $\mathbf{C}$, left atrial pressure on the $x$-axis is used as an index of sarcomere length, and stroke work (systolic pressure $\times$ ejected volume) on the $y$-axis is used instead of tension.
pressure diagram, Starling was able to reconstruct an equivalent length-tension diagram (Table 22-4).

His diagram for diastole (see Fig. 22-12B, purple curve), which shows a rising pressure (tension) with increased EDV (fiber length), is very similar to the early part of the passive length-tension diagram for cardiac muscle (see Fig. 22-12A, violet curve). His diagram for systole (see Fig. 22-12B, red curve) is more or less equivalent to the ascending phase of the active length-tension diagram for cardiac muscle (see Fig. 22-12A, brown curve). Therefore, Starling's systole curve shows that the heart is able to generate more pressure (i.e., deliver more blood) when more is presented to it.

A ventricular performance curve (see Fig. 22-12C) is another representation of Starling's length-tension diagram, but it is one a clinician can obtain for a patient. A ventricular performance curve shows stroke work ( $P \cdot \Delta V$, see Equation 22-4), which includes Starling's systolic pressure (itself an estimate of muscle tension) on the $y$-axis, plotted against left atrial pressure, which corresponds to Starling's end-diastolic volume (itself an estimate of muscle length), on the x -axis. What we learn from performance curves obtained for living subjects is that Starling's law is not a fixed relationship. For instance, the norepinephrine released during sympathetic stimulation-which increases myocardial contractility (as

we will see below in this chapter)—steepens the performance curve and shifts it upward and to the left (see brown arrow in Fig. 22-12C). Similar shifts occur with other positive inotropic agents (e.g., cardiac glycosides), that is, drugs that increase myocardial contractility. Note also that ventricular performance curves show no descending component because sarcomere length does not increase beyond 2.2 to $2.4 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in healthy hearts.

## The velocity of cardiac muscle shortening falls when the contraction occurs against a greater opposing force (or pressure) or at a shorter muscle length (or lower volume)

The functional properties of cardiac muscle-how much tension it can develop, how rapidly it can contract-depend on many factors, but especially on two properties intrinsic to the cardiac myocyte.

1. Initial sarcomere length. For the beating heart, a convenient index of initial sarcomere length is EDV. Both initial sarcomere length and EDV are measures of the preload imposed on the cardiac muscle just before it ejects blood from the ventricle during systole. Starling's law, in which the independent variable is EDV, focuses on preload.
2. Force that the contracting myocytes must overcome. In the beating heart, a convenient index of opposing force is the arterial pressure that opposes the outflow of blood from the ventricle. Both opposing force and arterial pressure are measures of the afterload the ventricular muscle must overcome as it ejects blood during systole. Experiments on isotonic contractions focus on the afterload, factors that the ventricle can sense only after the contraction has begun.
Figure 22-13 shows how one might measure the velocity of shortening in a way that is relevant for a cardiac muscle facing both a preload and an afterload. In Figure 22-13A, the muscle starts off at rest, stretched between a fixed support
(bottom of the muscle) and the left end of a lever (top of the muscle). A weight attached to the other end of the lever, but resting on a table, applies stretch to the muscle to the extent allowed by the screw, which adjusts the "stop" of the lever's left end. Thus, the combination of the weight and the screw determines initial sarcomere length (i.e., preload). At this time, the muscle cannot sense the full extent of the weight. The more we stretch the muscle by retracting the screw, the greater the preload. When we begin to stimulate the muscle, it develops a gradually increasing tension (see Fig. 22-13C, lower blue curve), but the length between the fixed point and the left end of the lever (see Fig. 22-13A) remains constant. That is, the muscle cannot shorten. Therefore, in the first phase of the experiment, the muscle exerts increasing isometric tension.

When the muscle has built up enough tension, it can now begin lifting the weight off the table (see Fig. 22-13B). This phase of the contraction is termed afterloaded shortening. The tension now remains at a fixed afterload value (flat portion of lower curve in Fig. 22-13C) but the muscle gradually shortens (rising portion of upper blue curve). Therefore, in the second phase of the experiment, the muscle exerts isotonic contraction. From the slope of the upper curve in Figure 22-13C, we can compute the velocity of shortening at a particular afterload.

This experiment roughly mimics the actions of ventricular muscle during systole. Initially, during its isometric contraction, our hypothetical muscle increases its tension at constant length, as during the isovolumetric contraction of the cardiac cycle shown in segment CD of Figure 22-9. The initial length corresponds to EDV, the preload. Later, the muscle shortens while overcoming a constant force (i.e., generating a constant tension), as during the ejection phase of the cardiac cycle shown in segment DEF of Figure 22-9. The tension corresponds to arterial pressure, the afterload.

What happens if we vary the afterload (i.e., change the weight)? As we already observed in our discussion of skeletal muscle, it is easier to lift a feather than a barbell. Thus, with a heavier weight, the muscle develops a lot of tension, but shortens slowly (see Fig. 22-13D, red tracings). Conversely, with a lighter weight, the muscle develops only a little bit of tension, but shortens rapidly (purple curves).

If we plot the velocities of shortening in Figure 22-13D as a function of the three different afterloads being lifted, we obtain the purple, blue, and red points on the loadvelocity curve in Figure 22-13E. The velocity of muscle shortening corresponds to the outflow velocity of the ventricle (see Fig. 22-8D, E). Thus, at higher opposing arterial pressures the outflow velocity should decrease. The black curve in Figure 22-13E applies to a muscle that we stretched only slightly in the preload phase (i.e., low preload in Fig. 22-13A). The red curve in Figure 22-13E shows a similar load-velocity relationship for a muscle that we stretched greatly in the preload phase (i.e., high preload). In both cases, the velocity of shortening increases as the tension (i.e., afterload) falls.

When the afterload is so large that no shortening ever occurs, that afterload is the isometric tension, shown as the point of zero velocity on the x -axis of Figure 22-13E. As expected from Starling's law, the greater the initial

Figure 22-13 Effect of preload and afterload on velocity of shortening. In $\mathbf{A}$, the developed tension is not yet sufficient to lift the weight (i.e., afterload). In $\mathbf{B}$, the muscle, which has now developed sufficient tension to lift the weight, shortens against a constant afterload. In $\mathbf{C}$, the slope of the blue curve $\Delta L / \Delta \theta$ is the velocity of shortening. The velocities of shortening for three different afterloads (tensions) in $\mathbf{D}$ are plotted as the three colored points of the lower curve in $\mathbf{E}$. In $\mathbf{F}$, the $x$-axis has the longest lengths on the left, so that "time" runs from left to right (arrows). Note that the family of curves is enclosed by the envelope created by the curve for the greatest initial length.

stretch (i.e., preload), the greater the isometric tension. In fact, at any velocity (see Fig. 22-13E, dashed horizontal line), the tension is greater in the muscle that was stretched more in the preload phase (red curve)-a restatement of Starling's law.

In summary, at a given preload (i.e., walking up the black curve in Fig. 22-13E), the velocity of shortening for cardiac muscle becomes greater with lower afterloads (i.e., opposing pressure). Conversely, at a given afterload-that is, comparing the black and red curves for any common $x$ value (see Fig. 22-13E, dashed vertical line)-the velocity of shortening for cardiac muscle becomes greater with a greater preload (i.e., sarcomere length).

Finally, the curves in Figure 22-13E do not represent a fixed set of relationships. Positive inotropic agents shift all curves up and to the right. Thus, a positive inotropic agent allows the heart to achieve a given velocity against a greater load, or to push a given load with a greater velocity.

Another way of representing how velocity of shortening depends on the initial muscle length (i.e., preload) is to monitor velocity of shortening during a single isotonic contraction. If we first apply a large preload to stretch a piece of muscle to an initial length of 9.0 mm (see Fig. 22-13F) and then stimulate it, the velocity instantly rises to a peak value of $\sim 8.5 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{s}$; it then gradually falls to zero as the muscle shortens to 7.5 mm . If we start by applying a smaller preload, thereby stretching the muscle to an initial length of 8.5 or 8.0 mm , the peak velocity falls. Thus, initial length determines not only the tension that cardiac muscle can generate, but also the speed with which the muscle can shorten.

## Increases in heart rate enhance myocardial tension

Heart muscle tension has a special dependence on the frequency of contraction. If we stimulate isolated heart muscle only a few times per minute, the tension developed is much smaller than if we stimulate it at a physiological rate of 70 times per minute. The progressive rise of tension after an increase in rate-the positive staircase phenomenon-was first observed by Henry Bowditch in 1871. Underlying the staircase phenomenon is an increase in $\mathrm{SR} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ content and release. The larger SR $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ content has three causes. First, during each action potential plateau, more $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enters the cell through Cav1.2 L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, and the larger number of action potentials per minute provides a longer aggregate period of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry through these channels. Second, the depolarization during the plateau of an action potential causes the Na-Ca exchanger NCX1 to operate in the reverse mode, (1) N21-2 allowing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to enter the cell. At higher heart rates, these depolarizations occur more frequently and are accompanied by an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$, which accentuates the reversal of NCX1, both of which enhance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ uptake. Third, the increased heart rate stimulates SERCA2a, thereby sequestering in the SR the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that entered the cell because of the first two mechanisms. The mechanism of this stimulation is that the rising $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, through calmodulin (CaM), activates CaM kinase II, which leads to phosphorylation of PLN; phosphorylation of PLN in turn enhances SERCA2a.

## Contractility is an intrinsic measure of cardiac performance

Now that we know that the performance of the heart depends on such factors as degree of filling (i.e., preload), arterial pressure (i.e., afterload), and heart rate, it would be useful to have a measure of the heart's intrinsic contractile performance, independent of these extrinsic factors. Contractility is such a measure.

Contractility is a somewhat vague but clinically useful term that distinguishes a better-performing heart from a poorly performing one. In a patient, (1) N22-8 it is difficult to assess cardiac performance by use of the approaches illustrated in Figures 22-12 and 22-13. One clinically useful measure of contractility is the ejection fraction (see p. 519). However, according to Starling's law, ejection depends on EDV (i.e., preload), which is external to the heart. Two somewhat better gauges of contractility are the rate of pressure development during ejection $(\Delta P / \Delta t)$ and the velocity of ejection. Both correlate well with the velocity of shortening in Figure 22-13E and $F$, and they are very sensitive guides to the effect of inotropic interventions.

A third assessment of contractility focuses on the physiological relationship between pressure and volume during the cardiac cycle. In the era of echocardiography, these volume data are now reasonably easy to obtain. We return to the ventricular pressure-volume loop that we introduced in Figure 22-9 and redraw it as the purple loop in Figure 22-14A. In this example, the EDV is 120 mL . Point $\mathrm{D}^{\prime}$ on the loop represents the relationship between pressure and volume at the end of the isovolumetric contraction, when the aortic valve opens. If we had prevented the aortic valve from opening, ventricular pressure would have continued to rise until the ventricle could generate no additional tension. In this case, the pressure would rise to point $\mathrm{G}^{\prime}$, the theoretical maximum isovolumetric pressure. We could repeat the measurement at very different EDVs by decreasing or increasing the venous return. Point G represents the maximum isovolumetric pressure for an EDV below 120 mL (orange loop), and point $\mathrm{G}^{\prime \prime}$ represents this pressure for an EDV above 120 mL (green loop). The gold dashed line through points $\mathrm{G}, \mathrm{G}^{\prime}$, and $\mathrm{G}^{\prime \prime}$ in Figure 22-14A would describe the relationship between pressure and EDV under isometric conditions (i.e., aortic valve closed)-the equivalent of an isometric Starling curve (e.g., brown curve in Fig. 22-12A). The steeper this line, the greater the contractility.

It is impossible to measure maximum isovolumetric pressures in a patient because it is hardly advisable to prevent the aortic valve from opening. However, we can use the end-systolic pressure at point $\mathrm{F}^{\prime}$ on the normal pressurevolume loop with an EDV of 120 mL (purple loop in Fig. 22-14A). For an EDV below 120 mL (orange loop), the corner point would slide down and to the left (point F). Conversely, for an EDV above 120 mL (green loop), the corner point would slide upward and to the right (point $\mathrm{F}^{\prime \prime}$ ). The corner points of many such pressure-volume loops fall along a line-the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR) (1) N22-9-that is very similar to that generated by the points $\mathrm{G}, \mathrm{G}^{\prime}$, and $\mathrm{G}^{\prime \prime}$.

## N22-8 Assessment of Contractility in Patients

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

For two reasons, it is not practical to assess cardiac performance in a patient by using the approaches outlined in Figures 22-12 and 22-13. First, with patients, we do not deal with isolated muscles in vitro. Second, the aforementioned figures require that we study the muscle under the artificial conditions of only isometric (i.e., preloaded) or only isotonic (i.e., afterloaded) contractions. During a full cardiac cycle, of course, these conditions alternate.

## N22-9 Using the End-Systolic Pressure-Volume Relation in Lieu of an Isometric Starling Curve

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

The ESPVR is a load-insensitive index of left ventricular contractility. This relation has been measured in small animal species using a conductance-catheter technique-whereby several electrodes along a catheter are used to compute the electrical conductance, which can be converted to absolute ventricular volume-and indwelling pressure gauges. Sato and colleagues (1998) tested the ESPVR under different contractility states: baseline condition, after sympathectomy, and after $\beta$ blockade in rats. The general slope of the curve decreased with decreasing contractility; that is, modestly after sympathectomy and strongly after $\beta$ blockade. The curve was not always perfectly straight. The ESPVR was slightly convex toward the pressure axis under baseline conditions, linear under sympathectomy conditions, and slightly concave toward the pressure axis under $\beta$-blockade conditions.

Figure 22-14 Assessment of contractility by the use of a ventricular pressure-volume loop. The purple pressure-volume loop is the normal curve in Figure 22-9. In $\mathbf{A}$, at the same normal state of cardiac contractility, the red loop is generated by decreasing EDV, and the green loop is generated by increasing EDV. The slope of the line through the points at the end of systole ( $\mathrm{F}, \mathrm{F}^{\prime}$, and $\mathrm{F}^{\prime \prime}$ ) represents the ESPVR.

Effect of Changes in Contractility The ESPVR is a clinically useful measure of contractility. Enhancing the contractility increases the slope of the ESPVR line, just as it increases the steepness of the ventricular performance curves (see brown arrow in Fig. 22-12C). For example, imagine that-with the same EDV and aortic pressure as in the control situation (purple area and gold ESPVR line in Fig. 22-14B)—we increase contractility. We represent increased contractility by steepening the ESPVR line (from gold to red dashed line in Fig. 22-14B). The result is that ejection continues from point $\mathrm{D}^{\prime}$ to a new point F (red loop in Fig. 22-14B) until the left ventricular volume reaches a much lower value than normal. In other words, enhanced contractility increases stroke volume. Decreasing contractility would flatten the slope of the ESPVR and decrease stroke volume.

Effect of Changes in Preload (i.e., Initial Sarcomere Length) A pressure-volume loop nicely illustrates the effect of increasing preload (i.e., increasing filling or EDV) without changing contractility. Starting from the control situation (see Fig. 22-14C, purple area), increase of the EDV shifts the isovolumetric segment to the right (segment CD on the red loop). Because the volume change along segment DEF is larger than for the control situation, stroke volume increases-as predicted by Starling's law.

Effect of Changes in Afterload A pressure-volume loop also illustrates the effect of an increased afterload (i.e., increase in aortic pressure). Starting from the control situation (see Fig. 22-14D, purple area), an increase of aortic pressure shifts the upper right corner of the loop from point $D^{\prime}$ (purple loop) to $D$ (red loop) because the ventricle cannot open the aortic valve until ventricular pressure reaches the higher aortic pressure. During the ejection phase-assuming that contractility (i.e., slope of the ESPVR) does not changethe ventricle necessarily ejects less blood until segment DEF intersects the ESPVR line. Therefore, an increase in afterload (at constant contractility) causes the loop to be taller and narrower, so that stroke volume and ejection fraction both decrease. However, if we were to increase contractility (i.e., increase the slope of the ESPVR), we could return the stroke volume to normal.

## Positive inotropic agents increase myocardial contractility by raising $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$

Modifiers of contractility can affect the dynamics of cardiac muscle contraction independent of preload or afterload.

These factors have in common their ability to change $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. When these factors increase myocardial contractility, they are called positive inotropic agents. When they decrease myocardial contractility, they are called negative inotropic agents (Boxes 22-3 and 22-4).

Positive Inotropic Agents Factors that increase myocardial contractility increase $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, either by opening $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, inhibiting Na-Ca exchange, or inhibiting the Ca pump-all at the plasma membrane.

1. Adrenergic agonists. Catecholamines (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine) act on $\beta_{1}$ adrenoceptors to activate the $\alpha$ subunit of $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$-type heterotrimeric G proteins. The activated $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ subunits produce effects by two pathways. First, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ raises intracellular levels of cAMP and stimulates PKA (see p. 57), which can then act by the mechanisms summarized in Table 23-2 to increase contractility and speed relaxation. Second, $\alpha_{s}$ can directly open L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the plasma membrane, which leads to an increased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx during action potentials, increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, and enhanced contractility.
2. Cardiac glycosides. Digitalis derivatives inhibit the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump on the plasma membrane (see p. 117) and therefore raise $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$. We would expect the increased $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ to slow down the Na-Ca exchanger NCX1, to raise steady-state $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, and to enhance contractility. Recent evidence suggests that cardiac glycosides may also increase $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ by a novel pathway-increasing the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeability of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels in the plasma membrane.
3. High extracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. Acting in two ways, elevated $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, increases $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and thereby enhances contractility. First, it decreases the exchange of external $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ for internal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Second, more $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enters the myocardial cell through L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels during the action potential.
4. Low extracellular $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$. Reducing the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient decreases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ extrusion through NCX1, raising $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and enhancing contractility.
5. Increased heart rate. As we noted in introducing the staircase phenomenon (see p. 528), an increased heart rate increases SR stores of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and also increases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx during the action potential.

Negative Inotropic Agents Factors that decrease myocardial contractility all decrease $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$.

1. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-channel blockers. Inhibitors of L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (see pp. 189-192)—such as verapamil, diltiazem, and

# BOX 22-3 Cardiac Hypertrophy 

Either volume overload or pressure overload can mechanically compromise the heart. A volume overload is an excessive EDV (i.e., preload). For example, a large AV shunt would volume overload both the left and right hearts. The increased EDV leads to an increase in stroke volume (see Fig. 22-14D), which elevates cardiac output. Systemic arterial pressure usually remains normal. A pressure overload is an excessive pressure in the ventricle's outflow tract (i.e., afterload). For the left heart,
the problem would be an increase in systemic arterial pressure (i.e., hypertension). The increased aortic pressure leads to a decrease in stroke volume (see Fig. 22-14D). However, because of a compensatory increase in heart rate, cardiac output usually remains normal. When, over time, the adaptive process of hypertrophy becomes inadequate to cope with demand, the result is mechanical dysfunction and, ultimately, heart failure (see Box 22-4).

# BOX 22-3 Cardiac Hypertrophy—cont'd 

Because cells of the adult heart are terminally differentiated, stimuli that might be mitogenic in other cells cannot elicit cell division in the heart, but rather cause the cardiac myocytes to hypertrophy and increase muscle mass. Elite athletes develop physiological hypertrophy, in which the cardiac cells increase proportionally both in length and in width. Volume overload leads to eccentric hypertrophy characterized by increases in myocyte length out of proportion to width. Pressure overload causes concentric hypertrophy with a relatively greater increase in myocyte width.

A host of events may trigger hypertrophy, including various hypertrophic factors, increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, and mechanical forces.

## Hypertrophic Factors

Agents implicated in cardiac hypertrophy include the cardiac cytosolic protein myotrophin (Myo/V1) and the cytokine cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1), as well as catecholamines, angiotensin II (ANG II), endothelin 1, insulin-like growth factor 2, transforming growth factor- $\beta$, and interleukin-1. Catecholamines and ANG II both activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (see pp. 68-69). Farther downstream in the signal-transduction pathway, the transcriptional response to hypertrophic stimuli includes the zinc-finger transcription factor, GATA-4 (see pp. 80-81), and perhaps also the transcription factors SRF and Sp1, as well as the TEF-1 family.

## Calcium

Elevated $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ may be both a trigger for hypertrophy and part of signal-transduction pathways that lead to hypertrophy. $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in heart cells is probably elevated initially during chronic volume or pressure overloads, just as $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ would be elevated in a normal heart that is working hard. Elevated $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ may activate calcineurin, a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent phosphatase (see p. 58). After being dephosphorylated by calcineurin, the transcription factor NFAT3 can enter the nucleus and bind to GATA4 (see above), which
transcriptionally activates genes responsible for hypertrophy. Mice that express constitutively activated forms of calcineurin develop cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

## Mechanical Factors

Mechanical stretch induces the expression of specific genes. The mechanical sensor that triggers cardiac hypertrophy may be MLP (muscle LIM protein), part of the myocardial cytoskeleton. Stretch activates a phosphorylation cascade of protein kinases: Raf-1 kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and a separate subfamily of the MAPKs called SAPKs (for stretch-activated protein kinases). These various kinases regulate gene expression by activating the transcription factor AP-1 (see pp. 81-82).

The pathways we have just discussed lead to several changes in gene expression within cardiac myocytes during hypertrophy. In addition to synthesizing many housekeeping proteins, hypertrophic cardiac myocytes undergo other changes that are more specific for contraction. Some of the most striking changes include reduced levels of the mRNA encoding three critical proteins in the membrane of the SR: (1) the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel, (2) PLN, and (3) SERCA2. In addition, cardiac hypertrophy is associated with increased levels of mRNA for the skeletal $\alpha$ actin, which is normally expressed in fetal heart, but not in adult heart. Hypertrophic hearts also have increased expression of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; see p. 481).

Although a hypertrophied myocardial cell may be able to do more work than a nonhypertrophied cell, it has a lower "contractility" when normalized to its cross-sectional area. Why should hypertrophied cardiac muscle not be as good as normal muscle? Possibilities include alterations in the transient increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ during the cardiac action potential and alterations in the expression of the contractile filaments, particularly the myosin isoenzymes.

## BOX 22-4 Cellular Basis of Heart Failure

Heart failure is among the most common causes of hospitalization in developed countries for people aged 65 years or older and is a leading cause of death. People whose hearts cannot sustain an adequate cardiac output become breathless (because blood backs up from the left heart into the lungs) and have swollen feet and ankles (because blood backs up from the right heart and promotes net filtration in systemic capillaries; see Box 20-1). On the cellular level, decreased contractility in heart failure could be a result of cardiac hypertrophy (see Box 22-3), reflecting alterations in the transient increases of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, the expression of the contractile filaments, or both.

Changes in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ physiology could reflect altered properties of the Cav1.2 L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel in the plasma membrane or the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel RYR2 in the SR membrane. In an animal model of hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy that leads to heart failure, the Cav1.2 channels exhibit an impaired ability to activate RYR2 through $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release. A distortion of the microarchitecture in hypertrophic cells, and thus a distortion of the spacing between Cav1.2 channels and RYR2, could be responsible for impaired coupling. Each of the four RYR2 molecules in the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel associates with a molecule of
calstabin 2 (also known as the FK506-binding protein, FKBP12.6) that, together with other proteins, forms a macromolecular complex regulating the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel. Depletion of calstabin 2 in heart failure results in leaky RYR2 channels that continually release $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the cytosol. High $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ makes the heart prone to delayed afterdepolarizations (see p. 506), ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. (5) N21-16

Changes in the expression of contractile proteins can reduce contractility. Two isoforms of myosin heavy chain, $\alpha \mathrm{MHC}$ and $\beta M H C$, are present in the heart (see Table 9-1). The speed of muscle shortening increases with the relative expression of $\alpha \mathrm{MHC}$. In human heart failure, the amount of $\alpha \mathrm{MHC} \mathrm{mRNA}$, relative to total MHC mRNA, falls from $\sim 35 \%$ to $\sim 2 \%$.

An interesting animal model of heart failure is the knockout mouse that lacks the gene encoding MLP, the muscle LIM protein (see pp. 530-531). MLP-deficient mice have the same disrupted cytoskeletal architecture seen in failing hearts. In addition, these mice have a dilated cardiomyopathy. Although humans with failing hearts are generally not deficient in MLP, the evidence from these knockout mice suggests that the MLP system could play a role in certain forms of cardiomyopathy.

nifedipine-reduce $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry during the plateau of the cardiac action potential. By reducing $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, they decrease contractility.
2. Low extracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. Depressed $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, lowers $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, both by increasing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ extrusion through NCX1 and by reducing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry through L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels during the plateau of the cardiac action potential.
3. High extracellular $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$. Elevated $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$, increases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ extrusion through NCX1, thereby decreasing $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$.

# REGULATION OF ARTERIAL PRESSURE AND CARDIAC OUTPUT 

Emile L. Boulpaep

When faced with a patient who appears seriously ill, clinicians focus their immediate attention on the patient's vital signs: temperature, respiratory rate, pulse, and blood pressure. These parameters are aptly named vital because they reflect the most fundamental aspects of health and even survival; a significant abnormality in any of these components indicates that emergent care is required.

In this chapter, we focus on blood pressure, a critical hemodynamic factor and one that is easily measured. An adequate blood pressure is necessary for proper organ perfusion. Too low, and we say that the patient is in shock. Too high, and we say that the patient is hypertensive; an acute and profound elevation of the blood pressure can be just as dangerous as a sudden plummeting of blood pressure. Here, we examine both the short- and long-term mechanisms that the body uses to regulate arterial blood pressure.

Because the arterial blood pressure depends to a large degree on the cardiac output, we also examine the regulation of this critical parameter. Finally, because cardiac output also depends on the venous return of blood to the heart, we discuss the matching between input (i.e., venous return) and cardiac output.

## SHORT-TERM REGULATION OF ARTERIAL PRESSURE

## Systemic mean arterial blood pressure is the principal variable that the cardiovascular system controls

Imagine that we must distribute city water to 1000 houses. We could decide in advance that each house uses $500 \mathrm{~L} /$ day and then pump this amount to each house at a constant rate. In other words, we would deliver $\sim 20 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{hr}$, regardless of actual water usage. The cardiovascular equivalent of such a system would be a circulation in which the cardiac output and the delivery of blood to each tissue remain constant.

Alternatively, we could connect all the houses to a single large water tower that provides a constant pressure head. Because the height of the water level in the tower is fairly stable, all faucets in all houses see the same pressure at all times. This system offers several advantages. First, each house can regulate its water usage by opening faucets according to need. Second, heavy water usage in one house with all faucets open does not affect the pressure head in the other
houses with only one faucet open. Third, the pressure head in the water tower guarantees that each house will receive sufficiently high pressure to send water to any upper floors. This water tower system is analogous to our own circulatory system, which provides the same flexibility for distribution of blood flow by, first and foremost, controlling the systemic mean arterial blood pressure.

The priority given to arterial pressure control is necessary because of the anatomy of the circulatory system. A network of branched arteries delivers to each organ a mean arterial pressure that approximates the mean aortic pressure. Thus, all organs, whether close to or distant from the heart, receive the same mean arterial pressure. Each organ, in turn, controls local blood flow by increasing or decreasing local arteriolar resistance. In Chapter 20, we described these local control mechanisms in a general way, and in Chapter 24, we will discuss specific vascular beds.

The system that we just introduced works because a change in blood flow in one vascular bed does not affect blood flow in other beds-as long as the heart can maintain the mean arterial pressure. However, the circulatory system must keep mean arterial pressure not only constant but also high enough for glomerular filtration to occur in the kidneys or to overcome high tissue pressures in organs such as the eye.

Since Chapter 17, we have regarded the heart as the generator of a constant driving pressure. The principles of the feedback loops that the body uses to control the circulation are similar to those involved in the regulation of many other physiological systems. The short-term regulation of arterial pressure-on a time scale of seconds to minutes-occurs via neural pathways and targets the heart, vessels, and adrenal medulla. This short-term regulation is the topic of the present discussion. The long-term regulation of arterial pressureon a time scale of hours or days-occurs via pathways that target the blood vessels, as well as the kidneys, in their control of extracellular fluid (ECF) volume. This long-term regulation is the topic of the final portion of the chapter.

## Neural reflexes mediate the short-term regulation of mean arterial blood pressure

The neural reflex systems that regulate mean arterial pressure operate as a series of negative-feedback loops. All such loops are composed of the following elements:

1. A detector. A sensor or receptor quantitates the controlled variable and transduces it into an electrical signal that is a measure of the controlled variable.
2. Afferent neural pathways. These convey the message away from the detector, to the central nervous system (CNS).
3. A coordinating center. A control center in the CNS compares the signal detected in the periphery to a set-point, generates an error signal, processes the information, and generates a message that encodes the appropriate response.
4. Efferent neural pathways. These convey the message from the coordinating center to the periphery.
5. Effectors. These elements execute the appropriate response and alter the controlled variable, thereby correcting its deviation from the set-point.

A dual system of sensors and neural reflexes controls mean arterial pressure. The primary sensors are baroreceptors, which are actually stretch receptors or mechanoreceptors that detect distention of the vascular walls. The secondary sensors are chemoreceptors that detect changes in blood $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Na}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH . The control centers are located within the CNS, mostly in the medulla, but sites within the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus also exert control. The effectors include the pacemaker and muscle cells in the heart, the vascular smooth-muscle cells (VSMCs) in arteries and veins, and the adrenal medulla.

We all know from common experience that the CNS influences the circulation. Emotional stress can cause blushing of the skin or an increase in heart rate. Pain-or the stress of your first day in a gross anatomy laboratory-can elicit fainting because of a profound, generalized vasodilation and a decrease in heart rate (i.e., bradycardia).

Early physiologists, such as Claude Bernard, observed that stimulation of peripheral sympathetic nerves causes vasoconstriction and that interruption of the spinal cord in the lower cervical region drastically reduces blood pressure (i.e., produces hypotension). However, the first idea that a reflex might be involved in regulating the cardiovascular system came from experiments in which stimulating a particular sensory (i.e., afferent) nerve caused a change in heart rate and blood pressure. In 1866, Élie de Cyon and Carl Ludwig (5) N23-1 studied the depressor nerve, a branch of the vagus nerve. After they transected this nerve, they found that stimulation of the central (i.e., cranial) end of the cut nerve slows down the heart and produces hypotension. Ewald Hering showed that stimulation of the central end of another cut nerve-the sinus nerve (nerve of Hering), which innervates the carotid sinus-also causes bradycardia and hypotension. These two experiments strongly suggested that the depressor and sinus nerves carry sensory information to the brain and that the brain in some fashion uses this information to control cardiovascular function.

## High-pressure baroreceptors at the carotid sinus and aortic arch are stretch receptors that sense changes in arterial pressure

Corneille Heymans was the first to demonstrate that pressure receptors-called baroreceptors-are located in arteries and are part of a neural feedback mechanism that regulates mean arterial pressure. He found that injection of epinephrinealso known as adrenaline-into a dog raises blood pressure and, later, lowers heart rate. Heymans hypothesized that increased blood pressure stimulates arterial sensors, which send a neural signal to the brain, and that the brain in turn transmits a neural signal to the heart, resulting in bradycardia.

To demonstrate that the posited feedback loop did not depend on the blood-borne traffic of chemicals between the periphery and the CNS, Heymans cross-perfused two dogs so that only nerves connected the head of the dog to the rest of the animal's body. The dog's head received its blood flow from a second animal. (Today, one would use a heart-lung machine to perfuse the head of the first dog.) Heymans found that the vagus nerve carried both the upward and the downward traffic for the reflex arc and that agents carried in the blood played no role. He used a similar approach to demonstrate the role of the peripheral chemoreceptors in the control of respiration (see pp. 710-713). For his work on the neural control of respiration, Heymans received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1938. (6) N23-2

The entire control process, known as the baroreceptor control of arterial pressure (Fig. 23-1), consists of baroreceptors (i.e., the detectors), afferent neuronal pathways, control centers in the medulla, efferent neuronal pathways, and the heart and blood vessels (i.e., the effectors). The negative-feedback loop is designed so that increased mean arterial pressure causes vasodilation and bradycardia, whereas decreased mean arterial pressure causes vasoconstriction and tachycardia (i.e., increased heart rate).

The sensor component consists of a set of mechanoreceptors located at strategic high-pressure sites within the cardiovascular system. As discussed below, the cardiovascular system also has low-pressure sensors that detect changes in venous pressure. The two most important high-pressure loci are the carotid sinus and the aortic arch. Stretching of the vessel walls at either of these sites causes vasodilation and

## Élie de Cyon

Born into a Jewish community in Telsch, Lithuania (then a part of the Russian Empire), not far from the German border, Ila Faddevitch Tsion (1842-1910) -also known as Élie de Cyon (French) or Elias Cyon (English)-was a tragic figure. He studied medicine in Warsaw and Kiev before moving to Berlin, where he received his doctorate in medicine and surgery. After de Cyon joined the Medical-Surgical Academy in St. Petersburg and earned a second doctorate (in medicine) in 1865, the Ministry of Education in Russia sent him to Paris to study physiology, presumably with Claude Bernard. Afterward, de Cyon moved to Leipzig to work with Carl Ludwig. There, he developed the isolated, perfused, working frog heart and with Ludwig discovered the baroreflex. In 1866, de Cyon described the inhibitory effect of the vagus nerve on cardiac muscle. The branch of the vagus that innervates the heart is known as the nerve of LudwigCyon. With his brother M. de Cyon, E. de Cyon in 1867 discovered the nerve that stimulates the heart. E. de Cyon observed, but did not document, the response of the heart to increased filling pressure, thereby anticipating by a few years the FrankStarling mechanism.

In 1867, E. de Cyon again journeyed to St. Petersburg and was professor of physiology at St. Petersburg University from 1868 to 1872. During this time, he was a mentor of and had a major influence on I.P. Pavlov (1849-1936 (6) N42-4), who mastered surgical techniques and began his studies of circulation and digestion with de Cyon. In 1974-against the will of the facultyde Cyon was appointed professor and chair of physiology at the Medical-Surgical Academy of St. Petersburg. However, majority nihilist students demanded de Cyon's removal, chaos erupted, troops were called in, and the academy was closed. de Cyon requested and received a transfer to Leipzig but was dismissed from Russian service in 1875. He received an invitation from

Claude Bernard to move to France, where de Cyon performed his research and obtained his third doctorate. However, after Bernard's death in 1878, de Cyon fell out of favor, left science, and became involved in a wide range of activities, including newspaper work and an effort to unite French and Russian interests against Germany. He moved in high social circles and died in Paris in 1919, never having returned to Russia.

## Carl F. Ludwig

Carl F. Ludwig (1816-1895) was born in Witzenhausen, Germany, and obtained his doctorate in medicine in Marburg in 1839. In 1865 he became the inaugural professor of physiology at Leipzig, a position that he held until his death. Along with a few contemporaries-Helmholtz, Brücke, and Du Bois-ReymondLudwig rejected the view that special biological laws applied to animals, and instead he championed the view that the laws of physics and chemistry applied also to animals-a philosophy necessary for the further development of physiology as a science. Ludwig invented the kymograph for recording changes in blood pressure-the first graphical output in the field of physiology. His research touched many areas of physiology, his institute became a center of physiological research, and he trained a large number of investigators from across Europe. The papers from his institute usually bear only the name of his pupils!

Figure 23-2 Afferent pathways of the high-pressure baroreceptors. In B, the chemoreceptors (i.e., aortic bodies) are located on the underside of the aortic arch as well as-on the right side of the body-at the bifurcation of the right brachiocephalic artery. On the left side of the body, aortic bodies, if present, are in a notch between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery.
bradycardia. The carotid sinus (Fig. 23-2A) is a very distensible portion of the wall of the internal carotid artery located just above the branching of the common carotid artery into the external and internal carotid arteries. The arterial wall at the carotid sinus contains thin lamellae of elastic fibers but very little collagen or smooth muscle. The aortic arch (see Fig. 23-2B) is also a highly compliant portion of the arterial tree that distends during each left ventricular ejection.

The baroreceptors in both the carotid sinus and the aortic arch are the branched and varicose (or coiled) terminals of myelinated and unmyelinated sensory nerve fibers, which are intermeshed within the elastic layers. The terminals express several nonselective cation channels in the TRP family: TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC5. TRPC channels may play a role both as primary electromechanical transducers and as modulators of transduction. An increase
in the transmural pressure difference enlarges the vessel and thereby deforms the receptors. Baroreceptors are not really pressure sensitive but stretch sensitive. Indeed, TRPC1 is stretch sensitive. Direct stretching of the receptor results in increased firing of the baroreceptor's sensory nerve. The difference between stretch sensitivity and pressure sensitivity becomes apparent when one prevents the expansion of the vessel by surrounding the arterial wall with a plaster cast. When this is done, increase of the transmural pressure fails to increase the firing rate of the baroreceptor nerve. Removal of the cast restores the response. Other tissues surrounding the receptors act as a sort of mechanical filter, although much less so than the plaster cast.

As shown by the red records in the upper two panels of Figure 23-3A, a step increase in transmural pressure (i.e., stretch) produces an inward current that depolarizes the

In A, the records refer to hypothetical experiments on a baroreceptor in which one suddenly raises blood pressure to 75 mm Hg (purple) or to 125 mm Hg (red). In B, the records refer to results from the carotid sinus nerve. (Data from Chapleau MW, Abboud FM: Contrasting effects of static and pulsatile pressure on carotid baroreceptor activity in dogs.

receptor, generating a receptor potential (see pp. 353-354). The pressure increase actually causes a biphasic response in the receptor voltage. Following a large initial depolarization (the dynamic component) is a more modest but steady depolarization (the static component). This receptor potential, unlike a regenerative action potential, is a graded response whose amplitude is proportional to the degree of stretch (compare red and purple records).

These sensory neurons are bipolar neurons (see p. 259) whose cell bodies are located in ganglia near the brainstem. The central ends of these neurons project to the medulla. The cell bodies of the aortic baroreceptor neurons, which are located in the nodose ganglion (a sensory ganglion of the vagus nerve), express several TRPC channels.

## Increased arterial pressure raises the firing rate of afferent baroreceptor nerves

If, in the absence of a pressure step, we depolarize the baroreceptor nerve ending, the result is an increase in the frequency of action potentials in the sensory nerve. Therefore, it is not surprising that graded increases in pressure produce graded depolarizations, resulting in graded increases in the spike frequency (see Fig. 23-3A, lower two panels). Graded decreases in pressure gradually diminish receptor activity until the firing falls to vanishingly low frequencies at pressures around 40 to 60 mm Hg . Therefore, the baroreceptor encodes the mechanical response as a frequency-modulated signal.

A step increase in pressure generates a large initial depolarization, accompanied by a transient high-frequency discharge. The smaller steady depolarization is accompanied by a steady but lower spike frequency. Because baroreceptors have both a dynamic and a static response, they are sensitive to both the waveform and the amplitude of a pressure oscillation. Therefore, bursts of action potentials occurring in phase with the cardiac cycle encode information on the pulse pressure (i.e., difference between the peak systolic and lowest diastolic pressures). The static pressureactivity curve in Figure 23-3B—obtained on single units of the sinus nerve-shows that the spike frequency rises sigmoidally with increases in steady blood pressure. The pulsatile pressure-activity curve in Figure 23-3B shows that when the pressure is oscillating, the mean discharge frequency at low mean pressures is higher than when pressure is steady.

Not all arterial receptors have the same properties. As we gradually increase intravascular pressure, different single units in the isolated carotid sinus begin to fire at different static pressures. Thus, the overall baroreceptor response to a pressure increase includes both an increased firing rate of active units and the recruitment of more units, until a saturation level is reached at $\sim 200 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. The carotid sinus in some individuals is unusually sensitive. When wearing a tight collar, such a person may faint just from turning the head because compression or stretching of the carotid sinus orders the medulla to lower blood pressure.

The responses of the receptors in the carotid sinus and the aortic arch are different. In a given individual, a change in the carotid sinus pressure has a greater effect on the systemic arterial pressure than does a change in the aortic pressure. Compared with the carotid sinus receptor, the aortic arch receptor

- has a higher threshold for activating the static response $(\sim 110 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ versus $\sim 50 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$;
- has a higher threshold, likewise, for the dynamic response;

# N23-3 Receptor Potential of Baroreceptors 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

As noted in the text, increased intraluminal pressure (actually an increase tension in the vessel wall) triggers an inward current that generates a depolarization (i.e., receptor potential). The inward current that underlies the receptor potential is not sensitive to blockers of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, but is blocked by $\mathrm{Gd}^{3+}$. The channels inhibited by the $\mathrm{Gd}^{3+}$ may be the mechanoelectrical transducers in baroreceptor nerve endings. TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5, TRPC6, and TRPC7 channels are present in the plasma membrane of the cell bodies of the aortic baroreceptor neurons in the nodose ganglion. Although these channels are stretch sensitive, the cell body presumably is not subject to stretch. On the other hand, TRPC1 and TRPC3 are present in the fine nerve endings of myelinated A-type fibers that are tonically active in the normal range of arterial blood pressures. Thus, these channels could be responsible for sensory transduction. An alternate view is that such TRPC channels may set the sensitivity of the baroreceptor.

On the other hand, several types of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels modulate the sensitivity of the baroreceptor nerve endings to stretch. By patchclamping the cell bodies of the aortic arch baroreceptor neurons, investigators have found that these $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents include $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents ( $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels; see p. 196) and A currents ( Kv channels sensitive to 4-aminopyridine; see pp. 193-196). The various types of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels found at the cell bodies may also be functional at the peripheral sensory endings. Agents that block these $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels cause a sustained depolarization of the baroreceptor endings, decreasing the pressure sensitivity of the baroreceptors, presumably by inactivating other voltage-gated channels.

- continues responding to pressure increases at pressures at which the carotid baroreceptor has already saturated;
- is less sensitive to the rate of pressure change; and
- responds less effectively to a decrease in pressure than to an increase in pressure (over the same pressure range).

Once a change in the arterial pressure has produced a change in the firing rate of the sensory nerve, the signal travels to the medulla. The afferent pathway for the carotid sinus reflex is the sinus nerve, which then joins the glossopharyngeal trunk (cranial nerve [CN] IX; see Fig. 23-2A). The cell bodies of the carotid baroreceptors are located in the petrosal (or inferior) ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve (Fig. 23-4A). The afferent pathways for the aortic arch reflex are sensory fibers in the depressor branch of the vagus nerve (CN X; see Fig. 23-2B). After joining the superior laryngeal nerves, the sensory fibers run cranially to their cell bodies in the nodose (or inferior) ganglion of the vagus (see Fig. 23-4A).

## The medulla coordinates afferent baroreceptor signals

The entire complex of medullary nuclei involved in cardiovascular regulation is called the medullary cardiovascular center. Within this center, broad subdivisions can be distinguished, such as a vasomotor area and a cardioinhibitory area. The medullary cardiovascular center receives all important information from the baroreceptors and is the major coordinating center for cardiovascular homeostasis. 3 N23-4

Most afferent fibers from the two high-pressure baroreceptors project to the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS, from the Latin tractus solitarii [of the solitary tract]; see p. 348), one of which is located on each side of the dorsal medulla (see Fig. 23-4A and B). The neurotransmitter released by the baroreceptor afferents onto the NTS neurons is glutamate, which binds to the GluA2 subunits of AMPA ( $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors (see pp. 323-324 and Fig. 13-15C and D). Some neurons in the NTS (and also in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus; see below) have P2X purinoceptors that are activated by extracellular ATP.

Inhibitory interneurons project from the NTS onto the vasomotor area in the ventrolateral medulla (see Fig. 23-4B). This vasomotor area includes the A1 and C1 areas in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, 3 N23-5 as well as the inferior olivary complex and other nuclei. Stimulation of the neurons in the C1 area produces a vasoconstrictor response. Unless inhibited by output from the NTS interneurons, neurons within the C 1 area produce a tonic output that promotes vasoconstriction. Therefore, an increase in pressure stimulates baroreceptor firing, which, in turn, causes NTS interneurons to inhibit C 1 neurons, resulting in vasodilation. This C1 pathway largely accounts for the vascular component of the baroreceptor reflex. The bursting pattern of C1 neurons is locked to the cardiac cycle.

Excitatory interneurons project from the NTS onto a cardioinhibitory area, which includes the nucleus ambiguus and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (see p. 339). Neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus largely account for the cardiac component of the baroreceptor reflex (i.e., bradycardia). Some inhibitory interneurons
probably project from the NTS onto a cardioacceleratory area, also located in the dorsal medulla. Stimulation of neurons in this area causes heart rate and cardiac contractility to increase.

## The efferent pathways of the baroreceptor response include both sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system

After the medullary cardiovascular center has processed the information from the afferent baroreceptor pathways and integrated it with data coming from other pathways, this center must send signals back to the periphery via efferent (i.e., motor) pathways. The baroreceptor response has two major efferent pathways: the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system.

Sympathetic Efferents As discussed above, increased baroreceptor activity instructs the NTS to inhibit the C 1 (i.e., vasomotor) and cardioacceleratory areas of the medulla. Functionally diverse bulbospinal neurons in both areas send axons down the spinal cord to synapse on and to stimulate preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord. Thus, we can think of these bulbospinal neurons as being presympathetic or prepreganglionic. The synapse can be adrenergic (in the case of the C 1 neurons), peptidergic (e.g., neuropeptide Y), or glutamatergic. The glutamatergic synapses are the most important for the vasomotor response; the released glutamate acts on both NMDA ( $N$-methyl-D-aspartate) and non-NMDA receptors on the preganglionic sympathetic neurons.

The cell bodies of the preganglionic sympathetic neurons are located in the intermediolateral gray matter of the spinal cord, between levels T1 and L3 (see Fig. 14-4). After considerable convergence and divergence, most of the axons from these preganglionic neurons synapse with postganglionic sympathetic neurons located within ganglia of the paravertebral sympathetic chain as well as within prevertebral ganglia (see Fig. 14-2). The neurotransmitter between the preganglionic and postganglionic sympathetic neurons is acetylcholine ( ACh ), which acts at $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs; p. 339). Because of the convergence and divergence, sympathetic output does not distribute according to dermatomes (see p. 339). Postganglionic sympathetic fibers control a wide range of functions (see Fig. 14-4). Those that control blood pressure run with the large blood vessels and innervate both muscular arteries and arterioles and veins.

Increased sympathetic activity produces vasoconstriction. Indeed, the baroreceptor reflex produces vasodilation because it inhibits the tonic stimulatory output of the vasomotor C 1 neurons. Because the bulbospinal neurons synapse with preganglionic sympathetic neurons between T1 and L3, severing of the spinal cord above T1 causes a severe fall in blood pressure. Sectioning of the cord below L3 produces no fall in blood pressure.

Another important target of postganglionic neurons with a cardiovascular mission is the heart. Output from the middle cervical and stellate ganglia, along with that from several upper thoracic ganglia (see Fig. 14-4), ramifies and after extensive convergence and divergence forms the cardiac

# N23-4 Identifying the Medullary Cardiovascular Control Center 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Investigators have established the overall importance of the medullary cardiovascular center in cardiovascular control using a variety of technical approaches:

1. Successive transections of the brain and spinal cord. Transecting the brainstem at the level of the pons does not affect the maintenance of normal blood pressure. However, transecting the medulla below the level of the facial colliculus (see Fig. 23-4A) causes blood pressure to fall. Lower sections produce even deeper drops in pressure, all the way to $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. The lowest pressures occur after transection at the level of the first cervical segment (i.e., spinal shock).
2. Stimulation of the bulbopontine region. Stimulating random cells in the medulla or pons can produce either pressor (i.e., increased blood pressure) or depressor responses. In general, the pressor areas extend more rostrally and more laterally than the depressor areas.
3. Recording from single neurons. Some neurons in medullary nuclei or other medullary areas exhibit electrical activity that is synchronous with the pulse. However, it is difficult to trace the activity of a specific neuron to a specific sensory input (e.g., a specific carotid baroreceptor) or to the control of a specific effector (e.g., the smooth muscle of a particular blood vessel). These recordings have not revealed any somatotopic organization (see pp. 400-401).
4. Labeling of pathways. Following the microinjection of radiolabeled amino acids into neurons of the NTS, the anterograde transport of the label allows tracking of the efferent pathway by autoradiography. Conversely, by exposing the cut central end of the carotid sinus nerve to horseradish peroxidase, it is possible-by exploiting the retrograde transport of the marker-to trace the course of the fibers to the NTS.

## N23-5 The Vasomotor Area

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

The vasomotor area includes the A1 and C1 areas in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, as well as the inferior olivary complex and other nuclei (i.e., the nucleus gigantocellularis lateralis, lateral reticular nucleus, and medullary raphe).

The C1 area also includes some adrenergic neurons, identified by the presence of the enzyme phenylethanolamine- $N$-methyltransferase (see Fig. 13-8C), which converts norepinephrine to epinephrine. Multiple brainstem neurons synapse with C1-area neurons and release ACh, gammaaminobutyric acid, enkephalin, and substance $P$. As we will see on page 544, the antihypertensive agent clonidine acts by binding to imidazole receptors on C1-area neurons.

Some of the baroreceptor afferent fibers project directly to the vasomotor area without interaction with the NTS.

nerves. Thus, severing of the spinal cord above T1 would block the input to the preganglionic sympathetic fibers to the heart. In addition, some preganglionic fibers do not synapse in sympathetic ganglia at all but directly innervate the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla via the splanchnic nerve. These cells release epinephrine, which acts on the heart and blood vessels (see below).

Parasympathetic Efferents As noted above, increased baroreceptor activity instructs the NTS to stimulate neurons in the nucleus ambiguus and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (cardioinhibitory area). The target neurons in these two nuclei are preganglionic parasympathetic fibers of the vagus nerve (CN X) that project to the heart. These efferent vagal fibers follow the common carotid arteries, ultimately synapsing in small ganglia in the walls of the atria. There, they release ACh onto the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-type nAChRs of the postganglionic parasympathetic neurons. The short postganglionic fibers then innervate the sinoatrial (SA) node, the atria, and the ventricles, where they act primarily to slow conduction through the heart (see below).

## The principal effectors in the neural control of arterial pressure are the heart, the arteries, the veins, and the adrenal medulla

The cardiovascular system uses several effector organs to control systemic arterial pressure: the heart, arteries, veins, and adrenal medulla (Fig. 23-5).

Sympathetic Input to the Heart (Cardiac Nerves) The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system influences the heart through the cardiac nerves, which form a plexus near the heart (see Fig. 23-2). The postganglionic fibers, which release norepinephrine, innervate the SA node, atria, and ventricles. Their effect is to increase both heart rate and contractility (Table 23-1). Because it dominates the innervation of the SA node (which is in the right atrium), sympathetic input from the right cardiac nerve has more effect on the heart rate than does input from the left cardiac nerve. On the other hand, sympathetic input from the left cardiac nerve has more effect on contractility. In general, the cardiac nerves do not exert a strong tonic cardioacceleratory influence on the heart. At rest, their firing rate is less than that of the vagus nerve.

Parasympathetic Input to the Heart (Vagus Nerve) The vagus normally exerts an intense tonic, parasympathetic activity on the heart through ACh released by the postganglionic fibers. Severing of the vagus nerve or administration of atropine (which blocks the action of ACh ) increases heart rate. Indeed, experiments on the effects of the vagus on the heart led to the discovery of the first neurohumoral transmitter identified, ACh (see p. 205). Vagal stimulation decreases heart rate by its effect on pacemaker activity (see p. 492). Just as the actions of the right and left cardiac nerves are somewhat different, the right vagus is a more effective inhibitor of the SA node than the left. The left vagus is a more effective inhibitor of conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node. Vagal stimulation, to some extent, also reduces cardiac contractility.

Sympathetic Input to Blood Vessels (Vasoconstrictor Response) The vasoconstrictor sympathetic fibers are disseminated widely throughout the blood vessels of the body. These fibers are most abundant in the kidney and the skin, relatively sparse in the coronary and cerebral vessels, and absent in the placenta. They release norepinephrine, which binds to adrenoceptors on the membrane of VSMCs. In most vascular beds, vasodilation is the result of a decrease in the tonic discharge of the vasoconstrictor sympathetic nerves.

Parasympathetic Input to Blood Vessels (Vasodilator Response) Parasympathetic vasodilator fibers are far less common than sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibers. The parasympathetic vasodilator fibers supply the salivary and some gastrointestinal glands and are also crucial for vasodilation of erectile tissue in the external genitalia (see pp. 1105-1106 and 1127). Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers release ACh, which, as we shall see, indirectly causes vasodilation. In addition, these fibers produce vasodilation by releasing nitric oxide (NO) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (see pp. 346-347).

Sympathetic Input to Blood Vessels in Skeletal Muscle (Vasodilator Response) In addition to the more widespread sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibers, skeletal muscle in nonprimates has a special system of sympathetic fibers that produce vasodilation (see pp. 342-343). (○) N23-6 These special fibers innervate the large precapillary vessels in skeletal muscle. The origin of the sympathetic vasodilator pathway is very different from that of the vasoconstrictor pathway, which receives its instructions-ultimately-from the vasomotor area of the medulla. Instead, the sympathetic vasodilator fibers receive their instructions-ultimately-from neurons in the cerebral cortex, which synapse on other neurons in the hypothalamus or in the mesencephalon. The fibers from these second neurons (analogous to the bulbospinal neurons discussed above) transit through the medulla without interruption and reach the spinal cord. There, these fibers synapse on preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the intermediolateral column, just as do other descending neurons. The vasodilatory preganglionic fibers synapse in the sympathetic ganglia on postganglionic neurons that terminate on VSMCs surrounding skeletal muscle blood vessels. These postganglionic vasodilatory fibers release ACh and perhaps other transmitters.

Therefore, blood vessels within skeletal muscle receive both sympathetic adrenergic and sympathetic cholinergic innervation. The cholinergic system, acting directly via muscarinic receptors (see pp. 341-342), relaxes VSMCs and causes rapid vasodilation. This vasodilation in skeletal muscle occurs in the fight-or-flight response as well as perhaps during the anticipatory response in exercise (see pp. 349350). In both cases, mobilization of the sympathetic vasodilator system is accompanied by extensive activation of the sympathetic division, including cardiac effects (i.e., increased heart rate and contractility) and generalized vasoconstriction of all vascular beds except those in skeletal muscle. (Little vasoconstriction occurs in cerebral and coronary beds, which have sparse sympathetic vasoconstrictor innervation.)

Adrenal Medulla We have already mentioned that some preganglionic sympathetic fibers in the sympathetic splanchnic nerves also innervate the chromaffin cells in the adrenal

From a macroscopic anatomical point of view, there is no doubt that the cholinergic sympathetic nerve endings of sudomotor nerves (i.e., the nerves that cause sweat secretion) and some vasomotor nerves are distal to the sympathetic ganglia. In this sense, these fibers are clearly "postganglionic." Indeed, these rare cholinergic sympathetic fibers run together from the sympathetic ganglion to the target organ together with the majority adrenergic fibers.

From a physiological point of view, all of the sympathetic neurons that reach the adrenal medulla (see p. 343) are "preganglionic." That is, these fibers derive from neuron cell bodies that lie in the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord. Their axons then transit through the paravertebral ganglia of the sympathetic trunk (see the left side of Fig. 14-4) without synapsing, and then follow along the splanchnic nerves. Most of these axons then go directly to the adrenal medulla, where they synapse on their targets, the chromaffin cells. However, some axons transit through the celiac ganglion-again without synapsing-before reaching their target chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Thus, all sympathetic fibers that synapse on chromaffin cells are physiologically "preganglionic": a single neuron carries information from the spinal cord to the target cell. However, the sympathetic neurons that traverse the celiac ganglion before reaching the adrenal medulla could-from a macroscopic anatomical point of view-be regarded as postganglionic.

Authors in the 1960s and 1970s suggested that cholinergic sympathetic fibers that innervate the sweat glands (see pp. 342 and 571) and some of the vascular smooth muscle in skeletal muscle (see p. 539) derive from neuronal cell bodies in the spinal cord. This situation would be analogous to that of the cholinergic sympathetic innervation of the adrenal medulla. If this were true, then one could regard these cholinergic sympathetic sudomotor/ vasomotor fibers-physiologically-as being "preganglionic." However, more recent experiments suggest that these cholinergic sympathetic fibers can arise from neuron cell bodies located in sympathetic ganglia and that these neurons develop from neural crest cells (see p. 539). Using antibodies directed against the vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT, which transports ACh
from the cytoplasm of the nerve terminal into the synaptic vesicles), Schäfer and colleagues demonstrated that VAChTpositive "principal ganglionic cells" (i.e., postganglionic neurons) are present in paravertebral sympathetic ganglia at all levels of the thoracolumbar paravertebral chain. These observations are consistent with the idea that sudomotor nerve fibers and some vasomotor nerve fibers (e.g., skeletal microvasculature) are cholinergic postganglionic sympathetic neurons. These authors also demonstrated VAChT-positive principal ganglionic cells in two other sympathetic ganglia: the stellate and superior cervical ganglia.

Schäfer and colleagues also studied the developmental biology of postganglionic sympathetic neurons. They found that a small minority of sympathetic neurons have a cholinergic phenotype even during early embryonic development-before the neurons innervate sweat glands.

Thus, a true postganglionic sympathetic neuronpostganglionic in both the gross anatomical and the physiological sense of the word-can be cholinergic. In other words, a preganglionic sympathetic "first" neuron, with its cell body in the intermediolateral column, may synapse in a sympathetic ganglion with a postganglionic sympathetic "second" neuron that releases ACh at its nerve terminals. Thus, it is no longer necessary to assume that cholinergic sympathetic sudomotor/vasomotor neurons are, in fact, preganglionic fibers that traversed the sympathetic ganglion without synapsing.

medulla. Therefore, the adrenal medulla is the equivalent of a sympathetic ganglion. The synaptic terminals of the preganglionic fibers release ACh, which acts on $\mathbf{n A C h R s}$ of the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla (see p. 1030). Chromaffin cells are thus modified postganglionic neurons that release their transmitters-epinephrine and, to a far lesser degree, norepinephrine-into the bloodstream rather
than onto a specific end organ. Thus, the adrenal medulla participates as a global effector that through its release of epinephrine causes generalized effects on the circulation. As we will see in the next section, the epinephrine released by the adrenal medulla acts on both the heart and the blood vessels and thereby contributes to the control of the systemic arterial pressure.

## The unique combination of agonists and receptors determines the end response in cardiac and vascular effector cells

Adrenergic Receptors in the Heart The sympathetic output to the heart affects both heart rate and contractility. Norepinephrine, released by the postganglionic sympathetic neurons, acts on postsynaptic $\beta_{1}$-adrenergic receptors of pacemaker cells in the SA node as well as on similar receptors of myocardial cells in the atria and ventricles. The $\beta_{1}$ adrenoceptor, via the G protein $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$, acts via the cAMPprotein kinase A pathway (see p. 57) to phosphorylate multiple effector molecules in both pacemaker cells and cardiac myocytes (see Table 23-1).

In pacemaker cells, $\bigcirc$ N23-7 $\beta_{1}$ agonists stimulate (1) $I_{D}$ the diastolic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current through HCN channels, and (2) $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current through T-type and L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. The net effect of these two changes is an increased rate of diastolic depolarization (i.e., phase 4 of the action potential; see Fig. $21-4 A$ ) and a negative shift in the threshold for the action potential (see pp. 492-493). Because diastole shortens, the heart rate increases.

In myocardial cells, $\beta_{1}$ agonists exert several parallel positive inotropic effects via protein kinase A (Table 23-2). In addition, the activated $\alpha_{2}$ subunit of the G protein can directly activate L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. The net effects of these pathways are contractions that are both stronger (see p. 493) and briefer (see pp. 522-524).

Cholinergic Receptors in the Heart Parasympathetic output to the heart affects heart rate and, to a much lesser extent, contractility. ACh released by postsynaptic parasym-
pathetic neurons binds to $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ muscarinic (i.e., G proteincoupled) receptors on pacemaker cells of the SA node and on ventricular myocytes (see Table 23-1).

In pacemaker cells, ACh acts by three mechanisms. (1) ACh triggers a membrane-delimited signaling pathway mediated not by the G-protein $\alpha$ subunits but rather by the $\beta \gamma$ heterodimers (see p. 56). The newly released $\beta \gamma$ subunits directly open inward-rectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (GIRK1 or Kir3.1) in pacemaker cells (see pp. 197-198). The resulting elevation of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance makes the maximum diastolic potential more negative during phase 4 of the action potential. (2) ACh also decreases $I_{D}$ thereby reducing the rate of diastolic depolarization. (3) ACh decreases $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, thereby both reducing the rate of diastolic depolarization and making the threshold more positive (see p. 492). The net effect is a reduction in heart rate.

In myocardial cells, ACh has a minor negative inotropic effect, which could occur by two mechanisms: (1) Activation of the $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptor, via $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{i}$, inhibits adenylyl cyclase, reducing $\left[\mathrm{cAMP}\right]_{i}$ and thereby counteracting the effects of adrenergic stimulation. (2) Activation of the $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptor, via $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{q}$, stimulates phospholipase C, raising $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and thus stimulating nitric oxide synthase (NOS; pp. 66-67). The newly formed NO stimulates guanylyl cyclase and increases [cGMP] $]_{i}$, which somehow inhibits L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels and decreases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx.

Adrenergic Receptors in Blood Vessels The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system can modulate the tone of vascular smooth muscle in arteries, arterioles, and veins via two distinct routes-postganglionic sympathetic neurons and the adrenal medulla. Whether the net effect of

# N23-7 Action Potential of the Sinoatrial Node 

## Contributed by W. Jonathan Lederer

Figure 21-4A illustrates the phases of the SA node action potential and the underlying currents.

During phase 0 of the action potential, $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ activates regeneratively (see red record in bottom panel of Fig. 21-4A, specifically the rapid downstroke), producing a rapid upstroke of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. Underlying $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ are both T-type and L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels.

At the transition between phases 0 and $3, I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ then begins to inactivate, a feature that begins the repolarization process. Note that phases 1 and 2 are not seen in the SA node because the inactivation of $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ combines with the slow activation of $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ to bring about the phase 3 repolarization of the action potential.

As $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ approaches the maximum diastolic potential at the beginning of phase 4, three slow changes in membrane current take place that underlie phase 4 pacemaker activity:

1. $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ deactivates slowly with time (over hundreds of milliseconds), producing a decreasing outward current (see green record in middle panel of Fig. 21-4A, specifically the slow decline of outward current during phase 4).
2. $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ contributes inward (i.e., depolarizing) current in the following way. Even though $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ has become more negative at the end of phase $3, V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is still positive enough to keep $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ partially activated (albeit to only a small extent) from the previous action potential. Additionally, at the end of phase $3, V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is still negative enough to cause $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ to recover slowly
from inactivation (remember that recovery from inactivation and activation of $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ are independent processes). Thus, as $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ recovers from inactivation over hundreds of milliseconds, there is a small, increasingly inward $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ that tends to depolarize the SA nodal cells during phase 4 (see red record in lower panel of Fig. 21-4A, specifically the slow downstroke of inward current during phase 4).
3. $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ slowly activates as $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ becomes sufficiently negative at the end of phase 3. The result is a slowly growing, inward (i.e., depolarizing) current (see blue record in middle panel of Fig. 21-4A, specifically the rather rapid downstroke of inward current during phase 4).
Thus, during phase 4, the sum of a decreasing outward current $\left(I_{\mathrm{k}}\right)$ and two increasing inward currents $\left(I_{\mathrm{ca}}\right.$ and $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ ) produces the slow pacemaker depolarization associated with the SA node.

As $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ rises from about -65 mV toward the threshold of about -55 mV during the pacemaker depolarization, $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ becomes increasingly activated and eventually becomes regenerative, producing the rapid upstroke of the action potential ... which takes us back to the beginning of this discussion. Note that the turning off of $I_{\mathrm{s}}$ tends to oppose the rapid upstroke of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ during phase 0 . However, the activation of $I_{\mathrm{ca}}$ overwhelms the turning off of $I_{\mathrm{s}}$.

sympathetic stimulation in a particular vessel is vasoconstriction (increased VSMC tone) or vasodilation (decreased VSMC tone) depends on four factors: (1) which agonist is released, (2) which adrenoceptors that agonist binds to, (3) whether receptor occupancy tends to cause vasoconstriction or vasodilation, and (4) which receptor subtypes happen to be present on a particular VSMC.

Which agonist is released is the most straightforward of the factors. Postganglionic sympathetic neurons release norepinephrine, and the adrenal medulla releases primarily epinephrine.

Which receptors the agonist binds to is more complex. Norepinephrine and epinephrine do not have exclusive affinity for a single type of adrenoceptor. The original $\alpha$ and $\beta$ designations followed from the observation that norepinephrine appeared to have its greatest activity on $\alpha$ receptors, and epinephrine, on $\beta$ receptors. However, although norepinephrine binds with a greater affinity to $\alpha$ receptors than to $\beta$ receptors, it also can activate $\beta$ receptors. Similarly, although epinephrine binds with a greater affinity to $\beta$ receptors than to $\alpha$ receptors, it can also activate $\alpha$ receptors. Of course, synthetic agonists may be more specific and potent than either norepinephrine or epinephrine (e.g., the $\alpha$ agonist phenylephrine and $\beta$ agonist isoproterenol). A finer pharmacological and molecular dissection reveals that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ receptors have subgroups (e.g., $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ ), and even the subgroups have subgroups (see pp. 342-343). Each of these many adrenoceptor types has a unique pharmacology. Thus, the $\beta_{1}$ receptor has about the same affinity for epinephrine and norepinephrine, but the $\beta_{2}$ receptor has a higher affinity for epinephrine than for norepinephrine.

Whether receptor occupancy tends to cause vasoconstriction or vasodilation is straightforward (see Table 23-1). The vasoconstriction elicited by catecholamines is an $\alpha$ effect, in particular, an $\alpha_{1}$ effect. Thus, norepinephrine released from nerve terminals acts on the $\alpha_{1}$ adrenoceptor, which is coupled to the G protein $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$. The resulting activation of phospholipase C (see pp. 53-56) and formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ lead to a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, and smoothmuscle contraction (see Table 20-7). In contrast, vasodilation, elicited by epinephrine released from the adrenal medulla, is a $\beta_{2}$ effect. Occupancy of the $\beta_{2}$ adrenoceptor triggers the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway, leading to phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK; p. 247); this reduces the sensitivity of MLCK to the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ calmodulin complex, resulting by default in smooth-muscle relaxation (see Table 20-7).

Which receptor subtypes happen to be present on a particular VSMC is a complex issue. Many blood vessels are populated with a mixture of $\alpha$-receptor or $\beta$-receptor subtypes, each stimulated to varying degrees by norepinephrine and epinephrine. Therefore, the response of the cell depends on the relative dominance of the subtype of receptor present on the cell surface. Fortunately, the only two subtypes in blood vessels that matter clinically are $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$.

The ultimate outcome in the target tissue (vasoconstriction versus vasodilation) depends on both the heterogeneous mixture of agonists (norepinephrine versus epinephrine) applied and the heterogeneous mixture of VSMC receptors ( $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ ) present in tissues. As an example, consider blood vessels in the skin and heart. Because cutaneous blood
vessels have only $\alpha_{1}$ receptors, they can only vasoconstrict, regardless of whether the agonist is norepinephrine or epinephrine. On the other hand, epinephrine causes coronary blood vessels to dilate because they have a greater number of $\beta_{2}$ receptors than $\alpha_{1}$ receptors.

Cholinergic Receptors in or near Blood Vessels The addition of ACh to an isolated VSMC causes contraction. Thus, in an artificial situation in which the nerve terminals release only ACh and in which no other tissues are present, ACh would lead to vasoconstriction. In real life, however, ACh dilates blood vessels by binding to muscarinic receptors on neighboring cells and generating other messengers that indirectly cause vasodilation (see Tables 23-1 and 20-7). For example, in skeletal muscle, ACh may bind to $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptors on the presynaptic membranes of postganglionic sympathetic neurons, decreasing [cAMP], and inhibiting the release of norepinephrine. Thus, inhibition of vasoconstriction produces vasodilation.

In erectile tissue, ACh not only binds to presynaptic $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptors as before, but also binds to $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ receptors on vascular endothelial cells and, via the phospholipase C pathway, releases $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and raises $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ (see Fig. 14-11). The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stimulates NOS to produce NO (see pp. 66-67), which diffuses from the endothelial cell to the VSMC. Inside the VSMC, the NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase, resulting in the production of cGMP and activation of protein kinase G. The subsequent phosphorylation of MLCK causes relaxation (see p. 477).

In salivary glands, N23-8 postganglionic parasympathetic neurons release ACh , which may stimulate gland cells to secrete kallikrein, an enzyme that cleaves kininogens to vasodilating kinins (e.g., bradykinin). A similar paracrine sequence of events may occur in the sweat glands of nonapical skin, where postganglionic sympathetic fibers release ACh , indirectly leading to local vasodilation (see p. 571).

Nonadrenergic, Noncholinergic Receptors in Blood Vessels Postganglionic parasympathetic nerve terminals may cause vasodilation by co-releasing neurotransmitters other than ACh (see Table 23-1), such as NO, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals may cause vasoconstriction by co-releasing neuropeptide Y (NPY). NO of neuronal origin acts in the same way as endothelium-derived NO. NPY acts by lowering [cAMP] $\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{i}}$ VIP and presumably CGRP act by raising [cAMP] $_{i}$ (see Table 20-8).

## The medullary cardiovascular center tonically maintains blood pressure and is under the control of higher brain centers

The medullary cardiovascular center normally exerts its tonic activity on the sympathetic preganglionic neurons, whose cell bodies lie in the thoracolumbar segments of the spinal cord. However, a variety of somatic and visceral afferents also make connections with this efferent pathway in the spinal cord, and such afferents are responsible for several reflexes that occur at the spinal level. The sympathetic preganglionic neurons are normally so dependent on medullary input that they are not very sensitive to local afferents. Rather, these somatic and visceral afferents exert their major

effect by ascending to the medulla and synapsing in the NTS. Nevertheless, some spinal (i.e., segmental) cardiovascular reflexes do exist. For example, the skin blanches in response to both pain and inflammation. These spinal reflexes become most powerful after a spinal transverse lesion.

Neurons of the C1 area of the medulla (see Fig. 23-4) are responsible for maintaining a normal mean arterial pressure. In general, C1 neurons are tonically active and excite sympathetic preganglionic neurons to produce vasoconstriction (see p. 537). The presence of tonically active neurons in the C 1 area raises the possibility that these neurons play a role in some forms of hypertension. Interestingly, clonidine, an antihypertensive agent, acts by binding to imidazole receptors on C 1 area neurons.

Besides the afferents from the baroreceptors, the medullary cardiovascular center receives afferents from respiratory centers and from higher CNS centers, such as the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex (see Fig. 23-5). The hypothalamus integrates many cardiovascular responses. Indeed, one can use a microelectrode to stimulate particular sites in the hypothalamus to reproduce a variety of physiological responses. The dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus in the hypothalamus acts on the rostral ventrolateral medulla (see p. 537) to mediate vasomotor and cardiac responses (e.g., during exercise and acute stress). The cerebral cortex influences the hypothalamic integration areas along both excitatory and inhibitory pathways. Thus, a strong emotion can lead to precipitous hypotension with syncope (i.e., fainting). Conditioned reflexes can also elicit cardiovascular responses. For example, it is possible, by reward conditioning, to train an animal to increase or to decrease its heart rate.

## Secondary neural regulation of arterial blood pressure depends on chemoreceptors

Although baroreceptors are the primary sensors for blood pressure control, a second set of receptors, the peripheral chemoreceptors, also play a role. Whereas input from baroreceptors exerts a negative drive on the medullary vasomotor center, causing vasodilation, the peripheral chemoreceptors exert a positive drive on the vasomotor center, causing vasoconstriction (Fig. 23-6A). As far as the heart is concerned, inputs from both the baroreceptors and the peripheral chemoreceptors exert a positive drive on the cardioinhibitory center; that is, they both decrease heart rate (compare Figs. 23-1 and 23-6A).

The medullary respiratory centers-which include the areas that integrate the input from the peripheral chemoreceptors-strongly influence medullary cardiovascular centers. A fall in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, a rise in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, or a fall in pH stimulates the peripheral chemoreceptors to increase the firing frequency of the afferent nerves to the medulla. In the absence of conflicting input, which we discuss next, the intrinsic response of the medulla to this peripheral chemoreceptor input is to direct efferent pathways to cause vasoconstriction and bradycardia (see Fig. 23-6A). Opposite changes in the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH have the opposite effects.

The peripheral chemoreceptors-whose primary role is to regulate ventilation (see pp. 710-713)-lie close to the baroreceptors. Just as there are two types of high-pressure baroreceptors (i.e., carotid sinus and aortic arch), there are also two types of peripheral chemoreceptors: the carotid

## A INTRINSIC CARDIOVASCULAR RESPONSE

Figure 23-6 Chemoreceptor control of the cardiovascular system. In this example, we assume that a decrease in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, an increase in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, or a decrease in pH is the primary insult (violet box). In $\mathbf{A}$, the bradycardia occurs only when ventilation is fixed or prevented (e.g., breath-holding). In $\mathbf{B}$, the effects of breathing overcome the intrinsic cardiovascular response, producing tachycardia.

bodies and the aortic bodies (compare the location of the baroreceptor and chemoreceptor systems in Fig. 23-2A, B).

Carotid Bodies The carotid body-or glomus caroticumis located between the external and internal carotid arteries. Although the human carotid body is small (i.e., $\sim 1 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$ ), it has an extraordinarily high blood flow per unit mass and a minuscule arteriovenous difference for $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pHputting it in an excellent position to monitor the composition of the arterial blood. The chemosensitive cell in the carotid body is the glomus cell, (○) NZ3-9 which synapses with nerve fibers that join the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). A fall in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, a rise in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, or a fall in the pH increases the spike frequency in the sensory fibers of the afferent sinus nerve.

Aortic Bodies The aortic bodies are situated immediately under the concavity of the aortic arch and in the angle between the right subclavian and carotid arteries. Aortic bodies may also be present at the angle between the left subclavian and common carotid arteries. The aortic glomus cells synapse with nerve fibers that are afferent pathways in the vagus nerve (CN X).

Afferent Fiber Input to the Medulla The most important signal affecting the glomus cells is a low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, which triggers an increase in the firing rate of the sensory fibers. We will discuss ways in which this signal triggers neuronal firing on page 712. Like the afferent fibers from the baroreceptors, the afferent fibers from both the carotid body (CN IX) and the aortic bodies ( CN X ) project to the NTS in the medulla. Indeed, the responses to input from the peripheral chemoreceptors overlap with those to input from the baroreceptors.

Physiological Role of the Peripheral Chemoreceptors in Cardiovascular Control The fluctuations in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ that normally occur in humans are not large enough to affect the blood pressure or heart rate. For the cardiovascular system, the peripheral chemoreceptors play a role only during severe hypoxia (e.g., hemorrhagic hypotension). As already noted, the intrinsic cardiovascular effects of hypoxia on the peripheral chemoreceptors include vasoconstriction and bradycardia (see Fig. 23-6A). However, it is not easy to demonstrate this primary reflex bradycardia; indeed, it is observed only during forced apnea. Under real-life conditions, hypoxia causes tachycardia. Why? Hypoxia-via the peripheral chemoreceptors-normally stimulates the medullary respiratory centers, which in turn stimulate ventilation (see Fig. 23-6B). As discussed below, the high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ that may accompany hypoxia stimulates the central chemoreceptors, and this independently stimulates ventilation. This increased ventilation has two effects. First, it stretches the lungs, which in turn stimulates pulmonary stretch receptors. Afferent impulses from these pulmonary stretch receptors ultimately inhibit the cardioinhibitory center, causing reflex tachycardia. Second, as discussed on pages 679-680, increased alveolar ventilation caused by hypoxia lowers systemic $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, raising the pH of the brain ECF and inhibiting the cardioinhibitory center. Again, the net effect is tachycardia. Thus, the physiological response to hypoxia is tachycardia.

Central Chemoreceptors In addition to peripheral chemoreceptors, central chemoreceptors are present in the medulla (see p. 713). However, in contrast to the peripheral chemoreceptors, which primarily sense a low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, the central chemoreceptors mainly sense a low brain pH , which generally reflects a high arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$.

As already noted (see Fig. 23-4B), tonic baroreceptor input to the NTS in the medulla stimulates inhibitory interneurons that project onto the vasomotor area. This pathway exerts a considerable restraining influence on sympathetic output, which would otherwise cause vasoconstriction. Thus, cutting of these baroreceptor afferents causes vasoconstriction. The central chemoreceptor also influences the vasomotor area. Indeed, a high arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (i.e., low brain pH ), which stimulates the central chemoreceptor, disinhibits the vasomotor area-just as cutting of baroreceptor afferents disinhibits the vasomotor area. The result is also the same: an increase in the sympathetic output and vasoconstriction.

In summary, a low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ acting on the peripheral chemoreceptor and a high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ acting on the central chemoreceptor act in concert to enhance vasoconstriction.

## REGULATION OF CARDIAC OUTPUT

Other things being unchanged, an increased cardiac output raises mean arterial pressure. Therefore, it is not surprising that, as we have just seen, the heart is an important effector organ in the feedback loops that regulate mean arterial pressure. Cardiac output is the product of the heart rate and stroke volume (see Equation 17-6), and both factors are under the dual control of (1) regulatory mechanisms intrinsic to the heart, and (2) neural and hormonal pathways that are extrinsic to the heart.

## Mechanisms intrinsic to the heart modulate both heart rate and stroke volume

Intrinsic Control of Heart Rate As the length of diastole increases, the heart rate necessarily decreases. The diastolic interval is determined by the nature of the action potential fired off by the SA node. Such factors as the maximum diastolic potential, the slope of the diastolic depolarization (phase 4), and the threshold potential all influence the period between one SA node action potential and the next (see Fig. 21-6). Intrinsic modifiers of the SA node pacemaker, such as $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ and $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$, greatly influence the ionic currents responsible for SA node pacemaker activity but are not part of any cardiovascular feedback loops.

Intrinsic Control of Stroke Volume Stroke volume is the difference between end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume (see Equation 22-2). Various processes intrinsic to the heart affect both of these variables.

The end-diastolic volume (EDV) depends on the following:

1. Filling pressure. Ventricular filling pressure depends to a large degree on atrial filling pressure. When increased venous return causes atrial filling pressure to rise, EDV rises as well.

Recent progress on the physiology of glomus cells has largely been a result of the ability to study glomus cells in culture and in the isolated carotid body in vitro.

Regarding the model in Figure 32-11, some controversywhich may reflect species differences-exists about which $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel is the target of hypoxia. Some evidence favors the charybdotoxin-sensitive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. Other data point to a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-insensitive voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel and a voltage-insensitive "resting" $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel.

Although one report (Williams et al, 2004) suggested that hemoxygenase-2 (HO-2) is a universal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ sensor, the results of a later study (Ortega-Sáenz et al, 2006) showed that mice deficient in HO-2 have a normal ability to sense a decrease in $\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]$.

2. Filling time. The longer the filling time, the greater the EDV. As heart rate rises, diastole shortens to a greater extent than does systole, thereby decreasing EDV.
3. Ventricular compliance (reciprocal of the slope of the diastole curve in Fig. 22-12B). As ventricular compliance increases, a given filling pressure will produce a greater increase in ventricular volume, thus resulting in a greater EDV.

The end-systolic volume (ESV) depends on the following:

1. Preload (i.e., end-diastolic volume). According to Starling's law of the heart, increase of the EDV increases the stretch on the cardiac muscle and the force of the contraction (see the systole curve in Fig. 22-12B), and thus the stroke volume. Only at a very large EDV does contraction begin to weaken as the muscle fibers are too stretched to generate maximal power (see Fig. 22-12A).
2. Afterload (force against which the ventricle ejects its contents). The afterload of the left ventricle is the mean systemic arterial pressure; the afterload of the right ventricle is the mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Increased afterload impedes the heart's ability to empty and thereby increases ESV.
3. Heart rate. An increased heart rate leads to greater $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry into myocardial cells, thereby increasing contractility and reducing ESV (see p. 530).
4. Contractility. Positive inotropic agents act by increasing $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ within the myocardial cells (see p. 530), thereby enhancing the force of contraction and decreasing ESV.

Note that a particular variable may affect both EDV and ESV. For example, an increased heart rate decreases EDV and decreases ESV. Therefore, its effect on stroke volumethe difference between these two volumes-may be difficult to predict.

## Mechanisms extrinsic to the heart also modulate heart rate and stroke volume

We have already seen that the sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways are the efferent limbs of the feedback loops that control mean arterial pressure (see Fig. 23-5). These efferent limbs also control cardiac output via heart rate and stroke volume. Because we have already described the anatomy, neurotransmitters, and transduction mechanisms involved in these pathways, we focus here on how these pathways specifically affect the heart rate and stroke volume.

Baroreceptor Regulation Baroreceptor responses affect both heart rate and stroke volume, the product of which is cardiac output. However, baroreceptors do not monitor cardiac output per se but rather arterial pressure. Thus, the baroreceptor response does not correct spontaneous alterations in cardiac output unless they happen to change mean arterial pressure. For example, when an increase in the cardiac output matches a commensurate decrease in the peripheral resistance, leaving the mean arterial pressure unchanged, the baroreceptors do not respond. On the other hand, even if cardiac output is unchanged, it will be the target
of the baroreceptor response if other factors (e.g., changes in peripheral resistance) alter arterial pressure.

Chemoreceptor Regulation In Figure 23-6B, we saw that the integrated response to hypoxia and respiratory acidosis is tachycardia. This tachycardia response turns out to be a very helpful feedback mechanism for maintaining cardiac output. For example, a reduced cardiac output lowers arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, raises $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and lowers pH . These changes stimulate the peripheral chemoreceptors, indirectly producing tachycardia and thereby increasing cardiac output. Thus, the chemoreceptor response corrects changes in blood chemistry that are likely to result from reduced cardiac output. Once again, the detector (i.e., the peripheral chemoreceptor) does not sense changes in the cardiac output per se but rather in the metabolic consequences of altered cardiac output. Changes in cardiac output go unnoticed by the chemoreceptors if they do not affect arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, or pH .

It is fortunate that a high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ increases the heart rate (see Fig. 23-6B) because a high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ has a direct effect on the heart, decreasing myocardial contractility. High $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ leads to intracellular acidosis of the myocardial cells (see pp. 645646). The low pH , shifts the $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$-tension curve of cardiac muscle to higher $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ values, which reflects a lower sensitivity of the cardiac form of troponin C (TNNC1) to $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Thus, in the absence of reflex tachycardia, high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ would decrease myocardial force and thereby lower cardiac output.

## Low-pressure baroreceptors in the atria respond to increased "fullness" of the vascular system, triggering tachycardia, renal vasodilation, and diuresis

The baroreceptors located at high-pressure sites (i.e., the carotid sinus and aortic arch) are not the only stretch receptors involved in feedback regulation of the circulation. Lowpressure baroreceptors-bare ends of myelinated nerve fibers-are located at strategic low-pressure sites, including the pulmonary artery, the junction of the atria with their corresponding veins, the atria themselves, and the ventricles (Fig. 23-7A). Distention of these receptors depends largely on venous return to the heart. Therefore, these mechanoreceptors detect the "fullness" of the circulation and are part of a larger system of volume sensors that control the effective circulating volume of blood (see p. 838). These low-pressure receptors also help control cardiac output. By regulating both effective circulating volume and cardiac output, these receptors also indirectly regulate mean arterial blood pressure.

Atrial Receptors The most extensively studied lowpressure receptors are the atrial receptors. These are located at the ends of afferent axons-either A or B fibers-that join the vagus nerve (CN X). The A fibers fire in synchrony with atrial systole and therefore monitor heart rate (see Fig. 23-7B). The B fibers fire in a burst during ventricular systole (see Fig. 23-7B) and gradually increase their firing rate as the atria fill, reaching maximum firing frequency at the peak of the $v$ wave of the atrial (i.e., jugular) pulse (see Fig. 22-7A). Thus, the B fibers monitor the rising atrial volume. Because the central venous pressure (CVP)-the pressure inside large systemic veins leading to the right heart-is the main

determinant of right atrial filling, the B fibers also detect changes in CVP. By inference, the atrial B-type stretch receptors primarily monitor effective circulating volume and venous return.

The afferent pathways for the low-pressure receptors are similar to those for high-pressure baroreceptors and peripheral chemoreceptors traveling along the vagus nerve and projecting to the NTS (see p. 537) and other nuclei of the medullary cardiovascular center. To some extent, the efferent pathways and effector organs (i.e., heart and blood vessels) also are similar. However, whereas increased stretch of the high-pressure receptors lowers heart rate, increased stretch of the atrial B-type receptors raises heart rate (the Bainbridge reflex, which we discuss in the next section). Moreover, whereas increased stretch of the high-pressure receptors causes generalized vasodilation, increased stretch of the atrial B-type receptors decreases sympathetic vasoconstrictor output only to the kidney. The net effect of increased atrial stretch (i.e., tachycardia and renal vasodilation) is an increase in renal blood flow and-as seen on page 768-an increase in urine output (i.e., diuresis). Decreased atrial stretch has little effect on heart rate but increases sympathetic output to the kidney. Therefore, as far as their direct cardiovascular effects are concerned, the high-pressure baroreceptors respond to stretch (i.e., increased blood pressure) by attempting to decrease blood pressure. The low-pressure baroreceptors respond to stretch (i.e., increased fullness) by attempting to eliminate fluid.

The afferent fibers of the atrial receptors that project to the NTS also synapse there with neurons that project to magnocellular neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (see Fig. 40-8). These hypothalamic neurons synthesize arginine vasopressin (AVP)-also known as antidiuretic hormone (see pp. 817-819)—and then transport
it down their axons to the posterior pituitary for release into the blood (see pp. 979-981). Increased atrial stretch lowers AVP secretion, which produces a water diuresis and thus decreases total body water (see pp. 846-849).

In addition to stimulating bare nerve endings, atrial stretch causes a non-neural response by stretching the atrial myocytes themselves. When stretched, atrial myocytes release atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) or factor (ANF). (T) N3-18 ANP is a powerful vasodilator. It also causes diuresis (see p. 843) and thus enhances the renal excretion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ (i.e., it causes natriuresis). In these ways, it lowers effective circulating volume blood pressure.

Thus, enhanced atrial filling with consequent stretching of the atrial mechanoreceptors promotes diuresis by at least three efferent mechanisms, the first two of which are neurally mediated: (1) Tachycardia in combination with a reduced sympathetic vasoconstrictor output to the kidney increases renal blood flow. (2) Atrial baroreceptors cause decreased secretion of AVP. (3) The stretch of the atrial myocytes themselves enhances the release of ANP.

Ventricular Receptors Stretching of the ventricular lowpressure stretch receptors causes bradycardia and vasodilation, responses similar to those associated with stretching of the arterial high-pressure receptors. However, these ventricular receptors do not contribute appreciably to homeostasis of the cardiac output.

## Cardiac output is roughly proportional to effective circulating blood volume

The Bainbridge reflex is the name given to the tachycardia caused by an increase in venous return. An increase in blood volume leads to increased firing of low-pressure B fibers (see

Fig. 23-7B) during atrial filling. The efferent limb of this Bainbridge reflex is limited to instructions carried by both parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways to the SA node, which determines heart rate. Effects on cardiac contractility and stroke volume are insignificant. Because the Bainbridge reflex saturates, the increase in heart rate is greatest at low baseline heart rates.

The Bainbridge reflex acts as a counterbalance to the baroreceptor reflex in the control of heart rate. The orange curve on the right upper quadrant of Figure 23-8 illustrates the Bainbridge reflex: increase of the effective circulating volume (i.e., increase of venous return and stimulation of low-pressure receptors) increases heart rate. On the other hand, we have already noted that decreased atrial stretch has little effect on heart rate by the Bainbridge reflex. The orange curve in the left upper quadrant of Figure 23-8 illustrates the intervention of the high-pressure baroreceptors. That is, a decrease in blood volume does not cause heart rate to fall but rather causes it to rise. Indeed, a significant reduction in blood volume leads to a fall in mean arterial pressure, reduced baroreceptor firing, and-via the cardioinhibitory and cardioacceleratory areas in the medulla (see Fig.

23-4B)—stimulation of the SA node. Therefore, on examination of the full orange curve in Figure 23-8, we see that changes in blood volume or venous return have a biphasic effect on heart rate. By different mechanisms, volume loading and volume depletion both cause a graded increase in heart rate. In general, during volume loading, the Bainbridge reflex prevails, whereas during volume depletion, the high-pressure baroreceptor reflex dominates. Heart rate is at its minimum when effective circulating volume is normal.

Like heart rate (see Fig. 23-8, orange curve), stroke volume also shows a peculiar, biphasic dependence on effective circulating volume (blue curve) that is the result of two competing effects. In the case of stroke volume, the competitors are Starling's law and the baroreceptor reflex. According to Starling's law, as venous blood volume increases, enhanced ventricular filling increases EDV, thereby improving cardiac performance and thus stroke volume (see pp. 524-526). The Starling relationship reflects the intrinsic properties of the heart muscle. However, in a real person, the baroreceptor reflex has a major influence on the dependence of stroke volume on blood volume. At low blood volumes, the baroreceptor reflex produces high sympathetic output, increasing contractility and steepening the Starling relationship (blue curve in the left lower quadrant of Fig. 23-8). At high blood volumes, the Starling relationship normally tends to be less steep. Moreover, the baroreceptor reflex reduces sympathetic output, thereby decreasing contractility and further flattening the blue curve in the right half of Figure 23-8.

In contrast to the biphasic response of heart rate and stroke volume to changes in effective circulating volume, cardiac output rises monotonically (see Fig. 23-8, red curve). The reason for this smooth increase is that cardiac output is the product of heart rate and stroke volume. Starting from very low blood volumes (see the extreme left of Fig. 23-8), increase in the blood volume causes a gradual rise in stroke volume (blue curve), offset by a fall in heart rate (orange curve), resulting in an overall rise of cardiac output (red curve) until blood volume and stroke volume reach normal levels. Further increases in blood volume have no effect on stroke volume (blue curve) but increase heart rate (orange curve), further increasing cardiac output (red curve). Consequently, the dependence of cardiac output on effective circulating volume ( $\triangle$ N23-10 is the result of the complex interplay among three responses: (1) the Bainbridge reflex, (2) the baroreceptor reflex, and (3) Starling's law.

## MATCHING OF VENOUS RETURN AND CARDIAC OUTPUT

Venous return is the blood flow returning to the heart. Most often, the term is used to mean the systemic venous return, that is, return of blood to the right heart. Because the input of the right heart must equal its output in the steady state, and because the cardiac outputs of the right and left heart are almost exactly the same, the input to the right heart must equal the output of the left heart. Thus, the systemic venous return must match the systemic cardiac output.

# N23-10 Monotonic Dependence of Cardiac Output on Effective Circulating Volume 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

The following is a summary and restatement of the discussion that began on pages 547-548.

Starting from a volume-contracted state (change in effective circulating volume $=\sim 30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ in Fig. 23-8), a gradual increase in effective circulating volume causes the cardiac output to increase monotonically (see Fig. 23-8, lower left portion of red curve) because the rising stroke volume (Starling's law, steepened by baroreceptor response, as indicated by the lower left portion of the blue curve) more than counterbalances the falling heart rate (baroreceptor reflex, as indicated by the falling phase of the orange curve).

Continuing now from a normal volume state (change in effective circulating volume $=0 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ in Fig. 23-8), an additional increase in effective circulating volume causes a further monotonic increase in cardiac output because a rising heart rate (the Bainbridge reflex, as indicated by the rising phase of the orange curve) combines with the flat stroke-volume curve (the Starling relationship-normally flattening at high degrees of stretch-is further flattened by the baroreceptor reflex).

## Increases in cardiac output cause right atrial pressure to fall

The right atrial pressure (RAP) determines the extent of ventricular filling and indeed was the first of the three determinants of EDV discussed above in the chapter. In turn, RAP depends on the venous return of blood to the heart. Imagine that we replace the heart and lungs with a simple pump-with adjustable flow-that delivers blood into the aorta and simultaneously takes it back up from the right atrium (Fig. 23-9A). Using this simple pump, we can study the factors that govern venous return from the peripheral systemic circulation to the right heart by varying flow (the independent variable) while recording RAP (the dependent variable).

We start our experiment with the pump generating a normal cardiac output of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$; the RAP is 2 mm Hg . This situation is represented by point A in Figure 23-9B, which is a plot of RAP versus venous return (i.e., our pump rate). When we reverse the axes, the plot is known as a vascular function curve. Note that we express venous return (i.e., cardiac input) in the same units as cardiac output. We now turn off the pump, a situation analogous to cardiac arrest. For several seconds, blood continues to flow from the arteries and capillaries into the veins because the arterial pressure continues to exceed the venous pressure. Remember that the aortic pressure does not fall to zero during diastole because of the potential energy stored in the elastic recoil of the arterial walls (see Box 22-2). Similarly, after a cardiac arrest, this potential energy continues to push blood to the venous side until all pressures are equal throughout the vascular tree, and flow stops everywhere.

When blood flow finally ceases after a cardiac arrest, the pressures in the arteries, capillaries, veins, and right atrium are uniform. This pressure is called the mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) and is $\sim 7 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (point B in Fig. 23-9B). Why is the MSFP not zero? When you fill an elastic container (e.g., a balloon) with fluid, the pressure inside depends on how much fluid you put in as well as the compliance of the container (see Equation 19-5). In the case of the cardiovascular system, MSFP depends on the blood volume and the overall compliance of the entire vascular system. Now that blood flow has ceased, there is obviously no longer any force (i.e., no $\Delta P$ ) driving the blood from the veins into the pump. Therefore, RAP equals MSFP.

Now, starting with the system at a standstill (point B in Fig. 23-9B), we increase pump rate to some level, measure the steady-state RAP, and repeat this procedure several times at different pump rates. As the pump rate increases, RAP falls (see Fig. 23-9B) because the inflow to the pump draws blood out of the right atrium, the site closest to the inlet of the pump. Because the upstream CVP exceeds RAP, blood flows from the large veins into the right atrium. At a pump rate of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, the RAP falls to about +2 mm Hg , its original value. At even higher pump rates, RAP eventually falls to negative values.

Cardiovascular physiologists usually work with the vascular function curve with the axes reversed from those shown in Figure 23-9B, treating RAP as the independent variable and plotting it on the x -axis (see Fig. 23-9C). As RAP becomes less positive, it provides a greater driving

Figure 23-9 Vascular function. In $\mathbf{A}$, a heart-lung machine replaces the right heart, the pulmonary circulation, and the left heart. We can set the pump flow to predetermined values and examine how cardiac output determines CVP and RAP. $C_{V}$ and $C_{A}$ are vascular compliances. $\mathbf{B}$ shows the dependent variable (RAP) on the $y$-axis, whereas $\mathbf{C}$ shows RAP on the $x$-axis.

pressure (i.e., greater $\Delta P=\mathrm{CVP}-\mathrm{RAP}$ ) for the return of blood from the periphery to the right atrium, as it must for cardiac output to increase. Thus, the cardiac output steadily rises as RAP falls. However, as RAP becomes increasingly negative, the transmural pressure of the large veins becomes negative, so that the large veins feeding blood to the right atrium collapse. No further increment in venous return can occur, even though the driving pressure, $\Delta P$, is increasing. Therefore, the vascular function curve plateaus at negative values of RAP, around -1 mm Hg (see Fig. 23-9C).

Two different theories ( $\$ ) N23-11 attempt to explain the shape of the vascular function curve in Figure 23-9C. One explanation for the curve's steepness emphasizes the high compliance of the venous capacitance vessels; the other focuses on their small viscous resistance. In reality, both compliance and resistance are responsible for the steepness of the vascular function curve.

## Changes in blood volume shift the vascular function curve to different RAPs, whereas changes in arteriolar tone alter the slope of the curve

Because the vascular function curve depends on how full the capacitance vessels are, changing the blood volume affects the vascular function curve. An increase in blood volume (e.g., a transfusion) shifts the curve to the right. In the example in Figure 23-10A, the intercept with the x-axis (i.e., MSFP) moves from 7 to 9 mm Hg , as would be expected if more blood were put into a distensible container, whether it is a balloon or the circulatory system. A decrease in blood volume (e.g., hemorrhage) shifts the curve and the x-intercept to the left. Thus, MSFP increases with transfusion and decreases with hemorrhage. However, changes in blood volume do not affect the slope of the linear portion of the
vascular function curve as long as there is no change in either vessel compliance or resistance.

Change in the venomotor tone, by constriction or dilation of only the veins, is equivalent to change in the blood volume. Returning to our balloon analogy, even if we hold the amount of blood constant, we can increase pressure inside the balloon by increasing the tension in the wall. Because most of the blood volume is in the veins, a pure increase in venomotor tone would be equivalent to a blood transfusion (see Fig. 23-10A). Conversely, a pure decrease in venomotor tone would reduce the tension in the wall of the container, shifting the curve to the left, just as in a hemorrhage.

Change in the tone of the arterioles has a very different effect on the vascular function curve. Because the arterioles contain only a minor fraction of the blood volume, changes in the arteriolar tone have little effect on MSFP and thus on the x-intercept. However, changes in the arteriolar tone can have a marked effect on the CVP, which, along with the RAP, determines the driving force for the venous return. Arteriolar constriction flattens the vascular function curve; arteriolar dilation has the opposite effect (see Fig. 23-10B). We can understand this effect by examining the vertical line through the three curves at an RAP of 2 mm Hg . For the middle or normal curve, the difference between a CVP of, say, 5 mm Hg and an RAP of $2 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\left(\Delta P=\mathrm{CVP}-\mathrm{RAP}=3 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\right)$ produces a venous return of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. Arteriolar constriction might lower the CVP from 5 to 4 mm Hg , thereby reducing $\Delta P$ from 3 to 2 mm Hg . Because the driving pressure $(\Delta P)$ drops to $2 / 3$ of normal, venous return also falls to $2 / 3$ of normal. Thus, arteriolar constriction flattens the vascular function curve. Similarly, arteriolar dilation might raise CVP from 5 to 6 mm Hg , so that the $\Delta P$ increases from 3 to 4 mm Hg , producing a venous return that is $3 / 4$ of normal. Thus, arteriolar dilation steepens the vascular function curve.

Figure 23-10 Effect of changes in blood volume and vasomotor tone on the vascular function curve. The purple curves are the same as the vascular function curve in Figure 23-9C. In B, dilation of the arterioles increases CVP and thus raises the driving force (CVP - RAP) for venous return. Constriction of arterioles has the opposite effects.

# N23-11 How Does Cardiac Output Determine Right Atrial Pressure? 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Imagine that we replace the right heart, the pulmonary circulation, and the left heart with a single pump (see Fig. 23-9A), similar to the heart-lung machine used for cardiopulmonary bypass during open heart surgery. In explaining the shape of the vascularfunction curve in Figure 23-9C, we can stress either that large veins have a high compliance or that they have a low resistance.

## Model of High Venous Compliance

In the high-venous-compliance model, we ignore the small axial pressure gradient along the lumen of the venous reservoir that is a result of the small viscous resistance between the large veins and right atrium. Instead, we assume that the CVP is the same as the RAP and that we can lump the compliance of all largecapacitance veins into a single compliance $\left(C_{s}\right)$. The model in Figure 23-9A has two reservoirs-an aortic and a venous reservoir-separated by the peripheral resistance of the microcirculation. As we noted in our discussion of the "Windkessel" function of the aorta (see Fig. 22-4C), the compliance of the aorta $\left(C_{A}\right)$ is far less than that of the large veins $\left(C_{s}\right)$. During normal pumping of the heart, the aortic pressure $\left(P_{A}\right)$ is much higher than the CVP $\left(P_{A}\right)$. Let us consider what happens immediately after a cardiac arrest. At that moment, $P_{A}$ still exceeds $P_{A}$, and blood continues to flow from the aortic reservoir to the venous reservoir until $P_{A}$ and $P_{s}$ both become equal to MSFP. How much blood volume shifts from the aortic to the venous reservoir depends on the relative compliances of the two reservoirs. For the aorta,

$$
C_{A}=\frac{\Delta V_{A}}{\Delta P_{A}}
$$

and for the veins,

$$
C_{V}=\frac{\Delta V_{A}}{\Delta P_{A}}
$$

$C_{V}$ is $\sim 20$ times larger than $C_{A}$. In the equilibrium state, all the blood lost by the aorta ends up in the veins (i.e., $\Delta V_{V}=-\Delta V_{A}$ ). Therefore, because $C_{V}$ is $\sim 20$ times larger than $C_{A}$, and because the magnitudes of the volume changes are identical, the fall in the aortic pressure $\left(\Delta P_{A}\right)$ must be $\sim 20$-fold greater than the rise in venous pressure $\left(\Delta P_{A}\right)$. Thus, at equilibrium, when all the pressures are the same, we must end up at a pressure (MSFP $=\sim 7 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) that is much closer to the physiological CVP (CVP $=\sim 2 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) than the original mean aortic pressure $\left(P_{A}=\sim 95 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\right)$.

When the heart starts to pump again, it depletes the volume in the highly distensible venous reservoir, so that $P_{A}$ progressively falls to the original steady-state value of 2 mm Hg . At this point, cardiac output and venous return are once again matched.

## Model of Low Venous-Resistance

In the low-venous-resistance model, we ignore the capacitance of the veins, and instead focus on the resistance between the large veins and right atrium. The hydrodynamic equivalent of Ohm's law says that the driving pressure equals flow times resistance:

$$
\Delta P=F \times R
$$

(NE 23-3)
Because the venous return equals $F$, it should depend on the axial pressure gradient ( $\Delta P$ ) between the CVP upstream and the RAP downstream. According to this model, RAP is the force that opposes flow into the atria. Venous return should also depend on the resistance to blood flow between the large systemic (i.e., "central") veins that serve as the blood reservoir, on the one hand, and the right atrium, on the other. This resistance to venous return (RVR) resides mostly in these large-capacitance veins. From Ohm's law, the venous return depends on the CVP, RAP, and RVR:

Cardiac input $=$ Venous return $=\frac{\Delta P}{R}=\frac{C V P-R A P}{R V R}$
(NE 23-4)
RVR is usually considered to be the reciprocal of the slope of the linear portion of the vascular function curve in Figure 23-9C. However, this line is not really a plot of Ohm's law. Ohm's law should be a plot of the venous return versus the driving pressure $(\Delta P)$, as suggested by Equation NE 23-4. Instead, in Figure 23-9C, we plot the venous return versus RAP, which is not quite the same as $\Delta P$. Changes in RAP in Figure 23-9C represent $\Delta P$ only if the "upstream pressure" (i.e., CVP) remains constant, which can only be true over a limited range of flows. The CVP remains constant only as long as sufficient blood is present on the venous side of the circulation. If flow increases too much, not enough blood can enter the veins, CVP falls, and the change in RAP is no longer equal to the change in the driving pressure $\Delta P$. Despite this caveat, cardiovascular physiologists often take the reciprocal of the linear portion of Figure 23-9C as RVR.

According to this model, the negative intravascular pressures at high venous return (i.e., at high cardiac output) cause the large intrathoracic veins to collapse, which effectively increases the RVR to infinity. Hence, the curve plateaus.

## Conclusions

Although both the high-capacitance and low-resistance models provide an intuitive understanding of the vascular function curve in Figure 23-9C, both compliance and viscous resistive properties of the venous system affect the relationship between pressure and flow.

In the preceding analysis, we assumed "pure" changes in blood volume or vessel tone. In real life, things can be more complicated. For example, hemorrhage is typically followed by arteriolar constriction for maintenance of the systemic arterial pressure. Thus, real situations may both shift the x -intercept and change the slope of the vascular function curve.

## Because vascular function and cardiac function depend on each other, cardiac output and venous return match at exactly one value of RAP

Just as there is a vascular function curve, there is also a cardiac function curve that in effect is Starling's law. The classical Starling's law relationship (see Fig. 22-12B), which is valid for both ventricles, is a plot of developed pressure versus EDV. However, we already expressed Starling's law as a cardiac performance curve in Figure 22-12C, plotting stroke work on the $y$-axis and atrial pressure on the $x$-axis. Because stroke work-at a fixed arterial pressure and heart rate-is proportional to cardiac output, we can replace stroke work with cardiac output on the $y$-axis of the cardiac performance curve. The result is the red cardiac function curve in Figure 23-11A. Note that the cardiac function curve is a plot of cardiac output versus RAP, and it has the same units as the vascular function curve. We can plot the two relationships on the same graph (see Fig. 23-11A). However, the y-axis for the cardiac function curve is cardiac output, whereas the $y$-axis for the vascular function curve is venous return. Of course, cardiac output and venous return (i.e., cardiac input) must be the same in the steady state.

We can now ask, Do the cardiac output and venous return depend on RAP? Does RAP depend on the cardiac output and venous return? The answer to both questions is an emphatic yes! They all depend on each other. There is no absolute dependent or independent variable in this closed circuit because, in the steady state, venous return and cardiac output must be equal. Venous return (from the vascular function curve) and cardiac output (from the cardiac function curve) can be equal only at the single point where the two curves intersect (point A in Fig. 23-11A). Only transient and small deviations in these two curves are possible unless either or both of the function curves change in shape.

Imagine what would happen if RAP transiently increased from 2 to 4 mm Hg (see Fig. 23-11A). Starling's law states that the increased ventricular filling initially increases cardiac output from starting point $\mathrm{A}(5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})$ to point $\mathrm{B}(7.3 \mathrm{~L} /$ min ). Simultaneously, the increase in RAP causes a decrease in the driving pressure $\Delta P$ for venous return, that is, the difference CVP - RAP. Thus, the increase in RAP would initially reduce the venous return from point $\mathrm{A}(5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})$ to point $\mathrm{B}^{\prime}(3 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})$. This imbalance between cardiac output and venous return cannot last very long. The transiently elevated cardiac output will have two effects. First, by sucking the right atrium dry, it will tend to lower RAP. Second, by pumping blood out of the heart and toward the veins, it will raise CVP. As a result, the difference CVP - RAP increases, and venous return moves from point $B^{\prime}$ to $C^{\prime}$. Because RAP is lower at point $C^{\prime}$ than at $B^{\prime}$, the cardiac output must also be less at point $C$ than at point $B$. The imbalance between $C$
and $\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$ ( 6.5 versus $4 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ ) is now less than that between B and $\mathrm{B}^{\prime}$ ( 7.3 versus $3 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ ). In this way, venous return gradually increases, cardiac output gradually decreases, and RAP gradually decreases until once again they all come into balance at point A. Thus, the cardiovascular system has an intrinsic mechanism for counteracting small, transient imbalances between cardiac input and output.

The only way to produce a permanent change in cardiac output, venous return, and RAP is to change at least one of the two function curves. The vascular function curve may be any one of a large family of such curves (see Fig. 23-10A, B), depending on the precise blood volume, venomotor tone, and arteriolar tone. Thus, a transfusion of blood shifts the vascular function curve to the right, establishing a new steady-state operating point at a higher RAP (point $\mathrm{A} \rightarrow$ point B in Fig. 23-11B). Similarly, vasodilation would rotate the vascular function curve to a steeper slope, also establishing a new steady-state operating point at a higher RAP.

The cardiac function curve also may be any one of a large family (see Fig. 22-12C), depending on afterload, heart rate, and, above all, the heart's contractile state. Therefore, increasing contractility by adding a cardiac glycoside such as digitalis (see p. 530) shifts the cardiac function curve upward and to the left, establishing another steady-state operating point (point $\mathrm{A} \rightarrow$ point B in Fig. 23-11C). Both physiological and pathological conditions can reset the vascular and cardiac function curves, resulting in a wide range of operating points for the match between venous return and cardiac output.

## INTERMEDIATE- AND LONG-TERM CONTROL OF THE CIRCULATION

In addition to the rapidly acting neural mechanisms that control the total peripheral resistance and cardiac output, humoral controls contribute to the homeostasis of the circulation. In most instances, these control systems operate on a time scale of hours or days, far more slowly than the neurotransmitter-mediated reflex control by the CNS.

Two classes of humoral controls influence the circulation:

1. Vasoactive substances released in the blood, or in the proximity of vascular smooth muscle, modulate the vasomotor tone of arteries and veins, affecting blood pressure and the distribution of blood flow.
2. Nonvasoactive substances, which act on targets other than the cardiovascular system, control the effective circulating volume by modulating ECF volume. By determining the filling of the blood vessels, these nonvasoactive agents also modulate the mean arterial pressure and cardiac output.

## Endocrine and paracrine vasoactive compounds control the circulatory system on an intermediateto long-term basis

Vasoactive substances, both endocrine and paracrine, cause blood vessels to contract or to relax (Table 23-3). In many instances, paracrine control dominates over endocrine control. The chemical messengers controlling the blood vessels can be amines, peptides, or proteins; derivatives of arachidonic acid; or gases such as NO.

Figure 23-11 Matching of cardiac output with venous return. The purple curves are the same as the vascular function curve in Figure 23-9C. The red cardiac function curves represent Starling's law. In A, point $A$ is the single RAP at which venous return and cardiac output match. A transient increase in RAP from 2 to 4 mm Hg causes an initial mismatch between cardiac output (point B) and venous return (point B'), which eventually resolves ( $\mathrm{B}^{\prime} \mathrm{C}^{\prime} \mathrm{A}$ and BCA). In B, permanently increasing blood volume (transfusion) shifts the vascular function curve to the right las in Fig. 23-10/4), so that a match between the cardiac output and venous return now occurs at a higher RAP (point B). In C, permanently increasing cardiac contractility shifts the cardiac function curve upward, so that a match between the cardiac output and the venous return now occurs at a lower RAP (point B).

Biogenic Amines Monoamines may be either vasoconstrictors (epinephrine and serotonin) or vasodilators (histamine).

1. Epinephrine. The source of this hormone is the adrenal medulla (see pp. 1030-1033). Epinephrine binds to $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{1}$ receptors on VSMCs with less affinity than norepinephrine, causing vasoconstriction (see Table 20-7), and with high affinity to $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{2}$ receptors on VSMCs, causing vasodilation (see Table 20-7). Because $\beta_{2}$ receptors are largely confined to the blood vessels of skeletal muscle, the heart, the liver, and the adrenal medulla itself, epinephrine is not a systemic vasodilator. Epinephrine also binds to $\beta_{1}$ receptors in the heart, thereby increasing the heart rate and contractility (see p. 542). For the cardiovascular system, the effects of catecholamines originating from the adrenal medulla are usually minor compared with those of the norepinephrine released from the sympathetic nerve endings.
2. Serotonin. Also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; see Fig. 13-8B), this monoamine is synthesized by serotonergic nerves, enterochromaffin cells, and adrenal chromaffin cells. 5-HT is also present in platelets and mast cells. Serotonin binds to $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}$ and $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~B}}$ receptors on VSMCs, causing vasoconstriction (see Table 20-8). Circulating serotonin is generally not involved in normal systemic control of the circulation but rather in local control. Serotonin is particularly important in vessel damage, where it contributes to hemostasis (see p. 439).
3. Histamine. Like serotonin, histamine (see Fig. 13-8B) may also be present in nerve terminals. In addition, mast cells release histamine in response to tissue injury and inflammation. Histamine binds to $\mathbf{H}_{2}$ receptors on VSMCs, causing vasodilation (see Table 20-8). Although histamine causes vascular smooth muscle to relax, it causes visceral smooth muscle (e.g., bronchial smooth muscle in asthma) to contract.

Peptides Vasoactive peptides may be either vasoconstrictors or vasodilators (see Table 23-3).

1. Angiotensin II (ANG II). Part of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone cascade (see pp. 841-842), ANG II, as its name implies, is a powerful vasoconstrictor. The liver secretes angiotensinogen into the blood. The enzyme renin, released into the blood by the kidney, then converts angiotensinogen to the decapeptide ANG I. Finally, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is present primarily on endothelial cells, particularly those of the lung, cleaves ANG I to the octapeptide ANG II. Aminopeptidases further cleave it to the heptapeptide

ANG III, which is somewhat less vasoactive than ANG II. (○) N23-12

In VSMCs, ANG II binds to G protein-coupled $\mathbf{A T}_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$ receptors, activating phospholipase C, raising $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, and leading to vasoconstriction (see Table 20-8). However, ANG II is normally not present in plasma concentrations high enough to produce systemic vasoconstriction. In contrast, ANG II plays a major role in cardiovascular control during blood loss (see p. 585), exercise, and similar circumstances that reduce renal blood flow. Reduced perfusion pressure in the kidney causes the release of renin (see p. 841). Plasma ANG II levels rise, leading to an intense vasoconstriction in the splanchnic and renal circulations. The resulting reduced renal blood flow leads to even more renin release and higher ANG II levels, a dangerous positive-feedback system that can lead to acute renal failure. A widely studied model of hypertension that demonstrates the importance of this mechanism is the Goldblatt model for hypertension (Box 23-1).

ANG II has a range of other effects-besides direct vasoactive effects-that indirectly increase mean arterial pressure: (1) ANG II increases cardiac contractility. (2) It reduces renal plasma flow, thereby enhancing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the kidney. (3) As discussed in the next section, ANG II and ANG III also stimulate the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone. (4) In the CNS, ANG II stimulates thirst and leads to the release of another vasoconstrictor, AVP. (5) ANG II facilitates the release of norepinephrine by postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals. (6) Finally, ANG II also acts as a cardiac growth factor (see Box 22-3).
2. Arginine vasopressin (AVP). The posterior pituitary releases AVP, also known as antidiuretic hormone. AVP binds to $\mathbf{V}_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$ receptors on VSMCs, causing vasoconstriction (see Table 20-8), but only at concentrations higher than those that are strongly antidiuretic (see pp. 817819). Hemorrhagic shock causes enhanced AVP release and a vasoconstriction that contributes to a transient restoration of arterial pressure (see pp. 584-585).
3. Endothelins (ETs). Endothelial cells produce ETs (see pp. 461-463) that bind to $\mathbf{E T}_{\mathbf{A}}$ receptors on VSMCs, causing vasoconstriction (see Table 20-8). Although, on a molar basis, ETs are the most powerful vasoconstrictors, it is not clear whether these paracrine agents play a dominant role in overall blood pressure homeostasis.
4. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP or ANF). Released from atrial myocytes in response to stretch (see p. 547), this 28-amino-acid peptide binds to ANP receptor A (NPR1) on VSMCs, which is membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase, causing vasodilation (see Table 20-8). Although ANP lowers blood pressure, its role in the overall regulation of mean arterial pressure is doubtful. Because ANP also has powerful diuretic and natriuretic actions, it ultimately reduces plasma volume and therefore blood pressure. (○) N22-13
5. Kinins. At least three different kinins exist: (1) the nonapeptide bradykinin, which is formed in plasma; (2) the decapeptide lysyl-bradykinin, which is liberated from tissues; and (3) methionyl-lysyl-bradykinin, which is present in the urine. These kinins are produced by the breakdown of kininogens, catalyzed by

# N23-12 Metabolism of the Angiotensins 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The liver synthesizes and releases into the blood the $\alpha_{2}$-globulin angiotensinogen (Agt), which is a plasma glycoprotein that consists of 452 amino acids. Its molecular weight ranges from 52 to 60 kDa , depending on the degree of glycosylation. Angiotensinogen belongs to the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) superfamily of proteins, which also includes antithrombin III (see p. 446 as well as Tables 18-4 and 18-5). The liver contains only small stores of angiotensinogen, which it constitutively secretes. Production by the liver is greatly increased during the acutephase response (see Box 18-1). Angiotensinogen is synthesized in several tissues other than liver. In addition to the 52- to 60-kDa form of angiotensinogen, a high-molecular-weight (HMW) angiotensinogen complex of 450 to 500 kDa is also present in plasma. Polymorphisms within the angiotensinogen gene may contribute to normal variations in arterial blood pressure and a tendency to develop hypertension.

The juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney-also called granular cells (see p. 727)—are specialized smooth-muscle cells of the afferent arteriole that synthesize and release both the glycoprotein renin (molecular weight 37 to 40 kDa )-pronounced ree-nin-and its inactive precursor prorenin, which is the major circulating form. Prorenin-activating enzymes on endothelial cells convert this prorenin to renin. The kidney is the major source of circulating prorenin/renin, and the liver is responsible for removing renin from the circulation. The half-life of renin in plasma is 10 to 20 minutes. Renin is an aspartyl proteinase that cleaves a leucine-valine bond near the amino ( N ) terminus of angiotensinogen to release a decapeptide called angiotensin I (ANG I), which is not biologically active. By an alternative pathway, nonrenin proteases can also produce ANG I. The full sequence of ANG I is Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu:

Agt: N-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Val-Ile-His ...
Ser-Thr-Ala-C
$\downarrow$ Renin
ANG I: N-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-C
(NE 23-5)
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; molecular weight $\sim 200 \mathrm{kDa}$ ) is produced by and attached to endothelial cells. ACE is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (a zinc peptidase) that cleaves ANG I by removing the carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) dipeptide histidine-leucine and producing the octapeptide angiotensin II (ANG II). The ACE cleavage site is a phenylalanine-histidine bond. The sequence of ANG II is Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe:

ANG I: N-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-C
$\downarrow$ ACE
ANG II: N-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-C
(NE 23-6)

ANG II has a half-life in blood of 1 to 3 minutes, indicating that a large fraction is removed in a single pass through the circulation. ANG II acts on G protein-coupled receptors known as $\mathbf{A T}_{\mathbf{1}}$ and $\mathbf{A T}_{\mathbf{2}}$. In addition, two other receptors are less well characterized: AT3 and AT4. ANG IV (see below) can bind to AT4 receptors.

By an alternative pathway, non-ACE proteases can also convert ANG I to ANG II. Conversely, note that ANG I is not a specific substrate for ACE, which can cleave other peptides, including bradykinin (see pp. 553-554), enkephalins, and substance $P$.

Aminopeptidase A (also called angiotensinase A, or glutamyl aminopeptidase) further cleaves the aspartate-arginine bond on ANG II to produce the heptapeptide angiotensin III (ANG III, also called ANG-(2-8)), which has the sequence Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe. Ang III, like ANG II, can also bind to AT receptors.

Aminopeptidase B (also called angiotensinase B, or arginyl aminopeptidase) finally cleaves an arginine-valine bond on ANG III to produce the hexapeptide angiotensin IV (ANG IV, also called ANG-(3-8)). The sequence of ANG IV is Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe. This metabolite is inactive.

Finally, another ANG metabolite has received attention in recent years. ANG-(1-7) consists only of the first seven amino acids of ANG I*: Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro. This heptapeptide can arise from ANG I by at least three routes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { ANG I } \xrightarrow{\text { ACE }} \text { ANG II } \xrightarrow{\text { ACE2 }} \text { ANG-(1-7) } \\
& \text { or } \\
& \text { ANG I } \xrightarrow{\text { N23 }} \text { ANG-(1-7) } \\
& \text { or } \\
& \text { ANG I } \xrightarrow{\text { ACE2 }} \text { ANG-(1-9) } \xrightarrow{\text { ACE }} \text { ANG-(1-7) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that, by the above nomenclature, ANG I is ANG-(1-10), and ANG II is ANG-(1-8). The first and third pathways involve a new enzyme called ACE2. The second is catalyzed by any in a family of enzymes called neutral endopeptidases (NEPs). ANG-(1-7) can bind to a G protein-coupled receptor called the Mas receptor and-when acting on the cardiovascular system-can elicit effects opposite those of ANG II.

# N23-13 Crosstalk Between Atrial Natriuretic Peptide and Endothelin 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) is also involved in an intriguing feedback loop involving endothelin. ANP stimulates endothelin formation by endothelial cells, but endothelin is itself a secretagogue for the atrial myocytes, causing them to release ANP. Thus, a vasodilator (ANP) promotes the release of a vasoconstrictor (ET), which in turn promotes the release of the original vasodilator.

## BOX 23-1 Hypertension

Hypertension is found in $\sim 20 \%$ of the adult population. It can damage endothelial cells, producing a number of proliferative responses, including arteriosclerosis. In the long term, hypertension can lead to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and renal failure. In the great majority of cases, hypertension is the result of dysfunction of the mechanisms used by the circulation for the long-term rather than short-term control of arterial pressure. In fact, chronically hypertensive patients may have diminished sensitivity of their arterial baroreceptors.

Most people with an elevated blood pressure have "primary hypertension," in which it is not possible to identify a single, specific cause. Renal artery stenosis, which compromises renal blood flow, is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. An experimental equivalent of renal artery stenosis is the "one-clip two-kidney" model of hypertension first described by Goldblatt (see Box 40-2). This model does not explain most cases of hypertension, but it does give us our best description of the pathophysiological mechanism involved in at least some patients with elevated blood pressure. The most common cause of renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of the renal artery by atherosclerotic plaque. Fibromuscular disease of the renal arterial wall can also be responsible, usually in young women, as can any space-occupying lesion (e.g., metastatic cancer or benign cysts). If the stenosis is removed by angioplasty or surgery, and if preliminary test results show that the stenosis is the likely cause of the elevation in blood pressure, then a significant percentage of such patients will experience resolution of their hypertension.

The cumulative obstruction of smaller arteries and arterioles may also produce hypertension, as is often seen in diseases of the renal parenchyma or any end-stage renal disease. Conversely, constriction of larger vessels proximal to the kidneys can also cause hypertension, as is the case with coarctation of the aorta, a congenital malformation that constricts flow through the aorta to the lower parts of the body. Another cause of secondary hypertension is chronic volume overload. Volume overload can be acquired, such as in primary aldosteronism (caused by either a benign adenoma or bilateral hyperplasia) and pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal medulla that releases excessive amounts of catecholamines into the circulation). Volume overload can be genetic, as in rare mendelian forms of hypertension such as Liddle disease
D N23-14 and pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2.
kallikreins-enzymes that are present in plasma and in tissues such as the salivary glands, pancreas, sweat glands, intestine, and kidney. Kallikreins form in the blood from the following cascade: Plasmin acts on clotting factor XII, releasing fragments with proteolytic activity. These factor XII fragments convert an inactive precursor, prekallikrein, to kallikreins. The kinins formed by the action of these kallikreins are eliminated by the kininases (kininase I and II). Kininase II is the same as ACE. Thus, the same enzyme (ACE) that generates a vasoconstrictor (ANG II) also disposes of vasodilators (bradykinin). Bradykinin binds to B2 receptors on endothelial cells, causing release of NO and prostaglandins and thereby vasodilation (see Table 20-8). Like histamine, the kinins relax vascular smooth muscle but contract visceral smooth muscle.

Prostaglandins Many tissues synthesize prostaglandins, derivatives of arachidonic acid (see pp. 61-62). Prostacyclin (prostaglandin $\mathrm{I}_{2}\left[\mathrm{PGI}_{2}\right]$ ) binds to prostanoid IP receptors on VSMCs, causing strong vasodilation (see Table 20-8). $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ binds to prostanoid $\mathrm{EP}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{EP}_{4}$ receptors on VSMCs, also causing vasodilation (see Table 20-8). It is doubtful that prostaglandins play a role in systemic vascular control. In veins and also in some arteries, arachidonic acid or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ionophores cause endothelium-dependent contractions. Because cyclooxygenase inhibitors prevent this vasoconstrictor response, venous endothelial cells probably metabolize arachidonic acid into a vasoconstrictive cyclooxygenase product, presumably thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$.

Nitric Oxide Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) produces NO from arginine in endothelial cells (see p. 480). NO activates the soluble guanylyl cyclase in VSMCs, causing vasodilation (see Table 20-8). Although NO is a powerful paracrine vasodilator, it is not clear that it plays an important role in overall blood pressure homeostasis.

## Pathways for the renal control of ECF volume are the primary long-term regulators of mean arterial pressure

The volume of the ECF includes both the blood plasma and the interstitial fluid. The small solutes in the plasma and interstitial fluid exchange freely across the capillary wall, so that the entire ECF constitutes a single osmotic compartment. Because the plasma volume is a more or less constant fraction ( $\sim 20 \%$ ) of the ECF volume, changes in the ECF volume produce proportional changes in plasma volume. Thus, assuming that the compliance of the vasculature is constant (see Equation 19-5), such an increase in plasma volume will lead to an increase in transmural blood pressure.

We saw in Chapter 20 that the Starling forces across a capillary (i.e., the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressure differences) determine the traffic of fluid between the plasma and the interstitial fluid (see p. 471). Thus, alterations in the Starling forces acting across the capillary wall can affect the plasma volume and therefore blood pressure.

Because of the importance of the ECF volume and Starling forces in determining the plasma volume, one might expect that the body would have specific sensors for ECF volume, interstitial fluid volume, and blood volume. However, the parameter that the body controls in the intermediate- and long-term regulation of the mean arterial pressure is none of these but rather a more vague parameter termed the effective circulating volume. The effective circulating volume is not an anatomical volume but the functional blood volume that reflects the extent of tissue perfusion, as sensed by the fullness or pressure in the vessels. The control mechanisms that defend effective circulating volume include the two classes of stretch receptors described in this chapter. First, the highpressure receptors in the carotid sinus and aorta (see pp. 534-536) do double duty. In the short term, these baroreceptors regulate blood pressure by their direct cardiovascular effects, as was already discussed. In the longer term, they regulate effective circulating volume. Second, the lowpressure receptors-located in the pulmonary artery, the junction of the atria with their corresponding veins, the atria

# N23-14 Liddle Disease 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Liddle disease is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the $\beta$ or $\gamma$ subunit of the epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel ENaC. For example, the critical regions in the $\beta$ subunit are critical for endocytosis or proteasomal degradation of the channel. Thus, mutations result in an overabundance of ENaC at the apical membrane, resulting in excessive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, an increase in effective circulating volume, and hypertension. The disease is readily diagnosed by determining whether the hypertension is reversed by the drug amiloride, which antagonizes ENaC. Indeed, amiloride is an effective therapy for Liddle disease.

For a description of ENaC, see Table 6-2, family No. 14.

themselves, and the ventricles (see pp. 546-547)—regulate effective circulating volume by direct and indirect effects on the cardiovascular system. In addition to these already familiar receptors involved in neural control of the circulation, other sensors monitor effective circulating volume (see Table 40-2): the baroreceptors in the renal artery, the stretch receptors in the liver, and the atrial myocytes themselves as well as-to some extent-osmoreceptors in the CNS.

As we will see in Chapter 40, these sensors of effective circulating volume send signals to the dominant effector organ-the kidney-to change the rate of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion in the urine. These signals to the kidney follow four parallel effector pathways (see p. 834): (1) the renin-ANG

II-aldosterone axis, (2) the autonomic nervous system, (3) the posterior pituitary that releases AVP, and (4) the atrial myocytes that release ANP. Of these four parallel pathways, the most important is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. By regulating total body $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$content, the kidney determines ECF volume. Therefore, the kidney ultimately governs the blood volume and is thus the principal agent in the long-term control of mean arterial pressure.

# SPECIAL CIRCULATIONS 

Steven S. Segal

In the preceding chapters, we considered blood flow to peripheral capillary beds as if the "periphery" were a single entity. In this chapter, we break that entity down into some of its component parts. Because each organ in the body has its own unique set of requirements, special circulations within each organ have evolved with their own particular features and regulatory mechanisms. Especially for times of great stress to the body, each organ possesses circulatory adaptations that allow it to make the changes appropriate for causing minimal harm to the overall organism. Here, we focus on the circulations of the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, abdominal viscera, and skin. Elsewhere we discuss other special circulations in the context of particular organs-the lungs (see pp. 683-689), the kidneys (see pp. 745-750), the placenta (see pp. 1136-1139), and the fetal circulation (see pp. 1157-1158).

## The blood flow to individual organs must vary to meet the needs of the particular organ, as well as of the whole body

The blood flow to each tissue must meet the nutritional needs of that tissue's parenchymal cells, while at the same time allowing those cells to play their role in the homeostasis of the whole individual. The way in which the circulatory system distributes blood flow must be flexible so that changing demands can be met. In the process of meeting these demands, the body makes compromises. Consider the circulatory changes that accompany exercise. Blood flow to active skeletal muscle increases tremendously through both an increase in and a redistribution of cardiac output. Blood flow to the coronary circulation must also rise to meet the demands of exercise. Furthermore, in order to dispose of the heat generated during exercise, the vessels in the skin dilate, thereby promoting heat transfer to the environment. As cardiac output is increasingly directed to active muscle and skin, circulation to the splanchnic and renal circulations decreases, while blood flow to the brain is preserved.

This chapter focuses on the perfusion of select systemic vascular beds, but keep in mind that the lungs receive the entire cardiac output and therefore must also be able to accommodate any changes in total blood flow.

## Neural, myogenic, metabolic, and endothelial mechanisms control regional blood flow

Several mechanisms govern vascular resistance and thus the distribution of blood circulating throughout the body. The
interplay among neural, myogenic, metabolic, and endothelial mechanisms establishes a resting level of vasomotor tone. The extent to which a particular vascular bed depends on a particular blood-flow-control mechanism varies from organ to organ. We have discussed the following four mechanisms in the preceding chapters, and briefly review them here.

Neural Mechanisms The resistance vessels of nearly every organ are invested with fibers of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), particularly those of the sympathetic division (see pp. 542-543). In addition to playing a critical role in controlling blood pressure and cardiac output, the ANS modulates local blood flow to meet the needs of particular tissues.

Myogenic Mechanisms Many vessels, particularly the muscular arteries and arterioles that govern vascular resistance, are inherently responsive to changes in transmural pressure. Increased pressure and the accompanying stretch of vascular smooth-muscle cells (VSMCs) elicit vasoconstriction (see pp. 477-478), whereas decreased pressure elicits vasodilation. This myogenic response plays an important role in the autoregulation (see p. 481) that occurs in the vessels of the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidneys.

Metabolic Mechanisms Throughout the body, the vessels that govern blood flow are sensitive to the local metabolic needs of parenchymal cells. Table 20-9 lists several changes that act synergistically to increase local blood flow. For example, a decrease in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IV}}$ or pH promotes relaxation of VSMCs, thereby causing vasodilation. In response to activity, excitable cells raise extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentration $\left(\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}\right)$, which also causes vasodilation. Tissues with high energy demandssuch as the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle during exerciserely heavily on such local control mechanisms.

Endothelial Mechanisms Endothelial cells release a variety of vasoactive substances (see Table 20-10). For example, the shear stress exerted by the movement of blood through the vessel lumen stimulates the release of nitric oxide (NO), which relaxes VSMCs and prevents leukocyte adhesion. Endothelial cells and VSMCs also use gap junctions for electrical and chemical signaling between themselves, thereby coordinating their activity during blood flow control.

In addition to the previous mechanisms, which are part of a sophisticated feedback control system, other factorswhich are not regulatory in nature-can affect the local

circulation. These other factors are all mechanical forces that are external to the blood vessels and that tend to either to collapse or to open them. For example, in the heart (see p. 517) and skeletal muscle (see p. 517), muscle contraction transiently halts blood flow by compressing blood vessels within the tissue.

## THE BRAIN

## Anastomoses at the circle of Willis and among the branches of distributing arteries protect the blood supply to the brain, which is $\sim 15 \%$ of resting cardiac output

The brain accounts for only $\sim 2 \%$ of the body's weight, yet it receives $\sim 15 \%$ of the resting cardiac output. Of all the organs in the body, the brain is the least tolerant of ischemia. It depends entirely on oxidative sources of energy production. Each day, the human brain oxidizes $\sim 100 \mathrm{~g}$ of glucose, (7) N24-1 which is roughly equivalent to the amount stored as glycogen in the liver. Interruption of cerebral blood flow for just a few seconds causes unconsciousness. If ischemia persists for even a few minutes, irreversible cellular damage is likely.

Arteries Blood reaches the brain through four source arteries-the two internal carotid arteries and the two vertebral arteries (Fig. 24-1). The vertebral arteries join to form the basilar artery, which then splits to form the two posterior cerebral arteries, which in turn are part of the circle of Willis at the base of the brain. The internal carotid arteries are the major source of blood to the circle. Three bilateral pairs of distributing arteries (anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries) arise from the circle of Willis to envelop the cerebral hemispheres. Smaller branches from the vertebral and basilar arteries distribute blood to the brainstem and cerebellum. The distributing arteries give rise to pial arteries that course over the surface of the brain, forming anastomoses, and then branch again into arterioles that penetrate the tissue at right angles to the brain surface. These penetrating arterioles branch centripetally to give rise to capillaries. The anastomoses on the cortical surface provide the collateral circulation that is so important should a distributing artery or one of its branches become occluded. Each of the four source arteries tends to supply the brain region closest to where the source artery joins the circle of Willis. If a stenosis develops in one source artery, other source arteries to the circle of Willis can provide alternative flow. Nevertheless, if flow through a carotid artery becomes severely restricted (e.g., with atherosclerotic plaque), ischemia may occur in the ipsilateral hemisphere, with impairment of function.

Veins The veins of the brain are wide, thin-walled structures that are nearly devoid of VSMCs and have no valves. In general, the veins drain the brain radially, in a centrifugal direction. The intracerebral veins converge into a superficial pial plexus lying under the arteries. The plexus drains into collecting veins, which course over the distributing arteries and empty into the dural sinuses (see Fig. 11-1B). The exception to this radial pattern is the deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and basal ganglia; these regions

# N24-1 Brain Metabolism 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As noted in Chapter 11 (see pp. 275 and 288), the brain has rather limited glycogen stores ( $\sim 10 \%$ of the amount stored in the liver), and virtually all of these stores are in the astrocytes, which have mechanisms for transferring the energy to the neurons. As noted in the text on page 557, the glucose consumption by the brain alone is capable of exhausting the liver's entire store of glycogen in only 1 day. When food is not eaten for $>24$ hours, the brain must either rely on glucose derived from gluconeogenesis (largely from the breakdown of muscle protein) or utilize an alternative fuel. For example, as levels of ketone bodies rise in the bloodstream during fasting, the enzymes required for their oxidation are induced in brain cells, thereby enabling an alternative substrate for energy production and conserving lean body mass.

The text addresses related issues in three locations: (1) on page 557, (2) on page 287 (see Fig. 11-10), and (3) in Chapter 58 on metabolism.

drain centrally into veins that course along the walls of the lateral ventricles to form a deep venous system, which also empties into the dural sinuses. Nearly all of the venous blood from the brain leaves the cranium by way of the internal jugular vein. (5) N24-2

Capillaries One of the most characteristic features of the brain vasculature is the blood-brain barrier (see pp. 284287), which prevents the solutes in the lumen of the capillaries from having direct access to the brain extracellular fluid (BECF). For this reason, many drugs that act on other organs or vascular beds have no effect on the brain. Polar and water-soluble compounds cross the blood-brain barrier slowly, and the ability of proteins to cross the barrier is extremely limited. Only water, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (or other gases) can readily diffuse across the cerebral capillaries. Glucose crosses more slowly via facilitated diffusion. No substance is entirely excluded from the brain; the critical variable is the rate of transfer. The blood-brain barrier protects the brain from abrupt changes in the composition of arterial blood. In a similar manner, a blood-testis barrier protects the germinal epithelia in males. The blood-brain barrier may become damaged in regions of the brain that are injured, infected, or occupied by tumors. Such damage can be helpful in identifying the location of tumors because tracers that are excluded from healthy central nervous system (CNS) tissue can enter the tumor. In specialized areas of the brain-the circumventricular organs (see pp. 284-285)-the capillaries are fenestrated and have permeability characteristics similar to those of capillaries in the intestinal circulation.

Lymphatics The brain lacks lymphatic vessels.

Vascular Volume The skull encloses all of the cerebral vasculature, along with the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid compartments. Because the rigid cranium has a fixed total volume, vasodilation and an increase in vascular volume in one region of the brain must be met by reciprocal volume changes elsewhere within the cranium. Precise control of the cerebral blood volume is essential for preventing elevation of the intracranial pressure. With cerebral edema or hemorrhage, or with the growth of a brain tumor, neurological dysfunction can result from the restriction of blood flow due to vascular compression. An analogous situation can occur in the eyes of patients with glaucoma (see pp. 360-361). Pressure buildup within the eye compresses the optic nerve and retinal artery, and blindness can result from the damage caused by diminished blood flow to the retinal cells.

## Neural, metabolic, and myogenic mechanisms control blood flow to the brain

Cerebral blood flow averages $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ for each 100 g of brain tissue and, because of autoregulation, is relatively constant. Nevertheless, regional changes in blood distribution occur in response to changing patterns of neuronal activity (Fig. 24-2).

Neural Control Sympathetic nerve fibers supplying the brain vasculature originate from postganglionic neurons in the superior cervical ganglia and travel with the internal carotid and vertebral arteries into the skull, branching with the arterial supply. The sympathetic nerve terminals release norepinephrine, which causes contraction of
![bo17585266204](bo17585266204.jpg)

Figure 24-2 Changes in regional blood flow in the brain. The investigators used the washout of ${ }^{135} \mathrm{Xe}$ (see p. 426), measured with detectors placed over the side of the patient's head, as an index of regional blood flow in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. The turquoise "hot spots" represent regions where blood flow is $>20 \%$ above mean blood flow for the entire brain. At rest, blood flow is greatest in the frontal and premotor regions. The patterns of blood flow change in characteristic ways with the seven other forms of cerebral activity shown. (Data from Ingvar DH: Functional landscapes of the dominant hemisphere. Brain Res 107:181-197, 1976.)

# N24-2 Emissary Veins 

## Contributed by Steve Segal

The emissary veins traverse the skull, carrying blood from the sinuses (e.g., superior sagittal sinus), which are surrounded by the dura mater inside the skull, to branches of the superficial temporal veins that are external to the skull. The emissary veins are typically responsible for little venous drainage from the brain.

VSMCs. Parasympathetic innervation of the cerebral vessels arises from branches of the facial nerve; these nerve fibers elicit a modest vasodilation when activated. The cerebral vessels are also supplied with sensory nerves, whose cell bodies are located in the trigeminal ganglia and whose sensory processes contain substance P and calcitonin generelated peptide, both of which are vasodilatory neurotransmitters. Local perturbations (e.g., changes in pressure or chemistry) may stimulate the sensory nerve endings to release these vasodilators, an example of an axon reflex (see p. 571). 5 N24-3

Despite this innervation, neural control of the cerebral vasculature is relatively weak. Instead, it is the local metabolic requirements of the brain cells that primarily govern vasomotor activity in the brain.

Metabolic Control Neural activity leads to ATP breakdown and to the local production and release of adenosine, a potent vasodilator. A local increase in brain metabolism also lowers $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ while raising $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and lowering pH in the nearby BECF. These changes trigger vasodilation and thus a compensatory increase in blood flow. Cerebral VSMCs relax mainly in response to low extracellular pH ; these cells are insensitive to increased $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ per se, and decreased intracellular pH actually causes a weak vasoconstriction.

How does brain blood flow respond to systemic changes in pH ? Lowering of arterial pH at a constant $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (metabolic acidosis; see p. 635) has little effect on cerebral blood flow because arterial $\mathrm{H}^{+}$cannot easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier and therefore does not readily reach cerebral VSMCs. On the other hand, lowering of arterial pH by an increase in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (respiratory acidosis; see p. 633) rapidly leads to a fall in the pH around VSMCs because $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. This fall in pH of the BECF evokes pronounced dilation of the cerebral vasculature, with an increase in blood flow that occurs within seconds. The rise in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ caused by inhalation of $7 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can cause cerebral blood flow to double. Conversely, the fall in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ caused by hyperventilation raises the pH of the BECF, producing cerebral vasoconstriction, decreased blood flow, and dizziness. Clinically, hyperventilation is used to lower cerebral blood flow in the emergency treatment of acute cerebral edema and glaucoma.

A fall in the blood and tissue $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$-from hypoxemia or impaired cardiac output-may also contribute to cerebral vasodilation, although the effects are less dramatic than those produced by arterial hypercapnia. The vasodilatory effects of hypoxia may be direct or may be mediated by release of adenosine, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, or NO into the BECF. 5 N24-4

Myogenic Control Cerebral resistance vessels are inherently responsive to changes in their transmural pressure. Increases in pressure lead to vasoconstriction, whereas decreases in pressure produce vasodilation.

## The neurovascular unit matches blood flow to local brain activity

Neurons, glia, and cerebral blood vessels function as an integrated unit to distribute cerebral blood flow according to
local activity within the brain (see Fig. 24-2). This "neurovascular coupling" involves several signaling pathways that complement the metabolic control discussed above. Some neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are vasoactive (e.g., acetylcholine, catecholamines, and neuropeptides) and can control blood vessels in the region of synaptic activity. The endfeet of astrocytes (see Fig. 11-6A) come into direct contact with the smooth muscle penetrating arterioles and the endothelial cells of capillaries. The release of neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) from neurons initiates $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ waves in astrocytes as well as in dendrites of adjacent neurons. These $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ waves stimulate the release of powerful vasodilators, including NO and metabolites of arachidonic acid. Thus, synaptic activity generates vasoactive mediators in neurons and astrocytes that can produce vasodilation. Concurrent activation of local interneurons with vascular projections helps to focus the vasomotor response. The vasodilator signal conducts through gap junctions from cell to cell along the endothelium and smooth-muscle cells of penetrating arterioles, retrograde to the pial arteries, which are a major part of vascular resistance. This reduction in proximal resistance directs increased blood flow to the region of increased neural activity.

## Autoregulation maintains a fairly constant cerebral blood flow across a broad range of perfusion pressures

The perfusion pressure to the brain is the difference between the systemic arterial pressure (mean pressure, $\sim 95 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) and intracranial venous pressure, which is nearly equal to the intracranial pressure ( $<10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ). A decrease in cerebral blood flow could thus result from a fall in arterial pressure or a rise in intracranial (or venous) pressure. However, the local control of cerebral blood flow maintains a nearly constant blood flow through perfusion pressures ranging from $\sim 70$ to 150 mm Hg . This constancy of blood flowautoregulation (see p. 481)—maintains a continuous supply of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and nutrients. In patients with hypertension, the cerebral blood flow remains normal because cerebral vascular resistance increases. Conversely, vascular resistance falls with hypotension. This autoregulation of blood flow has both myogenic and metabolic components.

Increases in intracranial pressure compress the brain vasculature and tend to reduce blood flow despite autoregulatory vasodilation. In such cases, the brain regulates its blood flow by inducing reflexive changes in systemic arterial pressure. This principle is exemplified by the Cushing reflex, an increase in arterial pressure that occurs in response to an increase in intracranial pressure. It appears that intracranial compression causes a local ischemia that stimulates vasomotor centers in the medulla. Increased sympathetic nerve activity in the systemic circulation then triggers a rise in total peripheral resistance. The Cushing reflex may occur acutely with the swelling that follows a head injury or more gradually with growth of a brain tumor. Over a considerable pressure range, the Cushing reflex ensures that the perfusion pressure can offset the effects of vascular compression and thereby maintain the constancy of cerebral blood flow.

## N24-3 Axon Reflex

## Contributed by George Richerson

Axon reflexes are thought to occur when a nerve ending is depolarized by local factors (e.g., irritation, pressure, seizures, altered pH , high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{i}$, or other chemical signals), triggering an action potential that travels anterograde along the axon to a branch point, where the action potential propagates back down another branch. Thus, an axon reflex is a local reflex arc that involves only the distal/peripheral part of a motor or sensory neuron.

In the case of a motor neuron, the stimulus would trigger an action potential that would move retrograde up the fiber to the branch point and then orthograde down to a terminal that would release its normal complement of neurotransmitters. Of course, when responding to its normal "central" stimuli, this motor neuron would function in the usual orthograde fashion.

In the case of a sensory fiber, the stimulus would travel orthograde along the axon to a branch point and then travel retrograde to other nerve endings. If these endings have release machinery, they could activate an effector. Varicosities on sensory fibers may contain substance $P(S P)$ and calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), which the processes release in response to a local stimulus. Both SP and CGRP are vasodilatory neurotransmitters.

Another example of an afferent fiber that can release a neurotransmitter is the cranial nerve IX sensory neurons that innervate the glomus cells of the carotid body. As pointed out on pages 710-712, this is an example of a bidirectional synapse. The glomus cells can trigger an action potential in the sensory neuron, and the sensory neuron can apparently release neurotransmitters that may modulate the glomus cell.

Axon reflexes can also occur in neurons of the CNS-for example, from one part of the cortex to another.

## N24-4 Vasodilatory Effect of Hypoxia in the Brain

## Contributed by Steve Segal, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

A fall in the blood and tissue $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{II}_{2}}$-from hypoxemia or impaired blood flow to the brain-may also contribute to vasodilation in the brain, although the effects are less dramatic than those produced by arterial hypercapnia. Several mediators may underlie the effect of hypoxia:

1. Adenosine. Levels of adenosine increase with hypoxia, reflecting the breakdown of ATP. Virtually any condition that increases brain $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption will result in adenosine production and release within seconds. Because adenosine is a potent vasodilator (see Tables 20-8 and 20-9), increased adenosine levels tend to enhance blood flow and correct the hypoxia.
2. High $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$. Hypoxia, seizures, and electrical stimulation all elevate $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$in the BECF. Increased $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{i}$ leads to vasodilation (see Table 20-9; 0 N24-6), which in turn tends to wash away the excess $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Thus, elevated $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{i}$ may be involved only in the early portion of a hyperemic response.
3. NO. Both brain vascular endothelial cells and neurons contain nitric oxide synthase (see pp. 66-67 and 480) and thus can generate the highly permeable NO, which readily dilates the brain's resistance vessels.
4. Direct effects of low $\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{II}_{2}}$. A mechanism receiving increasing attention is the effect of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ on the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ conductance of the VSMC membrane: a fall in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{II}_{2}}$ increases $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance, promoting VSMC relaxation.

## THE HEART

## The coronary circulation receives $5 \%$ of the resting cardiac output from the left heart and mostly returns it to the right heart

The heart receives $\sim 5 \%$ of the resting cardiac output, although it represents $<0.5 \%$ of total body weight. The heart normally uses oxidative phosphorylation to generate the ATP required to pump blood. However, of all the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that the heart consumes, no more than $40 \%$ reflects the oxidation of carbohydrate. More than $60 \%$ of myocardial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption in the fasting state is due to the oxidation of fatty acids. The myocardium readily oxidizes ketone bodies (see p. 1185), which can provide considerable energy during starvation or during diabetic ketoacidosis. When the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ supply is adequate, the heart takes up and oxidizes both lactate and pyruvate, as do red (i.e., oxidative) skeletal muscle fibers, although the arterial concentration of pyruvate is usually low. When the energetic demand for ATP exceeds the supply of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, the heart can no longer take up lactate, but instead releases lactate by breaking down its own glycogen stores. In this manner, the heart can continue to function for a short time when it is deprived of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. If hypoxia develops in the myocardium, nociceptive fibers trigger the sensation of referred pain, known as angina pectoris. More severe or prolonged insults damage the myocardial tissue, which eventually becomes necrotic-myocardial infarction.

The entire blood supply to the myocardium derives from the right and left coronary arteries, which originate at the root of the aorta behind the cusps of the aortic valves (Fig. 24-3). Although the anatomy is subject to individual variation, the right coronary artery generally supplies the right ventricle and atrium, and the left coronary artery supplies
the left ventricle and atrium. The left coronary artery divides near its origin into two principal branches: The left circumflex artery sends branches to the left atrium and ventricle, and the left anterior descending artery descends to the apex of the heart and branches to supply the interventricular septum and a portion of the right as well as the left ventricle. These arteries course over the heart, branching into segments that penetrate into the tissue and dividing into capillary networks. Capillary density in histological sections of the human heart exceeds 3000 per square millimeter (skeletal muscle has only $\sim 400$ per square millimeter). The small diameter of cardiac muscle fibers ( $<20 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ), less than half that of skeletal muscle ( $\sim 50 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ), facilitates $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion into the cardiac myocytes, which have a high energetic demand.

Once blood passes through the capillaries, it collects in venules, which drain outward from the myocardium to converge into the epicardial veins. These veins empty into the right atrium via the coronary sinus. Other vascular channels drain directly into the cardiac chambers. These include the thebesian veins, which drain capillary beds within the ventricular wall. Because the deoxygenated blood carried by the thebesian veins exits predominantly into the ventricles, this blood flow bypasses the pulmonary circulation. Numerous collateral vessels among branches of the arterial vessels and throughout the venous system act as anastomoses; these provide alternative routes for blood flow should a primary vessel become occluded.

## Extravascular compression impairs coronary blood flow during systole

In other systemic vascular beds, blood flow roughly parallels the pressure profile in the aorta, rising in systole and falling in diastole (see Fig. 22-3). However, in the coronary
![bo17685266204](bo17685266204.jpg)

Figure 24-3 Heart and coronary circulation. AV, atrioventricular; SA, sinoatrial.

![bo17785266204](bo17785266204.jpg)

Figure 24-4 Coronary blood flow cycle. Bands at the beginning of systole and diastole reflect isovolumetric contraction and relaxation, respectively.
circulation, flow is somewhat paradoxical: Although the heart is the source of its own perfusion pressure, myocardial contraction effectively compresses the heart's own vascular supply. Therefore, the profile of blood flow through the coronary arteries depends on both the perfusion pressure in the aorta (Fig. 24-4, top panel) and the extravascular compression resulting from the contracting ventricles, particularly the left ventricle.

Blood flow in the left coronary artery may actually reverse transiently in early systole (see Fig. 24-4, middle panel) because the force of the left ventricle's isovolumetric contraction compresses the left coronary vessels and the aortic pressure has not yet begun to rise (i.e., aortic valve is still closed). As aortic pressure increases later during systole, coronary blood flow increases, but never reaches peak values. However, early during diastole, when the relaxed ventricles no longer compress the left coronary vessels and aortic pressure is still high, left coronary flow rises rapidly to extremely high levels. All told, $\sim 80 \%$ of total left coronary blood flow occurs during diastole.

In contrast, the profile of flow through the right coronary artery (see Fig. 24-4, lower panel) is very similar to the pressure profile of its feed vessel, the aorta. Here, systole contributes a greater proportion of the total flow, and systolic reversal does not occur. The reason for this difference is the lower wall tension developed by the right heart, which pumps against the low resistance of the pulmonary circulation and does not occlude the right coronary vessels during contraction.

The impact of systolic contraction on the perfusion of the left coronary vessels is highlighted by the effect of ventricular fibrillation (see Fig. 21-14I). At the onset of
this lethal arrhythmia, left coronary perfusion transiently increases, reflecting the loss of mechanical compression of the vasculature.

Changes in heart rate, because they affect the duration of diastole more than that of systole, also affect coronary flow. During tachycardia, the fraction of the cardiac cycle spent in diastole decreases, minimizing the time available for maximal left coronary perfusion. If the heart is healthy, the coronary vessels can adequately dilate in response to the metabolic signals generated by increased cardiac work, which offsets the negative effects of the shorter diastole. On the other hand, a high heart rate can be dangerous when severe coronary artery disease restricts blood flow. (5) N24-5

Coronary blood flow not only varies in time during the cardiac cycle, it also varies with depth in the wall of the heart. Blood flows to cardiac myocytes through arteries that penetrate from the epicardium toward the endocardium. During systole, the intramuscular pressure is greatest near the endocardium and least near the epicardium. All things being equal, the perfusion of the endocardium would therefore be less than that of the epicardium. However, total blood flows to the endocardial and epicardial halves are approximately equal because the endocardium has a lower intrinsic vascular resistance, and thus a greater blood flow during diastole. When the diastolic pressure at the root of the aorta is pathologically low (e.g., with aortic regurgitation) or coronary arterial resistance is high (e.g., with coronary artery occlusion), endocardial blood flow falls below the epicardial flow. Thus, the inner wall of the left ventricle often experiences the greatest damage with atherosclerotic heart disease.

## Myocardial blood flow parallels myocardial metabolism

A striking feature of the coronary circulation is the nearly linear correspondence between myocardial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption and myocardial blood flow. This relationship persists in isolated heart preparations, emphasizing that metabolic signals are the principal determinants of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to the myocardium. In a resting individual, each 100 g of heart tissue receives 60 to $70 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of blood flow. Normally, the heart extracts $70 \%$ to $80 \%$ of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of arterial blood (normally $\sim 20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ blood), so that the venous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content is extremely low ( $\sim 5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Therefore, the myocardium cannot respond to increased metabolic demands by extracting much more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ than it already does when the individual is at rest. The heart can meet large increases in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ demand only by increasing coronary blood flow, which can exceed $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ per 100 g with exercise.

Because blood pressure normally varies within fairly narrow limits, the only way to substantially increase blood flow through the coronary circulation during exercise is by vasodilation. The heart relies primarily on metabolic mechanisms to increase the caliber of its coronary vessels. Adenosine has received particular emphasis in this regard. An increased metabolic activity of the heart, an insufficient coronary blood flow, or a fall in myocardial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ results in adenosine release. Adenosine then diffuses to the VSMCs, activating purinergic receptors to induce vasodilation by lowering $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ (see Table 20-8). Thus, inadequate perfusion to a region of the myocardium would elevate interstitial

# N24-5 Adverse Effects of Tachycardia on Left Coronary Perfusion 

## Contributed by Steve Segal and Emile Boulpaep

As shown in Figure 24-4, most of the blood flow to the left coronary artery occurs during diastole. During bradycardia, a greater proportion of time is spent in diastole. Although this effect promotes left coronary blood flow, the total requirement for blood flow falls. During tachycardia, the diastolic interval shortens relatively more than the systolic interval. Thus, if we were to sum up all the diastolic intervals that occur over the course of a minute, we would see that less total time is available for left coronary perfusion during diastole-even though the metabolic requirements of the left ventricle are much higher during tachycardia.

adenosine levels, causing vasodilation and restoration of flow to the affected region.

When cardiac work increases, contracting myocytes release $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, resulting in a transient rise in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ that may contribute to the initial increase in coronary perfusion (see Table 20-9). However, it is unlikely that $\mathrm{K}^{+}$mediates sustained elevations in blood flow. When the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ demand of cardiac myocytes exceeds $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ supply, a rise in the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and a fall in the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ may also lower coronary vascular resistance and thereby increase local $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery.

Coronary blood flow is relatively stable between perfusion pressures of $\sim 70 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ and $>150 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Thus, like that of the brain, the blood flow to the heart exhibits autoregulation. In addition to the myogenic response, fluctuations in adenosine and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ contribute to coronary autoregulation.

## Although sympathetic stimulation directly constricts coronary vessels, accompanying metabolic effects predominate, producing an overall vasodilation

Sympathetic nerves course throughout the heart, following the arterial supply. Stimulation of these nerves causes the heart to beat more frequently and more forcefully. $\beta_{1}$ adrenoceptors on the cardiac myocytes mediate these chronotropic and inotropic responses. As discussed in the preceding section, the increased metabolic work of the myocardium leads to coronary vasodilation via metabolic pathways. However, during pharmacological inhibition of the $\beta_{1}$ receptors, which prevents the increase in metabolism, sympathetic nerve stimulation causes a coronary vasoconstriction. This response is the direct effect of sympathetic nerve activity on $\alpha$ adrenoceptors on the VSMCs of the coronary resistance vessels. Thus, blocking of $\beta_{1}$ receptors "unmasks" adrenergic vasoconstriction. However, under normal circumstances (i.e., no $\beta$ blockade), the tendency of the metabolic pathways to vasodilate far overwhelms the tendency of the sympathetic pathways to vasoconstrict.

Activation of the vagus nerve has only a mild vasodilatory effect on the coronary resistance vessels. This muted response is not due to insensitivity of the resistance vessels to acetylcholine, which elicits a pronounced vasodilation when it is administered directly. Rather, the release of acetylcholine from the vagus nerve is restricted to the vicinity of the sinoatrial node. Thus, the vagus nerve has a much greater effect on heart rate than on coronary resistance.

## Collateral vessel growth can provide blood flow to ischemic regions

When a coronary artery or one of its primary branches becomes abruptly occluded, ischemia can produce necrosis (i.e., a myocardial infarct) in the region deprived of blood flow. However, if a coronary artery narrows gradually over time, collateral blood vessels may develop and ameliorate the reduced delivery of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and nutrients to the compromised area, preventing or at least diminishing tissue damage. Collateral vessels originate from existing vessel branches that undergo remodeling with the proliferation of endothelial and smooth-muscle cells. Stimuli for collateral development
include angiogenic molecules (see pp. 481-482) released from the ischemic tissue and changes in mechanical stress in the walls of vessels supplying the affected region.

## Vasodilator drugs may compromise myocardial flow through "coronary steal"

A variety of drugs can promote vasodilation of the coronary arteries. These are typically prescribed for patients with angina pectoris, the chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart (see p. 564). If the buildup of atherosclerotic plaque-which underlies angina pectoris-occurs in the large epicardial arteries, the increased resistance lowers the pressure in the downstream microvessels. Under such conditions, the physician should be cautious in using pharmacological agents to dilate the coronary vessels: In an ischemic area of the myocardium downstream from a stenosis, metabolic stimuli may have already maximally dilated the arterioles. Administration of a vasodilator can then increase the diameter of blood vessels only in nonischemic vascular beds that are parallel to the ischemic ones, which thereby decreases the pressure at the branch point, upstream from the stenosis. The result is coronary steal. When vasodilator therapy relieves angina, the favorable result is more likely attributable to the vasodilation of the noncoronary systemic vessels, which reduces peripheral resistance, thereby reducing the afterload during systole and thus the work of the heart.

## THE SKELETAL MUSCLE

Perhaps the most impressive characteristic of the blood flow to skeletal muscle is its extreme range. Muscle blood flow at rest is 5 to $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ for each 100 g of tissue. With maximal aerobic exercise, it may increase 50 -fold, reaching $250 \mathrm{~mL} /$ min or more for each 100 g of active muscle. The linear correspondence among work rate, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption, and muscle blood flow implies a "coupling" between muscle fiber activity and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to capillaries. We discuss muscle blood flow during exercise beginning on page 1214. Here we discuss the key features of the organization of the skeletal muscle vasculature and the integration of its blood flow control mechanisms.

## A microvascular unit is the capillary bed supplied by a single terminal arteriole

The vascular supply to skeletal muscle begins externally to the tissue in the feed arteries. These muscular vessels are the last branches of the arterial supply, located just before entry into the tissue. As much as $30 \%$ to $50 \%$ of the total resistance to blood flow of skeletal muscle resides in these feed arteries. Therefore, an important site of blood flow control is located proximally to the microvessels within the tissue that are in direct contact with skeletal muscle fibers.

The arteriolar network originates from the site at which a feed artery enters the muscle. Within the muscle, arterioles branch through several orders (Fig. 24-5A) until reaching the terminal arterioles (see Fig. 24-5B), which are the last

![bo17885266204](bo17885266204.jpg)

Figure 24-5 Microvascular units in skeletal muscle. A, A feed artery branches into primary arterioles, which, after two more orders of branching, give rise to transverse arterioles; the latter, in turn, give rise to terminal arterioles. B, The terminal arteriole supplies a "microvascular unit" ( $<1 \mathrm{~mm}$ in length).
branches to contain smooth muscle and, therefore, the last branches still able to control blood flow. Thus, the terminal arteriole is the functional equivalent of the precapillary sphincter (see p. 461). The group of capillaries supplied by a terminal arteriole represents one microvascular unit, which is the smallest functional unit of blood flow control in skeletal muscle. Each unit consists of 15 to 20 capillaries that run parallel to the muscle fibers in each direction, for a distance of $\leq 1 \mathrm{~mm}$, ending in a collecting venule.

Owing to the profound differences in length between capillaries ( $\leq 1 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) and muscle fibers (centimeters), many microvascular units are required to span the distance of each muscle fiber. When a muscle fiber contracts, blood flow must increase throughout all of the microvascular units that supply that fiber to provide $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and to remove metabolites (Box 24-1).

## Metabolites released by active muscle trigger vasodilation and an increase in blood flow

When skeletal muscle is at rest, its vascular resistance is high, blood flow is low, and the venous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content is only a few milliliters per deciliter lower than the arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content. As exercise begins, the terminal arterioles (those closest to the capillaries) dilate first. This vasodilation increases blood flow through capillaries that are already flowing with blood and opens up previously unperfused capillaries, thus increasing the number of perfused capillaries and thereby decreasing the effective intercapillary distance (see Fig. 20-4B, C). Even before total blood flow increases very much, the greater demand of active muscle fibers for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ produces a large increase in the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction ratio (see p. 464). As metabolic demand continues to increase, additional $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery is required.

The vasculature meets increased metabolic demand by progressively dilating the more proximal arteriolar branches and feed arteries. Thus, vasodilation "ascends" the resistance network as metabolic demand increases. A coordinated vasodilation throughout the resistance network is essential when segments having substantial resistance are organized in series with each other. Dilation of the downstream arterioles, without dilation of the proximal arterioles and feed arteries, would result in only a limited ability to increase muscle blood flow because of the high resistance of upstream vessels. Thus, when feed arteries dilate in concert with arterioles, the increase in muscle blood flow is profound.

The primary stimulus triggering vasodilation is the release of vasodilator substances (e.g., adenosine, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, \mathrm{~K}^{+}$) from active muscle fibers in proportion to the energy expenditure. These metabolites diffuse locally and-acting either directly

# BOX 24-1 Treating Coronary Artery Disease 

$\Gamma$or many patients with gradual narrowing of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaque, the first sign of disease may be the development of angina pectoris. Pain results when the metabolic demands of a region of myocardium exceed the ability of the compromised blood supply to satisfy those needs. Attacks of angina are often accompanied by characteristic changes on the electrocardiogram. If the diagnosis is in doubtthe chest pain of angina can sometimes be mimicked by gastroesophageal reflux, hyperventilation, costochondritis, and other clinical entities-an exercise test may stress the heart sufficiently to bring on the pain, to induce electrocardiographic changes, or to alter coronary blood flow as monitored by thallium scanning (see p. 426). Some patients with significant coronary artery narrowing never experience angina and are said to have silent ischemia. In these patients, only an astute clinician may detect the coronary disease.

Many patients with a stable anginal pattern respond well to medication. Nitrates induce vasodilation by releasing NO (see p. 67). The nitrates dilate peripheral veins, reducing venous return and thus the preload to the heart (see p. 526); they also dilate the arteries and arterioles, reducing blood pressure and therefore the afterload. Finally, nitrates may increase coronary collateral flow to the involved region of myocardium (however, see discussion of coronary steal on p. 562). Beta blockers prevent the sympathetic nervous system from stimulating myocardial $\beta_{1}$ receptors, thereby reducing both heart rate and contractility. Calcium channel blockers lessen the contractility of the heart
muscle and the vascular smooth muscle. These interventions all reduce the metabolic demands of the heart.

In patients for whom medication cannot control the angina, or who develop a pattern of unstable angina with an increasing frequency and severity of anginal attacks, mechanical revascularization may be required. For a long time, the only option was coronary artery bypass grafting, but nowadays percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty may often be successful. A cardiologist can perform this procedure at the same time as a diagnostic coronary artery catheterization. The physician advances a balloon-tipped catheter through a peripheral artery into the left ventricle and then loops the catheter back out the left ventricle to have a favorable angle for entering the coronary vessels from the aorta. Inflation of the balloon at the site of the obstruction flattens the plaque into the wall of the vessel and restores blood flow. The obstruction often recurs due to proliferation of VSMCs. Refinements in the technique, the placement of stents at the treated site, and the use of aggressive anticoagulation therapy have all contributed to the technique's growing success. Variants of this technique, in which lasers are used to remove the obstruction, are promising new approaches.

Given the continued prevalence of coronary artery disease, a great deal of research has been aimed at developing alternatives to medication and mechanical revascularization. Among the most promising of these is the use of angiogenesis promoters to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels for collateral blood flow (see pp. 481-482).
on VSMCs or indirectly on adjacent endothelial cells-relax the VSMCs of resistance vessels, thereby increasing blood flow in proportion to local demand. Although a variety of substances released by muscle fibers can contribute to the hyperemia, no single stimulus yet explains the integrated response of blood flow control to muscle contraction. Furthermore, the hyperemic response to increased muscle activity begins within a second or two of the onset of exercise. In contrast, it would take several seconds for these substances to be produced by the skeletal muscle fibers, to reach the interstitium, and to diffuse to the arteriolar VSMCs in sufficient concentration to elicit vasodilation.

The initiation of muscle fiber contraction leads to a release of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$that may hyperpolarize $\bigcirc$ N24-6 the VSMCs and endothelial cells of nearby arterioles (see Table 20-9). Once triggered, this electrical signal spreads from cell to cell through gap junctions along the endothelium and into VSMCs, conducting upstream to the larger vessels and causing them to dilate in concert. This mechanism of conducted vasodilation, together with the action of the muscle pump (see p. 565), contributes to the rapid onset of hyperemia. Increases in levels of other metabolites (e.g., adenosine and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ levels) or decreases in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{II}_{2}}$ contribute to and sustain vasodilation and maintain the hyperemic response.

## Sympathetic innervation increases the intrinsic tone of resistance vessels

Sympathetic nerve fibers invest the entire resistance network of skeletal muscle, from feed arteries to terminal arterioles. The release of norepinephrine by these nerve
terminals activates $\alpha$-adrenoceptors on VSMCs, leading to vasoconstriction beyond that produced by transmural pressure and myogenic tone. On the other hand, the shear stress of blood flowing past the endothelial cells produces vasodilators, such as NO. The interactions among these vasoconstrictor and vasodilatory mechanisms maintain the intrinsic basal tone of the VSMCs. Venules also constrict in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation but are not directly innervated, and instead respond to norepinephrine that diffuses from the nearby arterioles.

With nearly one third of total body mass composed of skeletal muscle, the sympathetic control of vasomotor tone to skeletal muscle is an integral component of the regulation of both systemic arterial pressure (via total peripheral resistance) and cardiac filling (via venous capacitance and return). This principle is particularly relevant during maximal aerobic exercise (see pp. 1213-1215), when the majority of cardiac output flows to the active skeletal muscles.

The basal firing rate of the sympathetic nerves to skeletal muscle is 1 to 2 Hz , which contributes only modestly to the resting vasomotor tone. However, with the onset of exercise, or when high-pressure baroreceptors detect a fall in blood pressure (see pp. 534-536), sympathetic firing to skeletal muscle resistance vessels may increase to 8 to 16 Hz . This degree of sympathetic nerve activity can close the lumens of arterioles in resting skeletal muscle. However, during exercise arterioles remain dilated under the influence of vasodilator metabolites released from surrounding muscle fibers. Because feed arteries are external to the muscle, enhanced sympathetic tone can limit total flow into the muscle and thereby help to maintain arterial pressure.

# N24-6 Vasodilation Caused by Increases in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Why does the transient increase in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ cause a transient paradoxical hyperpolarization, rather than the depolarization that one might expect from the Nernst equation (see Equation 6-5)?

First of all, the effect is transient because the increase in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ is short-lived-the ensuing vasodilation will wash away the excess extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.

Second, the rise in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ causes $V_{m}$ (membrane potential) to become more negative (a hyperpolarization) even though $E_{0}$ (the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$) becomes more positive (see Equation 6-5). The reason is that the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance of VSMCs depends largely on inwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels ( $\mathrm{Kir}^{-}$ channels; see Fig. 7-20). A peculiar property of Kir channels is that an increase in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ not only causes $E_{k}$ to shift to more positive values, but also increases the slope conductance (i.e., the slope of the current-voltage relationship at $E_{0}$ ). VSMCs normally do not live at $E_{0}$, but at more positive voltages ( -30 to -40 mV ), reflecting the contributions from other conductances (e.g., $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$) with more positive equilibrium potentials. In the text, we introduced Equation 6-12 (shown here as Equation NE 24-1):

$$
V_{m}=\frac{G_{k}}{G_{m}} E_{k}+\frac{G_{N k}}{G_{m}} E_{N k}+\frac{G_{C k}}{G_{m}} E_{C k}+\frac{G_{O k}}{G_{m}} E_{O} \ldots
$$

Here, $G_{k}, G_{N k}, G_{C k}, G_{O k}$ etc. represent membrane conductances for each ion, whereas $G_{m}$ represents the total membrane conductance. Thus, $G_{k} / G_{m}$ represents the fractional conductance for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Therefore, the equation tells us that $V_{m}$ not only depends on the various equilibrium potentials, but also on their respective fractional conductances. Thus, if an increase in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ simultaneously causes (1) a slight decrease in the absolute value of $E_{k}$ and (2) a larger increase $G_{k}$, the absolute value of the product $\left(G_{k} / G_{m}\right) E_{k}$ will be larger. Because $\left(G_{k} / G_{m}\right) E_{k}$ is a negative number, the net effect is that the computed value of $V_{m}$ is more negative (i.e., a hyperpolarization).

In principle, a second phenomenon can contribute to the hyperpolarization. The increase in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ will enhance the activity of the electrogenic Na-K pump, resulting an increase in the pump's outward current, and therefore a hyperpolarization.

During exercise, total blood flow through skeletal muscle increases to as much as $80 \%$ of cardiac output. This redistribution of systemic blood flow occurs for two reasons. First, the increase in sympathetic nerve activity constricts the splanchnic circulation (see below), renal circulation (see p. 752), and the vessels of inactive skeletal muscle. Indeed, only the brain and heart are spared from vasoconstriction. Second, the metabolites released by active skeletal muscle overcome the constriction of arterioles that sympathetic activity would otherwise produce. In addition, substances released during muscle fiber contraction (e.g., NO and adenosine) may inhibit norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve fibers surrounding the arterioles.

The vasodilatory effects of the metabolites notwithstanding, sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity can limit muscle blood flow, particularly when another large mass of muscle is active simultaneously and requires a substantial portion of cardiac output. Thus, during "whole-body" exercise, each muscle group may receive only a fraction of the blood flow it would otherwise get if it were the only active group in the body. It is at the level of the feed arteries-which are external to the muscle and thus physically removed from the direct influence of the vasoactive products of muscular activitythat sympathetic vasoconstriction puts an upper limit on blood flow during intense aerobic exercise. At the same time, dilation of arterioles within the active muscle maximizes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction by promoting capillary perfusion.

## Rhythmic contraction promotes blood flow through the "muscle pump"

During exercise, skeletal muscle undergoes rhythmic changes in length and tension, giving rise to mechanical forces within the tissue analogous to those of the beating heart. The contraction of muscle forces venous blood out of the muscle and impedes arterial inflow (Fig. 24-6). Because valves in the veins prevent backflow of blood, each muscle contraction squeezes and empties the veins, driving blood toward the heart (see p. 516). During the subsequent relaxation, the reduction in venous pressure increases the arteriovenous driving force for capillary perfusion. As is true for coronary blood flow, skeletal muscle blood flow is maximal between contractions. This pumping action of skeletal muscle on the vasculature imparts substantial kinetic energy to the blood, thereby reducing the work of the heart. Remarkably, the skeletal muscle pump may generate up to half of the total energy required to circulate blood, an essential contribution for achieving the high blood flows experienced during maximal aerobic exercise. In contrast, drugs that dilate blood vessels of inactive muscle (i.e., muscle lacking a muscle pump) increase blood flow to a lesser extent than do rhythmic contractions.

## THE SPLANCHNIC ORGANS

The splanchnic circulation includes the blood flow through the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, pancreas, spleen, and liver (Fig. 24-7A). The majority of flow to the liver occurs through the portal vein, which carries the venous blood draining from all of these organs except the liver itself.
![bo17985266204](bo17985266204.jpg)

Figure 24-6 Muscle pump.

## The vascular supply to the gut is highly interconnected

The celiac artery is the primary blood supply to the stomach, pancreas, and spleen. The superior and inferior mesenteric arteries supply the large and small intestines, as well as parts of the stomach and pancreas. The superior mesenteric artery is the largest of all the splanchnic branches from the aorta, carrying $>10 \%$ of the cardiac output. The extensive interconnections between the arcading arterial branches (see Fig. 24-7B) provide multiple collateral pathways through which blood can reach each portion of the intestines. This arrangement lessens the risk that the intestines may become ischemic should one of the arteries become occluded.

The microvascular network in the small intestine (see Fig. 24-7C) is representative of that throughout the gastrointestinal tract. After penetrating the wall of the intestine, small arteries course through the various muscle layers and reach the submucosa, where they branch into arterioles. Some arterioles remain in the submucosa to form a submucosal vascular plexus. Others project toward the intestinal lumen and into the mucosa, including the villi. Still others project away from the mucosa and course along the bundles of smooth muscle. Venules emerging from the villi and mucosal and muscularis layers converge into veins. These exit the intestinal wall, paralleling the arterial supply.

The arrangement of microvessels within a villus is like a fountain (see Fig. 24-7C). The incoming arteriole courses up the center of the villus, branching into many capillaries along

the way to the tip of the villus. Capillaries converge into venules and carry blood back to the base of the villus. Capillaries also interconnect the arteriole and the venule all along the villus. These microvessels of villi are highly permeable to solutes of low molecular weight, thereby facilitating the absorption of nutrients.

The arrangement just described can create a countercurrent exchange system that enables permeable solutes to move from the arteriole to the venule without having to traverse the entire length of the villus, particularly when blood flow to the villi is low. With prolonged transit times, blood-borne $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ can diffuse from the arteriole to the venule before reaching the tip of the villus, which makes it susceptible to anoxic damage. In contrast, when blood flow through the villi is high (particularly after a meal), the tips of the villi are well oxygenated (as in Fig. 24-7D), and the effects of countercurrent exchange are reduced.

Because the capillaries in the villi are fenestrated (i.e., they have large pores) and have a large surface area, they are well suited for absorbing nutrients from the intestinal lumen. The venous blood carries away the majority of water-soluble nutrients absorbed from the gut, eventually delivering them to the portal vein. Lipophilic nutrients absorbed from the intestinal lumen enter the central lacteal of the villus (see Fig. 24-7D), which merges with the intestinal lymphatics. The lymph then delivers these substances into the bloodstream via the thoracic duct.

## Blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract increases up to eight-fold after a meal (postprandial hyperemia)

Throughout the gastrointestinal tract, blood flow in each layer of the gut wall closely correlates with the local metabolism (which reflects digestive and absorptive activity). Intestinal blood flow at rest, in the fasting state, is typically $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ for each 100 g of tissue. However, flow can reach $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ for each 100 g during peak hyperemia after a meal. The increase in blood flow with the ingestion and digestion of a meal reflects a complex interplay of several factors.

First, the CNS initiates an "anticipatory" response that increases splanchnic blood flow with the mere thought of food-corresponding to the "cephalic phase" of gastric (see p. 871) and pancreatic secretion (see p. 890).

Second, mucosal metabolic activity during digestion and absorption primarily depends on the rate of active transport of substances across the epithelium. These activities consume $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and produce vasodilator metabolites (e.g., adenosine and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) that increase blood flow locally.

Third, the absorption of nutrients generates hyperosmolality in both the blood and the lymphatic vessels of the villus. Hyperosmolality itself stimulates an increase in blood flow.

Fourth, during digestion, the gastrointestinal tract releases several hormones, some of which are vasoactive. Of these, cholecystokinin and neurotensin (see Table 41-1) may reach high enough concentrations in the local circulation to promote intestinal blood flow. (5) N24-7 The intestinal epithelium also releases various kinins (e.g., bradykinin and kallidin), which are powerful vasodilators. The magnitude of
the postprandial hyperemia further depends on the nature of the luminal content. Bile acids and partially digested fats are particularly effective in promoting hyperemia by acting on chemoreceptors in the intestinal mucosa.

The circulatory system does not distribute the increased splanchnic blood flow equally to all digestive organs, nor does it distribute the flow equally throughout the wall of even one segment of bowel. During and after a meal, as digestion and absorption proceed, blood flow increases sequentially along the gastrointestinal tract, first in the stomach and then in progressively more distal segments of the intestine. In all segments, blood flow through the muscularis layers primarily provides nutrition for the smooth-muscle cells. However, flow through the villi and submucosal vessels supports the absorption of foodstuffs as well as the secretion of electrolytes, fluids, and enzymes. After a meal, splanchnic blood flow remains elevated for 2 to 4 hours, primarily reflecting the vasodilation in the mucosal layer.

As in the heart and skeletal muscle, muscle contraction in the intestine (i.e., peristalsis) decreases blood flow, probably as a result of the compression applied by the muscularis in conjunction with the distending pressure of the luminal contents.

## Sympathetic activity directly constricts splanchnic blood vessels, whereas parasympathetic activity indirectly dilates them

The gastrointestinal tract is endowed with its own division of the ANS, the enteric nervous system (ENS; see pp. 339340 and 855-856). At one level, the ENS is its own independent nervous system, with sensory neurons, the capacity to integrate and to process sensory data, and motor neurons. One of the components of the ENS, the myenteric (or Auerbach's) plexus, releases vasoactive neurotransmitters. However, this plexus probably achieves its major influence on blood flow by controlling the peristaltic activity of the intestinal smooth muscle.

The enteric division sends sensory information upstream to the peripheral ganglia and to the CNS. The ENS also receives important input from the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the ANS. Postganglionic sympathetic neurons originate in the celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric ganglia and send nerve fibers that travel along the corresponding major arteries to all splanchnic organs. Except for the capillaries, all splanchnic blood vessels receive sympathetic innervation. The predominant neural influence is sympathetic vasoconstriction, mediated by norepinephrine acting on $\alpha$ adrenoceptors on VSMCs. The vasoconstriction occurs to a similar extent in both the muscularis and mucosal layers, without redistribution of flow between the layers. Vasoconstriction elicited by sympathetic nerve activity can reduce blood flow to $<10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ per 100 g of tissue (i.e., $\sim 1 / 3$ of resting values).

Parasympathetic preganglionic fibers travel to the intestine via vagal or pelvic nerves, which contact postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the intestinal wall. The effect of parasympathetic activity on blood flow is indirect. Parasympathetic activity stimulates intestinal motility and

# N24-7 Vasoactive Enteric Hormones 

## Contributed by Steve Segal

As noted in the text, the cholecystokinin and neurotensin released by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may reach high enough concentrations in the local circulation to promote intestinal blood flow. However, these substances do not affect blood flow in other vascular beds because these hormones are too dilute, because other vascular beds lack appropriate receptors, or possibly because the hormones are destroyed as they pass through the liver. The intestinal mucosa releases additional peptide hormones (e.g., vasoactive intestinal peptide, gastrin, and secretin), but their effect on blood flow under physiological conditions is questionable.

In addition to the vasoactive hormones released by the GI tract, the carbohydrates and amino acids absorbed by the small intestine increase local osmolality, which in turn leads to an increase in blood flow. It has been suggested that amino acids may cause vasodilation independent of the osmolality effect.

glandular secretion, which in turn increases intestinal metabolism, thereby enhancing blood flow to the gut.

## Changes in the splanchnic circulation regulate total peripheral resistance and the distribution of blood volume

The splanchnic circulation serves both as a site of adjustable resistance and as a major reservoir of blood. During exercise, when blood flow increases to active skeletal muscle, sympathetic constriction of the splanchnic resistance vessels decreases the proportion of cardiac output directed to the viscera. Therefore, abdominal cramping can result from attempts to exercise too soon after eating, when the gastrointestinal tract still demands blood flow to support its digestive and absorptive activities. (3) N24-8

The splanchnic circulation contains $\sim 15 \%$ of the total blood volume, with the majority contained in the liver. During increases in sympathetic tone, splanchnic arteriolar constriction reduces perfusion, resulting in the passive collapse of the splanchnic veins. Blood contained in these veins moves into the inferior vena cava, thus increasing the circulating blood volume. With a greater increase in sympathetic activity, as would occur with intense exercise or severe hemorrhage, active venoconstriction mobilizes even more venous blood, thereby helping to maintain arterial pressure while promoting blood flow to active muscles.

## Exercise and hemorrhage can substantially reduce splanchnic blood flow

A reduction in blood flow leads to the production of vasodilator metabolites (e.g., adenosine and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ), which stimulate arteriolar dilation and increase $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery. Nevertheless, during maximal exercise or severe hemorrhage, blood flow through the gut may fall to $<25 \%$ of its resting value. Fortunately, temporary reductions in splanchnic flow can occur without serious $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ deprivation; at rest, the viscera normally extract only $\sim 20 \%$ of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ carried in the blood, so that extraction can increase several-fold. However, extended periods of compromised splanchnic blood flow can irreversibly damage the intestinal parenchyma.

After a severe hemorrhage and sustained splanchnic vasoconstriction, the ischemic mucosal epithelia slough off, even after repletion of the blood volume and restoration of blood flow. Sloughing occurs particularly at the tips of the villi, where the epithelial cells are susceptible to ischemia because of countercurrent flow (see p. 567). As these cells slough, pancreatic enzymes generate toxic "activators" that enter the circulation and produce multiple organ failure, which can lead to an irreversible decline in cardiovascular function. In an experimental setting, one can avoid damage to the heart by collecting the blood draining from the gut during the first several minutes of reperfusion and thereby preventing access of these blood-borne substances to the heart. Another major consequence of damage to the epithelium is endotoxic shock, which results from disruption of the barrier that normally prevents bacteria and toxins from escaping the intestinal lumen and entering the systemic circulation and peritoneal cavity.

## The liver receives its blood flow from both the systemic and the portal circulation

The liver receives nearly one fourth of resting cardiac output. Of this blood flow, $\sim 25 \%$ is arterial blood that arrives via the hepatic artery. The remaining $75 \%$ of the hepatic blood flow comes from the portal vein, which drains the stomach, intestines, pancreas, and spleen (see Fig. 24-7A). Because the portal venous blood has already given up much of its $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the gut, the hepatic artery is left to supply $\sim 75 \%$ of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ used by the liver.

We discuss the anatomy of the hepatic circulation in more detail on page 946. Small branches of the portal vein give rise to terminal portal venules, and branches of the hepatic artery give rise to hepatic arterioles. These two independent sources of blood flow enter the liver lobule at its periphery. Blood flows from these terminal vessels into the sinusoids, which form the capillary network of the liver. The sinusoids converge at the center of the lobule to form terminal hepatic venules (i.e., central veins), which drain into progressively larger branches of the hepatic veins and finally into the inferior vena cava. Within the sinusoids, rapid exchange occurs between the blood and the hepatocytes because the vascular endothelial cells have large fenestrations and gaps. Thus, the liver sinusoids are more permeable to protein than are capillaries elsewhere in the body. As blood from the gastrointestinal tract passes the Kupffer cells of the liver (see p. 946), they remove bacteria and particulate matter, thereby preventing the access of potentially harmful material to the general circulation.

The mean blood pressure in the portal vein is normally 10 to 12 mm Hg . In contrast, the pressure in the hepatic artery averages 90 mm Hg . These two systems, with very different pressures, feed into the sinusoids ( 8 to 9 mm Hg ). The sinusoids drain into the hepatic veins ( $\sim 5 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ), and these in turn drain into the vena cava ( 2 to 5 mm Hg ). These remarkable values lead us to three conclusions. First, there must be a very high "precapillary" resistance between the hepatic artery $(90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$ and the sinusoids ( 8 to 9 mm Hg ), causing the arterial pressure to step down to sinusoidal values. If the sinusoidal pressure were as high as in typical capillaries (e.g., 25 mm Hg ), blood would flow from the hepatic artery to the sinusoids and then backward into the portal vein. Second, because the pressure in the portal vein ( 10 to 12 mm Hg ) is only slightly higher than that in the sinusoids ( 8 to 9 mm Hg ), the precapillary resistance of the portal inflow ( $75 \%$ of the total blood flow entering the liver) must be very low. Third, because the pressure in the sinusoids is only slightly higher than that in the hepatic vein, the resistance of the sinusoids must also be extremely low.

As a result of the unique hemodynamics of the liver, changes in pressure within the hepatic vein have profound effects on fluid exchange across the wall of sinusoids. For example, in right-sided congestive heart failure, an elevated vena cava pressure can result in transudation of fluid from the liver into the peritoneal cavity, a condition known as ascites.

A change in the blood flow through one of the inputs to the liver (e.g., portal vein) leads to a reciprocal change in flow through the other input (i.e., hepatic artery). For example, if

## N24-9 The Spleen as a Blood Reservoir

## Contributed by Steve Segal

In aerobic animals such as dogs and horses, and in diving animals such as seals, the spleen serves as an important reservoir of blood; it contains up to $10 \%$ of the total blood volume with a hematocrit that is about $10 \%$ higher than that in the systemic circulation. Sympathetic stimulation in these animals causes the capsule of the spleen to contract, ejecting this hemoconcentrated blood into the systemic circulation. In humans and cats, the spleen is principally a reticuloendothelial organ, having little role as a blood reservoir.

# BOX 24-2 Portal Hypertension 

The cirrhotic liver is hard, shrunken, scarred, and laced with thick bands of fibrotic tissue. The most common cause of this in the United States is chronic alcoholism, but worldwide, hepatitis $B$ and hepatitis $C$ are also leading causes. Less commonly, inherited diseases, such as hemochromatosis (iron overload) and Wilson disease (altered copper metabolism), can be responsible, as can diseases of unclear etiology, such as biliary cirrhosis and sclerosing cholangitis.

When damage to the liver becomes severe, the clinical consequences of cirrhosis can become life-threatening. The 5 -year survival rate is the same as that for primary lung cancerless than $10 \%$. The three major complications of cirrhosis are metabolic abnormalities, portal hypertension, and hepatic encephalopathy.

## Metabolic Abnormalities

The liver's inability to maintain its normal synthetic activities (see pp. 964-971) results in a range of metabolic problems. Both albumin and cholesterol levels fall, and the prothrombin time rises, indicating failure of the liver to manufacture proteins in the coagulation cascade. The decreased plasma volume leads to renal hypoperfusion and renal failure-hepatorenal syndrome.

## Portal Hypertension

The scarring that accompanies cirrhosis causes increased resistance to blood flow through the liver. When the portal venous pressure rises, the signs and symptoms of portal hypertension can appear. The increased portal venous pressure leads to increased pressure in the splanchnic capillaries. The Starling forces (see pp. 471-472) thus promote the filtration and extravasation of fluid. The result is abdominal edema (i.e., fluid accumulation in the interstitium), which can progress to frank ascites. As the portal pressure rises further, a portion of the portal blood begins to flow through and dilate the portal anastomoses with systemic veins. These anastomoses are present in the lower esophagus, around the umbilicus, at the rectum, and in the retroperitoneum.

Dilation of the vessels in the lower esophagus can lead to the development of esophageal varices. These veins, and similar veins in the stomach, can burst and cause life-threatening hemorrhage. When varices are associated with persistent or recurrent bleeding, the physician can inject sclerosing agents directly into the varices, a procedure called sclerotherapy. However, even after sclerotherapy, recurrent bleeding is not uncommon, and complications include perforation, stricture formation, infection, and aspiration. It is possible to prevent rupture of the varices in some patients by placing an intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. One introduces a catheter through the jugular vein and into the liver, and then a stent is placed between a branch of the hepatic vein and a branch of the portal vein, allowing portal blood to bypass the liver and flow directly into the vena cava.

In some cases of portal hypertension, surgical intervention is necessary. Portacaval shunts (i.e., those linking the portal vein and inferior vena cava) can stop rebleeding and reduce portal hypertension, but hepatic encephalopathy (see next) can occur and overall mortality is not improved. The distal splenorenal shunt is now the more popular choice of treatment. It is effective in preventing rebleeding, and because it diverts only a portion of the blood flow away from the liver (i.e., just the blood exiting the spleen; see Fig. 24-7A), it is associated with a much lower incidence of encephalopathy.

## Hepatic Encephalopathy

Even as hepatic scarring increases vascular resistance through the liver, hepatic perfusion continues for a while. However, as we have just seen, eventually some of the portal blood flow shunts around the damaged liver into systemic veins, through pre-existing anastomoses. Because the liver is critical for removal and inactivation of naturally occurring toxic metabolites (see pp. 955-956), as well as pharmacological agents, toxins that bypass the liver directly enter the systemic veins and can build up in the plasma. If these toxins (e.g., $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$; see Fig. 39-6) cross the blood-brain barrier, they can cause acute delirium.
the inflow through the hepatic artery decreases, the pressure inside the sinusoids falls slightly, leading to an increase in flow from the portal vein into the sinusoids. When the inflow through the portal vein decreases, metabolic factors (e.g., decreases in metabolites carried by the portal blood) trigger an increase in flow from the hepatic arteriolar system. The hepatic arterial supply displays autoregulation (see p. 481), which is absent in the portal venous system. However, these adjustments do not fully stabilize total hepatic blood flow. With changes in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery, the liver compensates with corresponding changes in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction ratio. Hence, the liver tends to maintain constant $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption (Box 24-2).

## THE SKIN

## The skin is the largest organ of the body

The skin is the major barrier between the internal milieu of the body and the environment of the outside world. The skin is normally overperfused in relation to its nutritional requirements. Thus, local metabolic control of skin blood flow is of
little functional importance. However, changes in blood flow to the skin also play a central role in the body's temperature regulation (see pp. 1200-1201).

In terms of blood flow, we can divide the skin into "apical" skin (Fig. 24-8A)—which is present on the nose, lips, ears, hands, and feet-and "nonapical" skin (see Fig. 24-8B). In skin, capillaries reach only as superficially as the dermis; the epidermis does not have a blood supply. The venules that are part of a plexus of vessels near the dermal-epidermal border (i.e., the most superficial vessels) may contain an appreciable volume of blood, thereby imparting a pinkish hue to individuals with light-colored skin. When cutaneous blood flow decreases, this volume of blood also decreases, lessening the reddish component of skin color (i.e., pallor). Local nutritional flow through the precapillary sphincters and capillaries is under the control of local vasodilator metabolites and sensory stimuli (e.g., temperature, touch, pain). For example, the vascular beds can respond to local thermal changes, largely independently of sympathetic nerve activity: the blood vessels dilate when the skin is directly heated and constrict when it is cooled.

![bo18385266204](bo18385266204.jpg)

Figure 24-8 Blood flow to the skin. A, In apical skin, glomus bodies (a-v anastomoses) can reach a density of $\sim 500$ per $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ in the nail beds. B, The nonapical skin lacks glomus bodies. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine (NE), causing the usual vasoconstriction. Preganglionic sympathetic fibers release acetylcholine (ACh) and cause vasodilation, perhaps mediated by formation of bradykinin.

The blood flow to the skin not only is affected by local metabolites and local warming and cooling but also is under sympathetic neural control. Increases in body core temperature increase blood flow to the skin, leading to a loss of heat. Decreases in core temperature result in the opposite effect of conserving heat. Unlike in other vascular beds, this neural control is far more important than local metabolic control in the overall regulation of skin blood flow.

## Specialized arteriovenous anastomoses in apical skin help control heat loss

Apical Skin The apical skin at the extremities of the body has a very high surface-to-volume ratio that favors heat loss. Circulation to these apical regions has an unusual featurearteriovenous ( $a-v$ ) anastomoses called glomus bodies. (These glomus bodies are unrelated to the glomus cells of the peripheral chemoreceptors.) Glomus bodies of the skin are tiny nodules found in many parts of the body, including the ears, the pads of the fingers and toes, and the nail beds. As the afferent arteriole enters the connective tissue capsule of the glomus body, it becomes a vessel with a small lumen and a thick, muscular wall comprising multiple layers of
myoepithelioid cells. These vessels-which have a rich sympathetic innervation-connect with short, thin-walled veins that eventually drain into larger skin veins. The a-v anastomoses, which are involved in heat exchange, are in parallel with the capillaries of the skin, which are involved in nutrient exchange (see Fig. 24-8A).

The anastomotic vessels are under neural control, rather than the control of local metabolites, and play a critical role in temperature regulation. In these apical regions, blood flow is under the control of sympathetic fibers that release norepinephrine and thereby constrict the arterioles, anastomotic vessels, and venules. Therefore, the increase in sympathetic tone that occurs in response to decreases in core temperature elicits vasoconstriction in the a-v anastomoses, a fall in blood flow, and a reduction in heat loss. Maximal sympathetic stimulation can completely obliterate the lumen of an anastomotic vessel, thus greatly reducing total blood flow to the skin. On the other hand, when the core temperature rises, the withdrawal of sympathetic tone leads to passive vasodilation; there is no active vasodilation. Indeed, blocking of the sympathetic input to a hand in a neutral thermal environment can increase blood flow 4 -fold above basal levels-as much as heat stress can produce. Thus,

sympathetic tone to the vasculature of apical skin is substantial at rest, particularly in cool environments, thereby minimizing heat loss.

Nonapical Skin The body uses a very different approach for regulating blood flow in nonapical skin. One important difference is that this vasculature almost completely lacks a-v anastomoses. A second important difference is that there are two types of sympathetic neurons innervating the vessels of the skin. Some release norepinephrine and some release acetylcholine.

Vasoconstriction occurs in response to the release of norepinephrine. In contrast to the situation in apical skin, blockade of sympathetic innervation to nonapical skin in a thermoneutral environment produces little change in skin blood flow, demonstrating that little vasoconstrictor activity is present at rest.

Vasodilation in nonapical skin occurs in response to sympathetic neurons that release acetylcholine (see p. 543). Indeed, blockade of sympathetic innervation to the nonapical skin in a warm environment produces vasoconstriction and a decrease in skin blood flow, demonstrating neurally directed vasodilation before the blockade. The precise mechanism of this vasodilation is obscure. One proposal is that the acetylcholine stimulates eccrine sweat glands, causing the secretion of sweat as well as enzymes that lead to the local formation of vasoactive molecules. For instance, sweat gland cells release kallikrein, a protease that converts kininogens to kinins, one of which is bradykinin (see p. 543). These kinins may act in a paracrine fashion on nearby blood vessels to relax VSMCs and thereby increase local perfusion. Cholinergic sympathetic neurons may cause vasodilation by means of a second pathway involving the co-release of vasodilatory neurotransmitters (e.g., calcitonin gene-related peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide) that act directly on VSMCs, independently of sweat gland activity. Evidence for the second pathway is that the vasodilation cannot be blocked by atropine and is therefore independent from the actions of acetylcholine.

## Mechanical stimuli elicit local vascular responses in the skin

White Reaction If the skin is stroked mildly with a sharp instrument, a blanched line appears in the trailing path of the instrument. The immediate response is attributable to passive expulsion of the blood by the external mechanical
force. During the next 15 to 60 seconds, the white reaction that ensues is caused by contraction of microvascular VSMCs and pericytes in response to mechanical stimulation. This active response has the effect of emptying the capillary loops, the collecting venules, and the subpapillary venous plexus of blood in a sharply delineated manner.
"Triple Response" If a pointed instrument is drawn across the skin more forcefully, a series of reactions ensues that is collectively known as the triple response. Within several seconds, a band of increased redness appears due to a local dilation and increased perfusion of capillaries and venules within the perturbed area. This red reaction is independent of innervation and may persist for one to several minutes. The presumed cause is the local release of a vasodilator substance (e.g., histamine) from cells that were disturbed by the mechanical response.

If the stimulus is sufficiently strong or repeated, the reddening of the skin is no longer restricted to the line that was stroked but spreads to the surrounding region. This flare reaction appears several seconds after the localized redness and reflects the dilation of arterioles. The mechanism of the flare reaction is a local nervous response known as the axon reflex, (1) N24-3 which depends on the branching of a single nerve fiber (see Fig. 15-29). A stimulus applied to one branch (containing the sensory receptor) gives rise to an action potential that travels centrally to the point of fiber branching. From this branch point, the afferent signal travels both orthodromically to the spinal cord and antidromically along the collateral branch. As a result, this collateral branch releases the vasodilating neurotransmitters. Sectioning of the nerve fiber central to the site of the collateral branch eliminates the awareness of the stimulus but does not eliminate the flare reaction until the nerve fiber degenerates.

When the stimulus is even more intense, as caused by the lash of a whip, the skin along the line of injury develops localized swelling known as a wheal. This local edema results from an increase in capillary permeability (e.g., in response to histamine) as filtration exceeds absorption. The wheal is preceded by and ultimately replaces the red reaction, appearing within a few minutes from the time of injury, and it is often surrounded by the flare reaction.

# INTEGRATED CONTROL OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM 

Emile L. Boulpaep

In the preceding chapters, we examined cardiovascular regulation at several different levels. Powerful systemic mechanisms operate over both the short term and the long term to control mean arterial pressure and cardiac output. Operating independently of these are local mechanisms of control that regulate blood flow at the microcirculatory level. In addition, individual organs have their own unique tools for managing specific circulatory requirements. In this chapter, we put it all together and learn how the cardiovascular system integrates the complex systemic, local, and individualized regulatory mechanisms in response to the demands of everyday life.

## INTERACTION AMONG THE DIFFERENT CARDIOVASCULAR CONTROL SYSTEMS

## The control of the cardiovascular system involves "linear," "branched," and "connected" interactions

In the previous chapters, we often presented physiological responses in a linear sequence or on a linear chart. For instance, we might represent the carotid-baroreceptor feedback loop (see p. 534) as a linear sequence of events (Fig. 25-1A). However, cardiovascular parameters and associated physiological responses are often related by multiple factors, requiring a more complex diagram called a branching tree (or an algorithmic tree). For example, in our discussion of the control of cardiac output (see pp. 545-548), we started with the knowledge that cardiac output depends on two parameters-stroke volume and heart rate. Therefore, with our very first step, we come to a fork in the road-an example of a branching tree (see Fig. 25-1B). At the next level, we encounter a pair of forks because stroke volume and heart rate both depend on two parameters. Finally, at the third level, we see that each of the determinants of stroke volume and heart rate depends on multiple factors (i.e., multiple forks).

The control of some cardiovascular parameters is even more complex, requiring that we graft branches from smaller trees. For example, we know from Ohm's law that mean arterial pressure depends on both cardiac output (and all the elements in its branching tree in Fig. 25-1B) and total peripheral resistance, which requires a branching tree of its own (see Fig. 25-1C). Moreover, sometimes an element in one part of the "forest" interacts with another element that is far away. A physiological system with such complex interactions is
best represented by a connected diagram, which may include feedback loops (see Fig. 25-1C, red arrows), parameters that appear more than once in the tree (connected by a red dashed line), or factors that modulate parameters in two different branches of the tree (connected by brown arrows). Although not shown in Figure 25-1C, several feedback loops may impinge on a single element, and some loops are more dominant than others. The complex interactions among parameters make it difficult to distinguish factors of overriding importance from those of lesser weight. Moreover, when one disturbs a single parameter in a complex physiological system, the initial state of other parameters determines the end state of the system. In previous chapters, we have chosen situations that artificially isolate one portion of the cardiovascular system (e.g., heart, microcirculation) to explain in a simple way the homeostatic control mechanisms that govern that subsystem. However, conditions isolating subsystems rarely apply to a real person.

How can we evaluate which parameters are crucial? As an example, consider one subsystem, the heart. Let us assume that we can rigorously analyze all determinants of cardiac function-such as Starling's law, force-velocity relationships, effect of heart rate on contractility, and so forth. These analyses take the form of mathematical expressions, which we can combine by systems analysis to create a model that describes the behavior of the entire heart-at least theoretically. How can we test whether our model is reasonable? We can compare the physiological response of the heart in vivo with the response predicted by a computer simulation of the model. Using this approach, we may be able to establish whether we have used the correct feedback loops, whether we have assigned proper values to various elements, and whether we have assigned the proper weight to each interaction. In this way, we can use any agreement between the experimental data and the performance of the model as evidence-but not proof-that the concepts contained in the model are reasonable.

## Regulation of the entire cardiovascular system depends on the integrated action of multiple subsystem controls as well as noncardiovascular controls

In performing a systems analysis of the entire cardiovascular system, we must consider the interrelationships among the various subsystems summarized in the central yellow block

of Figure 25-2. Not surprisingly, we cannot fully understand how a particular disturbance affects the overall circulation unless we consider all subsystems in an integrated fashion. For instance, consider the effects of administering norepinephrine, which has a high affinity for $\alpha_{1}$ adrenoceptors, less for $\beta_{1}$ adrenoceptors, and far less for $\beta_{2}$ adrenoceptors. These receptors are present, in varying degrees, in both the blood vessels and the heart. A branching tree would predict the following. Because $\alpha_{1}$ adrenoceptors (high affinity) are present in most vascular beds, we expect widespread vasoconstriction. Because $\beta_{2}$ adrenoceptors (low affinity) are present in only a few vascular beds, we predict little vasodilation. Because $\beta_{1}$ adrenoceptors (intermediate affinity) are present in pacemaker and myocardial cells of the heart, we would anticipate an increase in both heart rate and contractility and therefore an increase in cardiac output.

Although our analysis predicts that the heart rate should increase, in most cases the dominant effect of intravenous norepinephrine injection is to slow down the heart. The explanation, which relies on a connected diagram, is that increased peripheral resistance (caused by stimulation of $\alpha_{1}$ receptors) and increased cardiac output (caused by stimulation of $\beta_{1}$ receptors) combine to cause a substantial rise in mean arterial pressure. The baroreceptor reflex (see red arrow on right in Fig. 25-1C) then intervenes to instruct the heart to slow down (see p. 534). However, bradycardia may not occur if many vascular beds were dilated before the administration of norepinephrine; in this case, the rise in blood pressure would be modest. Bradycardia might also not occur if the baroreceptor reflex were less sensitive, as would be the case in a chronically hypertensive patient (see Box 23-1). Thus, the effect of intravenous administration of norepinephrine on heart rate depends on the pre-existing state of various subsystems.

In trying to understand the integrated response of the cardiovascular system to an insult, we must include in our analysis not only all the subsystems of the cardiovascular system but also the pertinent control systems outside the circulation (see blue boxes in Fig. 25-2):

1. Autonomic nervous system (ANS). Part of the ANS is intimately involved in cardiovascular control (e.g., highpressure baroreceptor response). On the other hand, a generalized activation of the ANS, such as occurs with the fight-or-flight response (see p. 347) also affects the circulation.
2. Respiratory system. We have already seen that ventilatory activity converts the intrinsic bradycardia response to tachycardia during stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors (see p. 545). In addition, the action of the respiratory muscles during inspiration causes intrathoracic pressure to become more negative (see p. 607), thereby increasing venous return. A third example is that the evaporative loss of water during breathing reduces total body water and, ultimately, blood volume.
3. Hematopoietic organs and liver. These systems control blood composition in terms of cell constituents and plasma proteins. The hematocrit and large proteins (e.g., fibrinogen) are major determinants of blood viscosity (see pp. 437-439) and therefore of blood flow. Because the plasma proteins also determine colloid osmotic pressure (see p. 470), they are a major component of the Starling forces (see pp. 467-468), which determine the distribution of extracellular fluid (ECF) between the interstitium and the blood plasma.
4. Gastrointestinal and urinary systems. Because the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys are the principal organs determining input and output of electrolytes and water, they are mainly responsible for controlling the volume and electrolyte composition of ECF. ECF volume plays a central role in the long-term control of blood pressure (see p. 838).
5. Endocrine system. Part of the endocrine system is intimately involved in cardiovascular control (e.g., epinephrine release by the adrenal medulla). Other hormones influence the cardiovascular system either because they are vasoactive agents (see pp. 551-554) or because they regulate fluid volume and electrolyte composition by acting on the kidney and gastrointestinal system.
6. Temperature control system. The cardiovascular system is a major effector organ for thermoregulation, carrying blood from the body core to the skin, where heat loss then occurs (see pp. 1200-1201). In part, this heat loss occurs as sweat glands secrete fluid that then evaporates. However, the loss of ECF volume reduces the effective circulating volume (see pp. 554-555).

Inclusion of control elements outside the circulation (see Fig. 25-2) in our connected diagram of the cardiovascular system (see Fig. 25-1C) would expand the computer model to include hundreds of independent and dependent variables. Rather than trying to grasp such an exhaustive model, we work here through the integrated cardiovascular responses to four important circulatory "stresses": (1) orthostasis (i.e., standing up), (2) emotional stress, (3) exercise, and (4) hemorrhage.

## RESPONSE TO ERECT POSTURE

## Because of gravity, standing up (orthostasis) tends to shift blood from the head and heart to veins in the legs

About two thirds of the total blood volume resides in the systemic veins (see pp. 448-450). When a recumbent subject assumes an upright position, the blood shifts from the central blood volume reservoirs and other veins to large veins in the dependent limbs. In discussing Figure 17-8B, we assumed that the cardiovascular system somehow made the adjustments necessary to keep right atrial pressure (RAP) constant at about +2 mm Hg . Indeed, unless compensatory mechanisms intervene, blood redistribution will lower not only arterial blood pressure but also venous return and thus cardiac output.

To illustrate the effect of blood redistribution on venous return, we will represent the entire circulatory system by a horizontal, distensible cylinder 180 cm in length (the height of our person) and 3 cm in radius (Fig. 25-3A). This cylinder holds $\sim 5000 \mathrm{~mL}$ of blood (the normal blood volume). We know that immediately after a cardiac arrest, the entire vascular system will have a mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) of $\sim 7 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (see p. 549). The MSFP is the pressure in the circulation that would remain in the absence of any pumping or any gravity effects. Thus, if a subject is recumbent and has no heartbeat, and if the cardiovascular system is filled with a normal blood volume of $5000 \mathrm{~mL}\left(V_{o}\right)$, the overall compliance of the system will produce a uniform pressure of $\sim 7 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. If we were to transfuse an additional $100 \mathrm{~mL}(\Delta V)$ of blood into our cylinder, the MSFP would rise by $\sim 1 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}(\Delta P)$. We can conclude that the compliance, expressed as a normalized distensibility (see p. 454), is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Relative distensibility } & =\frac{\left(\Delta V / V_{o}\right)}{\Delta P} \\
& =\frac{(100 \mathrm{~mL} / 5000 \mathrm{~mL})}{1 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}} \\
& =0.02 \frac{\mathrm{~mL}}{\mathrm{~mL} \times \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}} \\
& =0.02 /(\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg})
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, for every $2 \%$ increase in blood volume, the MSFP of the cylinder increases by 1 mm Hg .

What will happen to our cylinder if we now turn it upright? This position is called orthostasis (from the Greek orthos [upright] + histanai [to stand]). Because we have a vertical column of blood 180 cm tall, we must now consider gravity (see Fig. 25-3B). The highest pressures will be at the bottom of the cylinder. (Fig. 17-8 shows that orthostasis causes venous pressure at the ankle to rise from 5 to 100 mm Hg .) Therefore, our cylinder will distend maximally at the bottom, and this distention represents a shift in blood volume. The bottom of the cylinder (corresponding to the "dependent areas" of a person) gains volume, whereas the top (i.e., corresponding to the cranial portion of a person) loses blood volume. In fact, there would be no blood at all at the top of the cylinder.

Figure 25-3 Model of the orthostatic redistribution of blood. A, A horizontal tube ( 3 -cm radius, 180 cm long) contains the entire blood volume ( 5 L ). With no blood flow, pressure inside the tube is uniform and corresponds to a mean systemic filling pressure of 7 mm Hg . B, With the cylinder upright (orthostasis), pressure gradually increases toward the bottom, causing increasingly greater distention of this compliant tube. Because blood volume has shifted to the bottom, the upper level of the blood column is 30 cm below the level of the heart, preventing venous return. C, Reducing compliance of the tube by half also causes distention to fall by half. With the reduced shift of blood volume, the upper level of the blood column now just reaches the heart.

By just how much would the column of blood fall in our upright, $180-\mathrm{cm}$-tall cylinder? If the overall vascular volume distensibility were $0.02 /(\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg})$, then the actual height of the blood column inside the cylinder would be only about 100 cm . (2) N25-1 If the heart were 50 cm below the top of the cylinder, then the top of the column would now be $\sim 30 \mathrm{~cm}$ below the level of the heart. Therefore, there would be no blood to return to the heart. Moreover, the RAP would be negative $\left(\sim 30 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right.$, or about -22 mm Hg$)$. Because the heart cannot create a vacuum this large at its input by "sucking" blood-in fact, the heart must be filled by a positive RAP-cardiac output would fall to zero.

# N25-1 Calculation of Distention in an Upright Cylinder 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Equation 19-4 and the identical Equation 25-1 both describe how the "relative" or "normalized" distensibility depends on the relative change in volume $\left(\Delta V / V_{c}\right)$ and the pressure difference $(\Delta P)$ :

$$
\text { Relative distensibility }=\frac{\left(\Delta V / V_{c}\right)}{\Delta P}
$$

(NE 25-1)

We can now solve for the relative change in volume:

$$
\frac{\Delta V}{V_{c}}=\text { Relative distensibility } \cdot \Delta P
$$

(NE 25-2)

For a very thin disk of fluid (height $h$ ) in the upright vessel, the change in volume ( $\Delta V$ ) is due solely to a change in vessel radius. In other words, because $V=h \pi r^{2}, \Delta V=h \pi(\Delta r)^{2}$. Thus, we can rewrite Equation NE 25-2 as

$$
\frac{\left(\Delta r)^{2}}{\left(r_{c}\right)^{2}}=\text { Relative distensibility } \cdot \Delta P
$$

(NE 25-3)

In order to compute the shape of the upright vessel in Figure 25-3, the only other thing we need to know is how $\Delta P$ varies with height in the upright vessel. For a hydrostatic column, the pressure increases linearly as we descend to greater depths, as described by Equation 17-4. We reproduce this equation here:

$$
P=\rho \cdot g \cdot h
$$

(NE 25-4)

Here, $\rho$ is the density of the liquid, $g$ is the gravitational constant, and $h$ is the height of the column. We could use this equation to compute the pressure in dynes per square centimeter or pascals. However, physiologists tend to express pressures in centimeters of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ or millimeters of mercury. For example, in Figure 25-3B, the pressure at the bottom of the $100-\mathrm{cm}$ column
is equivalent to $100 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, which is also (knowing the density of mercury) 73.5 mm Hg .

Now we can compute the relative distention at the bottom of the upright cylinder, which is under a pressure of 73.5 mm Hg . Rearranging Equation NE 25-3 and solving for $\Delta r$ (the change in radius), we have

$$
\begin{gathered}
(\Delta r)^{2}=\text { Relative distensibility } \cdot \Delta P \cdot\left(r_{c}\right)^{2} \\
\left(\Delta r^{2}=(0.02) \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg} \cdot(73.5 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})(3 \mathrm{~cm})^{2} \quad \text { (NE 25-5) }\right. \\
\Delta r=3.6 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{gathered}
$$

Because the initial radius $\left(r_{c}\right)$ of the horizontal cylinder in Figure 25-3A was everywhere 3 cm , the distended radius at the bottom of the upright column has increased by 3.6 cm for a total radius of 6.6 cm -in other words, the radius has more than doubled, and the volume has more than quadrupled (i.e., increased by a factor of 4.8 ).

If the relative distensibility were less (e.g., $0.01 / \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in Fig. 25-3C), then the $\Delta r$ would also be less at the bottom of the upright cylinder. On the other hand, because the $\Delta r$ is less at each height, the column of water would have to be higher to accommodate the volume. Thus, the pressure at the bottom of the column would be greater (i.e., $130 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ or 95.6 mm Hg in the example of Fig. 25-3C). As in Equation NE 25-5, we can compute the relative distention at the bottom of the upright cylinder, which this time is under a pressure of 95.6 mm Hg :

$$
\begin{gathered}
\left(\Delta r^{2}=(0.01) \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg} \cdot(95.6 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})(3 \mathrm{~cm})^{2}\right. \\
\Delta r=2.9 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{gathered}
$$

(NE 25-6)

In other words, uniformly reducing the relative distensibility by a factor of 2 still results in a near doubling of the radius and a near quadrupling of the volume (i.e., increased by a factor of 3.8 ).

## The ANS mediates an "orthostatic response" that raises heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance and thus tends to restore mean arterial pressure

If our model predicts that orthostasis should cause RAP to fall to -22 mm Hg , how is it that the body manages to maintain RAP at about +2 mm Hg in the upright position? The answer is that pooling of blood in the dependent vessels is much less pronounced during orthostasis than would be predicted by Figure 25-3B, where $\sim 2.3 \mathrm{~L}$ disappeared from the top of the cylinder. The actual amount of pooling in both legs of a real person is only $\sim 500 \mathrm{~mL}$. 0 N25-2 Four major factors help reduce pooling and maintain RAP.

Nonuniform Initial Distribution of Blood In our cylinder example, the blood was initially distributed evenly throughout the length of the cylinder. In a recumbent human, however, most of the blood in large veins is located in the central blood volume (see p. 449), that is, the vessels near the heart. If a large fraction of the blood had started off in the head, the orthostatic shift of blood would have been more dramatic, as in Figure 25-3B. The majority of the 500 mL of blood that pools in the legs during orthostasis comes from the intrathoracic vascular compartments. What is the sequence of events by which blood volume redistributes during orthostasis? As one stands, the output from the heart for a number of beats exceeds the venous return into the thoracic pool. This excess blood ends up filling the vessels in the dependent regions of the body. The result is a net transfer of blood-by way of the heart-from the intrathoracic vascular compartments to the dependent vessels.

Nonuniform Distensibility of the Vessels In Figure 25-3B, we assumed a relative distensibility of $0.02 /(\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg})$. If we had instead used a value of $0.01 /(\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg})$-that is, if the vessels were less distensible-standing would cause a less dramatic shift of blood to the dependent vessels, $\sim 1.4 \mathrm{~L}$ (see Fig. 25-3C) instead of $\sim 2.3 \mathrm{~L}$ (see Fig. 25-3B). 0 N25-1 As a result, the height of the blood column would fall from 180 to only 130 cm (see Fig. 25-3C) in the upright position, rather than to 100 cm (see Fig. 25-3B). Assuming a lower distensibility for the leg veins is reasonable because small vessels are far stiffer than larger ones, such as the aorta and vena cava. With the lower relative distensibility of $0.01 /$ ( mm Hg ), the column of blood would just reach the heart. Indeed, when a subject stands quietly, the zero effective pressure level-the height in the body where vascular pressure equals atmospheric pressure-is about at the level of the right atrium. Obviously, if the circulatory system reduces its distensibility even further through the regulated contraction of vascular smooth muscle (discussed below), the height of the column of blood will increase and improve venous return.

Muscle Pumps An important compensation for blood pooling during orthostasis comes from skeletal muscle contraction. When a person stands, the muscles of the legs and abdomen tighten. The presence of valves in the veins, as well as intermittent muscular movement, contributes to the flow of blood upward along the veins (see Fig. 22-7C and Fig. 24-6). Vessels of the abdominal region remain nearly unaffected by orthostasis because the abdominal viscera are
contained in a water-filled jacket that is maintained by the tone of the abdominal muscles.

Autonomic Reflexes Because of decreased venous return, cardiac output tends to fall by $\sim 20 \%$ soon after one assumes an erect position. However, the fall in cardiac output would be even greater in the absence of autonomic reflexes. The decreased venous return leads to a fall in RAP, which in turn leads to a decrease in stroke volume and thus arterial pressure. High-pressure baroreceptors (see pp. 534-535) sense this decrease in arterial pressure, (0) N25-3 which leads to an increased sympathetic output that raises vascular tone throughout the body and increases heart rate and contractility. Together, the constriction of arterioles (which raises total peripheral resistance) and the increased heart rate restore the systemic mean arterial pressure, despite a small decrease in stroke volume. In the dependent regions of the body, the sympathetic response also increases the tone of the veins, thereby decreasing their diameter and their capacity (compare Fig. 25-3B and C).

In summary, of the four factors that contribute to the stability of RAP during orthostasis, two are anatomical (i.e., nonuniformities of initial blood volume distribution and distensibility) and two are physiological (i.e., muscle pumps and autonomic reflexes). The two physiological mechanisms are both important. Indeed, after a lumbar sympathectomy, patients tend to faint when standing. However, after some months, they are able to compensate, perhaps by using the muscle pumps more effectively or by enhancing the sympathetic response of the heart.

The extent of the orthostatic response-how much the heart rate or peripheral vascular resistance increases under the control of the ANS-depends on a variety of factors (Table 25-1), which involve nearly the entire cardiovascular system. Because these factors may differ from person to person or may differ within any one individual according to the circumstances, the orthostatic response is highly variable. We now discuss two examples of this variability.

Postural Hypotension In very sensitive subjects lying on a tilt table, a sudden orthostatic tilt can cause such a large fall in arterial pressure that the individual becomes dizzy or even faints. Fainting is caused by a transient fall in arterial pressure that causes cerebral perfusion to become inadequate.

Temperature Effects In a cool environment, in which the arterioles in the lower extremities are constricted, the initial dip in arterial pressure can be small, despite the decrease in stroke volume. The explanation is that the high arteriolar resistance delays the transfer of blood from the thoracic pool to the legs. As a result, the sympathetic response to the small drop in mean arterial pressure may already be in effect before further pooling can occur. In a warm environment, where the arterioles in the skin are more dilated, orthostasis leads to faster transfer of blood from the thoracic pool to the legs (0) N25-4 so that-before the sympathetic response can develop-the initial decreases in stroke volume, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure can be large. Thus, soldiers standing quietly at attention in hot weather are more likely to faint than are soldiers marching in a cold environment because of differences in muscle pump activity and vasoconstriction.

## N25-2 Hypothetical Volume of Pooled Blood during Orthostasis

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

In the example shown in Figure 25-38, the column of blood would reach a height of 100 cm . Because the horizontal cylinder in Figure 25-34 had a length of 180 cm , turning the vessel upright reduced the length of the column by 80 cm . How much volume moved into the lower part of the distensible, upright vessel? The answer is the volume at the top of the white region in Figure 25-38, which is the product of the $80-\mathrm{cm}$ length and cross-sectional area:

Hypothetical pooled volume $=\left(80 \mathrm{~cm}\right) \cdot \pi(3 \mathrm{~cm})^{2}$

## N25-4 Effects of Temperature on Venous Pooling

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

As discussed on page 565, the contraction of skeletal muscle in the legs (the "muscle pump"-see Fig. 24-6) drives blood from the large veins in the lower limbs toward the heart. Conversely, each time these skeletal muscles relax, the vascular bed in the legs refills from the arterial side. Obviously, the arteriolar inflow resistance influences the rate at which the veins in the leg refill subsequent to the action of the muscle pump. When the lower limbs are at a high temperature, the arterioles dilate, lowering the inflow resistance and increasing the inflow of blood to the dependent vessels. Therefore, venous pooling worsens at high temperature, which explains why soldiers tend to faint under these conditions.

## N25-3 Baroreceptor Responses in Orthostasis

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

As noted in the text (see p. 576), orthostasis leads to the following sequence of events: Decreased venous return $\rightarrow$ fall in RAP $\rightarrow$ decrease in stroke volume $\rightarrow$ decreased arterial pressure $\rightarrow$ response of high-pressure baroreceptors (see pp. 536-537) $\rightarrow$ increased sympathetic output $\rightarrow$ generalized vasoconstriction and increased heart rate/contractility. Because RAP falls early in this sequence, you might wonder what role the atrial low-pressure baroreceptors play in the response. Reduced atrial stretch has little effect on heart rate (see pp. 547-547) and causes an increase in sympathetic output only to the kidney (i.e., causing renal vasoconstriction). Therefore, the low-pressure baroreceptors make only a minor contribution to the overall orthostatic response (i.e., generalized vasoconstriction and increased heart rate/contractility).

## RESPONSES TO ACUTE EMOTIONAL STRESS

## The fight-or-flight reaction is a sympathetic response that is centrally controlled in the cortex and hypothalamus

Emotional responses vary greatly among people. A severe emotional reaction can resemble the fight-or-flight response in animals (see p. 345). This defense reaction causes a generalized increase in skeletal muscle tone and increased sensory attention.

Fight-or-flight behavior is an extreme example of an integrated acute stress response that originates entirely within the central nervous system (CNS), without involvement of peripheral sensors or reflexes. The response is due to the activation of sensory centers in the cortex (Fig. 25-4), which activate a part of the limbic system called the amygdala (see p. 349). The amygdala in turn activates the locus coeruleus (see p. 312), which is in the pons, as well as hypothalamic nuclei. Noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus project to nearly every part of the CNS (see Fig. 13-7A), including the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which produces both an endocrine and an ANS response. The endocrine response of the PVN involves (1) release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by magnocellular neurons in the PVN (see Fig. 40-8), thereby reducing urine output (see pp. 817-818); and (2) release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH; see p. 1023) by parvocellular neurons in the PVN, activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and
thereby releasing cortisol, which is important for the metabolic response to stress. The ANS response of the PVN involves projections to (1) autonomic nuclei in the brainstem (dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, rostral ventrolateral medulla, and nucleus tractus solitarii [NTS]) that are part of the medullary cardiovascular center (see p. 537), and (2) direct projections to the spinal intermediolateral column (see Fig. 25-4).

The overall fight-or-flight response involves the following:

1. Skeletal muscle blood flow. In animals-but perhaps not in humans-activation of postganglionic sympathetic cholinergic neurons (see p. 342-343) directly causes a rapid increase in blood flow to skeletal muscle (see p. 539). In humans as well as in other mammals, flow also increases secondarily more slowly and less dramatically because the adrenal medulla releases epinephrine, which acts on $\beta_{2}$ adrenoceptors on skeletal muscle blood vessels. The result is dilation and an increase in blood flow. In a full-blown fight-or-flight reaction, muscle exercise generates metabolites that further increase skeletal muscle blood flow (see pp. 563-564). Of course, humans may not exercise skeletal muscle in responding to internal stress (e.g., anxiety or panic).
2. Cutaneous blood flow. The sympathetic response causes little change in blood flow to skin unless it stimulates sweating. The neural pathway involves sympathetic cholinergic neurons (see pp. 342-343), which release acetylcholine and perhaps vasodilatory neurotransmitters (e.g., calcitonin gene-related peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide). The acetylcholine causes the secretion of sweat and possibly also the local formation of kinins (see pp. 553-554). These kinins increase capillary permeability and presumably also dilate arterioles but constrict venules (i.e., increasing the midcapillary pressure). The result would be an increased filtration of fluid from the skin capillaries into the interstitium, causing dermal swelling.
3. Adrenal medulla. Preganglionic sympathetic neurons stimulate the chromaffin cells to release epinephrine, which causes vasodilation in muscle (through $\beta_{2}$ adrenoceptors) and vasoconstriction in the kidney and splanchnic beds (through $\alpha_{1}$ adrenoceptors).
4. Renal and splanchnic blood flow. In virtually all vascular beds, increased sympathetic output causes vasoconstriction and thereby decreases blood flow. The systemic release of epinephrine also vasoconstricts these vascular beds rich in $\alpha_{1}$ adrenoceptors.
5. Veins. Most veins constrict in response to sympathetic output.
6. The heart. Increased sympathetic output and decreased vagal output cause a rise in heart rate and contractility, so that cardiac output increases.
7. Blood volume. High plasma levels of AVP reduce urine output and maintain blood volume.
8. Mean arterial pressure. Depending on the balance of vasodilation and vasoconstriction, the overall result of vascular resistance changes may be either a decrease or an increase in total peripheral resistance. Nevertheless, because cardiac output increases, the net result of an increased cardiac output and a resistance change is an increase in arterial pressure.

## The common faint reflects mainly a parasympathetic response caused by sudden emotional stress

About one fifth of humans experience one or more episodes of fainting during adolescence. This type of fainting is known as vasodepressor syncope or vasovagal syncope (VVS). About $40 \%$ of syncope cases seen in outpatient settings are vasovagal in nature. VVS can occur in response to a sudden emotional stress, phlebotomy, the sight of blood, or acute pain. Fainting usually starts when the individual is standing or sitting, rarely when the individual is recumbent. The loss of consciousness is due to a transient fall in perfusion pressure to the brain. The "playing dead" reaction in animals is the equivalent of VVS in humans.

VVS originates with activation of specific areas in the cerebral cortex. Indeed, stimulation of areas in the anterior cingulate gyrus can trigger a faint. Although the exact trigger is not known, VVS has been attributed to activation of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. This reflex-originally described as the cardiorespiratory response to the intravenous injection of Veratrum alkaloids-causes bradycardia, hypotension, and apnea. In experimental animals, stimulation of arterial baroreceptors (see p. 534) or ventricular baroreceptors (see p. 547) by any of a host of chemicals-Veratrum alkaloids, nicotine, capsaicin, histamine, serotonin, and snake and insect venoms-can also trigger the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. In patients, coronary injection of contrast material or of thrombolytic agents can cause VVS, presumably by stimulating ventricular receptors. It is possible that these chemical stimuli activate the same stretch-sensitive TRPC channels of arterial baroreceptors (see pp. 534-535) that are usually activated by high blood pressure. In humans, triggers clearly distinct from those known to initiate a Bezold-Jarisch reflex can also elicit VVS. Whatever the actual trigger, vagal afferents carry signals to higher CNS centers, which act through autonomic nuclei in the medulla to cause a massive stimulation of the parasympathetic system and abolition of sympathetic tone.

VVS involves changes in several parameters (Fig. 25-5):

1. Total peripheral resistance. A massive vasodilation results from the removal of sympathetic tone from the resistance vessels of the skeletal muscle, splanchnic, renal, and cerebral circulations. The resulting fall in blood pressure fails to activate a normal baroreceptor response.
2. Cardiac output. Intense vagal output to the heart causes bradycardia and decreased stroke volume, resulting in a marked decrease in cardiac output. Because atropine, a muscarinic receptor blocker, does not reliably prevent syncope, decreased sympathetic tone to the heart may also play a role in causing bradycardia.
3. Arterial pressure. The combination of a sudden decrease in both total peripheral resistance and cardiac output causes a profound fall in mean arterial pressure.
4. Cerebral blood flow. The fall in mean arterial pressure causes global cerebral ischemia. If the decreased cerebral blood flow persists for only a few seconds, the result is dizziness or faintness. If it lasts for $\sim 10$ seconds, the subject loses consciousness. The stress underlying the common faint also may provoke hyperventilation, which lowers arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see p. 680). The resulting constriction of cerebral blood vessels (see p. 559) further impairs

cerebral blood flow, which increases the likelihood of a faint.
5. Other manifestations of altered ANS activity. Pallor of the skin and sweating (beads of perspiration) are signs that often appear before the loss of consciousness. Intense vagal stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract may cause epigastric pain that is interpreted as nausea. Mydriasis

(pupillary dilation) as well as visual blurring can also result from parasympathetic stimulation. (○) N25-5

Fainting is more likely to occur in a warm room (see pp. 576-577), after a volume loss (e.g., dehydration or hemorrhage), or after standing up or other maneuvers that tend to lower mean arterial pressure. You might think that these stresses would trigger baroreceptor responses that increase cardiac output and vascular resistance, thereby making fainting less likely. However, the same integrated pattern of brain activity that orchestrates VVS also appears to suppress the expected baroreceptor reflexes that would otherwise counteract the syncope. (○) N25-6

After regaining consciousness, the patient often notices oliguria (reduced urine output), caused by high plasma levels of AVP (also known as antidiuretic hormone; see pp. 817819). Elevated levels of AVP can result in part from the reduced atrial stretch that occurs during periods of decreased venous return (see pp. 546-547). The pallor and nausea that persist after fainting may also result from the high levels of circulating AVP.

## RESPONSE TO EXERCISE

Adaptation to exercise probably places the greatest demands on circulatory function. The main feature of the cardiovascular response to exercise is an increased cardiac output, up to four or five times the resting cardiac output. The increase in cardiac output during exercise is more the result of increased heart rate ( $\sim 3$ times the control value) than of increased stroke volume ( $\sim 1.5$ times control). The cardiovascular response to exercise has both early and late components and originates from higher centers in the CNS (early), from mechanical and chemical changes triggered by contracting skeletal muscle (delayed), and from various reflexes (delayed).

## Early physiologists suggested that muscle contraction leads to mechanical and chemical changes that trigger an increase in cardiac output

Contracting skeletal muscle produces cardiovascular changes that mimic many of those that occur during exercise. In fact, early physiologists believed that these skeletal muscle effects triggered all of the cardiovascular changes associated with exercise. We now know that these skeletal muscle effects are important only for the delayed cardiovascular responses in exercise. Muscle contraction directly affects the cardiovascular system in two ways (Fig. 25-6)-through a mechanical response that increases venous return and through a chemical response that dilates blood vessels in active muscle.

Mechanical Response: Increased Venous Return The pumping action of contracting skeletal muscle improves venous return (see pp. 516 and 565). As a result, RAP, ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and end-diastolic volume should all increase. According to the Starling mechanism (see pp. 524-526), the result should be an increase in stroke volume.
![bo19185266204](bo19185266204.jpg)

Figure 25-6 Early model of how exercise affects cardiovascular function. EDV, end-diastolic volume.

Chemical Response: Local Vasodilation in Active Muscle Enhanced skeletal muscle metabolism produces multiple changes in the chemistry of the interstitial fluid. The $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and pH fall, whereas other metabolites $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right.$, lactic acid, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, and adenosine) accumulate. Moreover, the accumulation of metabolites causes interstitial osmolarity to increase. After a small delay that follows the onset of muscle contraction, the developing chemical changes cause the arterioles to dilate (see pp. 477-478 and 563-564), which may lead to an initial fall in arterial pressure. However, this fall is transient because of the intervening baroreceptor response (see p. 534), which increases heart rate and stroke volume, both of which enhance cardiac output. At the same time, the baroreceptor reflex vasoconstricts inactive muscle regions as well as the splanchnic, renal, and cutaneous circulations.

Cardiovascular physiologists believed for a long time that the mechanical and chemical limbs in Figure 25-6, both of

## N25-5 Ocular Symptoms and Signs Associated with Fainting

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

On pages 579-580, the text points out that fainting may be associated with mydriasis (dilation of the pupil) and blurred vision. In addition, fainting may also be associated with dimmed vision.

The mydriasis that may occur during the loss of consciousness is not the direct consequence of the strong parasympathetic stimulation that underlies the fainting episode. Stimulation of the autonomic (parasympathetic) portion of cranial nerve III (see pp. 338-339, Fig. 14-4) would lead to contraction of the sphincter muscle in the iris, and therefore would lead to miosis (pupillary constriction). How then does mydriasis arise? It is likely that the brain ischemia that leads to the altered mental status of the faint also causes a palsy of the preganglionic fibers that originate in the oculomotor (Edinger-Westphal) nucleus (see Fig. 14-5), resulting in a relaxation of the iris's sphincter muscle and therefore mydriasis. Note that the dilator muscle of the iris is innervated by postganglionic sympathetic fibers emanating from the superior cervical ganglion. Evidently, the brain hypoperfusion that triggers the faint has a lesser effect on the sympathetic system that causes dilation of the pupil.

Blurred vision before or after the loss of consciousness may be a direct consequence of strong parasympathetic stimulation. The ciliary zonule fibers are elastic elements that tend to stretch the lens of the eye in a radial direction and thus to flatten the lens. The ciliary muscle that encircles the lens is composed of smooth-muscle fibers that are arranged both radially and circularly. The main effect of contraction of the ciliary muscle is to relax the radial tension exerted by elastic zonule fibers, thereby allowing the lens to become more curved. A higher curvature of the front surface of the lens increases its focal power (see Equation 15-1). It is possible that very strong parasympathetic stimulation could cause blurring by the following sequence of events: Preganglionic fibers in the oculomotor (Edinger-Westphal) nucleus synapse in the ciliary ganglion on postganglionic parasympathetic fibers that innervate the smooth-muscle fibers of the ciliary muscle. Parasympathetic activation of this system would cause the lens to accommodate for objects very close to the eye. Therefore, the patient would experience blurred vision for any object further removed from the eye.

Dimming of vision may be part of the prodrome of fainting, presumably due to a loss of adequate retinal perfusion.

## N25-6 Suppression of the Classical Baroreceptor Response in Vagovagal Syncope

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

In rare cases, certain chemicals can cause vasovagal syncope. One hypothesis is that certain chemicals that stimulate TRPC channels of baroreceptors can activate the baroreceptors maximally, as if blood pressure had risen markedly. According to this view, vasovagal syncope is the appropriate response: decreased cardiac output and decreased peripheral resistance. Even though blood pressure falls, vessels collapse, and stretch on the walls of the blood vessels wanes, the baroreceptors would still behave as if they were maximally stimulated.

which originate in active muscle, are responsible for the increased cardiac output during exercise. However, Figure $25-6$ is not only incomplete, some of its predictions are incorrect or do not occur in the predicted order. As far as the mechanical effect on venous return is concerned, the model predicts a rise in ventricular end-diastolic pressure and thus end-diastolic volume. As far as the chemical effect is concerned, the model predicts that it should take time for chemical changes in active skeletal muscle to produce local vasodilation. Therefore, there ought to be a time lag between the initiation of exercise and the fall in mean arterial pressure that triggers the baroreceptor response (e.g., increased heart rate).

In the 1950s, Rushmer tested these predictions on trained unanesthetized dogs. Recording the mechanical limb of Figure 25-6, he found that at the onset of exercise, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure does not rise and that left ventricular end-diastolic volume diminishes rather than increases. These findings cast doubt on the primary role of the Starling mechanism in raising stroke volume during exercise. Recording the chemical limb of Figure 25-6, Rushmer found no transient fall in mean arterial pressure, thus casting doubt on the importance of the baroreceptor reflex. Furthermore, he saw no delay between the onset of exercise and the increase of heart rate, thus calling into question the idea that the chemically induced vasodilation is at the root of the tachycardia.

The explanation for the discrepancies between the predicted and actual findings is the presence of a central command that rapidly activates the sympathetic division of the ANS.

## Central command organizes an integrated cardiovascular response to exercise

During exercise, a central command controls the parallel activation of both the motor cortex (see pp. 402-403) and cardiovascular centers. The central command involves such brain areas as the medial prefrontal cortex (involved in the mental state of thinking and planning exercise) as well as the insula and anterior cingulate gyrus, which are cortical parts of the limbic system (see p. 349). Indeed, the medial prefrontal cortex receives multiple limbic inputs. Moreover, both cortical centers modulate stress-related sympathetic outflow, including the sympathetic outflow related to exercise. N25-7 Rushmer and his colleagues explored various sites in the diencephalon (see p. 270) of dogs to determine if stimulation of any of them might mimic the integrated sympathetic response to exercise. In the 1950s, Rushmer found that stimulation of the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ fields of Forel in the ventral thalamus or neurons in the periventricular gray matter of the hypothalamus reproduced all the details of the cardiac response to exercise, even though the muscles of the dog were completely quiescent. The central command centers project to the lateral hypothalamus, rostral ventrolateral medulla, and NTS to make autonomic adaptations appropriate for exercise (Fig. 25-7):

1. Increased cardiac output. Increased sympathetic output to the heart causes early tachycardia and increased contractility, resulting in a rapid upsurge of cardiac output.
2. Vasoconstriction. Sympathetic output from the medulla causes vasoconstriction in inactive muscle regions as well as in the renal, splanchnic, and cutaneous circulations. The net effect is to make more blood available for diversion to the contracting muscles. Except during maximal exercise, the increase in splanchnic and renal resistance does not result in a fall in local blood flow to the abdominal viscera and kidneys. Rather, because the arterial pressure increases along with the renal and splanchnic vascular resistance, the absolute blood flow remains close to resting levels in these tissues, even as the flow to the skeletal muscle increases markedly. However, fractional blood flow (i.e., local blood flow normalized to cardiac output) does fall in these regions. In the early phase of exercise, skin blood flow also decreases. However, cutaneous blood flow eventually rises, which reflects the attempt of the temperature-regulatory system to prevent body temperature from rising too much (see pp. 1200-1201).
3. Early vasodilation in active muscle. In dogs-although not in humans or other primates-at the initiation of exercise, central command stimulates hypothalamic neurons whose axons bypass the medullary cardiovascular centers and synapse on preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the spinal cord (see p. 539). The postganglionic neurons synapse on cholinergic sympathetic vasodilator fibers that innervate the vascular smooth muscle of skeletal muscle and trigger early peripheral vasodilation in active skeletal muscle. As discussed in the next section, the delayed local "chemical" response later reinforces this vasodilation.

The increased alertness that accompanies the anticipation of exercise can elicit all the components of the early response to exercise. The early response resembles the fight-or-flight reaction. In humans, the anticipatory cardiovascular adjustments prepare the body for the increased metabolism of the exercising skeletal muscle. For sprinters at the start of a $100-\mathrm{m}$ dash, the anticipatory response prepares them to deliver an increased cardiac output and simultaneously to divert the increased blood flow away from tissues that do not require increased blood flow.

Muscle and baroreceptor reflexes, metabolites, venous return, histamine, epinephrine, and increased temperature reinforce the response to exercise

In addition to the events orchestrated by the command center, the integrated cardiovascular response to exercise includes the following:

1. Exercise pressor reflex. A neural drive called the exercise pressure reflex originates within the exercising muscle itself. Contraction activates stretch receptors that sense muscle tension and may also activate chemoreceptors that sense metabolites. Signals from these receptors travel through small thinly myelinated ( $A \delta$ or group III in Table 12-1) and unmyelinated (C or group IV) sensory fibers from skeletal muscle to the spinal cord and then on to the medullary cardiovascular control centers. This sensory input reinforces the central input to the cardiovascular control center and thus sustains the sympathetic outflow.

# N25-7 Central Commands for Exercise Originating Outside the Medulla 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

An increase in sympathetic output from the medullary cardiovascular center, by itself, would explain the immediate ventricular response during exercise. Increased sympathetic output from medullary centers would also explain the immediate vasoconstriction in inactive muscles and in the splanchnic, renal, and cutaneous circulations. However, sympathetic signals originating in the medulla cannot account for yet another immediate exercise response that occurs in dogs (though not humans and other primates) - a rapid vasodilation that occurs only in active skeletal muscle. On the contrary, experimental stimulation of medullary centers would constrict all muscle beds.

![bo19285266204](bo19285266204.jpg)

Figure 25-7 Integrated cardiovascular response to exercise. The hypothalamus orchestrates an early response, which includes vasodilation of active muscle (the mechanism of which is controversial in humans), vasoconstriction of certain inactive tissues, and increased cardiac output. In addition to those responses shown in Figure 25-6, the delayed responses (highlighted in yellow) include release of histamine, kallikreins, and epinephrine, leading to delayed vasodilation. Delayed local chemical responses from contracting muscles sustain early cardiovascular responses. Cutaneous thermoreceptors trigger delayed vasodilation in the skin.

2. Arterial baroreflexes. Elevated mean arterial pressure resulting from high cardiac output and vasoconstriction outside active muscle would normally slow the heart. However, during exercise, central command resets the sensitivity of the arterial baroreflex so that the heart slows only at much higher arterial pressures. Conversely, if massive vasodilation in exercising skeletal muscle would reduce total peripheral resistance, the baroreceptor reflex maintains mean arterial pressure.
3. Vasodilation triggered by metabolites in skeletal muscle. Metabolites released locally (see Fig. 25-7) dilate the resistance vessels and recruit capillaries that had received no blood flow at rest (see pp. 563-564). As a result of this decrease in resistance, in concert with the increase in cardiac output, blood flow to active skeletal muscle can be as much as 20 times that to resting skeletal muscle. This vasodilator effect of metabolites thus more than overcomes any vasoconstrictive tendency produced by norepinephrine.
4. Increased venous return. The central command discussed in the preceding section explains the early increase in cardiac output during exercise. The mechanical and the chemical limbs described in Figure 25-6 further sustain the high cardiac output. Mechanically, the muscle pump increases venous return, and stroke volume rises by the Starling mechanism. Chemical mediators cause a vasodilation of active muscle beds that results in the rapid mobilization of blood from the central blood volume to exercising muscle.
5. Histamine release. Cells near the arterioles may release their intracellular stores of histamine, a potent vasodilator (see Table 20-8). Although these histamine-containing cells are quiescent when sympathetic nerves release norepinephrine, they release histamine when sympathetic tone wanes. Because of relaxation of the arterioles and precapillary sphincters, the pressure in the muscle capillaries rises, leading to increased extravasation of fluid and enhanced lymph flow.
6. Epinephrine release. During severe exercise, preganglionic sympathetic fibers to the adrenal medulla stimulate epinephrine release. The systemic effects of circulating epinephrine on cardiac $\beta_{1}$ adrenoceptors enhance the neural effects on the heart, thus increasing cardiac output. Circulating epinephrine also acts on vascular $\beta_{2}$ adrenoceptors, augmenting vasodilation mainly in skeletal muscle and heart.
7. Regulation of body core temperature. As exercise continues, increased metabolism causes body core temperature to rise, activating temperature-sensitive cells in the hypothalamus (see p. 1199). This activation has two effects, both of which promote heat loss through the skin as part of a temperature-regulatory response (see p. 1200). First, the hypothalamus signals the medulla to inhibit its sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow to the skin, thereby increasing cutaneous blood flow. Recall that vasoconstriction is part of the early response to exercise (see above). Second, the hypothalamus activates sympathetic cholinergic fibers to sweat glands, causing an increase in sweat production as well as an indirect cutaneous vasodilation that may involve kinin formation. In addition, these neurons may co-release neurotransmitters that directly dilate cutaneous vessels (see p. 571).

## RESPONSE TO HEMORRHAGE

If a person rapidly loses $<10 \%$ or $20 \%$ of total blood volume from a large vein, the inadequate intravascular volume causes sequential decreases in central blood volume, venous return, ventricular filling, stroke volume, cardiac output, and thus mean arterial pressure. However, if the blood loss comes from a large peripheral artery, the mean arterial pressure in central arteries does not fall until cardiac output falls secondary to decreased venous return. Of course, if the blood loss occurs from a blown aortic aneurysm, mean arterial pressure falls immediately.

Large hemorrhages, in which one loses $30 \%$ or more of total blood volume, produce hypovolemic shock. Shock is a state of peripheral circulatory failure that is characterized by inadequate perfusion of the peripheral tissues. During shock, the systolic arterial pressure is usually $<90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, and the mean arterial pressure is $<70 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. For reasons that will become clear, by the time one records a significant fall in mean arterial pressure, other signs of shock are evident. The first signs may be narrowing of the pulse pressure and a sensation of faintness when sitting or standing. The subject in hypovolemic shock has cold and moist (i.e., "clammy") skin as well as a rapid and weak pulse. Moreover, urine output drops to $<25 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{hr}$, even if fluid intake had been normal.

After its abrupt initial fall, arterial pressure tends to return to normal (Fig. 25-8, red curve), although blood pressure falls irreversibly (blue dashed curve) in some cases. Under favorable circumstances, the body restores blood pressure toward normal values by mobilizing two lines of defense. First, circulatory control mechanisms act on the heart and blood vessels to restore cardiac output and to increase peripheral resistance. Second, mechanisms of capillary exchange and fluid conservation restore the intravascular volume.

## After hemorrhage, cardiovascular reflexes restore mean arterial pressure

Several cardiovascular reflexes cooperate to compensate for the fall in mean arterial pressure. These reflexes originate
![bo19385266204](bo19385266204.jpg)

Figure 25-8 Changes in blood pressure with hemorrhage. At time zero, the investigator removes enough blood from the experimental animal to lower mean arterial pressure to 45 mm Hg .

![bo19485266204](bo19485266204.jpg)

Figure 25-9 Integrated response to hemorrhage. Blood loss triggers four kinds of receptors (numbered 1 to 4) to produce an integrated response orchestrated by the medulla.
from four major groups of receptors (numbered 1 to 4 in Fig. 25-9):

1. High-pressure baroreceptors. The fall in arterial pressure leads to a decrease in the firing rate of afferents from the carotid and aortic baroreceptors (see p. 534). The resulting enhanced sympathetic output and diminished vagal output increase heart rate and cardiac contractility and also produce venoconstriction and selective arteriolar constriction. These responses cooperate to re-establish the arterial pressure.
2. Low-pressure baroreceptors. Reduced blood volume directly decreases effective circulating volume, which in
turn lessens the activity of low-pressure stretch receptors (see p. 547). The resulting increased sympathetic outflow causes vasoconstriction in a number of vascular beds, particularly the kidney, reducing glomerular filtration rate and urine output. In response to decreased stretch, low-pressure receptors at various sites in the circulation ultimately have divergent effects on heart rate. The atrial stretch receptors also instruct the hypothalamus to enhance release of AVP, which reduces renal water excretion (see pp. 817-818). During shock, the vasoconstrictor effects of AVP appear to be important for maintaining peripheral vascular resistance. Reduced atrial stretch also

lowers the level of circulating atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP; see p. 547), thereby reducing salt and water loss by the kidneys (see p. 843).
3. Peripheral chemoreceptors. As blood pressure drops, perfusion of the carotid and aortic bodies declines, causing local hypoxia near the glomus cells and an increase in the firing rate of the chemoreceptor afferents (see pp. 710-712), a response enhanced by increased sympathetic tone to the peripheral chemoreceptor vessels (see pp. 711-712). Increased chemoreceptor discharge leads to increased firing of the sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibers and ventilatory changes that indirectly increase heart rate (see p. 544).
4. Central chemoreceptors. Severe hypotension results in brain ischemia, which leads to a fall in the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of brain ECF as well as a rise in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and a fall in pH . The acidosis has a profound effect on the central chemoreceptors in the medulla (see p. 713, leading to a sympathetic output (see p. 546) several-fold more powerful than that caused by baroreceptor reflexes (see p. 546).

These four reflex pathways have in common the activation of a massive sympathetic response that results in the release of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic neurons. In addition, the sympathetic response triggers the adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and norepinephrine roughly in proportion to the severity of the hemorrhage. Lowering of the mean arterial pressure to 40 mm Hg causes circulating levels of epinephrine to rise 50 -fold and those of norepinephrine, 10 -fold. The consequences of the four combined reflex actions are the following responses (see Fig. 25-9).

Tachycardia and Increased Contractility Increased sympathetic activity increases heart rate roughly in proportion to the volume of shed blood. Thus, the degree of tachycardia is an index of the severity of the hemorrhage. Increased sympathetic tone increases myocardial contractility but can increase stroke volume only after venous return also improves.

Arteriolar Constriction Sympathetic constriction of the resistance vessels is most pronounced in the blood vessels of the extremities, skin, skeletal muscle, and abdominal viscera. Although both precapillary and postcapillary resistance vessels constrict, the precapillary response initially dominates. As a result, capillary pressure falls precipitously, leading to the transcapillary refill discussed in the next section. Renal blood flow falls rapidly after hemorrhage as a result of the fall in blood pressure but recovers after a few minutes because of autoregulation (see p. 750). The responses of both high- and low-pressure stretch receptors lead to enhanced sympathetic vasoconstrictor traffic to the kidney. Although renal blood flow has a high threshold for this sympathetic traffic, the sympathetic vasoconstriction eventually overrides renal autoregulation if arterial pressure remains low or continues to fall. In hypovolemic shock, renal blood flow falls to a proportionately greater extent than does cardiac output, which explains why severe hemorrhage often results in acute renal failure. Blood flow in the medulla of the kidney is less compromised than in the cortex, leading to "medullary washout" of the hypertonic interstitial fluid in the renal medulla (see pp. 813-815) and an inability to
produce a concentrated urine. Both coronary blood flow and cerebral blood flow initially fall after hemorrhage, but autoregulation can largely restore blood flow to normal.

Venous Constriction The fall in blood volume with hemorrhage occurs primarily in the large-capacitance vessels, especially those that contain the central blood volume. These vessels are very sensitive to sympathetic stimulation (which causes constriction) and less so to local metabolites (which causes dilation). The sympathetic venous constriction decreases both the capacity and the compliance of the large veins, thereby tending to restore central venous pressure. In addition, sympathetic venous constriction increases postcapillary resistance, which is important for transcapillary refill (see below).

Circulating Vasoactive Agonists As already discussed, sympathetic stimulation of the adrenal medulla causes circulating epinephrine levels to rise (see p. 585). In addition, sympathetic stimulation of the granular cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidney leads to an increased release of renin and, ultimately, increased plasma levels of angiotensin II (ANG II) (see p. 553). In hemorrhagic shock, ANG II rises to concentrations that are vasoconstrictive. Activation of the sympathetic system also triggers sympathetic cholinergic stimulation of the sweat glands (see p. 571), causing the patient's extremities to become clammy.

With moderate blood losses ( $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ ), these four responses can increase total peripheral resistance sufficiently to keep arterial pressure at about normal levels. However, cardiac output remains depressed.

## After hemorrhage, transcapillary refill, fluid conservation, and thirst restore the blood volume

The reflexes discussed in the preceding section compensate for the principal consequences of blood loss-decreased blood pressure and reduced cardiac output. The responses discussed here compensate for the primary disturbance, the loss of blood volume.

Transcapillary Refill The movement of fluid from the interstitium to the blood plasma is the major defense against reduced blood volume. Starling forces (see pp. 467-468) are critically important during hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock. Immediately after hemorrhage, a phase of hemodilution develops, as was first observed during World War I, when medics noted that injured soldiers arrived at the firstaid station with diluted blood (i.e., low hematocrit). Within an hour, interstitial fluid replaces $\sim 75 \%$ of the shed blood volume. Studies performed around World War II showed that the dilution of hemoglobin is more pronounced than the dilution of plasma proteins after hemorrhage. Therefore, not only do fluid and electrolytes move from the interstitium to the blood, but proteins also enter the vascular compartment.

Transcapillary refill involves two steps. The first is fluid movement from the interstitium to the vasculature. Capillary hydrostatic pressure $\left(P_{s}\right)$ (Fig. 25-10A) depends on arteriolar and venular pressures as well as on the relation of the precapillary to the postcapillary resistance (see pp. 451-452).

Figure 25-10 Effect of hemorrhage on capillary hydrostatic pressure. A, In this figure (which is similar to Fig. 19-44), $R_{\text {pre }}$ and $R_{\text {post }}$ are the precapillary and postcapillary resistances, respectively. Here, the ratio $R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}=0.35$. B, The fall in capillary hydrostatic pressure reverses the Starling forces, causing net movement of fluid from the interstitium to the capillary lumen. C, Sympathetic stimulation increases total peripheral resistance $\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}=0.25\right.$ in this example). D, Capillary pressure rises $\left(R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}=0.45\right.$ in this example).

Immediately after the hemorrhage, the upstream arteriolar pressure and the downstream venular pressure both fall, causing $P_{v}$ to fall (see Fig. 25-10B). The Starling forces thus produce a large net movement of fluid and small electrolytes from the interstitium into the capillaries. As compensation occurs, total peripheral resistance increases, in part restoring arteriolar pressure (see Fig. 25-10C). However, because precapillary resistance increases more than does postcapillary resistance, $P_{v}$ remains relatively low, sustaining the net movement of fluid into the capillaries. Normally, little protein would enter with the fluid because nonfenestrated capillary walls reflect proteins very effectively (see p. 468). The entry
of protein-free fluid into the capillary gradually modifies the three other Starling forces. First, the interstitial fluid volume decreases, lowering interstitial hydrostatic pressure $\left(P_{i j}\right)$. Second, the plasma proteins become diluted, so that capillary colloid osmotic pressure $\left(\pi_{c}\right)$ falls. Finally, the removal of a protein-free solution from the interstitium raises colloid osmotic pressure in the bulk interstitium $\left(\pi_{i l}\right)$ and in the subglycocalyx fluid $\left(\pi_{i q}\right)$; see pp. 471-472). The result of these dissipating Starling forces is that transcapillary refill gradually wanes and eventually ceases.

The second step in transcapillary refill is the appearance of plasma proteins in the blood. These proteins probably enter the blood across fenestrae of the mesenteric and hepatic capillaries, two regions in which the interstitium has a very high interstitial colloid osmotic pressure. In addition, hemorrhage rapidly stimulates albumin synthesis by the liver. Plasmapheresis, the artificial removal of plasma proteins from the blood, has the same effect on albumin synthesis, suggesting that a reduction in the concentration of plasma proteins per se stimulates the liver to make albumin.

Water from the intracellular compartments ultimately replaces the lost interstitial fluid. What the driving force is for water to leave the cells and to enter the interstitium is somewhat controversial. The blood osmolality often rises after hemorrhage, which presumably reflects interstitial hyperosmolality. The additional interstitial osmoles come from ischemic tissues that release the products of proteolysis, glycolysis, and lipolysis. Therefore, interstitial hyperosmolality may provide the osmotic drive for the movement of water from the intracellular to the interstitial compartment.

Renal Conservation of Salt and Water Arterial hypotension and lowered renal blood flow reduce the glomerular filtration rate (see p. 739) and therefore diminish the urinary excretion of salt and water. In addition to the direct hemodynamic effects, the reduced effective circulating volume promotes the renal retention of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$by four mechanisms, which are discussed more fully in Chapter 40. First, reduced effective circulating volume activates the renin-angiotensin cascade (see pp. 841-842), increasing aldosterone release and thus enhancing salt and water reabsorption by the distal nephron. Second, increased sympathetic nerve activity (see p. 842) promotes $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention by altering renal hemodynamics, enhancing renin release, and stimulating $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by renal tubule cells. Third, the release of AVP reduces water excretion (see p. 843). Finally, reduced effective circulating volume inhibits release of ANP (see p. 843) and thus promotes renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention. Therefore, the overall response of the kidney to blood loss is to reduce the excretion of water and salt, thereby contributing to the conservation of ECF. However, the renal response only conserves fluid; by itself, it does not add any water to the ECF.

Thirst The blood hyperosmolality caused by hemorrhage (discussed two paragraphs above) stimulates thirst osmoreceptors (see pp. 845-846). A far more potent stimulus for thirst (see p. 849)-as well as salt appetite-is the reduced effective circulating volume and blood pressure caused by severe hemorrhage. These urges, if fulfilled, actually provide some of the raw materials for replacement of the blood lost in hemorrhage.

## Positive-feedback mechanisms cause irreversible hemorrhagic shock

In some cases, hemorrhagic shock can be irreversible. After an initial fall in arterial pressure and perhaps some recovery, arterial pressure and the perfusion of peripheral tissues may inexorably deteriorate (see Fig. 25-8, blue dashed curve). Moreover, in these cases, the fall in arterial pressure does not reverse even if the physician intervenes at this time and replaces the volume of blood lost as the result of hemorrhage.

The best experimental model for irreversible hemorrhagic shock is prolonged hypotension. Typically, the researcher acutely removes blood from an experimental animal-thereby reducing blood pressure to some low target value-and then clamps the mean arterial pressure at this low target by either removing or infusing blood as the normal physiological responses evolve. Studies of this kind reveal that hemorrhagic shock can become irreversible as a result of the failure of multiple response components: (1) the vasoconstrictor response, (2) the capillary refill response, (3) the cardiac response, and (4) the CNS response.

Failure of the Vasoconstrictor Response With prolonged hemorrhagic hypotension, the total peripheral resistancewhich first increases in response to sympathetic stimulationtends to return to prehemorrhage levels. This failure to maintain vasoconstriction has several origins. First, desensitization of the vascular adrenoceptors or depletion of neurotransmitters in the nerve terminals close to the blood vessels may cause "sympathetic escape." Second, the ischemic tissues release metabolites and other vasodilator compounds that act on local blood vessels, thereby counteracting the vasoconstricting stimuli. In the late phases of irreversible shock, humans may become completely unresponsive to a range of vasoconstrictor drugs. Third, plasma AVP levels may have fallen substantially from the peak value during the early phase of hemorrhage-which perhaps reflects a decreased ability of the low-pressure baroreceptor reflex to trigger hypothalamic neurons to release AVP or a depletion of AVP stores. Under these conditions, restoration of AVP levels to their initial peak can markedly increase blood pressure.

Failure of the Capillary Refill Some blood vessels are able to sustain the initial increase in resistance better than others are. Over time, precapillary sphincters fail first, followed by the precapillary resistance vessels (i.e., arterioles), the postcapillary resistance vessels, and the capacitance vessels. Figure 25-10D shows an example in which, after prolonged hypotension, the precapillary constrictor response has fully faded, whereas the postcapillary response is partially maintained. Because the ratio $R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}$ has risen, the midcapillary pressure (see pp. 451-452) increases from 16 mm Hg (see Fig. 25-10C) to 21 mm Hg (see Fig. 25-10D). You will recall that early during hemorrhage, the net Starling forces reverse, favoring the movement of fluid from the interstitium to the blood. The gradual increase of $R_{\text {post }} / R_{\text {pre }}$ (see Fig. 25-10D) reverses this reversal, so that fluid once again leaves the capillary, even though the blood volume has not yet been restored. Thus, after the initial large influx of water and electrolytes into the capillary lumen, not only does transcapillary refill decline, but a net loss occurs. This phenomenon contributes to the hemoconcentration that occasionally occurs in prolonged hemorrhagic states.

Failure of the Heart Several factors may contribute to the weakening of the heart. Acidosis reduces $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in the myocardium and thus reduces contractility. In severe cases, subendocardial hemorrhage and necrosis of the heart muscle render the myocardium nonfunctional. Various organs may also release cardiotoxic shock factors, which exert a negative inotropic effect on the heart (see pp. 530-532). Ultimately hypovolemic shock converts to cardiogenic shock.

CNS Depression Moderate ischemia, by its effects on the central chemoreceptors, stimulates the cardiovascular control centers in the brain (see p. 585). However, prolonged cerebral ischemia depresses neural activity throughout the brain, thereby weakening the sympathetic output and in turn causing a decay in both vascular and cardiac responses. A progressive fall in the circulating levels of catecholamines of adrenal origin further worsens the outcome.

# ORGANIZATION OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 

Walter F. Boron

## COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY OF RESPIRATION

## External respiration is the exchange of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ between the atmosphere and the mitochondria

For millennia, people have regarded breathing as being synonymous with life. Life begins and ends with breathing. The Bible states that God "breathed into [Adam's] nostrils the breath of life" and then later used part of Adam's ventilatory apparatus-a rib-to give life to Eve.

In the fourth and fifth centuries BC, writings attributed to Hippocrates suggested that the primary purpose of breathing is to cool the heart. It was not until the 18th century that the true role of breathing began to emerge as several investigators studied the chemistry of gases. Chemists had recognized similarities between combustion and breathing but thought that both involved the release of a "fire-essence" called phlogiston. According to their theory, neither combustion nor life could be supported once air became saturated with phlogiston.

In the 1750s, Joseph Black (1) N26-1 found that heating calcium carbonate produces a gas he called "fixed air," now known to be carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$. He also found that animal respiration produces this gas. Shortly thereafter, Henry Cavendish (1) N26-2 found that fermentation and putrefaction also produce fixed air. The early 1770s saw the codiscovery of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ by Carl Scheele (1) N26-3 (who called it "fire air") and Joseph Priestley (1) N26-4 (who called it "dephlogistonated air"). In 1785, Henry Cavendish (1) N26-2 found that dephlogistonated air represents $\sim 20 \%$ of atmospheric air. Priestley found that combustion, putrefaction, and breathing all consume dephlogistonated air, and all reduce the volume of room air by $\sim 20 \%$. Conversely, he found that green plants produce dephlogistonated air, which he quantitated by reacting it with nitric oxide (a colorless gas) to produce nitrogen dioxide (a red gas).

In the mid-1770s, Priestley presented his findings to Antoine Lavoisier (1) N26-5-often regarded as the father of modern chemistry. Lavoisier quickly put Priestley's empirical observations into a theoretical framework that he used to demolish the phlogiston theory, which Priestley held to his death. Lavoisier recognized that dephlogistonated air, which he named "oxygen," represents the $\sim 20 \%$ of room air consumed by combustion in Priestley's experiments, leaving
behind "nonvital" air, or nitrogen $\left(\mathrm{N}_{2}\right)$. Furthermore, he proposed that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is consumed because it reacts with one substance to produce another. The mathematician JosephLouis Lagrange (1) N26-6 suggested that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production occur not in the lungs but in isolated tissues, as Lazzaro Spallanzani later rigorously demonstrated in the late 18th century.

Thus, by the end of the 18th century, chemists and physiologists appreciated that combustion, putrefaction, and respiration all involve chemical reactions that consume $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and produce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Subsequent advances in the chemistry of gases by Boyle, Henry, Avogadro, and others laid the theoretical foundation for the physiology of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Thus, respiration was a unifying theme in the early histories of physiology, chemistry, and biochemistry.

Later work showed that mitochondrial respiration (i.e., the oxidation of carbon-containing compounds to form $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) is responsible for the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production observed by Spallanzani. This aspect of respiration is often called internal respiration or oxidative phosphorylation (see p. 1185).

In the chapters on respiratory physiology, we focus on external respiration, the dual processes of (1) transporting $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the atmosphere to the mitochondria and (2) transporting $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the mitochondria to the atmosphere. We will also see that $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport is intimately related to acidbase homeostasis.

## Diffusion is the major mechanism of external respiration for small aquatic organisms

The most fundamental mechanism of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport is diffusion (see p. 108). Random movements of molecules such as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, whether in a gaseous phase or dissolved in water, result in a net movement of the substance from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration (Fig. 26-1A, inset). No expenditure of energy is involved. The driving force for diffusion is the concentration gradient.

Imagine a unicellular organism suspended in a beaker of pond water at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The water is in equilibrium with an atmosphere that has the usual composition of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Table 26-1). The partial pressures of $\mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ and of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\right)$ in the $d r y$ air are slightly higher than their corresponding values in the wet air immediately above the surface of
