# ORGANIZATION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 

Bruce R. Ransom

The human brain is the most complex tissue in the body. It mediates behavior ranging from simple movements and sensory perception to learning, memory, and consciousness. It is the organ of the mind and accounts for the human capacity for invention, discovery, and language. Many of the brain's functions are poorly understood. In fact, the most prominent function of the human brain, its capacity to think, is hardly understood at all. Its capacity to reflect upon itself is a philosophical paradox. Our lack of knowledge about fundamental aspects of brain function stands in marked contrast to the level of comprehension that we have about the primary functions of other organ systems such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys. Nevertheless, tremendous strides have been made in the past few decades.

In this part of the book, we present the physiology of the nervous system in a manner that is intended to be complementary to texts on neurobiology and neuroanatomy. In this chapter, we review the basic cellular, developmental, and gross anatomy of the nervous system. In Chapter 11, we discuss the fluid environment of the neurons in the brain, how this environment interacts with the rest of the extracellular fluid of the body, and the role of glial cells. Chapters 12 and 13 focus on the broad physiological principles that underlie how the brain's cellular elements operate. Another major goal of this section is to provide more detailed information on those parts of the nervous system that play key roles in the physiology of other systems in the body. Thus, in Chapter 14, we discuss the autonomic nervous system, which controls viscera such as the heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Finally, in Chapters 15 and 16, we discuss the special senses and simple neuronal circuits.

## The nervous system can be divided into central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems

The manner in which the nervous system is subdivided is somewhat arbitrary. All elements of the nervous system work closely together in a way that has no clear boundaries. Nevertheless, the traditional definitions of the subdivisions provide a useful framework for talking about the brain and its connections, and are important if only for that reason.

The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord (Table 10-1). It is covered by three "membranes"-the meninges. The outer membrane is the dura mater; the middle is the arachnoid; and the delicate inner
membrane is called the pia mater. Within the CNS, some neurons that share similar functions are grouped into aggregations called nuclei. The CNS can also be divided into gray matter, which contains neuron cell bodies, and white matter, which is rich in myelin (see pp. 199-201).

The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of those parts of the nervous system that lie outside the dura mater (see Table 10-1). These elements include sensory receptors for various kinds of stimuli, the peripheral portions of spinal and cranial nerves, and all the peripheral portions of the autonomic nervous system. The sensory nerves that carry messages from the periphery to the CNS are termed afferent nerves (from the Latin ad + ferens [carrying toward]). Conversely, the peripheral motor nerves that carry messages from the CNS to peripheral tissues are called efferent nerves (from the Latin ex + ferens [carrying away]). Peripheral ganglia are groups of nerve cells concentrated into small knots or clumps that are located outside the CNS.

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is that portion of the nervous system that regulates and controls visceral functions, including heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, temperature regulation, and reproductive function. Although the ANS is a functionally distinct system, it is anatomically composed of parts of the CNS and PNS (see Table 10-1). Visceral control is achieved by reflex arcs that consist of visceral afferent (i.e., sensory) neurons that send messages from the periphery to the CNS, control centers in the CNS that receive this input, and visceral motor output. Moreover, visceral afferent fibers typically travel together with visceral efferent fibers.

## Each area of the nervous system has unique nerve cells and a different function

Nervous tissue is composed of neurons and neuroglial cells. Neurons vary greatly in their structure throughout the nervous system, but they all share certain features that tailor them for the unique purpose of electrical communication (see Chapter 12). Neuroglial cells, often simply called glia, are not primary signaling cells and have variable structures that are suited for their diverse functions (see Chapter 11).

The human brain contains $\sim 10^{11}$ neurons and slightly more glial cells. Each of these neurons may interact with thousands of other neurons, which helps explain the awesome complexity of the nervous system.

TABLE 10-1 Subdivisions of the Nervous System

| Central | Brain (including CN II and retina) and spinal cord | Oligodendrocytes provide myelin Axons cannot regenerate |

CN, cranial nerve.

Few, if any, of the receptors, ion channels, or cells in the human brain are unique to humans. The unparalleled capabilities of the human brain are presumed to result from its unique patterns of connectivity and its large size.

The brain's diverse functions are the result of tremendous regional specialization. Different brain areas are composed of neurons that have special shapes, physiological properties, and connections. One part of the brain, therefore, cannot substitute functionally for another part that has failed. Any compensation of neural function by a patient with a brain lesion (e.g., a stroke) reflects enhancement of existing circuits or recruitment of latent circuits. A corollary is that damage to a specific part of the brain causes predictable symptoms that enable a clinician to establish the anatomical location of the problem, a key step in diagnosis of neurological diseases.

## CELLS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

## The neuron doctrine first asserted that the nervous system is composed of many individual signaling units-the neurons

In 1838, Schleiden and Schwann proposed that the nucleated cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in both plants and animals. They reached this conclusion by microscopic observation of plant and animal tissues that had been stained to reveal their cellular composition. However, the brain proved to be more difficult to stain than other tissues, and until 1885, when Camillo Golgi introduced his silverimpregnation method, "the black reaction," there was no clear indication that the brain is composed of individual cells. The histologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal worked relentlessly with the silver-staining method and eventually concluded that not only is nervous tissue composed of individual cells, but the anatomy of these cells also confers a functional polarization to the passage of nervous signals; the tapering branches near the cell body are the receptive end of the cell, and the long-axis cylinder conveys signals away from the cell. In the absence of any reliable physiological evidence, Ramón y Cajal was nevertheless able to correctly anticipate
how complex cell aggregates in the brain communicate with each other.

The pathologist Heinrich von Waldeyer referred to the individual cells in the brain as neurons. He wrote a monograph in 1891 that assembled the evidence in favor of the cellular composition of nervous tissue, a theory that became known as the neuron doctrine. It is ironic that Golgi, whose staining technique made these advances possible, never accepted the neuron doctrine, and he argued vehemently against it when he received his Nobel Prize along with Ramón y Cajal in 1906. (○) N10-1 The ultimate proof of the neuron doctrine was established by electron microscopic observations that definitively demonstrated that neurons are entirely separate from one another, even though their processes come into very close contact.

## Nerve cells have four specialized regions: cell body, dendrites, axon, and presynaptic terminals

Neurons are specialized for sending and receiving signals, a purpose reflected in their unique shapes and physiological adaptations. The structure of a typical neuron can generally be divided into four distinct domains: (1) the cell body, also called the soma or perikaryon; (2) the dendrites; (3) the axon; and (4) the presynaptic terminals (Fig. 10-1). The shape and organelle composition of these domains depends strongly on their cytoskeleton, which consists of three fibrillary structures: neurofilaments (i.e., intermediate filaments; see p. 23), microtubules (see pp. 23-25), and thin filaments (see pp. 25-28). The cytoskeleton-especially the microtubules and thin filaments, is dynamic and imbues axons and dendrites with the capacity to change shape, a plasticity believed to participate in the synaptic alterations associated with learning and memory.

Cell Body As the name perikaryon implies, the cell body is the portion of the cell surrounding the nucleus. It contains much of the cell's complement of endoplasmic reticular membranes as well as the Golgi complex. The cell body appears to be responsible for many of the neuronal housekeeping functions, including the synthesis and processing of proteins.

Dendrites These structures are tapering processes of variable complexity that arise from the cell body. Dendrites, and to a lesser extent the cell body, are the main areas for receiving information. Thus, their membranes are endowed with receptors that bind and respond to the neurotransmitters released by neighboring cells. The chemical message is translated by membrane receptors into an electrical or a biochemical event that influences the state of excitability or function of the receiving neuron. The cytoplasm of the dendrites contains dense networks of microtubules as well as extensions of the endoplasmic reticulum.

Axon Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the neuron, the axon is a projection that arises from the cell body, like the dendrites. Its point of origin is a tapered region known as the axon hillock. Just distal to the cone-shaped hillock is an untapered, unmyelinated region known as the initial segment. This area is also called the spike initiation zone

because it is where an action potential (see p. 176) normally arises as the result of the electrical events that have occurred in the cell body and dendrites. In contrast to the dendrites, the axon is thin, does not taper, and can extend for more than a meter. Because of its length, the typical axon contains much more cytoplasm than does the cell body, up to 1000 times as much. The neuron uses special metabolic mechanisms to sustain this unique structural component. The cytoplasm of the axon, the axoplasm, is packed with parallel arrays of microtubules and neurofilaments that provide structural stability and a means to rapidly convey materials back and forth between the cell body and the axon terminus. Axons are self-reliant in energy metabolism, taking up glucose and oxygen from their immediate environment to produce ATP. Specialized glial cells called oligodendrocytes contribute in complex ways to axon integrity (see pp. 292-293).

Axons are the message-sending portion of the neuron. The axon carries the neuron's signal, the action potential, to a specific target, such as another neuron or a muscle. Some axons have a special electrical insulation, called myelin, that consists of the coiled cell membranes of glial cells that wrap themselves around the nerve axon (see pp. 292-293). If the axon is not covered with myelin, the action potential travels down the axon by continuous propagation. On the other hand, if the axon is myelinated, the action potential jumps from one node of Ranvier (the space between adjacent myelin segments) to another in a process called saltatory conduction (see pp. 200-201). This adaptation greatly speeds impulse conduction.

Presynaptic Terminals At its target, the axon terminates in multiple endings-the presynaptic terminals-usually designed for rapid conversion of the neuron's electrical signal into a chemical signal. When the action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, it causes the release of chemical signaling molecules in a complex process called synaptic transmission (see Chapters 8 and 13).

The junction formed between the presynaptic terminal and its target is called a chemical synapse. Synapse is derived from the Greek for "joining together" or "junction"; this word and concept were introduced in 1897 by the neurophysiologist Charles Sherrington, whose contributions led to a share of the 1932 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology. (C) N10-2 A synapse comprises the presynaptic terminal, the membrane of the target cell (postsynaptic membrane), and the space between the two (synaptic cleft). In synapses between two neurons, the presynaptic terminals primarily contact dendrites and the cell body. The area of the postsynaptic membrane is frequently amplified to increase the surface that is available for receptors. This amplification can occur either through infolding of the plasma membrane or through the formation of small projections called dendritic spines.

The molecules released by the presynaptic terminals diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. The receptors then convert the chemical signal of the transmitter molecules-either directly or indirectly—back into an electrical signal.

In many ways, neurons can be thought of as highly specialized endocrine cells. They package and store hormones

and hormone-like molecules, which they release rapidly into the extracellular space by exocytosis (see pp. 34-35) in response to an external stimulus, in this case a nerve action potential. However, instead of entering the bloodstream to exert systemic effects, the substances secreted by neurons act over the very short distance of a synapse to communicate locally with a single neighboring cell (see p. 47).

In a different sense, neurons can be thought of as polarized cells with some of the properties of epithelial cells. Like epithelial cells, neurons have different populations of membrane proteins at each of the distinct domains of the neuronal plasma membrane, an arrangement that reflects the individual physiological responsibilities of these domains. Thus, the design of the nervous system permits information transfer across synapses in a selective and coordinated way that serves the needs of the organism and summates to produce complex behavior.

Synapses can undergo long-term changes based on certain patterns of prior activity. This plasticity (see pp. 328-333) is believed to underlie learning and memory.

## The cytoskeleton helps compartmentalize the neuron and also provides the tracks along which material travels between different parts of the neuron

Neurons are compartmentalized in both structure and function. Dendrites are tapered, have limited length, and contain neurotransmitter receptor proteins in their membranes. Axons can be very long and have a high density of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels. Dendrites and the cell body contain messenger RNA, ribosomes, and a Golgi apparatus.

How does this compartmentalization come about? The molecular orientation of microtubules (see pp. 23-25) together with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) play important roles in dictating the vectorial transport of organelles and proteins. (Note that these MAPs are totally unrelated to the mitogen-activated protein [MAP] kinase; see p. 69.) Two major classes of MAPs are found in the brain: high-molecular-weight proteins such as MAP-1 and MAP-2 and lower-molecular-weight tau proteins. Both classes of MAPs associate with microtubules and help link them to other cell components. MAP-2 is most abundant in dendrites, where it may assist in dendrite formation. Tau proteins are confined to axons; their suppression in cultured neurons prevents formation of the axon without altering formation of the dendrites. Hyperphosphorylated tau
proteins can assemble into pathological aggregates called neurofibrillary tangles, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer Disease.

The polarization of microtubules (see pp. 23-25) helps to create remarkable morphological and functional divisions in neurons. In axons, microtubules assemble with their plus ends pointed away from the cell body; this orientation polarizes the flow of material into and out of the axon. The cytoskeletal "order" provided by the microtubules and the MAPs helps define what should or should not be in the axonal cytoplasm. In dendrites, microtubules do not have a consistent orientation, which gives dendrites a greater functional similarity to the soma and perhaps their tapered shape.

The neuron cell body is the main manufacturing site for the membrane proteins and membranous organelles that are necessary for the structural integrity and function of its processes. Axons have little or no intrinsic protein synthetic ability, whereas dendrites have some free ribosomes and are able to engage in limited protein production. The transport of proteins from the cell body all the way to the end of long axons is a challenging task. The neuron also has a second task: moving various material in the opposite direction, from presynaptic terminals at the end of the axon to the cell body. The neuron solves these problems by using two distinct mechanisms for moving material to the presynaptic terminals in an "anterograde" direction and a third mechanism for transport in the opposite or "retrograde" direction (Table 10-2).

Fast Axoplasmic Transport If the flow of materials from the soma to the distant axon terminus were left to the whims of simple diffusion, their delivery would be far too slow to be of practical use. It could take months for needed proteins to diffuse to the end of an axon, and the presynaptic terminals are high-volume consumers of these molecules. To overcome this difficulty, neurons exploit a rapid, pony express-style system of conveyance known as fast axoplasmic transport (see Table 10-2). Membranous organelles, including vesicles and mitochondria, are the principal freight of fast axoplasmic transport. The proteins (some associated with RNA), lipids, and polysaccharides that move at fast rates in axons do so because they have caught a ride with a membranous organelle (i.e., they are sequestered inside the organelle or bound to or inserted into the organellar membrane). The peptide and protein contents of dense-core secretory granules, which are found in the presynaptic axonal

A ANTEROGRADE MOVEMENT

terminals, are synthesized as standard secretory proteins (see pp. 34-35). Thus, they are cotranslationally inserted across the membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently processed in the cisternae of the Golgi complex. They are shipped to the axon in the lumens of Golgi-derived carrier vesicles.

Organelles and vesicles, and their macromolecule payloads, move along microtubules (see p. 23) with the help of a microtubule-dependent motor protein called kinesin
(Fig. 10-2A). The kinesin motor (see p. 25) is itself an ATPase that produces vectorial movement of its payload along the microtubule. This system can move vesicles down the axon at rates of up to $400 \mathrm{~mm} /$ day; variations in cargo speed simply reflect more frequent pauses during the journey. Kinesins always move toward the plus end of microtubules (i.e., away from the cell body), and transport function is lost if the microtubules are disrupted. The nervous system has many forms of kinesin that recognize and transport different

cargo. It is not known how the motor proteins recognize and attach to their intended payloads.

Fast Retrograde Transport Axons move material back toward the cell body via a different motor protein called brain dynein (see p. 25) or MAP-1C (see Fig. 10-2B). Like kinesin, MAP-1C moves along microtubule tracks and is an ATPase (see Table 10-2). However, MAP-1C moves along microtubule in the opposite direction to kinesin (see Fig. 10-2C), though at a slightly slower pace. Retrograde transport provides a mechanism for target-derived growth factors, like nerve growth factor, to reach the nucleus of a neuron where they can influence survival. How this signal is transmitted up the axon has been a persistent question. It may be endocytosed at the axon's terminal and transported to the cell body in a "signaling endosome." The loss of ATP production in axons, as occurs with blockade of oxidative metabolism, causes fast axonal transport in both the anterograde and retrograde directions to fail.

Slow Axoplasmic Transport Axons also have a need for hundreds of other proteins, including cytoskeletal proteins and soluble proteins that are used as enzymes for intermediary metabolism. These proteins are delivered by a slow anterograde axoplasmic transport mechanism that moves material at a mere 0.2 to $8 \mathrm{~mm} /$ day, the nervous system's equivalent of snail mail. The slowest-moving proteins are neurofilament and microtubule subunits ( 0.2 to $1 \mathrm{~mm} /$ day). The mechanism of slow axoplasmic transport is not well understood, but molecular motors operating on microtubule tracks appear to be involved. In fact, the difference between slow and fast axonal transport may primarily be the number of transport interruptions during the long axonal journey.

## Neurons can be classified on the basis of their axonal projection, their dendritic geometry, and the number of processes emanating from the cell body

The trillions of nerve cells in the CNS have great structural diversity. Typically, neurons are classified on the basis of where their axons go (i.e., where they "project"), the geometry of their dendrites, and the number of processes that emanate from the cell body (Fig. 10-3). The real significance of these schemes is that they have functional implications.

Axonal Projection Neurons with long axons that connect with other parts of the nervous system are called projection neurons (or principal neurons or Golgi type I cells). Each of these cells has a clearly defined axon that arises from the axon hillock located on the cell body or proximal dendrite and extends away from the cell body, sometimes for remarkable distances. Some neurons in the cortex, for example, project to the distal part of the spinal cord, a stretch of nearly a meter. All the other processes that a projection neuron has are dendrites. The other type of neuron that is defined in this way has all of its processes confined to one region of the brain. These neurons are called interneurons (or intrinsic neurons or Golgi type II cells). Some of these cells have very short axons, whereas others seem to lack a conventional axon altogether and may be referred to as anaxonal. The anaxonal
neuron in the retina is called an amacrine cell (from the Greek for "no large/long fiber").

Dendritic Geometry A roughly pyramid-shaped set of dendritic branches characterizes pyramidal cells, whereas a radial pattern of dendritic branches defines stellate cells. This classification often includes mention of the presence or absence of dendritic spines-those small, protuberant projections that are sites for synaptic contact. All pyramidal cells appear to have spines, but stellate cells may have them (spiny) or may not (aspiny).

Number of Processes Neurons can also be classified by the number of processes that extend from their cell bodies. The dorsal root ganglion cell is the classic unipolar neuron. The naming of the processes of primary sensory neurons, like the dorsal root ganglion cell, is often ambiguous. The process that extends into the CNS from this unipolar neuron is easily recognized as an axon because it carries information away from the cell body. On the other hand, the process that extends to sensory receptors in the skin and elsewhere is less easily defined. It is a typical axon in the sense that it can conduct an action potential, has myelin, and is characterized by an axonal cytoskeleton. However, it conveys information toward the cell body, which is usually the function of a dendrite. Bipolar neurons, such as the retinal bipolar cell, have two processes extending from opposite sides of the cell body. Most neurons in the brain are multipolar. Cells with many dendritic processes are designed to receive large numbers of synaptic inputs.

Most neurons in the brain can be categorized by two or more of these schemes. For example, the large neurons in the cortical area devoted to movement (i.e., the motor cortex) are multipolar, pyramidal, projection neurons. Similarly, a retinal bipolar cell is both an interneuron and a bipolar cell.

## Glial cells provide a physiological environment for neurons

Glial cells are defined in part by what they lack: axons, action potentials, and synaptic potentials. They are more numerous than neurons and are diverse in structure and function. The main types of CNS glial cells are oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglial cells. In the PNS, the main types of glial cells are satellite cells in autonomic and sensory ganglia, Schwann cells, and enteric glial cells. Glial function is discussed in Chapter 11. Oligodendrocytes form the myelin sheaths of CNS axons, and Schwann cells myelinate peripheral nerves. Glial cells are involved in nearly every function of the brain and are far more than simply "nerve glue," a literal translation of the name neuroglia (from the Greek neuron [nerve] + glia [glue]).

In depictions of the nervous system, the presence of glial cells is sometimes minimized or neglected altogether. Glia fills in almost all the space around neurons, with a narrow extracellular space left between neurons and glial cells that has an average width of only $\sim 0.02 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. Glial cells have a major impact on the composition of the extracellular fluid, which in turn has a major impact on brain function, as we will see in Chapter 11.

| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1. Axonal projection <br> Goes to a distant brain area | Projection neuron or Principal neuron or Golgi type I cell (cortical motor neuron) | Affects different brain areas | Dorsal root ganglion cell <br> (O) |

Figure 10-3 Classification of neurons based on their structure.

## BOX 10-1 Neural Modalities

The type of information, or neural modality, that a neuron transmits is classically categorized by three terms that refer to different attributes of the neuron.

1. The first category defines the direction of information flow.

- Afferent (sensory): neurons that transmit information into the CNS from sensory cells or sensory receptors outside the nervous system. Examples are the dorsal root ganglion cell and neurons in the sensory nucleus of CN V.
- Efferent (motor): neurons that transmit information out of the CNS to muscles or secretory cells. Examples are spinal motor neurons and motor neurons in the ANS.

2. The second category defines the anatomical distribution of the information flow.

- Visceral: neurons that transmit information to or from internal organs or regions that arise embryologically from the branchial arch (e.g., chemoreceptors of the carotid body).
- Somatic: neurons that transmit information to or from all nonvisceral parts of the body, including skin and muscle.

3. The third category, which is somewhat arbitrary, defines the information flow on the basis of the embryological origin of the structure being innervated.

- Special: neurons that transmit information to or from a "special" subset of visceral or somatic structures. For example, in the case of special visceral neurons, information travels to or from structures derived from the branchial arch region of the embryo (e.g., pharyngeal muscles). In the case of special somatic neurons, which handle only sensory information, the neurons arise from the organs of special sense (e.g., retina, taste receptors, cochlea).
- General: neurons that transmit information to or from visceral or somatic structures that are not in the special group.
Each axon in the body conveys information of only a single modality. In this classification scheme, a motor neuron in the spinal cord is described as a general somatic efferent neuron. A motor neuron in the brainstem that innervates branchial arch-derived chewing muscles is described as a special visceral efferent neuron. Because each of these three categories defines two options, you might expect a total of eight distinct neural modalities. In practice, however, only seven neural modalities exist. The term special somatic efferent neuron is not used.


## DEVELOPMENT OF NEURONS AND GLIAL CELLS

## Neurons differentiate from the neuroectoderm

Although the embryology of the nervous system may seem like an odd place to begin studying the physiology of the brain, there are a number of reasons to start here. Knowledge of the embryology of the nervous system greatly facilitates comprehension of its complex organization. Events in the development of the nervous system highlight how different neuronal cell types evolve from a single type of precursor cell
and how these neurons establish astonishingly specific connections. Finally, the characteristics of brain cell proliferation as well as the growth of neuronal processes during development provide insight into the consequences of brain injury.

At the stage of gastrulation, the vertebrate embryo consists of three primitive tissue layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm (Fig. 10-4). The entire nervous system arises from ectoderm, which also gives rise to the skin. Underlying the ectoderm is a specialized cord of mesodermal cells called the notochord. Cells of the notochord somehow direct or "induce" the overlying ectoderm, or neuroectoderm, to form the neural tube in a complex process called neurulation.

The first step in neurulation is formation of the neural plate at about the beginning of the third fetal week. Initially, the neural plate is only a single layer of neuroectoderm cells. Rapid proliferation of these cells, especially at the lateral margins, creates a neural groove bordered by neural folds. Continued cell division enlarges the neural folds, and they eventually fuse dorsally to form the neural tube. The neural tube is open at both ends, the anterior and posterior neuropores. The neural tube ultimately gives rise to the brain and spinal cord. The lumen of the neural tube, the neural canal, becomes the four ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. Congenital malformations of the brain commonly arise from developmental defects in the neural tube (Box 10-2).

The neural crest derives from lateral portions of the neural plate. Neural crest cells migrate to sites in the body where they form the vast majority of the PNS and most of the peripheral cells of the ANS, including the sympathetic ganglia and the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. On the sensory side, these neural crest derivatives include unipolar neurons whose cell bodies are in the dorsal root ganglia, as well as the equivalent sensory cells of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X. Neural crest cells also give rise to several non-neuronal structures, including Schwann cells, satellite glial cells in spinal and cranial ganglia, and pigment cells of the skin.

The human brain begins to exhibit some regional specialization around the fourth gestational week (Fig. 10-5A, B). By then, it is possible to discern an anterior part called the prosencephalon, a midsection called the mesencephalon, and a posterior part called the rhombencephalon. Rapid brain growth ensues, and important new regions emerge in just another week (see Fig. 10-5C). Distinct regions called brain vesicles, which are destined to become separate parts of the adult brain, are set apart as swellings in the rostralcaudal plane (see Fig. 10-5B, C). The prosencephalon is now divisible into the telencephalon, which will give rise to the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex, and the diencephalon, which becomes the thalamus, subthalamus, hypothalamus, and neurohypophysis (the posterior or neural portion of the pituitary). Similarly, the rhombencephalon can now be divided into the metencephalon, which will give rise to the pons and cerebellum, and the myelencephalon, which becomes the medulla. Robust development of the cerebral cortex becomes apparent in mammals, especially humans, after the seventh week. This structure gradually expands so that it enwraps the rostral structures.

![bo04099069a0](bo04099069a0.jpg)

Figure 10-5 Embryonic development of the brain.

As the neural tube thickens with cell proliferation, a groove called the sulcus limitans forms on the inner, lateral wall of the neural tube (Fig. 10-6A). This anatomical landmark extends throughout the neural tube except in the farthest rostral area that will become the diencephalon and cortex. The sulcus limitans divides the neural tube into a ventral area called the basal plate and a dorsal area called the alar plate.

Structures that derive from the basal plate mediate efferent functions, and structures that arise from the alar plate mediate afferent and associative functions. Efferent neurons are mainly motor neurons that convey information from the CNS to outside effectors (i.e., muscles or secretory cells). In a strict sense, the only true afferent neurons are those that derive from neural crest cells and that convey sensory information from various kinds of receptors to the CNS. In the CNS, these afferent neurons synapse on other neurons derived from the alar plate; these alar plate neurons may be referred to as afferent because they receive sensory information and pass it along to other parts of the CNS. However, it is also appropriate to call these alar plate-derived neurons associative.

The development of the spinal cord and medulla illustrates how this early anatomical division into alar and basal plates helps make sense of the final organization of these complex regions. Neurons of the alar and basal plates proliferate, migrate, and aggregate into discrete groups that have functional specificity. In the spinal cord (see Fig. 10-6B, C), the basal plate develops into the ventral horn, which contains the cell bodies of somatic motor neurons, and the intermediolateral column, which contains the cell bodies of autonomic motor neurons. Both regions contain interneurons.

The alar plate in the spinal cord develops into the dorsal horn, which contains the cell bodies onto which sensory neurons synapse.

In the medulla (see Fig. 10-6D, E), as well as in the rest of the brain, aggregates of neurons are called nuclei. Nuclei that develop from the alar plate are generally afferent, such as the nucleus tractus solitarii, which plays an important sensory role in the ANS. Nuclei that develop from the basal plate are generally efferent, such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, which plays an important motor role in the ANS. The choroid plexus that invaginates into the lumen of the central canal is responsible for secreting cerebrospinal fluid (see pp. 278-279).

## Neurons and glial cells originate from cells in the proliferating germinal matrix near the ventricles

The trillions of neurons and glial cells that populate the brain arise from rapidly dividing stem cells called neuroepithelial cells ( $\mathbf{N 1 0 - 3}$ located near the ventricles (which derive from the neural canal) of the embryonic CNS. This germinal area is divided into two regions, the ventricular zone (VZ) and the subventricular zone (SVZ). Most of the neurons in the human brain are generated during the first 120 days of embryogenesis. Growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor and hormones such as growth hormone influence the rate of cell division of the neuroepithelial cells. The signals that direct one immature neuron to become a cortical pyramidal cell and another to become a retinal ganglion cell are not understood. Neuroepithelial cells generate different classes of neural precursor cells that develop into different mature cell types. In

## Contributed by Bruce Ransom

The general rule that neurons are created only during embryonic development and are never replaced is valid in a practical sense for all parts of the mammalian CNS except for the olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, which may retain a population of true stem cells. Stem cells are cells that have the ability to do the following:

1. Proliferate
2. Renew themselves over the life of the organism
3. Create fully differentiated cells through progenitor cells
4. Retain their multilineage potential throughout life
5. Replace cells lost to injury or disease

These stem cells create mature brain cells by engaging in asymmetrical cell division, which yields one stem cell and one cell that begins on the path to terminal differentiation. This latter cell is called a progenitor cell. It may continue to divide, but its progeny are committed to a particular line of cell differentiation (e.g., neurons or astrocytes, but not both). Stem cells can also engage in symmetrical division and simply create two new stem cells.

The stem cells of the nervous system are capable of generating neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. A slowly dividing population of presumed stem cells resides in the subependymal area of the lateral ventricles (i.e., analogous to the germinal matrix of the fetal brain; see pp. 263-267). These cells are apparently the source for the olfactory neurons that are continually renewed during life. Adult stem cells from the brain proliferate in response to epidermal growth factor. It is not understood how to make these cells produce progenitor cells for neurons or glial cells. Eventually it is hoped that, by sending stem cells the right sequence of signals, it might be possible to replace neurons lost to injury or disease.

## BOX 10-2 Abnormalities of Neural Tube Closure

Closure of the neural tube in humans normally occurs between 26 and 28 days of gestation. A disturbance in this process results in a midline congenital abnormality called a dysraphism (from the Greek dys [abnormal] + rhaphe [seam or suture]). The defect can be so devastating that it is incompatible with life or, alternatively, have so little consequence that it goes unnoticed throughout life. These midline embryonic abnormalities also involve the primitive mesoderm and ectoderm associated with the neural tube. Therefore, the vertebral bodies or skull (derived from mesoderm) and the overlying skin (derived from ectoderm) may be affected along with the nervous system.

The most serious neural tube defect, occurring in 1 of 1000 deliveries, is anencephaly, in which the cerebral hemispheres are absent and the rest of the brain is severely malformed. Overlying malformations of the skull, brain coverings, and scalp are present (Table 10-3). Affected fetuses are often spontaneously aborted.

The most common dysraphisms affect formation of the spinal vertebral bodies and are called spina bifida. The problem may be slight and cause only a minor abnormality in closure of the vertebral arch, called spina bifida occulta (Fig. 10-7A). This malformation affects $\sim 10 \%$ of the population, usually at the fifth lumbar or first sacral vertebra, and generally causes no significant sequelae. If the dura and arachnoid membranes herniate (i.e., protrude) through the vertebral defect, the malformation is called spina bifida cystica (see Fig. 10-7B); if the spinal cord also herniates through the defect, it is called myelomeningocele (see Fig. 10-7C). These latter problems are often more significant and may cause severe neurological disability.

Genetic and nongenetic factors can cause dysraphism. Some severe forms of this condition appear to be inherited, although the genetic pattern suggests that multiple genes are involved. Nongenetic factors such as folic acid deficiency may also play a role. Mothers taking folic acid (see p. 1143) before and during the periconceptional period have a decreased risk of having a fetus with a neural tube closure defect. Current medical recommendations are that women contemplating becoming pregnant receive folic acid supplementation, and it has been suggested that bread products should be enriched with folic acid to ensure that women will have the protective advantage of this vitamin if they become pregnant. Other factors that increase the risk of these defects are maternal heat exposure (e.g., from a hot tub) and certain drugs such as the anticonvulsant valproate. Neural tube disorders can be detected during pregnancy by measuring the concentration of $\alpha$-fetoprotein in maternal blood or amniotic fluid. $\alpha$-fetoprotein is synthesized by the fetal liver and, for unclear reasons, increases in concentration abnormally with failure of neural tube closure.
the developing brain, radial glial cells (or just radial cells), so called because their processes extend from the ventricular surface to the brain's outer surface (Fig. 10-8A), appear very early in neurogenesis and generate most of the projection neurons in forebrain cortex. Inhibitory interneurons, in contrast, arise from neural precursor cells located in the SVZ. Neurons are probably not fully differentiated when first created, and their mature characteristics may depend on their interactions with the chemical environment or other cells in a specific anatomical region of the nervous system.

The VZ appears to produce separate progenitor cells that produce only neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and ependymal cells (see Fig. 10-8B). The VZ does not contribute to the population of Schwann cells, which derive from neural crest tissue, or to microglial cells, which arise from the mesodermal cells that briefly invade the brain during early postnatal development. Recent work shows that the embryonic and perinatal VZ and SVZ may give rise to the adult SVZ, which is in part responsible for limited adult neurogenesis.

Neuronal progenitor cells appear earliest and produce nearly the entire complement of adult neurons during early embryonic life. Glial cells arise later in development. Neurons are confined to specific locations of the brain, whereas glial cells are more evenly distributed.

Figure 10-8 Arrangement of radial glial cells and migrating neurons. A, The upper portion is a coronal section of the developing occipital cerebral lobe of fetal monkey brain. The lower portion is a magnified view. The VZ contains the germinal cells that give rise to the neurons as well as to the cell bodies of the radial glial cells (or, simply, radial cells). These radial cells extend from the ventricular surface to the pial surface, which overlies the developing cortex. B, This more magnified view shows the cell bodies of radial cells as well as their processes that extend upward toward the cortex. Also shown are two migratory neuroblasts moving from the VZ toward the cortex along the fibers of the radial cells. The right part of the panel shows that, in the postnatal VZ, the radial cell can give rise to several major classes of cells. (Data from Rakic P: Mode of cell migration to the superficial layers of fetal monkey neocortex.

Cereb Cortex 13:580-587, 2003.)

Many more neurons are created during fetal development than are present in the adult brain. Most neurons, having migrated to a final location in the brain and differentiated, are lost through a process called programmed cell death, or apoptosis (Greek for "falling off"; see p. 1241). Apoptosis is a unique form of cell death that requires protein synthesis and can be triggered by removal of specific trophic influences, such as the action of a growth factor. In contrast to necrotic cell death, which rapidly leads to loss of cell membrane integrity after some insult causes a toxic increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, apoptosis evolves more slowly. For example, in the retina, $\sim 60 \%$ of the ganglion cells and thus $\sim 60 \%$ of the retinal axons are lost in the first 2 weeks of extrauterine life as a result of programmed retinal ganglion cell death. This process of sculpting the final form of a neuronal system by discarding neurons through programmed death is a common theme in developmental biology.

The number of glial cells in different areas of the brain appears to be determined by signals from nearby neurons or axons. For example, in the optic nerve, the final number of glial cells in the nerve is closely determined by the number of axons. When programmed cell death is prevented by expression of the bcl-2 gene in transgenic animals, the number of axons in the optic nerve, as well as the number of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, is dramatically increased. Thus, glial cell-axon ratios remain relatively constant. The axon-dependent signal or signals responsible for these adjustments in glial cell number are not known, but the process appears to operate by influencing both survival and proliferation of glial cells.

## Neurons migrate to their correct anatomical position in the brain with the help of adhesion molecules

During embryogenesis, the long processes of radial cells create an organized, cellular scaffolding on which neurons can migrate to their final position in the brain shortly after they appear. Migrating neurons contact radial cells (see Fig. $10-8 B$ ) and move along their processes toward their final positions in the developing cortex. Thus, the prearranged positions of these radial processes determine the direction of neuronal migration. The importance of the radial framework for assisting neuronal migration is illustrated by the failure of neurons to populate the cortex normally when the radial processes are interrupted by hemorrhage in the fetal brain.

The navigation mechanisms used by migrating cells in the nervous system and elsewhere in the body are only partially understood. Proteins that promote selective cellular aggregation are called cell-cell adhesion molecules (CAMs; see p. 17) and include the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent cadherins and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ independent neural cell adhesion molecules (N-CAMs). These molecules are expressed by developing cells in an organized, sequential manner. Cells that express the appropriate adhesion molecules have a strong tendency to adhere to one another. These Velcro-like molecules can assemble cells in a highly ordered fashion; experimentally, disrupted germ cells can properly reorganize themselves into a three-layered structure that replicates the normal embryonic pattern.

Another mechanism that assists migrating cells is the presence of extracellular matrix molecules such as laminin
and fibronectin (see p. 17). These glycoproteins are selectively secreted by both neurons and astrocytes and form a kind of extracellular roadway with which migrating cells can interact. Growing axons express at their surface cell matrix adhesion molecules called integrins that bind laminin and fibronectin. As a result, growing axons move together in fascicles.

Perhaps the least understood mechanism related to cell migration is chemotaxis, the ability of a cell to follow a chemical signal emitted from a target cell. The tips of developing or regenerating axons, called growth cones, follow such chemical cues as they grow toward their specific targets, propelled by coordinated extension of microtubules and thin filaments. Coordinated growth-cone movement also involves continuous polymerization of tubulin and actin at the leading edge of the growth cone and depolymerization at the trailing edge. This process requires that the recognition proteins on growth cones generate intracellular signals when they encounter path-finding signals. For example, a molecule called netrin, secreted by midline cells, attracts developing axons destined to cross the midline. On the other hand, molecules like slit repel axons by interacting with specific receptors on the growth cone. Such signals steer axon growth cones, perhaps by localized changes in intracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, which leads to the strategic insertion of new patches of membrane on the surface of the growth cone.

## Neurons do not regenerate

Neurons Most human neurons arise in about the first 4 months of intrauterine life. After birth, neurons do not divide, and if a neuron is lost for any reason, it is generally not replaced, which is the main reason for the relatively limited recovery from serious brain and spinal cord injuries. It has been argued that this lack of regenerative ability is a design principle to ensure that learned behavior and memories are preserved in stable populations of neurons throughout life. A notable exception to this rule is olfactory bulb neurons, which are continually renewed throughout adult life by a population of stem cells or neuronal progenitor cells. (○) N10-3 As noted above (see pp. 263-265), cells in the adult SVZ have the capacity to generate neurons and may do so to a limited extent throughout life. Learning how to induce these cells to make functional new CNS neurons after severe neural injury is the holy grail of regeneration research.

Axons Another reason that relatively little recovery follows severe brain and spinal cord injury is that axons within the CNS do not regenerate effectively. This lack of axon regeneration in the CNS is in sharp contrast to the behavior of axons in the PNS, which can regrow and reconnect to appropriate end organs, either muscle or sensory receptors. For example, if the median nerve of the forearm is crushed by blunt trauma, the distal axon segments die off in a process called wallerian degeneration (see Box 10-3) because the sustaining relationship with their proximal cell bodies is lost. These PNS axons can slowly regenerate and connect to muscles and sensory receptors in the hand. It is believed that the inability of CNS axons to regenerate is the fault of the local environment more than it is an intrinsic

## BOX 10-3 Axonal Degeneration and Regeneration

Axons have their own mitochondria and produce the ATP that they need to maintain the steep ion gradients necessary for excitability and survival. In this sense, they are metabolically independent of the cell body. However, they cannot make proteins and are unable to sustain themselves if separated from the cell body (see Fig. 10-2A). If an axon is cut in either the PNS or the CNS, a characteristic series of changes takes place (Fig. 10-9):
Step 1: Degeneration of the synaptic terminals distal to the lesion. Synaptic transmission occurring at the axon terminal fails within hours because this complex process is dependent on material provided by axonal transport. Visible changes in the degenerating terminal are seen a few days after the lesion. The terminal retracts from the postsynaptic target.
Step 2: Wallerian degeneration. The lesion divides the axon into proximal and distal segments. The distal segment degenerates slowly during a period of several weeks in a process named after its discoverer, Augustus Waller. Eventually, the entire distal segment is destroyed and removed.
Step 3: Myelin degeneration. If the affected axon is myelinated, the myelin degenerates. The myelinating cell (i.e., the Schwann cell in the PNS and the oligodendrocyte in the CNS) usually survives this process. Schwann cells are immediately induced to divide, and they begin to synthesize trophic factors that may be important for regeneration.
Step 4: Scavenging of debris. Microglia in the CNS and macrophages and Schwann cells in the PNS scavenge the debris created by the breakdown of the axon and its myelin. This step is more rapid in the PNS than in the CNS.
Step 5: Chromatolysis. After axonal injury, most neuron cell bodies swell and undergo a characteristic rearrangement of organelles called chromatolysis. The nucleus also swells and moves to an eccentric position. The endoplasmic reticulum, normally close to the nucleus, reassembles around the periphery of the cell body. Chromatolysis is reversible if the neuron survives and is able to re-establish its distal process and contact the appropriate target.
Step 6: Retrograde transneuronal degeneration. Neurons that are synaptically connected to injured neurons may themselves be injured, a condition called transneuronal or trans-synaptic degeneration. If the neuron that synapses on the injured cell undergoes degeneration, it is called retrograde degeneration.
Step 7: Anterograde transneuronal degeneration. If a neuron that received synaptic contacts from an injured cell degenerates, it is called anterograde degeneration. The magnitude of these transneuronal effects (retrograde and anterograde degeneration) is quite variable.
property of these axons. For example, on their surface, oligodendrocytes and myelin carry molecules, such as myelin-associated glycoprotein, that inhibit axon growth. Experiments have shown that if severed CNS axons are given the opportunity to regrow in the same environment that surrounds axons in the PNS, they are capable of regrowth

and can make functional connections with CNS targets. The remarkable ability of damaged peripheral nerves to regenerate, even in mammals, has encouraged hope that CNS axons might, under the right conditions, be able to perform this same feat. It would mean that victims of spinal cord injury might walk again.

Glia Unlike neurons, glial cells can be replaced if they are lost or injured in an adult. Such repopulation depends on progenitor cells committed to the glial cell lineage. Either the progenitor cells reside in a latent state (or are slowly turning over) in adult brains or true multipotential stem cells are activated by specific conditions, such as brain injury, to produce de novo glial progenitors. The most typical reaction of mammalian brains to a wide range of injuries is the formation of an astrocytic glial scar. This scar is produced primarily by an enlargement of individual astrocytes, a process called hypertrophy, and increased expression of a particular cytoskeleton protein, glial acidic fibrillary protein. Only a small degree of astrocytic proliferation (i.e., an increase in cell number) accompanies this reaction. Microglial cells, which derive from cells related to the monocyte-macrophage lineage in blood and not from neuroepithelium, also react strongly to brain injury and are the main cells that proliferate at the injury site.

## SUBDIVISIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

A rudimentary knowledge of the anatomy of the nervous system is a prerequisite to discussion of its physiology. This section provides an overview of nervous system anatomy that builds on what has already been discussed about its embryological development. We in turn consider the CNS, PNS, and ANS (see Table 10-1).

The directional terms used to describe brain structures can be somewhat confusing because the human nervous system, unlike that of lower vertebrates, bends during development. Thus, the dorsal surface of the cerebral cortex is also superior, whereas the dorsal surface of the spinal cord is also posterior (Fig. 10-10A).

## The CNS consists of the telencephalon, cerebellum, diencephalon, midbrain, pons, medulla, and spinal cord

The CNS can be conveniently divided into five major areas: (1) telencephalon, (2) cerebellum, (3) diencephalon, (4) brainstem (consisting of the midbrain, pons, and medulla), and (5) spinal cord (see Fig. 10-10B). Each of these areas has symmetrical right and left sides.

Telencephalon One of the crowning glories of evolution is the human cerebral cortex, the most conspicuous part of the paired cerebral hemispheres. The human cerebral cortex has a surface area of $\sim 2200 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and is estimated to contain 1.5 to $2 \times 10^{10}$ neurons. The number of synaptic contacts between these cells is $\sim 3 \times 10^{14}$. The cortical surface area of mammals increases massively from mouse to monkey to humans in a ratio of $1: 100: 1000$. The capacity for information processing by this neural machine is staggering and includes a remarkable range of functions: thinking, learning, memory, and consciousness.

The cortex is topographically organized in two ways. First, certain areas of the cortex mediate specific functions. For example, the area that mediates motor control is a welldefined strip of cortex located in the frontal lobe (see Fig. 10-10C). Second, within a portion of cortex that manages a specific function (e.g., motor control, somatic sensation,

hearing, or vision), the parts of the body spatially map onto this cortex in an orderly way. We discuss this principle of somatotopy on pp. 400-401.

Another part of the telencephalon is the great mass of axons that stream into and out of the cerebral cortex and connect it with other regions. The corpus callosum and smaller white matter tracts interconnect the two cerebral hemispheres. The volume of axons needed to interconnect cortical neurons increases as a power function of cortical volume, which rises so dramatically from mice to humans. Thus, the relative volume of white matter to gray matter is 5 -fold greater in humans than in mice. The final parts of the telencephalon are the basal ganglia, a functionally related group of neuron clusters consisting of the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen), globus pallidus, amygdala, and hippocampal formation. These are all paired structures. The basal ganglia have indirect connections with motor portions of the cerebral cortex and are involved in motor control. The amygdala participates in the expression of emotion, and the hippocampal formation is crucial in the formation of new memories. Indeed, injury to both hippocampal formations can cause a severe amnestic disorder.

Cerebellum This brain region lies immediately dorsal to the brainstem. Although the cerebellum represents only $\sim 10 \%$ of the CNS by volume, it contains $\sim 50 \%$ of all CNS neurons. The exceedingly large number of input connections to the cerebellum conveys information from nearly every type of receptor in the nervous system, including visual and auditory input. Combined, these afferent fibers outnumber the efferent projections by an estimated ratio of $40: 1$.

Functionally and by virtue of its connections, the cerebellum can be divided into three parts. Phylogenetically, the vestibulocerebellum (also called the archicerebellum) is the oldest of these three parts, followed by the spinocerebellum (also called the paleocerebellum) and then by the cerebrocerebellum (also called the neocerebellum).

The vestibulocerebellum is closely related to the vestibular system, whose sensors are located in the inner ear and whose way stations are located in the pons and medulla. It helps maintain the body's balance. The spinocerebellum receives strong input from muscle stretch receptors through connections in the spinal cord and brainstem. It helps regulate muscle tone. The cerebrocerebellum, the largest part of the human cerebellum, receives a massive number of projections from sensorimotor portions of the cerebral cortex through neurons in the pons. It coordinates motor behavior. Much of the cerebellum's output reaches the contralateral (i.e., on the opposite side of the body) motor cortex by way of the thalamus. Other efferent projections reach neurons in all three parts of the brainstem.

Diencephalon This brain region consists of the thalamus, the subthalamus, and the hypothalamus, each with a very different function. The thalamus is the main integrating station for sensory information that is bound for the cerebral cortex, where it will reach the level of conscious perception. Control of arousal and certain aspects of memory function also reside in discrete areas of the thalamus. Along with the subthalamus, the thalamus receives projections from the basal ganglia that are important for motor function. Input to the thalamus from the cerebellum (specifically, the cerebro-
cerebellum) is important for normal motor control. Patients with Parkinson disease, a severe movement disorder, gradually lose the ability to make voluntary movements; in some of these patients, it is possible to improve movement by stimulating certain areas of the subthalamus.

The hypothalamus is the CNS structure that most affects the ANS. It performs this function through strong, direct connections with autonomic nuclei in the brainstem and spinal cord. It also acts as part of the endocrine system in two major ways. First, specialized neurons located within specific nuclei in the hypothalamus synthesize certain hormones (e.g., arginine vasopressin and oxytocin) and transport them down their axons to the posterior pituitary gland, where the hormones are secreted into the blood. Second, other specialized neurons in other nuclei synthesize "releasing hormones" (e.g., gonadotropin-releasing hormone) and release them into a plexus of veins, called a portal system, that carries the releasing hormones to cells in the anterior pituitary. There, the releasing hormones stimulate certain cells (e.g., gonadotrophs) to secrete hormones (e.g., folliclestimulating hormone or luteinizing hormone) into the bloodstream. We discuss these principles starting on p. 978. The hypothalamus also has specialized centers that play important roles in controlling body temperature (see p. 1200), hunger (see p. 1001), thirst (see pp. 845-846), and the cardiovascular system. It is the main control center of the ANS.

Brainstem (Midbrain, Pons, and Medulla) The brainstem lies immediately above, or rostral to, the spinal cord. Like the spinal cord, the midbrain, pons, and medulla have a segmental organization, receive sensory (afferent) information, and send out motor (efferent) signals through paired nerves that are called cranial nerves. The midbrain, pons, and medulla also contain important control centers for the ANS (see Chapter 14). Not only are motor neurons, autonomic neurons, and sensory neurons present at each level, but the caudal brainstem serves as a conduit for a large volume of axons traveling from higher CNS centers to the spinal cord (descending pathways) and vice versa (ascending pathways). Additionally, this portion of the brainstem contains a loosely organized interconnected collection of neurons and fibers called the reticular formation. This neuronal network has diffuse connections with the cortex and other brain regions and affects the level of consciousness or arousal.

The midbrain has somatic motor neurons that control eye movement. These neurons reside in the nuclei for cranial nerve III (CN III) and CN IV. Other midbrain neurons are part of a system, along with the cerebellum and cortex, for motor control. The midbrain also contains groups of neurons that are involved in relaying signals related to hearing and vision.

Just caudal to the midbrain is the pons, which contains the somatic motor neurons that control mastication (nucleus for CN V), eye movement (nucleus for CN VI), and facial muscles (nucleus for CN VII). The pons also receives somatic sensory information from the face, scalp, mouth, and nose (portion of the nucleus for CN V). It is also involved in processing information that is related to hearing and equilibrium (nucleus for CN VIII). Neurons in the ventral pons receive input from the cortex, and these neurons in turn

form a massive direct connection with the cerebellum (see above) that is crucial for coordinating motor movements.

The most caudal portion of the brainstem is the medulla. The organization of the medulla is most similar to that of the spinal cord. The medulla contains somatic motor neurons that innervate the muscles of the neck (nucleus of CN XI) and tongue (nucleus of CN XII). Along with the pons, the medulla is involved in controlling blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, and digestion (nuclei of CN IX and X). The medulla is the first CNS way station for information traveling from the special senses of hearing and equilibrium.

Spinal Cord Continuous with the caudal portion of the medulla is the spinal cord. The spinal cord runs from the base of the skull to the end of the body of the first lumbar vertebra (L1). Thus, it does not run the full length of the vertebral column in adults.

The spinal cord consists of 31 segments that each have a motor and sensory nerve root. (The sensory nerve root of the first cervical segment is very small and can be missing.) These nerve roots combine to form 31 bilaterally symmetrical pairs of spinal nerves. The spinal roots, nerves, and ganglia are part of the PNS (see below).

Sensory information from the skin, muscle, and visceral organs enters the spinal cord through fascicles of axons called dorsal roots (Fig. 10-11A). The point of entry is called the dorsal root entry zone. Dorsal root axons have their cell bodies of origin in the spinal ganglia (i.e., dorsal root ganglia) associated with that spinal segment.

Ventral roots contain strictly efferent fibers (see Fig. 10-11B). These fibers arise from motor neurons (i.e., general somatic efferent neurons) whose cell bodies are located in the ventral (or anterior) gray horns of the spinal cord (gray because they contain mainly cell bodies without myelin) and from preganglionic autonomic neurons (i.e., general visceral efferent neurons) whose cell bodies are located in the intermediolateral gray horns (i.e., between the dorsal and ventral gray horns) of the cord. Most of the efferent fibers are somatic efferents that innervate skeletal muscle to mediate voluntary movement. The other fibers are visceral efferents that synapse with postganglionic autonomic neurons, which in turn innervate visceral smooth muscle or glandular tissue.

Each segment of the spinal cord contains groups of associative neurons in its dorsal gray horns. Some but not all incoming sensory fibers synapse on these associative neurons, which in turn contribute axons to fiber paths that both mediate synaptic interactions within the spinal cord and convey information to more rostral areas of the CNS by way of several conspicuous ascending tracts of axons (see Fig. 10-11C). Similarly, descending tracts of axons from the cerebral cortex and brainstem control the motor neurons whose cell bodies are in the ventral horn, which leads to coordinated voluntary or posture-stabilizing movements. The most important of these descending tracts is called the lateral corticospinal tract; $\sim 90 \%$ of its cell bodies of origin are in the contralateral cerebral cortex. These ascending and descending tracts are located in the white portion of the spinal cord (white because it contains mostly myelinated axons). The spatial organization of spinal cord neurons and fiber tracts is complex but orderly and varies somewhat among the 31 segments.

If sensory fibers enter the spinal cord and synapse directly on motor neurons in that same segment, this connection underlies a simple segmental reflex or interaction. If the incoming fibers synapse with neurons in other spinal segments, they can participate in an intersegmental reflex or interaction. Finally, if the incoming signals travel rostrally to the brainstem before they synapse, they constitute a suprasegmental interaction.

## The PNS comprises the cranial and spinal nerves, their associated sensory ganglia, and various sensory receptors

The PNS serves four main purposes: (1) it transduces physical or chemical stimuli both from the external environment and from within the body into raw sensory information through receptors; (2) it conveys sensory information to the CNS along axon pathways; (3) it conveys motor signals from the CNS along axon pathways to target organs, primarily skeletal and smooth muscle; and (4) it converts the motor signals to chemical signals at synapses on target tissues in the periphery. Figure 10-11B summarizes these four functions for a simple reflex arc in which a painful stimulus to the foot results in retraction of the foot from the source of the pain.

Like the CNS, the PNS can be divided into somatic and autonomic parts. The somatic division includes the sensory neurons and axons that innervate the skin, joints, and muscle as well as the motor axons that innervate skeletal muscle. The somatic division of the PNS primarily deals with the body's external environment, either to gather information about this environment or to interact with it through voluntary motor behavior. The ANS, discussed in the next section and in Chapter 14, is a functionally distinct part of both the CNS and PNS (see Table 10-1). The autonomic portion of the PNS consists of the motor and sensory axons that innervate smooth muscle, the exocrine glands, and other viscera. This division mainly deals with the body's internal environment.

Three important aspects of the PNS are discussed in other chapters. Sensory transduction is reviewed in Chapter 15, synaptic transmission in Chapters 8 and 13, and peripheral neuronal circuits in Chapter 16. Here, we focus primarily on the system of axons that is such a prominent feature of the PNS.

Axons in the PNS are organized into bundles called peripheral nerves (Fig. 10-12). These nerves contain, in a large nerve such as the sciatic nerve, tens of thousands of axons. Individual axons are surrounded by loose connective tissue called the endoneurium. Within the nerve, axons are bundled together in small groups called fascicles, each one covered by a connective tissue sheath known as the perineurium. The perineurium contributes structural stability to the nerve. Fascicles are grouped together and surrounded by a matrix of connective tissue called the epineurium. Fascicles within a nerve anastomose with neighboring fascicles. Axons shift from one fascicle to another along the length of the nerve, but they tend to remain in roughly the same general area within the nerve over long distances. The interlocking meshwork of fascicles adds further mechanical strength to the nerve. Axons range in diameter from $<1$ to $20 \mu \mathrm{~m}$.

Figure 10-11 Spinal cord. A, Each spinal segment has dorsal and ventral nerve roots that carry sensory and motor nerve fibers, respectively. B, The simple "flexor" reflex arc is an illustration of the four functions of the PNS: (1) a receptor transduces a painful stimulus into an action potential, (2) a primary sensory neuron conveys the information to the CNS, (3) the CNS conveys information to the target organ via a motor neuron, and (4) the electrical signals are converted to signals at the motor end plate. C, Ascending pathways, which carry information to more rostral areas of the CNS, are shown on the left. Descending pathways, which carry information in the opposite direction, are shown on the right.

Because axons are extremely fragile, adaptations that enhance mechanical stability are very important. Nervous tissue in the PNS is designed to be much tougher, physically, than that in the CNS. The PNS must be mechanically flexible, tolerant of minor physical trauma, and sustainable by a blood supply that is less dependable than the one providing for the CNS. A spinal cord transplanted to the lower part of the leg would not survive the running of a $100-\mathrm{m}$ dash.

Axons in peripheral nerves are closely associated with Schwann cells. In the case of a myelinated axon, a Schwann cell forms a myelinated wrap around a single adjacent axon, a single internodal myelin segment between 250 and $1000 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in length. Many such internodal myelin segments, and thus many Schwann cells, are necessary to myelinate the entire length of the axon. In an unmyelinated nerve, the Schwann cell surrounds but does not wrap multiple times around

Figure 10-12 Peripheral nerve.
axons. Unmyelinated axons outnumber myelinated axons by about $2: 1$ in typical human nerves. Diseases that affect the PNS can disrupt nerve function by causing either loss of myelin or axonal injury.

The functional organization of a peripheral nerve is best illustrated by a typical thoracic spinal nerve and its branches. Every spinal nerve is formed by the dorsal and ventral roots joining together and emerging from the spinal cord at that segmental level (see Fig. 10-11). The dorsal roots coalesce and display a spindle-shaped swelling called the spinal or dorsal root ganglion, which contains the cell bodies of the sensory axons in the dorsal roots. Individual neurons are called dorsal root ganglion cells or spinal ganglion cells and are typical unipolar neurons that give rise to a single process that bifurcates in a T-like manner into a peripheral and central branch (see Fig. 10-3). The central branch carries sensory information into the CNS and the peripheral branch terminates as a sensory ending. The peripheral process, which brings information toward the cell body, meets one definition of a dendrite; however, it has all the physiological and morphological features of a peripheral axon.

Spinal nerves divide into several branches that distribute motor and sensory axons to the parts of the body associated with that segment. Axons conveying autonomic motor or autonomic sensory signals also travel in these branches. These branches are said to be "mixed" because they contain both efferent and afferent axons. Further nerve division occurs as axons travel to supply their targets, such as the skin, muscle, or blood vessels. In the case of thoracic spinal nerves, the subdivision is orderly and has a similar pattern
for most of the nerves. In the cervical and lumbosacral areas, however, the spinal nerves from different segments of the spinal cord intermingle to form a nerve plexus. The subsequent course of the nerves in the upper and lower extremities is complex. The pattern of cutaneous innervation of the body is shown in Figure 10-13. The area of cutaneous innervation provided by a single dorsal root and its ganglion is called a dermatome. Severing a single dorsal root does not produce anesthesia in that dermatome because of overlap between the cutaneous innervation provided by adjacent dorsal roots. The sole exception to this rule is the C 2 root, sectioning of which causes a patch of analgesia on the back of the head; neither C3 nor the trigeminal nerve innervates skin in this area. Also note that no dermatomes are shown for the first cervical and the coccygeal segments because the dermatomes are small or, in the case of the first cervical segment, may be missing.

## The ANS innervates effectors that are not under voluntary control

The nervous system regulates some physiological mechanisms in a way that is independent or autonomous of voluntary control. Control of body temperature is an example of a fundamental process that most individuals cannot consciously regulate. Other examples include blood pressure and heart rate. The absence of voluntary control means that the ANS has little cortical representation.

The ANS has three divisions: sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric. The sympathetic and parasympathetic

# BOX 10-4 Peripheral Nerve Disease 

The symptoms of peripheral nerve disease, or neuropathy, are numbness (i.e., a sensory deficit) and weakness (i.e., a motor deficit). Such symptoms may arise from disturbances in many parts of the nervous system. How, then, can one tell whether a problem is the result of disease in the PNS?

Motor axons directly innervate and have "trophic" effects on skeletal muscle. If the axon is cut or dies, this trophic influence is lost and the muscle undergoes denervation atrophy. In addition, individual muscle fibers may twitch spontaneously (fibrillation). The cause of fibrillation is still debated, but it may be related to the observation that acetylcholine receptors spread beyond the neuromuscular junction and become "supersensitive" to their agonist. If true, these observations imply continuing exposure to acetylcholine, even if it is in smaller quantities. Schwann cells at denervated junctions may be the source of acetylcholine. When a motor axon is first damaged but has not yet lost continuity with the muscle fibers that it innervates, these muscle cells may twitch in unison. These small twitches can be seen under the skin and are called fasciculations. They are probably due to spontaneous action potentials in dying or injured motor neurons or their axons.

When the PNS is affected by a diffuse or generalized disease (e.g., the result of a metabolic problem or toxin), all peripheral nerves are involved, but symptoms arise first in the longest nerves of the body (i.e., those traveling from the spinal cord to the feet). This predilection for affecting the longest nerves often causes a "stocking pattern" defect in sensation and sometimes in strength. If both the feet and hands are affected, the process is called a "stocking and glove" defect. With progression of the disease, the level of involvement moves centripetally (i.e., up the leg, toward the trunk), and the sensory or motor dysfunction comes to involve more proximal portions of the legs and arms. One of the most common causes of this diffuse pattern of PNS involvement is the sensorimotor polyneuropathy associated with diabetes. Other causes include chronic renal failure (uremia), thiamine deficiency (often seen with alcohol abuse), and heavy-metal poisoning.

If a patient exhibits weakness or sensory loss that is associated with muscle fibrillation and atrophy and a stocking or stocking and glove pattern of sensory disturbance, a PNS problem is likely. Patients with peripheral neuropathy may also complain of tingling sensations (paresthesias) or pain in areas of the body supplied by the diseased nerves.
divisions have both CNS and PNS parts. The enteric division lies entirely within the PNS. The parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent systems are composed of two-neuron pathways. The cell body of the first neuron is located in the CNS and that of the second in the PNS. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions innervate most visceral organs and have a yin-yang functional relationship. The enteric division regulates the rhythmic contraction of intestinal smooth muscle and also regulates the secretory functions of intestinal epithelial cells. It receives afferent input from the
gut wall and is subject to modulation by the two other divisions of the ANS.

All the divisions have both efferent and afferent connections, although the efferent actions of the ANS are usually emphasized. We consider the ANS in detail in Chapter 14.

# THE NEURONAL MICROENVIRONMENT 

Bruce R. Ransom

## Extracellular fluid in the brain provides a highly regulated environment for central nervous system neurons

Everything that surrounds individual neurons can be considered part of the neuronal microenvironment. Technically, therefore, the neuronal microenvironment includes the extracellular fluid (ECF), capillaries, glial cells, and adjacent neurons. Although the term often is restricted to just the immediate ECF, the ECF cannot be meaningfully discussed in isolation because of its extensive interaction with brain capillaries, glial cells, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). How the microenvironment interacts with neurons and how the brain (used here synonymously with central nervous system, or CNS) stabilizes it to provide constancy for neuronal function are the subjects of this discussion.

The concentrations of solutes in brain extracellular fluid (BECF) fluctuate with neural activity, and conversely, changes in ECF composition can influence nerve cell behavior. Not surprisingly, therefore, the brain carefully controls the composition of this important compartment. It does so in three major ways: First, the brain uses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to protect the BECF from fluctuations in blood composition. Second, the CSF, produced by choroid plexus epithelial cells, strongly influences the composition of the BECF. Third, the surrounding glial cells "condition" the BECF.

## The brain is physically and metabolically fragile

The ratio of brain weight to body weight in humans is the highest in the animal kingdom. The average adult brain weight is $\sim 1400 \mathrm{~g}$ in men and $\sim 1300 \mathrm{~g}$ in womenapproximately the same weight as the liver (see p. 944). This large and vital structure, which has the consistency of thick pudding, is protected from mechanical injury by a surrounding layer of bone and by the CSF in which it floats.

The brain is also metabolically fragile. This fragility arises from its high rate of energy consumption, absence of significant stored fuel in the form of glycogen ( $\sim 5 \%$ of the amount in the liver), and rapid development of cellular damage when ATP is depleted. However, the brain is not the greediest of the body's organs; both the heart and kidney cortex have higher metabolic rates. Nevertheless, although it constitutes
only $2 \%$ of the body by weight, the brain receives $\sim 15 \%$ of resting blood flow and accounts for $\sim 20 \%$ and $50 \%$ of total resting oxygen and glucose utilization, respectively. The brain's high metabolic demands arise from the need of its neurons to maintain the steep ion gradients on which neuronal excitability depends. In addition, neurons rapidly turn over their actin cytoskeleton. Neuroglial cells, the other major cells in the brain, also maintain steep transmembrane ion gradients. More than half of the energy consumed by the brain is directed to maintain ion gradients, primarily through operation of the Na-K pump (see pp. 115-117). An interruption of the continuous supply of oxygen or glucose to the brain results in rapid depletion of energy stores and disruption of ion gradients. Because of falling ATP levels in the brain, consciousness is lost within 10 seconds of a blockade in cerebral blood flow. Irreversible nerve cell injury can occur after only 5 to 10 minutes of interrupted blood flow.

## CEREBROSPINAL FLUID

CSF is a colorless, watery liquid. It fills the ventricles of the brain and forms a thin layer around the outside of the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space. CSF is secreted within the brain by a highly vascularized epithelial structure called the choroid plexus and circulates to sites in the subarachnoid space, where it enters the venous blood system. The composition of CSF is highly regulated, and because it directly mixes with BECF, it helps regulate the composition of BECF. The choroid plexus can be thought of as the brain's "kidney" in that it stabilizes the composition of CSF, just as the kidney stabilizes the composition of blood plasma.

## CSF fills the ventricles and subarachnoid space

The ventricles of the brain are four small compartments located within the brain (Fig. 11-1A). Each ventricle contains a choroid plexus and is filled with CSF. The ventricles are linked together by channels, or foramina, that allow CSF to move easily between them. The two lateral ventricles are the largest and are symmetrically located within the cerebral hemispheres. The choroid plexus of each lateral ventricle is located along the inner radius of this horseshoe-shaped structure (see Fig. 11-1B). The two lateral ventricles each

The two lateral ventricles communicate with the third ventricle, which in turn communicates with the fourth ventricle. B, Each ventricle contains a choroid plexus, which secretes CSF. The CSF escapes from the fourth ventricle and into the subarachnoid space through the two lateral foramina of Luschka and the single foramen of Magendie.

The upper inset shows the three layers of meninges: the dura mater, which here is split into two layers to accommodate the superior sagittal sinus (filled with venous blood); the arachnoid mater, which is formed by cells that are interconnected by tight junctions; and the pia mater, which closely adheres to a layer composed of astrocyte endfeet that are covered by a basement membrane (glia limitans). The lower inset shows ependymal cells lining the interior of the frontal horn of the left ventricle. Both the subarachnoid space and the cavities of the ventricles are filled with CSF.
communicate with the third ventricle, which is located in the midline between the thalami, through the two interventricular foramina of Monro. The choroid plexus of the third ventricle lies along the ventricle roof. The third ventricle communicates with the fourth ventricle by the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius. The fourth ventricle is the most caudal ventricle and is located in the brainstem. It is bounded by the cerebellum superiorly and by the pons and medulla inferiorly. The choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle lies along only a portion of this ventricle's tent-shaped roof. The fourth ventricle is continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord. CSF escapes from the fourth ventricle and flows into the subarachnoid space through three foramina: the two laterally placed foramina of Luschka and the midline opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle, called the foramen of Magendie. We shall see below how CSF circulates throughout the subarachnoid space of the brain and spinal cord, and how it moves through brain tissue itself.

The brain and spinal cord are covered by two membranous tissue layers called the leptomeninges, which are in
turn surrounded by a third, tougher layer. The innermost of these three layers is the pia mater; the middle is the arachnoid mater (or arachnoid membrane); and the outermost layer is the dura mater (Fig. 11-2). Between the arachnoid mater and pia mater (i.e., the leptomeninges) is the subarachnoid space, which is filled with CSF that flows from the fourth ventricle. The CSF in the subarachnoid space completely surrounds the brain and spinal cord. In adults, the subarachnoid space and the ventricles with which they are continuous contain $\sim 150 \mathrm{~mL}$ of CSF, 30 mL in the ventricles and 120 mL in the subarachnoid spaces of the brain and spinal cord.

The pia mater (Latin for "tender mother") is a thin layer of connective tissue cells that is very closely applied to the surface of the brain and covers blood vessels as they plunge through the arachnoid into the brain. A nearly complete layer of astrocytic endfeet (see p. 286)-the glia limitansabuts the pia from the brain side and is separated from the pia by a basement membrane. The pia adheres so tightly to the associated glia limitans in some areas that the two seem

to be continuous with each other; this combined structure is sometimes called the pial-glial membrane or layer. This layer does not restrict diffusion of substances between the BECF and the CSF.

The arachnoid membrane (from the Greek arachnoeides [cobweb-like]) is composed of layers of cells, resembling those that make up the pia, linked together by tight junctions. The arachnoid isolates the CSF in the subarachnoid space from blood in the overlying vessels of the dura mater. The cells that constitute the arachnoid and the pia are continuous in the trabeculae that span the subarachnoid space. These arachnoid and pial layers are relatively avascular; thus, the leptomeningeal cells that form them probably derive nutrition from the CSF that they enclose as well as from the ECF that surrounds them. The leptomeningeal cells can phagocytose foreign material in the subarachnoid space.

The dura mater is a thick, inelastic membrane that forms an outer protective envelope around the brain. The dura has two layers that split to form the intracranial venous sinuses. Blood vessels in the dura mater are outside the BBB (see below), and substances could easily diffuse from dural capillaries into the nearby CSF if it were not for the blood-CSF barrier created by the arachnoid.

## The brain floats in CSF, which acts as a shock absorber

An important function of CSF is to buffer the brain from mechanical injury. The CSF that surrounds the brain reduces the effective weight of the brain from $\sim 1400 \mathrm{~g}$ to $<50 \mathrm{~g}$. This buoyancy is a consequence of the difference in the specific gravities of brain tissue (1.040) and CSF (1.007). The mechanical buffering that the CSF provides greatly diminishes the risk of acceleration-deceleration injuries in the same way that wearing a bicycle helmet reduces the risk of head injury. As you strike a tree, the foam insulation of the helmet gradually compresses and reduces the velocity of your head. Thus, the deceleration of your head is not nearly as severe as the deceleration of the outer shell of your helmet. The importance of this fluid suspension system is underscored by the consequences of reduced CSF pressure, which sometimes happens transiently after the diagnostic procedure of removal of CSF from the spinal subarachnoid space (Box 11-1). Patients with reduced CSF pressure experience severe pain when they try to sit up or stand because the brain is no longer cushioned by shock-absorbing fluid and small gravity-induced movements put strain on pain-sensitive structures. Fortunately, the CSF leak that can result from lumbar puncture is only temporary; the puncture hole easily heals itself, with prompt resolution of all symptoms.

## The choroid plexuses secrete CSF into the ventricles, and the arachnoid granulations absorb it

Total CSF production is $\sim 500 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day. Because the entire volume of CSF is $\sim 150 \mathrm{~mL}$, the CSF "turns over" about three times each day. Most of the CSF is produced by the choroid plexuses, which are present in four locations (see Fig. 11-1): the two lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, and the fourth ventricle. The capillaries within the brain appear to form as much as $30 \%$ of the CSF.

## BOX 11-1 Lumbar Puncture

0ne of the most important diagnostic tests in neurology is the sampling of CSF by lumbar puncture. Critical information about the composition of CSF and about intracranial pressure can be obtained from this procedure. The anatomist Vesalius noted in 1543 that the ventricles are filled with a clear fluid, but the diagnostic technique of placing a needle into the lumbar subarachnoid space to obtain CSF was not introduced until 1891 by the neurologist Heinrich Quincke. (T) N11-7 The method of lumbar puncture is dictated by spine anatomy. In adults, the spinal cord ends at the interspace between L1 and L2 (see p. 271). A hollow needle for sampling of CSF can be safely inserted into the subarachnoid space at the level of the L3-L4 interspace, well below the end of the spinal cord.

Once the needle is in the subarachnoid space, the physician attaches it to a manometer to measure pressure. With the patient lying on the side, normal pressure varies from 100 to $180 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, or 7 to 13 mm Hg . With the subject in this position, and in the absence of a block to the free circulation of CSF, lumbar CSF pressure roughly corresponds to intracranial pressure. The physician can demonstrate direct communication of the pressure in the intracranial compartment to the lumbar subarachnoid space by gently compressing the external jugular veins in the neck for 10 seconds. This maneuver, called the Queckenstedt test, rapidly increases intracranial pressure because it increases the volume of intracranial venous blood. It quickly leads to an increase in lumbar pressure, which just as rapidly dissipates when the jugular pressure is removed.

CSF pressure can become elevated because of a pathological mass within the cranium, such as a tumor or collection of blood, or because the brain is swollen as a result of injury or infection (see Box 11-3). If a "mass lesion" (i.e., any pathological process that occupies intracranial space) is large or critically placed, it can displace the brain and cause interference with the free circulation of CSF. For example, an expanding mass in the cerebellum can force the inferior part of the cerebellum into the foramen magnum and block flow of CSF into the spinal subarachnoid space. Under these conditions, performance of lumbar puncture can precipitate a neurological catastrophe. If a needle is placed in the lumbar subarachnoid space and fluid is removed for diagnostic examination or leaks out after the needle is removed, the ensuing decrease in pressure in the lumbar space creates a pressure gradient across the foramen magnum and potentially forces the brain down into the spinal canal. This disaster is called herniation. For this reason, a computed tomographic scan or magnetic resonance image of the head is usually obtained before a lumbar puncture is attempted; the imaging study can rule out the possibility of a large intracranial lesion that might raise intracranial pressure and increase the risk of herniation when the subarachnoid space is punctured and CSF withdrawn. The Queckenstedt test must also be avoided when an intracranial mass is suspected because it could enhance the pressure gradient and hasten herniation.

Secretion of new CSF creates a slight pressure gradient, which drives the circulation of CSF from its ventricular sites of origin into the subarachnoid space through three openings in the fourth ventricle, as discussed above. CSF percolates throughout the subarachnoid space and is finally absorbed into venous blood in the superior sagittal sinus,

![bo22099069a0](bo22099069a0.jpg)

Figure 11-3 Absorption of CSF. A, Arachnoid villi-or the larger arachnoid granulations (not shown)-are specialized evaginations of the arachnoid membrane through the dura mater and into the lumen of the venous sinus. The absorption of CSF may involve transcytosis. Note that arachnoid villi and granulations serve as one-way valves; fluid cannot move from the vein to the subarachnoid space. B, The rate of CSF formation is virtually insensitive to changes in the pressure of the CSF. On the other hand, the absorption of CSF increases steeply at CSF pressures above $\sim 70 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.
which lies between the two cerebral hemispheres (see Fig. 11-2). The sites of absorption are specialized evaginations of the arachnoid membrane into the venous sinus (Fig. 11-3A). These absorptive sites are called pachionian granulations ( $\mathrm{N} 11-1$ or simply arachnoid granulations when they are large (up to 1 cm in diameter) and arachnoid villi if their size is microscopic. These structures act as pressuresensitive one-way valves for bulk CSF clearance; CSF can cross into venous blood but venous blood cannot enter CSF. The actual mechanism of CSF absorption may involve transcytosis (see pp. 477-487), or the formation of giant fluidcontaining vacuoles that cross from the CSF side of the arachnoid epithelial cells to the blood side (see Fig. 11-3A).

## BOX 11-2 Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus

Impaired CSF absorption is one mechanism proposed to explain a clinical form of ventricular enlargement called normal-pressure hydrocephalus. This condition is somewhat misnamed because the intracranial pressure is often intermittently elevated. Damage to the arachnoid villi can occur most commonly from infection or inflammation of the meninges or from the presence of an irritating substance, such as blood in the CSF after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A spinal tap reveals normal pressure readings, but computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head shows enlargement of all four ventricles. Patients with normalpressure hydrocephalus typically have progressive dementia, urinary incontinence, and gait disturbance, probably caused by stretching of axon pathways that course around the enlarged ventricles. A flexible plastic tube can be placed in one of the lateral ventricles to shunt CSF to venous blood or to the peritoneal cavity and thereby reduce CSF pressure. This procedure may reduce ventricular size and decrease neurological symptoms. The shunting procedure is also used for patients with obstructive hydrocephalus. In this condition, CSF outflow from the ventricles is blocked, typically at the aqueduct of Sylvius.

CSF may also be absorbed into spinal veins from herniations of arachnoid cells into these venous structures.

The pressure of the CSF, which is higher than that of the venous blood, promotes net CSF movement into venous blood. When intracranial pressure (equivalent to CSF pressure) exceeds $\sim 70 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, absorption commences and increases in a graded fashion with further intracranial pressure (see Fig. 11-3B). In contrast to CSF absorption, CSF formation is not sensitive to intracranial pressure. This arrangement helps stabilize intracranial pressure. Thus, if intracranial pressure increases, CSF absorption selectively increases as well, so that absorption exceeds formation. This response lowers CSF volume and tends to counteract the increased intracranial pressure. However, if absorption of CSF is impaired even at an initially normal intracranial pressure (Box 11-2), CSF volume increases and causes an increase in intracranial pressure, which can lead to a disturbance in brain function.

Some subarachnoid CSF flows into "sleeves" around arteries that dive from the subarachnoid space (see Fig. 11-2) deeply into the substance of the brain. This CSF appears to exit the sleeve by flowing across the pia/glia limitans and into brain extracellular space (BECS), where it mixes with BECF. Moving by convection, the BECF eventually appears to cross the pia/glia limitans that surrounds veins, enter via perivenous sleeves, and return to the subarachnoid space. This parenchymal CSF circuit-termed the glymphatic system (11-2-may be an efficient pathway to rid the brain of extracellular debris, including glutamate and potentially dangerous peptides such as amyloid beta.

## N11-2 The Glymphatic System

## Contributed by Bruce Ransom

The parenchymal CSF flow out of the periarterial sleeves, through the parenchyma of the brain, and into the perivenous sleeves is surprisingly brisk. Fluorescent dye experimentally placed in the subarachnoid space enters the BECS within minutes. Evidence suggests that arterial pulsations drives this parenchymal CSF circulation. Curiously, most of this CSF exchange with BECF occurs during sleep (or, artificially, during anesthesia) when BECS volume expands, thus enhancing transit of BECF through the tortuous extracellular spaces. This recently discovered CSF circulation pattern through brain tissue has been called the glymphatic system.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which fluid would cross the pia/glia limitans to exit periarterial sleeves, or to enter perivenous sleeves, is not understood. The entire glymphatic process appears to require the water channel AQP4, which is expressed at low density in the plasma membrane over the soma of astrocytes and at extremely high density in the plasma membrane of astrocytic endfeet that abuts either CNS capillaries or the pia mater (i.e., the glia limitans). AQP4 could play a role in the shrinkage of astrocytes during sleep (thereby promoting the expansion of the BECS) or in promotion of water movement through the astrocytic endfeet.

into the ventricular cavity (Fig. 11-4). The tela choroidea consists of a layer of ependymal cells covered by the pia mater and its associated blood vessels. The choroid epithelial cells (see Fig. 11-4, first inset) are specialized ependymal cells and therefore contiguous with the ependymal lining of the ventricles at the margins of the choroid plexus. Choroid epithelial cells are cuboidal and have an apical border with microvilli and cilia that project into the ventricle (i.e., into the CSF). The plexus receives its blood supply from the anterior and posterior choroidal arteries; blood flow to the plexuses-per unit mass of tissue-is $\sim 10$-fold greater than the average cerebral blood flow. Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves innervate each plexus, and sympathetic input appears to inhibit CSF formation. A high density of relatively leaky capillaries is present within each plexus; as discussed below, these capillaries are outside the BBB. The choroid epithelial cells are bound to one another by tight junctions that completely encircle each cell, an arrangement that makes

the epithelium an effective barrier to free diffusion. Thus, although the choroid capillaries are outside the BBB, the choroid epithelium insulates the ECF around these capillaries (which has a composition more similar to that of arterial blood) from the CSF. Moreover, the thin neck that connects the choroid plexus to the rest of the brain isolates the ECF near the leaky choroidal capillaries from the highly protected BECF in the rest of the brain.

The composition of CSF differs considerably from that of plasma; thus, CSF is not just an ultrafiltrate of plasma (Table 11-1). For example, CSF has lower concentrations of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and amino acids than plasma does, and it contains almost no protein. Moreover, the choroid plexuses rigidly maintain the concentration of ions in CSF in the face of large swings in ion concentration in plasma. This ion homeostasis includes $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}, \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and, to a lesser extent, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. All these ions can affect neural function, hence the need for tight homeostatic control. The neuronal microenvironment is so well protected from the blood by the choroid plexuses and the rest of the BBB that essential micronutrients, such as vitamins and trace elements that are needed in very small amounts, must be selectively transported into the brain. Some of these micronutrients are transported into the brain primarily by the choroid plexus and others primarily by the endothelial cells of the blood vessels. In comparison, the brain continuously metabolizes relatively large amounts of "macronutrients," such as glucose and some amino acids.

CSF forms in two sequential stages. First, ultrafiltration of plasma occurs across the fenestrated capillary wall (see p. 462) into the ECF beneath the basolateral membrane of the choroid epithelial cell. Second, choroid epithelial cells secrete fluid into the ventricle. CSF production occurs with a net transfer of NaCl and $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ that drives water movement isosmotically (see Fig. 11-4, right inset, large white arrow labeled "Transepithelial fluxes"). The renal proximal tubule (see p. 761) and small intestine (see p. 903) also perform near-isosmotic transport, but in the direction of absorption rather than secretion. In addition, the choroid plexus conditions CSF by absorbing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(see Fig. 11-4, right inset, thin black arrow labeled "Transepithelial fluxes") and certain other substances (e.g., 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, a metabolite of serotonin).

The upper portion of the right inset of Figure 11-4 summarizes the ion transport processes that mediate CSF secretion. The net secretion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from plasma to CSF is a two-step process. The Na-K pump in the choroid plexus, unlike that in other epithelia (see pp. 137-138), is unusual in being located on the apical membrane, where it moves $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ out of the cell into the CSF-the first step. This active movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$out of the cell generates an inward $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient across the basolateral membrane, energizing basolateral $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ entry-the second step-through $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ coupled $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$transport. In the case of $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange, the limiting factor is the availability of intracellular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, which carbonic anhydrase generates, along with $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Thus, blocking of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump with ouabain halts CSF formation, whereas blocking of carbonic anhydrase with acetazolamide slows CSF formation.

The net secretion of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, like that of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, is a two-step process. The first step is the intracellular accumulation of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$by the basolateral $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger. Note that the net effect of parallel $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange and $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange is NaCl uptake. The second step is efflux of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$across the apical border into the CSF through either a $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel or a $\mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter.
$\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion into CSF is important for neutralizing acid produced by CNS cells. At the basolateral membrane, the epithelial cell probably takes up $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$directly from the plasma filtrate through electroneutral $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporters (see Fig. 5-11F) and the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger (see Fig. 5-13C). As noted before, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$can also accumulate inside the cell after $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ entry. The apical step, movement of intracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the CSF, probably occurs by an electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter (see Fig. 5-11D) and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels (which may be permeable to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$).

The lower portion of the right inset of Figure 11-4 summarizes $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption from the CSF. The epithelial cell takes up $\mathrm{K}^{+}$by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump and the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter at the apical membrane (see Fig. 5-11G). Most of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$recycles back to the CSF, but a small amount exits across the basolateral membrane and enters the blood. The concentration of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in freshly secreted CSF is $\sim 3.3 \mathrm{mM}$. Even with very large changes in plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, the $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$in CSF changes very

little. The value of $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$in CSF is significantly lower in the subarachnoid space than in choroid secretions, which suggests that brain capillary endothelial cells remove extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from the brain.

Water transport across the choroid epithelium is driven by a small osmotic gradient favoring CSF formation. This water movement is facilitated by the water channel aquaporin 1 (AQP1; see p. 110) on both the apical and basal membranes as in the renal proximal tubule (see pp. 761-762).

## BRAIN EXTRACELLULAR SPACE

## Neurons, glia, and capillaries are packed tightly together in the CNS

The average width of the space between brain cells is $\sim 20 \mathrm{~nm}$, which is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the diameter of either a neuron or a glial cell body (Fig. 11-5). However, because the surface membranes of neurons and glial cells are highly folded (i.e., have a large surface-to-

This is an electron micrograph of a section of the spinal cord from an adult rat showing the intermingling and close apposition of neurons and glial cells, mainly astrocytes. Neurons and glial cells are separated by narrow clefts that are $\sim 20 \mathrm{~nm}$ wide and not visible at this magnification. The BECF in this space creates a tortuous path for the extracellular diffusion of solutes. Astrocyte processes are colored.

volume ratio), the BECF in toto has a sizable volume fraction, $\sim 20 \%$, of total brain volume. The fraction of the brain occupied by BECF varies somewhat in different areas of the CNS and increases during sleep. Moreover, because brain cells can increase volume rapidly during intense neural activity, the BECF fraction can reversibly decrease within seconds from $\sim 20 \%$ to $\sim 17 \%$ of brain volume.

Even though the space between brain cells is extremely small, diffusion of ions and other solutes within this thin BECF space is reasonably high. However, a particle that diffuses through the BECF from one side of a neuron to the other must take a circuitous route that is described by a parameter called tortuosity. For a normal width of the cell-to-cell spacing, this tortuosity reduces the rate of diffusion by $\sim 60 \%$ compared with movement in free solution. Decreases in cell-to-cell spacing can further slow diffusion. For example, brain cells, especially glial cells, swell under certain pathological conditions and sometimes with intense neural activity. Cell swelling is associated with a reduction in BECF because water moves from the BECF into cells. The intense cell swelling associated with acute anoxia, for example, can reduce BECF volume from $\sim 20 \%$ to $\sim 5 \%$ of total brain volume. By definition, this reduced extracellular volume translates to reduced cell-to-cell spacing, which further slows the extracellular movement of solutes between the blood and brain cells (Box 11-3).

The BECF is the route by which important molecules such as oxygen, glucose, and amino acids reach brain cells and by which the products of metabolism, including $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and catabolized neurotransmitters, leave the brain. The BECF also permits molecules that are released by brain cells to diffuse to adjacent cells. Neurotransmitter molecules released at synaptic sites, for example, can spill over from the synaptic cleft and contact nearby glial cells and neurons, in addition to their target postsynaptic cell. Glial cells express neurotransmitter receptors, and neurons have extrajunctional receptors; therefore, these cells are capable of receiving "messages" sent through the BECF. Numerous trophic molecules (see p. 292) secreted by brain cells diffuse in the BECF to their targets. Intercellular communication by way of the BECF is especially well suited for the transmission of tonic signals that are ideal for longer-term modulation of the behavior of aggregates of neurons and glial cells. The chronic presence of variable amounts of neurotransmitters in the BECF supports this idea.

## The CSF communicates freely with the BECF, which stabilizes the composition of the neuronal microenvironment

CSF in the ventricles and the subarachnoid space can exchange freely with BECF across two borders, the pia mater and ependymal cells. The pial-glial membrane (see Fig. 11-2, upper inset) has paracellular gaps through which substances can equilibrate between the subarachnoid space and BECF. Ependymal cells (see Fig. 11-2, lower inset) are special glial cells that line the walls of the ventricles and form the cellular boundary between the CSF and the BECF. These cells form gap junctions (see p. 45) between themselves that mediate intercellular communication, but they do not create a tight epithelium (see p. 137). Thus, macromolecules and

# BOX 11-3 Cerebral Edema 

AImost any type of insult to the brain causes cell swelling, which is frequently accompanied by a net accumulation of water within the brain that is referred to as cerebral edema. Cell swelling in the absence of net water accumulation in the brain does not constitute cerebral edema. For example, intense neural activity causes a rapid shift of fluid from the BECF to the intracellular space, with no net change in brain water content. In cerebral edema, the extra water comes from the blood, as shown in Figure 11-6.

The mechanisms by which glial cells and neurons swell are not completely understood. Neuron cell bodies and dendrites, but not axons, swell when exposed to high concentrations of the neurotransmitter glutamate. This transmitter, along with others, is released to the BECF in an uncontrolled fashion with brain injury. Activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors (see pp. 323324) allows $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to enter neurons, and water and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$follow passively. Glial cells, both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, swell vigorously under pathological conditions. One mechanism of glial swelling is an increase in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$, which is a common ionic disturbance in a variety of brain pathological processes. This elevated $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ causes a net uptake of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, accompanied by the passive influx of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and water.

Cerebral edema can be life threatening when it is severe. The problem is a mechanical one. The skull is an inelastic container housing three relatively noncompressible substances: brain, CSF, and blood. A significant increase in the volume of CSF, blood, or brain rapidly causes increased pressure within the skull (see

Fig. 11-6B). If the cerebral edema is generalized, it can be tolerated until intracerebral pressure exceeds arterial blood pressure, at which point blood flow to the brain stops, with disastrous consequences. Fortunately, sensors in the medulla detect the increased intracerebral pressure and can partially compensate by increasing arterial pressure (Cushing reflex; see p. 559). Focal cerebral edema (i.e., edema involving an isolated portion of the brain) causes problems by displacing nearby brain tissue. This abnormality may result in distortion of normal anatomical relationships, with selective pressure on critical structures such as the brainstem.

Clinical evidence of cerebral edema results directly from the increased intracranial pressure and includes headache, vomiting, altered consciousness, and focal neurological problems. Because of its long intracranial course, the sixth cranial nerve is especially vulnerable to stretching and dysfunction.

Hyperventilation is the most effective means of combating the acute increase in intracranial pressure associated with severe cerebral edema. Hyperventilation causes a prompt respiratory alkalosis (see p. 634) that is rapidly translated to an increase in the pH surrounding vascular smooth muscle, thereby triggering vasoconstriction and reduced cerebral blood flow (see p. 559). Thus, total intracranial blood content falls, with a rapid subsequent drop in intracranial pressure. Alternatively, the brain can be partially dehydrated by adding osmoles to the blood in the form of intravenously administered mannitol (see p. 131).
![bo25099069a0](bo25099069a0.jpg)

Figure 11-6 Cerebral edema. A, In cerebral edema, the brain fluid that accumulates comes from the vascular compartment. Cell swelling due to the mere shift of fluid from the extracellular to the intracellular fluid is not cerebral edema. B, Although small increases in intracranial volume have little effect on pressure, additional increases in volume cause potentially life-threatening increases in pressure. Note that compliance (i.e., $\Delta V / \Delta P)$ falls at increasing volumes.

ions can also easily pass through this cellular layer through paracellular openings (some notable exceptions to this rule are considered below) and equilibrate between the CSF in the ventricle and the BECF.

Because CSF and BECF can readily exchange with one another, it is not surprising that they have a similar chemical composition. For example, $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$is $\sim 3.3 \mathrm{mM}$ in freshly secreted CSF and $\sim 3 \mathrm{mM}$ in both the CSF of the subarachnoid space (see Table 11-1) and BECF. The $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$of blood is $\sim 4.5 \mathrm{mM}$. However, because of the extent and vast complexity of the extracellular space, changes in the composition of CSF are reflected slowly in the BECF and probably incompletely.

CSF is an efficient waste-management system because of its high rate of production, its circulation over the surface of the brain, and the free exchange between CSF and BECF. Products of metabolism and other substances released by cells, perhaps for signaling purposes, can diffuse into the chemically stable CSF and ultimately be removed on a continuous basis either by bulk resorption into the venous sinuses or by active transport across the choroid plexus into the blood. For example, the choroid plexus actively absorbs the breakdown products of the neurotransmitters serotonin (i.e., 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) and dopamine (i.e., homovanillic acid).

## The ion fluxes that accompany neural activity cause large changes in extracellular ion concentration

As discussed in Chapter 7, ionic currents through cell membranes underlie the synaptic and action potentials by which neurons communicate. These currents lead to changes in the ion concentrations of the BECF. It is estimated that even a single action potential can transiently lower $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{o}$ by $\sim 0.75 \mathrm{mM}$ and increase $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ by a similar amount. Repetitive neuronal activity causes larger perturbations in these extracellular ion concentrations. Because ambient $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ is much lower than $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{o}$, activity-induced changes in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ are proportionately larger and are of special interest because of the important effect that $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ has on membrane potential $\left(V_{m}\right)$. For example, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$accumulation in the vicinity of active neurons depolarizes nearby glial cells. In this way, neurons signal to glial cells the pattern and extent of their activity. Even small changes in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ can alter metabolism and ionic transport in glial cells and may be used for signaling. Changes in the extracellular concentrations of certain common amino acids, such as glutamate and glycine, can also affect neuronal $V_{m}$ and synaptic function by acting at specific receptor sites. If the nervous system is to function reliably, its signaling elements must have a regulated environment. Glial cells and neurons both function to prevent excessive extracellular accumulation of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and neurotransmitters.

## THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER

## The blood-brain barrier prevents some blood constituents from entering the brain extracellular space

The unique protective mechanism now called the BBB was first demonstrated by Ehrlich in 1885. He injected aniline
dyes intravenously and discovered that the soft tissues of the body, except for the brain, were uniformly stained. Aniline dyes, such as trypan blue, extensively bind to serum albumin, and the dye-albumin complex passes across capillaries in most areas of the body, but not the brain. This ability to exclude certain substances from crossing CNS blood vessels into the brain tissue is due to the blood-brain barrier. We now recognize that a BBB is present in all vertebrates and many invertebrates as well.

The need for a BBB can be understood by considering that blood is not a suitable environment for neurons. Blood is a complex medium that contains a large variety of solutes, some of which can vary greatly in concentration, depending on factors such as diet, metabolism, illness, and age. For example, the concentration of many amino acids increases significantly after a protein-rich meal. Some of these amino acids act as neurotransmitters within the brain, and if these molecules could move freely from the blood into the neuronal microenvironment, they would nonselectively activate receptors and disturb normal neurotransmission. Similarly, strenuous exercise can increase plasma concentrations of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$substantially. If these ionic changes were communicated directly to the microenvironment of neurons, they could disrupt ongoing neural activity. Running a foot race might temporarily lower your IQ. Increases in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ would depolarize neurons and thus increase their likelihood of firing and releasing transmitter. $\mathrm{H}^{+}$can nonspecifically modulate neuronal excitability and influence the action of certain neurotransmitters. A broad range of blood constituents-including hormones, other ions, and inflammatory mediators such as cytokines-can influence the behavior of neurons or glial cells, which can express receptors for these molecules. For the brain to function efficiently, it must be spared such influences.

The choroid plexus and several restricted areas of the brain lack a BBB; that is, they are supplied by leaky capillaries. Intra-arterially injected dyes can pass into the BECS at these sites through gaps between endothelial cells. The BECF in the vicinity of these leaky capillaries is more similar to blood plasma than to normal BECF. The small brain areas that lack a BBB are called the circumventricular organs because they surround the ventricular system; these areas include the area postrema, posterior pituitary, median eminence, organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, subfornical organ, subcommissural organ, and pineal gland (Fig. 11-7). The ependymal cells that overlie the leaky capillaries in some of these regions (e.g., the choroid plexus) are linked together by tight junctions that form a barrier between the local BECF and the CSF, which must be insulated from the variability of blood composition. Whereas dyes with molecular weights up to 5000 can normally pass from CSF across the ependymal cell layer into the BECF, they do not pass across the specialized ependymal layer at the median eminence, area postrema, and infundibular recess. At these points, the localized BECF-CSF barrier is similar to the one in the choroid plexus. These specialized ependymal cells often have long processes that extend to capillaries within the portal circulation of the pituitary. Although the function of these cells is not known, it has been suggested that they may form a special route for neurohumoral signaling; molecules secreted by hypothalamic cells into the third ventricle could be taken up by these

![bo26099069a0](bo26099069a0.jpg)

Figure 11-7 Leaky regions of the BBB: the circumventricular organs. The capillaries of the brain are leaky in several areas: the area postrema, the posterior pituitary, the subfornical organ, the median eminence, the pineal gland, and the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT). In these regions, the neurons are directly exposed to the solutes of the blood plasma. A midline sagittal section is shown.
cells and transmitted to the general circulation or to cells in the pituitary.

Neurons within the circumventricular organs are directly exposed to blood solutes and macromolecules; this arrangement is believed to be part of a neuroendocrine control system for maintaining such parameters as osmolality (see p. 844) and appropriate hormone levels, among other things. Humoral signals are integrated by connections of circumventricular organ neurons to endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral centers within the CNS. In the median eminence, neurons discharge "releasing hormones," which diffuse into leaky capillaries for carriage through the pituitary portal system to the anterior pituitary (see p. 978). The lack of a BBB in the posterior pituitary is necessary to allow hormones that are released there to enter the general circulation (see p. 979). In the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, leakiness is important in the action of cytokines from the periphery, which act as signals to temperature control centers that are involved in fever (see p. 1202).

## Continuous tight junctions link brain capillary endothelial cells

The BBB should be thought of as a physical barrier to diffusion from blood to BECF and as a selective set of regulatory transport mechanisms that determine how certain organic solutes move between the blood and brain. Thus, the BBB contributes to stabilization and protection of the neuronal microenvironment by facilitating the entry of needed substances, removing waste metabolites, and excluding toxic or disruptive substances.
![bo27099069a0](bo27099069a0.jpg)

Figure 11-8 BBB function of brain capillaries. A, Capillaries from most other organs often have interendothelial clefts or fenestrae, which makes them relatively leaky. B, Brain capillaries are not leaky and have reduced transcytosis. C, Continuous tight junctions connect the endothelial cells in the brain, making the capillaries relatively tight. GLUT1, glucose transporter 1.

The structure of brain capillaries differs from that of capillaries in other organs (Fig. 11-8A). Capillaries in other organs generally have small, simple openings-or cleftsbetween their endothelial cells. In some of these other organs, windows, or fenestrae, provide a pathway that bypasses the cytoplasm of capillary endothelial cells. Thus, in most capillaries outside the CNS, solutes can easily diffuse through the clefts and fenestrae. The physical barrier to solute diffusion in brain capillaries (see Fig. 11-8B) is provided by the capillary endothelial cells, which are fused

to each other by continuous tight junctions (or zonula occludens; see pp. 43-44). The tight junctions prevent watersoluble ions and molecules from passing from the blood into the brain through the paracellular route. Not surprisingly, the electrical resistance of the cerebral capillaries is 100 to 200 times higher than that of most other systemic capillaries.

Elsewhere in the systemic circulation, molecules may traverse the endothelial cell by the process of transcytosis (see p. 467). In cerebral capillaries, transcytosis is uncommon, and brain endothelial cells have fewer endocytic vesicles than do systemic capillaries. However, brain endothelial cells have many more mitochondria than systemic endothelial cells do, which may reflect the high metabolic demands imposed on brain endothelial cells by active transport.

Other interesting features of brain capillaries are the thick basement membrane that underlies the endothelial cells, the presence of occasional pericytes within the basement membrane sheath, and the astrocytic endfeet (or processes) that provide a nearly continuous covering of the capillaries and other blood vessels. Astrocytes may play a crucial role in forming tight junctions between endothelial cells; experiments have shown that these glial cells can induce the formation of tight junctions between endothelial cells derived from capillaries outside the CNS. The close apposition of the astrocyte endfoot to the capillary also could facilitate transport of substances between these cells and blood.

## Uncharged and lipid-soluble molecules more readily pass through the blood-brain barrier

The capacity of the brain capillaries to exclude large molecules is strongly related to the molecular mass of the molecule and its hydrated diameter (Table 11-2). With a mass of 61 kDa , prealbumin is 14 times as concentrated in blood as in CSF (essentially equivalent to BECF for purposes of this comparison), whereas fibrinogen, which has a molecular mass of 340 kDa , is $\sim 5000$ times more concentrated in blood than in CSF. Diffusion of a solute is also generally limited by ionization at physiological pH , by low lipid solubility, and by binding to plasma proteins. For example, gases such as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$
and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and drugs such as ethanol, caffeine, nicotine, heroin, and methadone readily cross the BBB. However, ions such as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and protein-bound metabolites such as bilirubin have restricted access to the brain. Finally, the BBB is permeable to water mainly because of the presence of AQP4 in the astrocytic endfeet (see Fig. 11-8A). Thus, water moves across the BBB in response to changes in plasma osmolality. When dehydration raises the osmolality of blood plasma (see Box 11-3), the increased osmolality of the CSF and BECF can affect the behavior of brain cells.

Cerebral capillaries also express enzymes that can affect the movement of substances from blood to brain and vice versa. Peptidases, acid hydrolases, monoamine oxidase, and other enzymes are present in CNS endothelial cells and can degrade a range of biologically active molecules, including enkephalins, substance P, proteins, and norepinephrine. Orally administered dopamine is not an effective treatment of Parkinson disease (see p. 313), a condition in which CNS dopamine is depleted, because dopamine is rapidly broken down by monoamine oxidase in the capillaries. Fortunately, the dopamine precursor compound L-DOPA is effective for this condition. Neutral amino-acid transporters in capillary endothelial cells move L-DOPA to the BECF, where presynaptic terminals take up the L-DOPA and convert it to dopamine in a reaction that is catalyzed by DOPA decarboxylase.

## Transport by capillary endothelial cells contributes to the blood-brain barrier

Two classes of substances can pass readily between blood and brain. The first consists of the small, highly lipid-soluble molecules discussed in the preceding section. The second group consists of water-soluble compounds-either critical nutrients entering or metabolites exiting the brain-that traverse the BBB by specific transporters. Examples include glucose, several amino acids and neurotransmitters, nucleic acid precursors, and several organic acids. Two major transporter groups provide these functions: the SLC superfamily (see pp. 111-114) and ABC transporters (see pp. 119-120). (○) N11-3 As is the case for other epithelial cells, capillary

## Contributed by Bruce Ransom

Large uncharged amino acids (i.e., phenylalanine, tyrosine, and leucine) are selectively transported into the brain by system L. As outlined in Table 36-1B, the system L protein is a heterodimer of SLC7A8 and SLC3A2. It has broad substrate specificity and transports across the BBB several important drugs that act on the brain, including L-DOPA (to treat Parkinson disease), baclofen (to reduce spasticity), and gabapentin (to treat chronic pain and epilepsy).

endothelial cells selectively express these and other membrane proteins on either the luminal or basal surface.

Although the choroid plexuses secrete most of the CSF, brain endothelial cells produce some interstitial fluid with a composition similar to that of CSF. Transporters such as those shown in Figure 11-8C are responsible for this CSFlike secretion as well as for the local control of $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$and pH in the BECF.

## GLIAL CELLS

## Glial cells constitute half the volume of the brain and outnumber neurons

The three major types of glial cells in the CNS are astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells (Fig. 11-9, Table 11-3). As discussed in Chapter 10, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) contains other, distinctive types of glial cells, including satellite cells, Schwann cells, and enteric glia. Glial cells represent about half the volume of the brain and are more numerous than neurons. Unlike neurons, which have little capacity to replace themselves when lost, neuroglial
(or simply glial) cells can proliferate throughout life. An injury to the nervous system is the usual stimulus for proliferation.

Historically, glial cells were viewed as a type of CNS connective tissue whose main function was to provide support for the true functional cells of the brain, the neurons. This firmly entrenched concept remained virtually unquestioned for the better part of a century after the early description of these cells by Virchow in 1858. Knowledge about glial cells has accumulated slowly because these cells have proved far more difficult to study than neurons. Because glial cells do not exhibit easily recorded action potentials or synaptic potentials, these cells were sometimes referred to as silent cells. However, glial cells are now recognized as intimate partners with neurons in virtually every function of the brain.

## Astrocytes supply fuel to neurons in the form of lactic acid

Astrocytes have great numbers of extremely elaborate processes that closely approach both blood vessels and neurons.

![bo29099069a0](bo29099069a0.jpg)

Figure 11-10 Role of astrocytes in providing lactate as fuel for neurons. Neurons have two fuel sources. They can obtain glucose directly from the blood plasma or they can obtain lactate from astrocytes. In the direct path, the oxidation of one glucose molecule provides 30 ATP molecules to the neuron. In the transastrocyte path, conversion of two lactates to two pyruvates, and then the subsequent oxidation of the pyruvate, provides 28 molecules of ATP to the neuron. GLUT1 and GLUT3, glucose transporters 1 and 3; MCT1 and MCT2, monocarboxylate cotransporters 1 and 2.

This arrangement led to the idea that astrocytes transport substances between the blood and neurons. This notion may be true, but it has not been proved. Throughout the brain, astrocytes envelop neurons, and both cells bathe in a common BECF. Therefore, astrocytes are ideally positioned to modify and to control the immediate environment of neurons. Most astrocytes in the brain are traditionally subdivided into fibrous and protoplasmic types (see Table 11-3). Fibrous astrocytes (found mainly in white matter) have long, thin, and well-defined processes, whereas protoplasmic astrocytes (found mainly in gray matter) have shorter, frilly processes (see Fig. 11-9). Astrocytes are evenly spaced. In cortical regions, the dense processes of an individual astrocyte define its spatial domain, into which adjacent astrocytes do not encroach. The cytoskeleton of these and other types of astrocytes contains an identifying intermediate filament (see p. 23) that is composed of a unique protein called glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP). The basic physiological properties of both types of astrocyte are similar, but specialized features, such as the expression of neurotransmitter receptors, vary among astrocytes from different brain regions.

During development, another type of astrocyte called the radial glial cell (see pp. 263-265) is also present. As discussed on p. 267, these cells create an organized "scaffolding" by spanning the developing forebrain from the ventricle to the pial surface. Astrocytes in the retina and cerebellum are similar in appearance to radial glial cells. Like astrocytes elsewhere, these cells contain the intermediate filament GFAP. Retinal astrocytes, called Müller cells, are oriented so that they span the entire width of the retina. Bergmann glial cells in the cerebellum have processes that run parallel to the processes of Purkinje cells.

Astrocytes store virtually all the glycogen present in the adult brain. They also contain all the enzymes needed for
metabolizing glycogen. The brain's high metabolic needs are primarily met by glucose transferred from blood because the brain's glucose supply in the form of glycogen is very limited. In the absence of glucose from blood, astrocytic glycogen could sustain the brain for only 5 to 10 minutes. As implied, astrocytes can share with neurons the energy stored in glycogen, but not by the direct release of glucose into the BECF. Instead, astrocytes break glycogen down to glucose and even further to lactate, which is transferred to nearby neurons where it can be aerobically metabolized (Fig. 11-10). The extent to which this metabolic interaction takes place under normal conditions is not known, but it may be important during periods of intense neuronal activity, when the demand for glucose exceeds the supply from blood.

Astrocytes can also provide fuel to neurons in the form of lactate derived directly from glucose, independent of glycogen. Glucose entering the brain from blood first encounters the astrocytic endfoot. Although it can diffuse past this point to neurons, glucose may be preferentially taken up by astrocytes and shuttled through astrocytic glycolysis to lactic acid, a significant portion of which is excreted into the BECF surrounding neurons. Several observations support the notion that astrocytes provide lactate to neurons. First, astrocytes have higher anaerobic metabolic rates and export much more lactate than do neurons. Second, neurons and their axons function normally when glucose is replaced by lactate, and some neurons seem to prefer lactate to glucose as fuel. Note that when they are aerobically metabolized, the two molecules of lactate derived from the breakdown of one molecule of glucose provide nearly as much ATP (28 molecules) as the complete oxidation of glucose itself ( 30 molecules of ATP; see Table 58-4). The advantage of this scheme for neuronal function is that it provides a form of substrate buffering, a second energy reservoir that is available to neurons. The availability of glucose in the neuronal

microenvironment depends on moment-to-moment supply from the blood and varies as a result of changes in neural activity. The concentration of extracellular lactate, however, is buffered against such variability by the surrounding astrocytes, which continuously shuttle lactate to the BECF by metabolizing glucose or by breaking down glycogen.

## Astrocytes are predominantly permeable to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and also help regulate $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$

The membrane potential of glial cells is more negative than that of neurons. For example, astrocytes have a $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ of about -85 mV , whereas the resting neuronal $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is about -65 mV . Because the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is about -90 mV in both neurons and glia, the more negative $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ in astrocytes indicates that glial membranes have higher $\mathrm{K}^{+}$selectivity than neuronal membranes do (see p. 148). Although glial cells express a variety of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, inwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels seem to be important in setting the resting potential. These channels are voltage gated and are open at membrane potentials that are more negative than about -80 mV , close to the observed resting potential of astrocytes. Astrocytes express many other voltage-gated ion channels that were once thought to be restricted to neurons. The significance of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in glial cells is unknown. Because the ratio of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels is low in adult astrocytes, these cells are not capable of regenerative electrical responses such as the action potential.

One consequence of the higher $\mathrm{K}^{+}$selectivity of astrocytes is that the $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ of astrocytes is far more sensitive than that of neurons to changes in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$. For example, when $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ is raised from 4 to 20 mM , astrocytes depolarize by -25 mV versus only -5 mV for neurons. This relative insensitivity of neuronal resting potential to changes in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ in the "physiological" range may have emerged as an adaptive feature that stabilizes the resting potential of neurons in the face of the transient increases in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ that accompany neuronal activity. In contrast, natural stimulation, such as viewing visual targets of different shapes or orientations, can cause depolarizations of up to 10 mV in astrocytes of the visual cortex. The accumulation of extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$that is secondary to neural activity may serve as a signal-to glial cells-that is proportional to the extent of the activity. For example, small increases in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ cause astrocytes to increase their glucose metabolism and to provide more lactate for active neurons. In addition, the depolarization that is triggered by the increased $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ leads to the influx of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into astrocytes by the electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter (see p. 122); this influx of bicarbonate in turn causes a fall in extracellular pH that may diminish neuronal excitability. (1) N11-4

Not only do astrocytes respond to changes in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$, they also help regulate it (Fig. 11-11A). The need for homeostatic control of $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ is clear because changes in brain $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ can influence transmitter release, cerebral blood flow, cell volume, glucose metabolism, and neuronal activity. Active neurons lose $\mathrm{K}^{+}$into the BECF, and the resulting increased $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ tends to act as a positive-feedback signal that increases excitability by further depolarizing neurons. This potentially unstable situation is opposed by efficient mechanisms that expedite $\mathrm{K}^{+}$removal and limit its accumulation to a maximum level of 10 to 12 mM , the so-called ceiling level. $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ would
rise far above this ceiling with intense neural activity if $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ clearance depended solely on passive redistribution of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in the BECF. Neurons and blood vessels can contribute to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ homeostasis, but glial mechanisms are probably most important. Astrocytes can take up $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in response to elevated $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ by three major mechanisms: the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter, and the uptake of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$through channels. Conversely, when neural activity decreases, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ leave the astrocytes through ion channels.

## Gap junctions couple astrocytes to one another, allowing diffusion of small solutes

The anatomical substrate for cell-cell coupling among astrocytes is the gap junction, which is composed of membrane proteins called connexins that form large aqueous pores connecting the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells (see pp. 158159). Coupling between astrocytes is strong because hundreds of gap junction channels may be present between two astrocytes. Astrocytes may also be weakly coupled to oligodendrocytes. Ions and organic molecules that are up to 1 kDa in size, regardless of charge, can diffuse from one cell into another through these large channels. Thus, a broad range of biologically important molecules, including nucleotides, sugars, amino acids, small peptides, cAMP, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$, have access to this pathway.

Gap junctions may coordinate the metabolic and electrical activities of cell populations, amplify the consequences of signal transduction, and control intrinsic proliferative capacity. The strong coupling among astrocytes ensures that all cells in the aggregate have similar intracellular concentrations of ions and small molecules and similar membrane potentials. Thus, the network of astrocytes functionally behaves like a syncytium, much like the myocytes in the heart (see p. 483). In ways that are not yet clear, gap junctional communication can be important for the control of cellular proliferation. The most common brain cell-derived tumors in the CNS arise from astrocytes. Malignant astrocyte tumors, like malignant neoplasms derived from other cells that are normally coupled (e.g., liver cells), lack gap junctions. (2) N11-5

The coupling among astrocytes may also play an important role in controlling $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ by a mechanism known as spatial buffering. The selective $\mathrm{K}^{+}$permeability of glia, together with their low-resistance cell-cell connections, permits them to transport $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from focal areas of high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$, where a portion of the glial syncytium would be depolarized, to areas of normal $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$, where the glial syncytium would be more normally polarized (see Fig. 11-11B). Redistribution of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$proceeds by way of a current loop in which $\mathrm{K}^{+}$enters glial cells at the point of high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ and leaves them at sites of normal $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$, with the extracellular flow of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$completing this circuit. At a site of high neuronal activity, $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ might rise to 12 mM , which would produce a very large depolarization of an isolated, uncoupled astrocyte. However, because of the electrical coupling among astrocytes, the $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the affected astrocyte remains more negative than the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{K}^{+}\left(E_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$ predicted for a $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ of 12 mM . Thus, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$would tend to passively enter coupled astrocytes through channels at sites of high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$. (1) N11-6 As discussed in the preceding section, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$may also enter the astrocyte by transporters.

# N11-4 Glial Modulation of Neuronal Excitability via Extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and pH 

## Contributed by Mark Bevensee, Walter Boron, and Bruce Ransom

Chesler and Ransom have proposed a model (eFig. 11-1) that integrates our knowledge of acid-base transporters in neurons and astrocytes, the pH sensitivity of neuronal ion channels, and a wealth of data on changes in the composition of BECF during neuronal activity (e.g., increased $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{s}}$ that occurs as the result of a train of action potentials). Neural activity (step 1 in the figure)

leads to a rise in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\text {BECF }}$ (step 2), which would depolarize astrocytes (step 3). As first described by Siebens in renal proximaltubule cells, this depolarization would promote electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} /$ $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ influx (step 4), which simultaneously raises pH , and lowers $\mathrm{pH}_{\text {BECF }}$ (step 5). The low $\mathrm{pH}_{\text {BECF }}$ would inhibit the neuronal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ driven $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger (step 6), causing neuronal pH , to fall (step 7). The decreases in both $\mathrm{pH}_{\text {BECF }}$ and neuronal pH , complete the feedback loop by inhibiting voltage-gated channels and ligandgated changes, thereby decreasing neuronal excitability (step 8). Indeed, low pH appears to reduce neuronal activity in experimental models of epilepsy.

As pointed out in the text, malignant astrocyte tumors (i.e., astrocytomas) lack gap junctions. One theory is that growthlimiting factors pass among coupled cells to regulate proliferation. Thus, if gap junctions are lost, cells with minimal intrinsic production of these factors would be more prone to escape from normal regulation and become tumor clones.

# N11-6 K+ Siphoning by Müller Cells 

## Contributed by Bruce Ransom

An additional specialization that contributes to spatial buffering is a nonuniform distribution of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels on a single cell. The density of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels on the cell membrane of retinal Müller cells (eFig. 11-2A), which are specialized astrocytes, is highest on the cell's endfoot. Thus, focal increases in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{0}$ at the endfoot cause greater depolarization than if they occur elsewhere along the cell's membrane (see eFig.
11-2B). Because the endfoot of the Müller cell, which abuts the vitreous humor of the eye, has the highest density of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, excess extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is preferentially transported to the vitreous, which acts as a disposal site. It is not known whether nonuniform $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel distribution is a general feature of astrocytes.

## Astrocytes synthesize neurotransmitters, take them up from the extracellular space, and have neurotransmitter receptors

Astrocytes synthesize at least 20 neuroactive compounds, including both glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Neurons can manufacture glutamate from glucose or from the immediate precursor molecule glutamine (Fig. 11-12). The glutamine pathway appears to be the primary one in the synthesis of synaptically released glutamate. Glutamine, however, is manufactured only in astrocytes by use of the astrocyte-specific enzyme glutamine synthetase to convert glutamate to glutamine. Astrocytes release this glutamine into the BECF through the SNAT3 and SNAT5 transporters (SLC38 family, see Table 5-4) for uptake by neurons through SNAT1 and SNAT2. Consistent with its role in the synthesis of glutamate for neurotransmission, glutamine synthetase is localized to astrocytic processes surrounding glutamatergic synapses. In the presynaptic ter-
![bo33099069a0](bo33099069a0.jpg)
minals of neurons, glutaminase converts the glutamine to glutamate for release into the synaptic cleft by the presynaptic terminal. Finally, astrocytes take up much of the synaptically released glutamate to complete this glutamateglutamine cycle. Disruption of this metabolic interaction between astrocytes and neurons can depress glutamatedependent synaptic transmission.

Glutamine derived from astrocytes is also important for synthesis of the brain's most prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. In the neuron, the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase converts glutamate (generated from glutamine) to GABA (see Fig. 13-8A). Because astrocytes play such an important role in the synthesis of synaptic transmitters, these glial cells are in a position to modulate synaptic efficacy.

Astrocytes have high-affinity uptake systems for the excitatory transmitter glutamate and the inhibitory transmitter GABA. In the case of glutamate uptake, mediated by EAAT1 and EAAT2 (SLC1 family, see Table 5-4), astrocytes

![bo34099069a0](bo34099069a0.jpg)

Figure 11-12 Role of astrocytes in the glutamate-glutamine cycle. Most of the glutamate of glutamatergic neurons is generated from glutamine, which the neurons themselves cannot make. However, astrocytes take up some of the glutamate that is released at synapses (or produced by metabolism) and convert it into glutamine. The glutamine then enters the neuron, where it is converted back to glutamate. This glutamate also serves as the source for GABA in inhibitory neurons.
appear to play the dominant role compared with neurons or other glial cells. Glutamate moves into cells accompanied by two $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions and an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ion, with one $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ion moving in the opposite direction (see Fig. 11-12). Because a net positive charge moves into the cell, glutamate uptake causes membrane depolarization. The presynaptic cytoplasm may contain glutamate at a concentration as high as 10 mM , and vesicles may contain as much as 100 mM glutamate. Nevertheless, the glutamate uptake systems can maintain extracellular glutamate at concentrations as low as $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{M}$, which is crucial for normal brain function.

Neurotransmitter uptake systems are important because they help terminate the action of synaptically released neurotransmitters. Astrocyte processes frequently surround synaptic junctions and are ideally placed for this function. Under pathological conditions in which transmembrane ion gradients break down, high-affinity uptake systems may work in reverse and release transmitters, such as glutamate, into the BECF (Box 11-4).

Astrocytes express a wide variety of ionotropic and metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors that are similar or identical to those present on neuronal membranes. As in neurons, activation of these receptors can open ion channels or generate second messengers. In most astrocytes, glutamate produces depolarization by increasing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$permeability, whereas GABA hyperpolarizes cells by opening $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels, similar to the situation in neurons (see pp. 326-327). Transmitter substances released by neurons at synapses can diffuse in the BECF to activate nearby receptors on astrocytes, thus providing, at least theoretically, a form of neuronal-glial signaling.

Astrocytes apparently can actively enhance or depress neuronal discharge and synaptic transmission by releasing neurotransmitters that they have taken up or synthesized.

## BOX 11-4 Excitatory Amino Acids and Neurotoxicity

The dicarboxylic amino acid glutamate is the most prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain (see pp. 318-319). Although glutamate is present at millimolar levels inside neurons, the BECF has only micromolar levels of glutamate, except at sites of synaptic release (see Fig. 11-12). Excessive accumulation of glutamate in the BECF-induced by ischemia, anoxia, hypoglycemia, or trauma-can lead to neuronal injury. Astrocytes are intimately involved in the metabolism of glutamate and its safe disposition after synaptic release.

In anoxia and ischemia, the sharp drop in cellular levels of ATP inhibits the Na-K pump, which rapidly leads to large increases in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ and $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$. These changes result in membrane depolarization, with an initial burst of glutamate release from vesicles in presynaptic terminals. Vesicular release, however, requires cytoplasmic ATP and probably halts rapidly. The ability of astrocytes to remove glutamate from the BECF is impeded by the elevated $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ elevated $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$, and membrane depolarization. In fact, the unfavorable ion gradients can cause the transporter to run in reverse and dump glutamate into the BECF. The action of rising levels of extracellular glutamate on postsynaptic and astrocytic receptors reinforces the developing ionic derangements by opening channels permeable to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. This vicious cycle at the level of the astrocyte can rapidly cause extracellular glutamate to reach levels that are toxic to neurons-excitotoxicity.

The release mechanisms are diverse and include stimulation by certain neurotransmitters, a fall in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$, or depolarization by elevated $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$. Applying glutamate to cultured astrocytes increases $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, which may oscillate. Moreover, these increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ can travel in waves from astrocyte to

astrocyte through gap junctions or through a propagated front of extracellular ATP release that activates astrocytic purinergic receptors, thereby increasing $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, and releasing more ATP. These $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ waves-perhaps by triggering the release of a neurotransmitter from the astrocyte-can lead to changes in the activity of nearby neurons. This interaction represents another form of glial-neuronal communication.

## Astrocytes secrete trophic factors that promote neuronal survival and synaptogenesis

Astrocytes, and other glial cell types, are a source of important trophic factors and cytokines, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). Moreover, both neurons and glial cells express receptors for these molecules, which are crucial for neuronal survival, function, and repair. The expression of these substances and their cognate receptors can vary during development and with injury to the nervous system.

The development of fully functional excitatory synapses in the brain requires the presence of astrocytes, which act at least in part by secreting proteins called thrombospondins. Indeed, synapses in the developing CNS do not form in substantial numbers before the appearance of astrocytes. In the absence of astrocytes, only $\sim 20 \%$ of the normal number of synapses form.

## Astrocytic endfeet modulate cerebral blood flow

Astrocytic endfeet (see p. 286) surround not only capillaries but also small arteries. Neuronal activity can lead to astrocytic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ waves-as previously described on pages 291292 that spread to the astrocytic endfeet, or to isolated increases in endfoot $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. In either case, the result is a rapid increase in blood vessel diameter and thus in local blood flow. A major mechanism of this vasodilation is the stimulation of phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ in the astrocyte, the formation of arachidonic acid, and the liberation through cyclooxygenase 1 (see Fig. 3-11) of a potent vasodilator that acts on vascular smooth muscle. This is one mechanism of neuron-vascular coupling-a local increase in neuronal activity that leads to a local increase in blood flow. Radiologists exploit this physiological principle in a form of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) called blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI, which uses blood flow as an index of neuronal activity.

Astrocytic modulation of blood flow is complex, and increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in endfeet can sometimes lead to vasoconstriction.

## Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells make and sustain myelin

The primary function of oligodendrocytes as well as of their PNS equivalent, the Schwann cell, is to provide and to maintain myelin sheaths on axons of the central and peripheral nervous systems, respectively. As discussed on p. 199, myelin is the insulating "electrical tape" of the nervous system (see Fig. 7-21B). Oligodendrocytes are present in all areas of the

CNS, although their morphological appearance is highly variable and depends on their location within the brain. In regions of the brain that are dominated by myelinated nerve tracts, called white matter, the oligodendrocytes responsible for myelination have a distinctive appearance (Fig. 11-13A). Such an oligodendrocyte has 15 to 30 processes, each of which connects a myelin sheath to the oligodendrocyte's cell body. Each myelin sheath, which is up to $250 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ wide, wraps many times around the long axis of one axon. The small exposed area of axon between adjacent myelin sheaths is called the node of Ranvier (see pp. 200-201). In gray matter, oligodendrocytes do not produce myelin and exist as perineuronal satellite cells.

During the myelination process, the leading edge of one of the processes of the oligodendrocyte cytoplasm wraps around the axon many times (see Fig. 11-13A, upper axon). The cytoplasm is then squeezed out of the many cell layers

This transmission electron micrograph shows a Schwann cell (nucleus on right side of picture) surrounding a peripheral axon with several layers of myelin.

surrounding the axon in a process called compaction. This process creates layer upon layer of tightly compressed membranes that is called myelin. The myelin sheaths remain continuous with the parent glial cells, which nourish them.

In the PNS, a single Schwann cell provides a single myelin segment to a single axon of a myelinated nerve (see Fig. 11-13B). This situation stands in contrast to that in the CNS, where one oligodendrocyte myelinates many axons. The process of myelination that occurs in the PNS is analogous to that outlined for oligodendrocytes. Axons of unmyelinated nerves are also associated with Schwann cells. In this case, the axons indent the surface of the Schwann cell and are completely surrounded by Schwann cell cytoplasm (Fig. 11-14).

Myelin has a biochemical composition different from that of the oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell plasma membrane from which it arose. Although PNS myelin and CNS myelin look similar, some of the constituent proteins are different (Table 11-4). For example, proteolipid protein is the most common protein in CNS myelin ( $\sim 50 \%$ of total protein) but is absent in PNS myelin. Conversely, P0 is found almost exclusively in PNS myelin.

Myelination greatly enhances conduction of the action potential down the axon because it allows the regenerative electrical event to skip from one node to the next rather than gradually spreading down the whole extent of the axon. This process is called saltatory conduction (see pp. 200-201). Besides being responsible for CNS myelin, oligodendrocytes play another key role in saltatory conduction: they induce the clustering of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels at the nodes (see Fig. 12-5C), which is essential for saltatory conduction.

It is well known that severed axons in the PNS can regenerate with restoration of lost function. Regrowth of these damaged axons is coordinated by the Schwann cells in the distal portion of the cut nerve. Severed axons in the CNS do not show functional regrowth, in part because of the growth-retarding nature of myelin-associated glycoproteins (see pp. 267-268).

## Oligodendrocytes are involved in pH regulation and iron metabolism in the brain

Oligodendrocytes and myelin contain most of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase within the brain. The appearance of this enzyme during development closely parallels the maturation of these cells and the formation of myelin. Carbonic anhydrase rapidly catalyzes the reversible hydration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and may thus allow the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer system to be maximally effective in dissipating pH gradients in the brain. The pH regulation in the brain is important because it influences neuronal excitability. The classic example of the brain's sensitivity to pH is the reduced seizure threshold caused by the respiratory alkalosis secondary to hyperventilation (see p. 634).

Oligodendrocytes are the cells in the brain most involved with iron metabolism. They contain the iron storage protein

ferritin and the iron transport protein transferrin. Iron is necessary as a cofactor for certain enzymes and may catalyze the formation of free radicals (see pp. 1238-1239) under pathological circumstances, such as disruption of blood flow to the brain.

Oligodendrocytes, like astrocytes, have a wide variety of neurotransmitter receptors. Unmyelinated axons can release glutamate when they conduct action potentials, and in principle, this glutamate could signal nearby oligodendrocytes. Ischemia readily injures oligodendrocytes, in part by releasing toxic levels of glutamate. Even white matter, therefore, can suffer excitotoxicity.

## Microglial cells are the macrophages of the CNS

Microglial cells are of mesodermal origin and derive from cells related to the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Microglia represent $\sim 20 \%$ of the total glial cells within the mature CNS. These cells are rapidly activated by injury to the brain, which causes them to proliferate, to change shape, and to become phagocytic (Fig. 11-15). When activated, they are capable of releasing substances that are toxic to neurons, including free radicals and nitric oxide. It is believed that microglia are involved in most brain diseases, not as initiators but as highly reactive cells that shape the brain's response to any insult.

Microglia are also the most effective antigen-presenting cells within the brain. Activated T lymphocytes are able to breech the BBB and enter the brain. To become mediators of tissue-specific disease or to destroy an invading infectious agent, T lymphocytes must recognize specific antigenic targets. Such recognition is accomplished through the process of antigen presentation, which is a function of the microglia.

# PHYSIOLOGY OF NEURONS 

Barry W. Connors

## Neurons receive, combine, transform, store, and send information

Neurons have arguably the most complex job of any cell in the body. Consequently, they have an elaborate morphology and physiology. Each neuron is an intricate computing device. A single neuron may receive chemical input from tens of thousands of other neurons. It then combines these myriad signals into a much simpler set of electrical changes across its cellular membrane. The neuron subsequently transforms these ionic transmembrane changes according to rules determined by its particular shape and electrical properties and transmits a single new message through its axon, which itself may contact and inform hundreds of other neurons. Under the right circumstances, neurons also possess the property of memory; some of the information coursing through a neuron's synapses may be stored for periods as long as years.

This general scheme of neuronal function applies to most neurons in the vertebrate nervous system. However, the scheme is endlessly variable. For example, each region of the brain has several major classes of neurons, and each of these classes has a physiology adapted to perform specific and unique functions. In this chapter, the general principles of neuronal function are outlined, and the almost unlimited variability contained within the general schema is discussed.

## Neural information flows from dendrite to soma to axon to synapse

Numerous dendrites converge on a central soma, or cell body, from which a single axon emerges and branches multiple times (see Fig. 10-1). Each branch culminates at a presynaptic terminal that contacts another cell. In most neurons, dendrites are the principal synaptic input sites, although synapses may also be found on the soma, on the axon hillock (the region of the soma neighboring the axon), or even directly on the axons. In some primary sensory neurons, the dendrites themselves are transducers of environmental energy. Regardless of their source, signals-in the form of voltage changes across the membrane-typically flow from dendrites to soma to axon and finally to synapses on the next set of cells. Under some circumstances electrical signals may
also propagate in the opposite direction, from the soma outward along dendrites to their tips.

Excitatory input to a neuron usually generates an inward flow of positive charge (i.e., an inward current) across the dendritic membrane. Because the interior of a resting neuron is polarized negatively with respect to the external environment, this inward current, which makes the membrane voltage more positive (i.e., less negative), is said to depolarize the cell. Conversely, inhibitory input to a neuron usually generates an outward current and, thus, hyperpolarization.

If the neuron receives its input from a neighboring cell through a chemical synapse, neurotransmitters trigger currents by activating ion channels. If the cell is a sensory neuron, environmental stimuli (e.g., chemicals, light, mechanical deformation) activate ion channels and produce a flow of current. The change in membrane potential $\left(V_{m}\right)$ caused by the flow of charge is called a postsynaptic potential (PSP) if it is generated at the postsynaptic membrane by a neurotransmitter and a receptor potential if it is generated at a sensory nerve ending by an external stimulus. In the case of synaptic transmission, the postsynaptic $V_{m}$ changes may be either positive or negative. If the neurotransmitter is excitatory and produces a depolarizing PSP, we refer to the PSP as an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP; see p. 210). On the other hand, if the neurotransmitter is inhibitory and produces a hyperpolarizing PSP, the PSP is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). In all cases, the stimulus produces a $V_{m}$ change that may be graded from small to large depending on the strength or quantity of input stimuli (see p. 174). Stronger sensory stimuli generate larger receptor potentials; similarly, more synapses activated together generate larger PSPs. A graded response is one form of neural coding whereby the size and duration of the input are encoded as the size and duration of the change in the dendritic $V_{m}$.

The synaptic (or receptor) potentials generated at the ends of a dendrite are communicated to the soma, usually with substantial attenuation of the signal (Fig. 12-1A). Extended cellular processes such as dendrites behave like leaky electrical cables (see pp. 201-203). As a consequence, dendritic potentials usually decline in amplitude before reaching the soma. As an EPSP reaches the soma, it may also

Figure 12-1 Spatial versus temporal summation of EPSPs.
combine with EPSPs arriving via other dendrites on the cell; this behavior is a type of spatial summation and can lead to EPSPs that are substantially larger than those generated by any single synapse (see Fig. 12-1B, C). Temporal summation occurs when EPSPs arrive rapidly in succession; when the first EPSP has not yet dissipated, a subsequent EPSP tends to add its amplitude to the residual of the preceding EPSP (see Fig. 12-1D).

The tendency for synaptic and receptor potentials to diminish with distance along a dendrite puts significant limitations on their signaling abilities. If nothing else happened, these depolarizing potentials would simply dwindle back to the resting membrane potential as they spread through the soma and down into the axon. At best, this passive signal might be carried a few millimeters, clearly inadequate for commanding a toe to wiggle when the axon of the motor neuron stretching from the spinal cord to the muscles moving the foot might be 1000 mm long. Some amplification is therefore necessary for certain inputs to generate
effective signals to and from the central nervous system (CNS). Amplification is provided in the form of regenerating action potentials. If the $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ change in the soma is large enough to reach the threshold voltage (see p. 173), the depolarization may trigger one or more action potentials between the soma and axon, as shown in Figure 12-1B to D. Action potentials are large, rapid fluctuations in $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. As described in Chapter 7, an action potential is an efficient, rapid, and reliable way to carry a signal over long distances. However, notice that generation of action potentials entails another transformation of neuronal information: the neuron converts the graded-voltage code of the dendrites (i.e., the PSPs) to a temporal code of action potentials in the axon. The initiation site for action potentials in many types of neurons is the axon initial segment, the first stretch of unmyelinated axon past the soma.

Action potentials are fixed in amplitude, not graded, and have uniform shape. So how is information encoded by action potentials? This question has no simple answer and is

still hotly debated. Because one axonal spike looks like another (with slight exceptions), neurons can vary only the number of spikes and their timing. For a single axon, information may be encoded by the average rate of action potential firing, the total number of action potentials, their temporal pattern, or some combination of these mechanisms. Figure 12-1 illustrates that as the synaptic potential in the soma increases in size, the resultant action potentials occur more frequently, and the burst of action potentials in the axon lasts longer. Notice also that by the time the signal has propagated well down the axon, the transformation has become complete-the graded potential has waned and vanished, whereas the action potentials have retained their size, number, and temporal pattern. The final output of the neuron is entirely encoded by these action potentials. When action potentials reach axonal terminals, they may trigger the release of a neurotransmitter at the next set of synapses, and the cycle begins again.

## SIGNAL CONDUCTION IN DENDRITES

The word dendrite is derived from the Greek word dendron [tree], and indeed some dendrites resemble tree branches or roots. Inspired by trees, no doubt, the anatomist Camillo Golgi suggested in 1886 that the function of dendrites is to collect nutrients for the neuron. The truth is analogous but more interesting: dendrites arborize through a volume of brain tissue so that they can collect information in the form of synaptic input. The dendrites of different types of neurons exhibit a great diversity of shapes. Dendrites are often extensive, accounting for up to $99 \%$ of a neuron's membrane. The dendrites of a single neuron may receive as many as 200,000 synaptic inputs. The electrical and biochemical properties of dendrites are quite variable from cell to cell, and they have a profound influence on the transfer of information from synapse to soma.

## Dendrites attenuate synaptic potentials

Dendrites tend to be long and thin. Their cytoplasm has relatively low electrical resistivity, and their membrane has relatively high resistivity. These are the properties of a leaky electrical cable, which is the premise for cable theory (see p. 201). Leaky cables are like leaky garden hoses; if ionic current (or water) enters at one end, the fraction of it that exits at the other end depends on the number of channels (or holes) in the cable (hose). A good hose has no holes and all the water makes it through, but most dendrites have a considerable number of channels that serve as leaks for ionic current (see Fig. 7-22).

Cable theory predicts how much current flows down the length of the dendrite through the cytoplasm and how much of it leaks out of the dendrite across the membrane. As summarized in Table 7-3, we can express the leakiness of the membrane by the resistance per unit area of dendritic membrane (specific membrane resistance, $\boldsymbol{R}_{\mathrm{m}}$ ), which can vary widely among neurons. The intracellular resistance per cross-sectional area of dendrite (specific resistivity of the cytoplasm, $\boldsymbol{R}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ) is also important in determining current
flow inasmuch as a very resistive cytoplasm forces more current to flow out across the membrane rather than down the axis of the dendrite. Another important factor is cable diameter; thick dendrites let more current flow toward the soma than thin dendrites do. Figure 7-22C illustrates the consequences of a point source of steady current flowing into a leaky, uniform, infinitely long cable made of purely passive membrane. The transmembrane voltage generated by the current falls off exponentially with distance from the site of current injection. The steepness with which the voltage falls off is defined by the length constant ( $\lambda$; see p. 201), which is the distance over which a steady voltage decays by a factor of $1 / e(\sim 37 \%)$. Estimates of the parameter values vary widely, but for brain neurons at rest, reasonable numbers are $\sim 50,000 \Omega \cdot \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ for $R_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $200 \Omega \cdot \mathrm{~cm}$ for $R_{\mathrm{i}}$. If the radius of the dendrite (a) is $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}\left(10^{-4} \mathrm{~cm}\right)$, we can estimate the length constant of a dendrite by applying Equation 7-8.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\lambda & =\sqrt{\frac{a \cdot R_{\mathrm{m}}}{2 R_{\mathrm{i}}}}=\sqrt{\frac{\left(10^{-4} \mathrm{~cm}\right)\left(5 \times 10^{4} \Omega \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\right)}{2(200 \Omega \mathrm{~cm})}} \\
& =0.1118 \mathrm{~cm}=1118 \mu \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because dendrite diameters vary greatly, $\lambda$ should also vary greatly. For example, assuming the same cellular properties, a thin dendrite with a radius of $0.1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ would have a $\lambda$ of only $354 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, whereas a thick one with a radius of $5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ would have a $\lambda$ of $2500 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. Thus, the graded signal voltage spreads farther in a thick dendrite.

Real dendrites are certainly not infinitely long, uniform, and unbranched, nor do they have purely passive membranes. Thus, quantitative analysis of realistic dendrites is complex. The termination of a dendrite decreases attenuation because current cannot escape farther down the cable. Branching increases attenuation because current has more paths to follow. Most dendrites are tapered. Gradually expanding to an increased diameter progressively increases $\lambda$ and thus progressively decreases attenuation. Real membranes are never completely passive because all have voltagegated channels, and therefore their $R_{\mathrm{m}}$ values can change as a function of voltage and time. Finally, in the working brain, cable properties are not constant but may vary dynamically with ongoing brain activity. For example, as the general level of synaptic input to a neuron rises (which might happen when a brain region is actively engaged in a task), more membrane channels will open and thus $R_{\mathrm{m}}$ will drop as a function of time, with consequent shortening of dendritic length constants. However, all these caveats do not alter the fundamental qualitative conclusion: voltage signals are attenuated as they travel down a dendrite.

So far, we have described only how a dendrite might attenuate a sustained voltage change. Indeed, the usual definition of length constant applies only to a steady-state voltage shift. An important complication is that the signal attenuation along a cable depends on the frequency components of that signal-how rapidly voltage changes over time. When $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ varies over time, some current is lost to membrane capacitance (see p. 158), and less current is carried along the dendrite downstream from the source of the current. Because

Figure 12-2 Effect of $\lambda$ on propagation of an EPSP to two different axons. A, The neuron at the top fires an action potential that reaches the left and right neurons below, each at a single synapse. The EPSPs are identical. However, the left neuron has a thin dendrite and therefore a small length constant ( $\lambda=0.1 \mathrm{~mm}$ ). As a result, the signal is almost completely attenuated by the time it reaches the axon hillock, and there is no action potential. In the right neuron, the dendrite is thicker and therefore has a larger length constant $(\lambda=1 \mathrm{~mm})$. As a result, the signal that reaches the axon hillock is large enough to trigger an action potential. B, The graph shows four theoretical plots of the decay of voltage (logarithmic plot) along a dendritic cable. The voltage is expressed as a fraction of maximal voltage. The length along the cable is normalized for the length constant ( $\lambda$ ). Thus, an $I / \lambda$ of 1.0 corresponds to one length constant along the dendrite. Curve $a$ : If the cable is infinitely long and passive, the voltage decays exponentially with increasing length, so that the semilog plot is linear. Curve $b$ : If the cable is terminated at a length that is equal to one length constant, then voltage decays less steeply. Curve $c$ : If the cable is terminated at a length that is equal to $10 \%$ of the length constant, the voltage decays even less steeply. Curve $d$ : If the membrane is not passive but has a slow voltage-gated conductance, the dendritic attenuation will be much smaller. (Data from Jack JJB, Noble D, Tsien RW: Electrical Current Flow in Excitable Cells. Oxford, UK, Oxford University Press, 1975.)
action potentials and EPSPs entail rapid changes in $V_{\mathrm{m}}$, with the fastest of them rising and falling within a few milliseconds, they are attenuated much more strongly than the steady-state $\lambda$ implies. If $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ varies in time, we can define a $\lambda$ that depends on signal frequency ( $\lambda_{\mathrm{AC}}$, where AC stands for "alternating current"). When signal frequency is zero (i.e., $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is steady), $\lambda=\lambda_{\mathrm{AC}}$. However, as frequency increases, $\lambda_{\mathrm{AC}}$ may fall sharply. Thus, dendrites attenuate high-frequency (i.e., rapidly changing) signals more than low-frequency or steady signals. Another way to express this concept is that most dendrites tend to be low-pass filters in that they let slowly changing signals pass more easily than rapidly changing ones.

Figure 12-2A shows how an EPSP propagates along two different dendrites with very different length constants. If we assume the synapses trigger EPSPs of similar size in the end of each dendrite, then the dendrites with the longer $\lambda$ deliver a larger signal to the axon hillock. How do leaky dendrites manage to communicate a useful synaptic signal to the soma? The problem is solved in two ways. The first solution
deals with the passive properties of the dendrite membrane. The length ( $l$ ) of dendrites tends to be relatively small in comparison to their $\lambda$; thus, none extends more than one or two steady-state length constants (i.e., the $l / \lambda$ ratio is $<1$ ). One way that dendrites achieve a small $l / \lambda$ ratio is to have a combination of diameter and $R_{\mathrm{m}}$ that gives them a large $\lambda$. Another way is that dendrites are not infinitely long cables but "terminated" cables. Figure 12-2B shows that a signal is attenuated more in an infinitely long cable (curve $a$ ) than in a terminated cable whose length $(l)$ is equal to $\lambda$ (curve $b$ ). The attenuation of a purely passive cable would be even less if the terminated cable had a $\lambda 10$-fold greater than $l$ (curve c). Recall that in our example in Figure 12-2A, such a 10 -fold difference in $\lambda$ underlies the difference in the amplitudes of the EPSPs arriving at the axon hillock.

The second solution to the attenuation problem is to endow dendrites with voltage-gated ion channels (see pp. 182-199) that enhance the signal more than would be expected in a purely "passive" system (curve $d$ ). We discuss the properties of such "active" cables in the next section.

Figure 12-3 $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ action potentials in dendrites of Purkinje cells. Usually, dendrites do not fire action potentials; however, in these Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (left), the high density of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the dendrites allows the generation of slow dendritic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ spikes (records $a, b$, and $c$ on the right), which propagate all the way to the axon soma. In the axon soma, these $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ action potentials trigger fast $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$action potentials (record $d$ on the right). Moreover, the fast $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$spikes back-propagate into the dendritic tree but are attenuated. Thus, these fast $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$spikes appear as small spikes in the proximal dendrites (record $c$ ) and even smaller blips in the midlevel dendrites (record b). (Data from Llinás R, Sugimori M: Electrophysiological properties of in vitro Purkinje cell dendrites in mammalian cerebellar slices. J Physiol 305:197-213, 1980.)

## Dendritic membranes have voltage-gated ion channels

All mammalian dendrites have voltage-gated ion channels that influence their signaling properties. Dendritic characteristics vary from cell to cell, and the principles of dendritic signaling are being studied intensively. Most dendrites have a relatively low density of voltage-gated channels (see pp. 182-199) that may amplify, or boost, synaptic signals by adding additional inward current as the signals propagate from distal dendrites toward the soma. We have already introduced the principle of an active cable in curve $d$ of Figure 12-2B. If the membrane has voltage-gated channels that are able to carry more inward current (often $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ) under depolarized conditions, a sufficiently strong EPSP would drive $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ into the activation range of the voltagegated channels. These voltage-gated channels would open, and their additional inward current would add to that generated initially by the synaptic channels. Thus, the synaptic signal would fall off much less steeply with distance than in
a passive dendrite. Voltage-gated channels can be distributed all along the dendrite and thus amplify the signal along the entire dendritic length, or they can be clustered at particular sites. In either case, voltage-gated channels can boost the synaptic signal considerably, even if the densities of channels are far too low for the generation of action potentials.

An even more dramatic solution, used by a few types of dendrites, is to have such a high density of voltage-gated ion channels that they can produce action potentials, just as axons can. One of the best-documented examples is the Purkinje cell, which is the large output neuron of the cerebellum. As Rodolfo Llinás and colleagues have shown, when the dendrites of Purkinje cells are stimulated strongly, they can generate large, relatively broad action potentials that are mediated by voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (Fig. 12-3). Such $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ spikes can sometimes propagate toward-or even into-the soma, but these $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ action potentials do not continue down the axon. Instead, they may trigger fast $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent action potentials that are generated by

voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in the initial segment. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ spikes carry the signal along the axon in the conventional way. Both types of spikes occur in the soma, where the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ spikes are considerably quicker and larger than the dendritic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ spikes. The faster $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$spikes propagate only a short distance backward into the dendritic tree because the rapid time course of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$spike is strongly attenuated by the inherent filtering properties of the dendrites (i.e., the $\lambda_{\mathrm{AC}}$ is smaller for the rapid frequencies of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$action potentials than for the slower $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ action potentials). The dendrites of certain other neurons of the CNS, including some pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex, can also generate spikes that are dependent on $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}$, or both.

Dendritic action potentials, when they exist at all, tend to be slower and weaker, and with higher thresholds, than those in axons. The reason is probably that one of the functions of dendrites is to collect and to integrate information from a large number of synapses (often thousands). If each synapse were capable of triggering an action potential, there would be little opportunity for most of the synaptic inputs to have a meaningful influence on a neuron's output. The cell's dynamic range would be truncated; that is, a very small number of active synapses would bring the neuron to its maximum firing rate. However, if dendrites are only weakly excitable, the problem of signal attenuation along dendritic cables can be solved while the cell still can generate an output (i.e., the axonal firing rate) that is indicative of the proportion of its synapses that are active.

Another advantage of voltage-gated channels in dendrites may be the selective boosting of high-frequency synaptic input. Recall that passive dendrites attenuate signals of high frequency more than those of low frequency. However, if dendrites possess the appropriate voltage-gated channels, with fast gating kinetics, they will be better able to communicate high-frequency synaptic input.

## CONTROL OF SPIKING PATTERNS IN THE SOMA

Electrical signals from dendrites converge and summate at the soma. Although action potentials themselves often appear first at the nearby axon hillock and initial segment of the axon, the large variety of ion channels in the soma and proximal dendritic membranes is critically important in determining and modulating the temporal patterns of action potentials that ultimately course down the axon.

## Neurons can transform a simple input into a variety of output patterns

Neurophysiologists have sampled the electrical properties of many different types of neurons in the nervous system, and one general conclusion seems safe: no two types behave the same. The variability begins with the shape and height of individual action potentials. Most neurons within the CNS generate action potentials in the conventional way (see Fig. 7-4). Fast voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (see pp. 185-187) generate a strong inward current that depolarizes the membrane from rest, usually in the range of -60 to -80 mV , to a peak
that is usually between +10 and +40 mV . This depolarization represents the upstroke of the action potential. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels then quickly inactivate and close, and certain $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels (often voltage-gated, delayed outward-rectifier channels; see pp. 193-196) open and thus cause $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ to fall and terminate the spike. However, many neurons have somewhat different spike-generating mechanisms and produce spikes with a range of shapes. (5) N12-1 Although a fast $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ current invariably drives the fast upstroke of neuronal action potentials, an additional fast $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current (see pp. 188-189) can frequently occur and, if it is large enough, broaden the spike duration. Adding to the complexity, individual neurons usually have more than one type of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current and multiple types of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ currents. The greatest variability occurs in the repolarization phase of the spike. Many neurons are repolarized by several other voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents in addition to the delayed outward-rectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current, and some also have $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents carried by one or more channels that are rapidly activated by the combination of membrane depolarization and a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ (see pp. 196-197).

More dramatic variations occur in the repetitive spiking patterns of neurons, observed when the duration of a stimulus is long. One way to illustrate this principle is to apply a simple continuous stimulus (a current pulse, for example) to a neuron and to measure the neuron's output (the number and pattern of action potentials fired at its soma). The current pulse is similar to a steady, strong input of excitatory synaptic currents. The transformation from stimulus input to spiking output can take many different forms. Some examples are shown in Figure 12-4, which illustrates recordings from three types of neurons in the cerebral cortex. In response to a sustained current stimulus, some cells generate a rapid train of action potentials that do not adapt (see Fig. 12-4A); that is, the spikes occur at a regular interval throughout the current pulse. Other cells fire rapidly at first but then adapt strongly (see Fig. 12-4B); that is, the spikes gradually become less frequent during the current pulse. Some cells fire a burst of action potentials and then stop firing altogether, and still others generate rhythmic bursts of action potentials that continue as long as the stimulus (see Fig. 12-4C). These varied behaviors are not arbitrary but are characteristic of each neuron type, and they are as distinctive as each cell's morphology. They are also an intrinsic property of each neuron; that is, a neuron's fundamental firing pattern is determined by the membrane properties of the cell and does not require fluctuations in synaptic input. Of course, synaptic input may also impose particular firing patterns on a neuron. When a neuron is operating in situ, its firing patterns are determined by the interaction of its intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic inputs.

Rhythmically bursting cells are particularly interesting and occur in a variety of places in the brain. As described on pages 397-398, they may participate in the central circuits that generate rhythmic motor output for behavior such as locomotion and respiration. Cells that secrete peptide neurohormones, such as the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus, are also often characterized by rhythmic bursting behavior. These cells release either arginine vasopressin to control water retention (see pp. 844-845) or oxytocin to control lactation (see p. 1150). Rhythmic bursting is a more

effective stimulus for the synaptic release of peptides than are tonic patterns of action potential. It may be that the bursting patterns and the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ currents that help drive them can elicit the relatively high $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ necessary to trigger the exocytosis of peptide-containing vesicles (see pp. 219-221). One additional role of rhythmically bursting neurons is to help drive the synchronous oscillations of neural activity in forebrain circuits (i.e., thalamus and cortex) during certain behavioral states, particularly sleep.

Although it has been difficult to prove, the diverse electrical properties of neurons are probably adapted to each cell's particular functions. For example, in the first stage of auditory processing in the brain, cranial nerve VIII axons from the cochlea innervate several types of neurons in the cochlear nucleus of the brainstem. The axons provide similar synaptic drive to each type of neuron, yet the output from each
neuron type is distinctly different. Some are tuned to precise timing and respond only to the onset of the stimulus and ignore anything else; some respond, pause, and respond again; others chop the ongoing stimulus into a more rhythmic output; and still other cells transform the input very little. The mechanisms for this range of transformations include both synaptic circuitry and the diverse membrane properties of each cell type. The different properties allow some cells to be particularly well tuned to specific features of the stimulus-its onset, duration, or amplitude modulationand they can then communicate this signal to the appropriate auditory nuclei for more complex processing.

## Intrinsic firing patterns are determined by a variety of ion currents with relatively slow kinetics

What determines the variety of spiking patterns in each type of neuron, and why do neurons differ in their intrinsic patterns? The key is a large set of ion channel types that have variable and often relatively slow kinetics compared with the quick $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels that shape the spike. For a discussion of the properties of such channels, see p. 182. Each neuron expresses a different complement of these slow channels and has a unique spatial arrangement of them on its dendrites, soma, and axon initial segment. The channels are gated primarily by membrane voltage and $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, and a neuron's ultimate spiking pattern is determined by the net effects of the slow currents that it generates. We provide three examples of systems that have been studied in detail.

1. A neuron with only fast voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and delayed-rectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels will generate repetitive spikes when it is presented with a long stimulus. The pattern of those spikes will be quite regular over time, as for the particular type of cerebral cortical interneuron that we have already seen in Figure 12-4A.
2. If the neuron also has another set of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels that activate only very slowly, the spiking pattern becomes more time dependent: the spiking frequency may initially be very high, but it adapts to progressively lower rates as a slow $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current turns on to counteract the stimulus, as shown for the small pyramidal cell in Figure 12-4B. The strength and rate of adaptation depend strongly on the number and properties of the fast and slow $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels.
3. A neuron, by exploiting the interplay between two or more voltage-gated currents with relatively slow kinetics, can generate spontaneous rhythmic bursting-as in the case of the large pyramidal neuron in Figure 12-4C-even without ongoing synaptic activity to drive it.

## AXONAL CONDUCTION

## Axons are specialized for rapid, reliable, and efficient transmission of electrical signals

At first glance, the job of the axon seems mundane compared with the complex computational functions of synapses, dendrites, and somata. After all, the axon has the relatively simple job of carrying the computed signal-a sequence of

action potentials-from one place in the brain to another without changing it significantly. Some axons are thin, unmyelinated, and slow; these properties are sufficient to achieve their functions. However, the axon can be exquisitely optimized, with myelin and nodes of Ranvier, for fast and reliable saltatory conduction of action potentials over very long distances (see p. 200). Consider the sensory endings in the skin of your foot, which must send their signals to your lumbar spinal cord 1 m away (see Fig. 10-11B). The axon of such a sensory cell transmits its message in just a few tens of milliseconds! As we see in our discussion of spinal reflexes on pages 392-395, axons of similar length carry signals in the opposite direction, from your spinal cord to the muscles within your feet, and they do it even faster than most of the sensory axons. Axons within the CNS can also be very long; examples include the corticospinal axons that originate in the cerebral cortex and terminate in the lumbar spinal cord. Alternatively, many central axons are quite short, only tens of micrometers in length, and they transmit their messages locally between neurons. The spinal interneuron between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron (see Fig. 10-11B) is an example. Some axons target their signal precisely, from one soma to only a few other cells, whereas others may branch profusely to target thousands of postsynaptic cells.

Different parts of the brain have different signaling needs, and their axons are adapted to the local requirements. Nevertheless, the primary function of all axons is to carry electrical signals, in the form of action potentials, from one place to other places and to do so rapidly, efficiently, and reliably. Without myelinated axons, the large, complex brains necessary to control warm, fast mammalian bodies could not exist. For unmyelinated axons to conduct action potentials sufficiently fast for many purposes, their diameters would have to be so large that the axons alone would take up far too much space and use impossibly large amounts of energy.

## Action potentials are usually initiated at the initial segment

The soma, axon hillock, and initial segment of the axon together serve as a kind of focal point in most neurons. The many graded synaptic potentials carried by numerous dendrites converge at the soma and generate one electrical signal. During the 1950s, Sir John Eccles ( $\mathbf{1}$ N12-2 and colleagues used glass microelectrodes to probe the details of this process in spinal motor neurons. Because it appeared that the threshold for action potentials in the initial segment was only $\sim 10 \mathrm{mV}$ above the resting potential, whereas the threshold in the soma was closer to 30 mV above resting potential, they concluded that the neuron's action potentials would be first triggered at the initial segment. Direct recordings from various parts of neurons now indicate that spikes begin at the initial segment, at least for many types of vertebrate neurons. EPSPs evoked in the dendrites propagate down to and through the soma and trigger an action potential in a myelin-free zone of axon $\sim 15$ to $50 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ from the soma (Fig. 12-5A). The action potential then propagates in two directions: forward-orthrodromic conduction-into the axon, with no loss of amplitude, and backward-antidromic conduction-into the soma and dendrites, with strong attenuation, as we saw above in Figure 12-3. Orthodromic
propagation carries the signal to the next set of neurons. The function of antidromic propagation is not completely understood. It is very likely that backwardly propagating spikes trigger biochemical changes in the neuron's dendrites and synapses and they may have a role in plasticity of synapses and intrinsic membrane properties.

The axon achieves a uniquely low threshold in its initial segment (see Fig. 12-5B) by two main mechanisms. First, the initial segment has a remarkably high density of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (see Fig. 12-5C). The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel density in the axon initial segment is estimated to be 3 -fold to 40 -fold higher than in the membrane of the soma and dendrites, depending on neuron type and experimental methodology. The scaffolding protein ankyrin-G is a molecular marker for the initial segment and seems to be critical for organizing its unique distribution of ion channels. Second, initial segments often include $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel types (see Table 7-1) such as Nav1.6 that activate at relatively negative voltages compared to channels such as Nav1.2 that are common in the soma and dendrites. The combination of large numbers of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and their opening at relatively negative voltage allows the initial segment to reach action potential threshold before other sites on the dendrites and soma.

## Conduction velocity of a myelinated axon increases linearly with diameter

The larger the diameter of an axon, the faster its conduction velocity, other things remaining equal. However, conduction velocity is usually much faster in myelinated axons than it is in unmyelinated axons (see p. 200). Thus, a myelinated axon $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter conducts impulses at about the same velocity as an unmyelinated axon $\sim 500 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter. Myelination confers not only substantial speed advantages but also advantages in efficiency. Almost 2500 of the $10-\mu \mathrm{m}$ myelinated axons can pack into the volume occupied by one $500-\mu \mathrm{m}$ axon!

Unmyelinated axons still have a role in vertebrates. At diameters below $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, unmyelinated axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) conduct more rapidly than myelinated ones do. In a testament to evolutionary frugality, the thinnest axons of the peripheral sensory nerves, called C fibers, are $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ wide or less, and all are unmyelinated. Axons larger than $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter are all myelinated (Table 12-1). Every axon has its biological price: the largest axons obviously take up the most room and are the most expensive to synthesize and to maintain metabolically. The largest, swiftest axons are therefore used sparingly. They are used only to carry sensory information about the most rapidly changing stimuli over the longest distances (e.g., stretch receptors in muscle, mechanoreceptors in tendons and skin), or they are used to control finely coordinated contractions of muscles. The thinnest, slowest C fibers in the periphery are mainly sensory axons related to chronic pain and temperature sensation, for which the speed of the message is not as critical.

The relationship between form and function for axons in the CNS is less obvious than it is for those in the PNS, in part because it is more difficult to identify each axon's function. Interestingly, in the brain and spinal cord, the critical diameter for the myelination transition may be smaller than

Figure 12-5 Simultaneous recording of action potentials from different parts of a neuron. $\mathbf{A}$, In this hypothetical experiment, an excitatory synapse on a dendrite is stimulated and the response near that dendrite is recorded in the soma and at the initial segment. The EPSP attenuates in the soma and the initial segment, but the EPSP is large enough to trigger an action potential at the initial segment. B, The threshold is high ( -35 mV ) in regions of the neuron that have few $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels but starts to fall rather steeply in the hillock and initial segment. Typically, a stimulus of sufficient strength triggers an action potential at the initial segment.

in the periphery. Many central myelinated axons are as thin as $0.2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. At the other extreme, very few myelinated central axons are $>4 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter.

The myelinated axon membrane has a variety of ion channels that may contribute to its normal and pathological function. Of primary importance is the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channel, which provides the rapidly activating and inactivating inward current that yields the action potential. Nine isoforms of the $\alpha$ subunit of the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channel exist (see Table 7-1). In normal central axons, it is specifically Nav1.6 channels that populate mature nodes of Ranvier at a density of 1000 to 2000 channels per square micrometer (see Fig. 12-5). The same axonal membrane in the internodal regions, under the myelin, has $<25$ channels per square micrometer (versus between 2 and 200 channels per square micrometer in unmyelinated axons). The
dramatically different distribution of channels between nodal and internodal membrane has important implications for conduction along pathologically demyelinated axons (see below). $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are relatively less important in myelinated axons than they are in most other excitable membranes. Very few of these channels are present in the nodal membrane, and fast $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents contribute little to repolarization of the action potential in mature myelinated axons. This diminished role for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels may be a cost-cutting adaptation because the absence of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents decreases the metabolic expense of a single action potential by $\sim 40 \%$. However, some $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are located in the axonal membrane under the myelin, particularly in the paranodal region. The function of these $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels is unclear; they may set the resting $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ of the internodes and help stabilize the firing properties of the axon.

## Demyelinated axons conduct action potentials slowly, unreliably, or not at all

Numerous clinical disorders selectively damage or destroy myelin sheaths and leave the axonal membranes intact but bare. These demyelinating diseases may affect either peripheral or central axons and can lead to severely impaired conduction (Fig. 12-6). The most common demyelinating disease of the CNS is multiple sclerosis (Box 12-1), a progressive disorder characterized by distributed zones of demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. The specific clinical signs of these disorders vary and depend on the particular sets of axons affected.

In a normal, myelinated axon, the action currents generated at a node can effectively charge the adjacent node and bring it to threshold within $-20 \mu \mathrm{sec}$ (Fig. 12-7A), because myelin serves to increase the resistance and to reduce the capacitance of the pathways between the axoplasm and the extracellular fluid (see pp. 199-201). The inward membrane current flowing across each node is actually 5 -fold to 7 -fold higher than necessary to initiate an action potential at the adjacent node. Removal of the insulating myelin, however, means that the same nodal action current is distributed across a much longer, leakier, higher-capacitance stretch of axonal membrane (see Fig. 12-7B). Several consequences are possible. Compared with normal conduction, conduction in a demyelinated axon may continue, but at a lower velocity, if the demyelination is not too severe (see Fig. 12-7B, record 1). In experimental studies, the internodal conduction time through demyelinated fibers can be as slow as $500 \mu \mathrm{~s}, 25$ times longer than normal. The ability of axons to transmit

high-frequency trains of impulses may also be impaired (see Fig. 12-7B, record 2). Extensive demyelination of an axon causes total blockade of conduction (see Fig. 12-7B, record 3). Clinical studies indicate that the blockade of action potentials is more closely related to symptoms than is the simple slowing of conduction. Demyelinated axons can also become the source of spontaneous, ectopically generated

# BOX 12-1 Demyelinating Diseases 

Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common demyelinating disease of the CNS, affects $>350,000$ Americans. MS is an autoimmune disease directed against the myelin or oligodendrocytes (see p. 292) and is thus a purely CNS disease. The trigger is unclear. Some have proposed a viral antigen (including canine distemper virus), but many other theories abound, none of which has been clearly proven. The viral antigen theory is based at least in part on classic studies that concluded that MS has a greater incidence in temperate regions than in the tropics and that one's risk depends on where one spent one's childhood, not adulthood. No good evidence has been presented for a viral etiology yet. MS is twice as common in women as in men. Susceptibility to MS has also been linked to a number of genetic alleles of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system.

The signs and symptoms of MS are protean, but common features include the following:

1. An optic neuritis may cause decreased visual acuity.
2. Lesions of axons important for controlling eye movements may cause double vision.
3. The Lhermitte sign is an electrical sensation that shoots down the back and into the legs when the neck is flexed.
Magnetic resonance imaging can demonstrate the lesions in MS. Evoked potential studies, which measure nerve fiber conduction in various sensory pathways, yield abnormal results in almost all established cases and in about two thirds of suspected cases of MS.

MS is defined clinically as a disease that involves demyelination of the CNS with episodes separated in both time and space-at least two episodes of demyelination involving at least two separated regions of the CNS. Remissions and relapses are very common with MS. An exacerbation is due to the occurrence of active inflammation of a white matter tract in the CNS. A remission occurs when the inflammation subsides and the axons that have been demyelinated recover some of their function and are able to conduct action potentials through the area of myelin damage. However, the pathologically demyelinated fibers are not normal. Among the molecular changes that occur may be replacement of Nav1.6 channels by Nav1.2 channels in demyelinated axons. Conduction is often barely adequate under normal circumstances and may become inadequate under stressful situations, such as illness, emotional stress, and exhaustion. Under these circumstances, symptoms will reappear.

The reasons for remissions and exacerbations are not entirely clear. Conduction in the pathologically demyelinated fibers that is just barely adequate under normal circumstances may become inadequate under certain stressful situations, such as illness, emotional stress, and exhaustion; only then will symptoms become evident. A change in temperature is a classic example of circumstances changing conduction. Conduction through demyelinated axons is actually "safer" at low temperatures that slow the gating kinetics of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels, lengthen the action potentials, and slow conduction velocity. The augmented currents of the broader spike make it more likely that the threshold for continued conduction will be reached. 3 N12-3 When the body temperature of a patient with MS is elevated, for example, by fever or immersion in a hot bath, conduction is compromised and neurological deficits may appear.

Certain drugs can also prolong the duration of action potentials and facilitate conduction through demyelinated axons. Demyelination may expose the voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, which are normally hidden under the myelin. Activation of outwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels can further impair spike production in demyelinated axons. However, the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels also become accessible to pharmacological agents, such as the class of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel blockers called aminopyridines (see pp. 195-196). Blocking these $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels can prolong the spike and facilitate its propagation through demyelinated regions. A slow-release formulation of 4-aminopyridine is now available for the symptomatic treatment of MS.

At present, standard treatment of MS exacerbations includes immunosuppressive agents. The most common is interferon- $\beta$, which has antiviral, antiproliferative, and immune-modulating activity. Many newer drugs are under investigation to help prevent the autoimmune attack, to reduce the damage during an attack, or to improve function in already demyelinated regions.

The most common demyelinating disease of the PNS is Landry-Guillain-Barré syndrome. After a respiratory or other viral infection, an ascending neurological syndrome develops that is characterized by the onset of weakness, leading to paralysis of the legs and subsequent involvement of the hands and arms. In severe cases, the paralysis involves the cranial nerves, and patients may lose the ability to swallow or even to breathe, which requires mechanical ventilation for a time. This initial stage of Landry-Guillain-Barré syndrome reaches a plateau in several weeks and then gradually resolves. Most patients recover completely as long as the physician recognizes the syndrome and initiates supportive treatment. Untreated, this syndrome is often fatal.

Landry-Guillain-Barré syndrome is caused by autoimmunity to the myelin sheath produced by Schwann cells in the PNS (see p. 292). These patients generally recover fully because the PNS has the ability to remyelinate itself. Axons of the CNS do not remyelinate to any significant extent, which explains why complete recovery in patients with MS is not common.

# N12-3 Temperature Dependence of Axonal Conduction 

## Contributed by Barry Connors

For a myelinated axon, decrease of just $2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ increases the duration of an action potential by $-20 \%$. As shown in eFigure 12-2, a temperature decrease of $7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ has an even greater effect on a myelinated axon. In the case of a demyelinated axon, a temperature decrease of $7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ can permit an action potential where one was previously not possible.

B, Action potentials propagate from a normally myelinated region into a demyelinated area. The axial action current that was generated at the last healthy node is distributed across a long region of bare or partially myelinated axonal membrane, with its decreased resistivity and increased capacitance. Thus, the current density at the two affected nodes is greatly reduced. This panel shows five consequences of demyelination: (1) decreased velocity, which is manifested as longer delays for the arrival of the train of spikes; (2) frequency-related block, which does not pass high-frequency trainsas a result, some of the spikes are missing distally; (3) total blockade; (4) ectopic impulse generation-even though there is no input in the proximal portion of the axon, action potentials arise spontaneously beyond the lesion; and (5) increased mechanosensitivity-ectopic action potentials arise from mechanical stimulation. C, If the demyelination affects two adjacent axons, action potentials in one (the top axon in this case) cause action potentials to propagate in both directions in the adjacent axon.
action potentials because of changes in their intrinsic excitability (see Fig. 12-7B, record 4) or mechanosensitivity (see Fig. 12-7B, record 5). Moreover, the signal from one demyelinated axon can excite an adjacent demyelinated axon and induce crosstalk (see Fig. 12-7C), which may cause action potentials to be conducted in both directions in the adjacent axon.

# SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 

Barry W. Connors

After meticulous study of spinal reflexes, Charles Sherrington (1) N10-2 deduced that neurons somehow communicate information, one to the next, by a mechanism that is fundamentally different from the way that they conduct signals along their axons. Sherrington had merged his physiological conclusions with the anatomical observations (Fig. 13-1) of his contemporary, the preeminent neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal. (1) N10-1 Ramón y Cajal had proposed that neurons are distinct entities, fundamental units of the nervous system that are discontinuous with each other. Discontinuous neurons must nevertheless communicate, and Sherrington in 1897 proposed that the synapse, a specialized apposition between cells, mediates the signals. The word synapse implies "contiguity, not continuity" between neurons, as Ramón y Cajal himself explained it. When the fine structure of synapses was finally revealed with the electron microscope in the 1950s, the vision of Ramón y Cajal and Sherrington was amply sustained. Neurons come very close together at chemical synapses (see p. 206), but their membranes and cytoplasm remain distinct. At electrical synapses (see p. 205), which are less common than chemical synapses, the membranes remain distinct, but ions and other small solutes can diffuse through the gap junctions, a form of continuity.

## NEURONAL SYNAPSES

## The molecular mechanisms of neuronal synapses are similar but not identical to those of the neuromuscular junction

Chemical synapses use diffusible transmitter molecules to communicate messages between two cells. The first chemical synapse to be understood in detail was the neuromuscular junction (the nerve-muscle synapse) in vertebrate skeletal muscle, which is described in Chapter 8. In this chapter, we are concerned with the properties of the synapses that occur between neurons. We now know that all synapses share certain basic biochemical and physiological mechanisms, and thus many basic insights gained from the neuromuscular junction are also applicable to synapses in the brain. However, neuronal synapses differ from neuromuscular junctions in many important ways; they also differ widely among themselves, and it is the diverse properties of synapses that help make each part of the brain unique.

It is useful to begin by reviewing some of the mechanisms that are common to all chemical synapses (see Figs. 8-2 and 8-3). (1) N13-1 Synaptic transmission at chemical synapses occurs in seven steps:

Step 1: Neurotransmitter molecules are packaged into membranous vesicles, and the vesicles are concentrated and docked at the presynaptic terminal.
Step 2: The presynaptic membrane depolarizes, usually as the result of an action potential, although some synapses respond to graded variations of membrane potential $\left(V_{m}\right)$.
Step 3: The depolarization causes voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels to open and allows $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions to flow into the terminal.
Step 4: The resulting increase in intracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ triggers fusion of vesicles with the presynaptic membrane (see pp. 219-221), and the rate of transmitter release increases $\sim 100,000$-fold above baseline. The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ dependence of fusion is conferred by neuron-specific protein components of the fusion apparatus called synaptotagmins. The actual fusion events are incredibly fast; each individual exocytosis requires only a fraction of a millisecond to be completed.
Step 5: The transmitter is released into the extracellular space in quantized amounts and diffuses passively across the synaptic cleft.
Step 6: Some of the transmitter molecules bind to receptors in the postsynaptic membrane, and the activated receptors trigger some postsynaptic event, usually the opening of an ion channel or the activation of a G protein-coupled signal cascade.
Step 7: Transmitter molecules diffuse away from postsynaptic receptors and are eventually cleared away by continued diffusion, enzymatic degradation, or active uptake into cells. In addition, the presynaptic machinery retrieves the membrane of the exocytosed synaptic vesicle, perhaps by endocytosis from the cell surface.

The molecular machinery of synapses is closely related to components that are universal in eukaryotic cells (see p. 37). A large set of proteins is involved in the docking and fusion of vesicles, and the proteins present in nerve terminals are remarkably similar to the ones mediating fusion and secretion in yeast. Docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles are discussed on page 219. Ligand-gated ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the receptors on the

postsynaptic membrane, are also present in all eukaryotic cells and mediate processes as disparate as the recognition of nutrients and poisons, and the identification of other members of the species. Even most of the neurotransmitters themselves are simple molecules, identical or very similar to those used in general cellular metabolism. Clearly, the evolutionary roots of synaptic transmission are much older than nervous systems themselves.

Within nervous systems, however, myriad variations on the basic molecular building blocks yield synapses with wide-ranging properties. Neuronal synapses vary widely in the size of the synaptic contact, the identity of the neurotransmitter, the nature of the postsynaptic receptors, the efficiency of synaptic transmission, the mechanism used for terminating transmitter action, and the degree and modes of synaptic plasticity. Thus, the properties of neuronal

Note that the time axis is logarithmic. (Data from Shepherd GM: Neurobiology, 3rd ed. New York, Oxford University Press, 1994.)
synapses can be tuned to achieve the diverse functions of the brain.

A major difference between the neuromuscular junction and most neuronal synapses is the type of neurotransmitter used. All skeletal neuromuscular junctions use acetylcholine (ACh). In contrast, neuronal synapses use many transmitters. The most ubiquitous are amino acids: glutamate and aspartate excite, whereas gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine inhibit. Other transmitters include simple amines, such as ACh, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine, ubiquitous molecules such as ATP and adenosine, and a wide array of peptides.

Even more varied than the neuronal transmitters are their receptors. Whereas skeletal muscle manufactures a few modest variants of its ACh receptors, the nervous system typically has several major receptor variants for each neurotransmitter. Knowledge about the wide range of transmitters and receptors is essential to understand the chemical activity of the brain as well as the drugs that influence brain activity. For one thing, the many transmitter systems in the brain generate responses with widely varying durations that range from a few milliseconds to days (Fig. 13-2).

## Presynaptic terminals may contact neurons at the dendrite, soma, or axon and may contain both clear vesicles and dense-core granules

Chemical synapses between neurons are generally small, often $<1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter, which means that their detailed structure can be seen only with an electron microscope (Fig. 13-3); under the light microscope, brain synapses are usually visible only as swellings along or at the termination of the axons (see Fig. 13-1). These swellings are actually the silhouettes of the bouton terminals-the presynaptic terminals. Most presynaptic terminals arise from axons, and they can form synapses on virtually any part of a neuron. The contact site and direction of communication determine the way in which a synapse is named: axodendritic, axosomatic, and axoaxonic synapses (Fig. 13-4). These synapses are the most common types in the nervous system. In many cases,

synapses occur on small outpockets of the dendritic membrane called spines and are termed axospinous synapses. However, not all synapses arise from axons, and dendrodendritic, somatosomatic, and even somatodendritic synapses may be found in the mammalian brain.

Despite their differences in size, site, and shape, all synapses share one basic function: they deliver a small amount of chemical transmitter onto a circumscribed patch of postsynaptic membrane. To accomplish this task, they use certain common anatomical features, most of them familiar from discussions of the neuromuscular junction (see Chapter 8).

Synapses are polarized, which means that their two apposed sides have different structures. This polarity reflects the fact that most synapses transmit information primarily in one direction, although retrograde transmission also occurs in many synapses in one direction but not in the other (we will see that some rare exceptions do exist). The presynaptic side contains numerous clear vesicles, 40 to 50 nm in diameter, that appear empty when viewed by transmission electron microscopy. Synaptic termini may also contain large ( 100 to 200 nm in diameter) dense-core secretory granules that are morphologically quite similar to the secretory granules of endocrine cells. These granules contain neuropeptides; that is, peptides or small proteins that act as neurotransmitters and for which receptors exist in the postsynaptic membranes. Many of these neuropeptides are identical to substances secreted by "traditional" endocrine cells. Endocrine hormones such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and cholecystokinin are found in dense-core secretory granules present in the terminals of certain central and peripheral neurons.

The clear synaptic vesicles (i.e., not the dense-core granules) are anchored and shifted about by a dense network of cytoskeletal proteins. Some vesicles are clustered close to the part of the presynaptic membrane that apposes the synaptic
contact; these vesicle attachment sites are called active zones. Synaptic vesicles are lined up several deep along the active zones, which are the regions of actual exocytosis. The number of active zones per synapse varies greatly (active zones are marked with arrows in the synapses in Fig. 13-3). Most synapses in the central nervous system (CNS) have relatively few active zones, often only 1 but occasionally as many as 10 or 20 (versus the hundreds in the neuromuscular junction). If we could view the presynaptic face of an active zone from the perspective of a synaptic vesicle, we would see filaments and particles projecting from the presynaptic membrane, often forming a regular hexagonal arrangement called a presynaptic grid. Specific points along the grid are thought to be the vesicle release sites.

Unlike the clear synaptic vesicles containing nonpeptide transmitters, dense-core secretory granules are distributed randomly throughout the cytoplasm of the synaptic terminus. They are not concentrated at the presynaptic density, and they do not appear to release their contents at the active zone. Although the molecular pathways that control exocytosis of the neuronal dense-core granules are still being elucidated, it appears that a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is a primary stimulus.

## The postsynaptic membrane contains transmitter receptors and numerous proteins clustered in the postsynaptic density

The postsynaptic membrane lies parallel to the presynaptic membrane, and they are separated by a narrow synaptic cleft ( $\sim 30 \mathrm{~nm}$ wide) that is filled with extracellular fluid. Transmitter molecules released from the presynaptic terminal must diffuse across the cleft to reach postsynaptic receptors. The most characteristic anatomical feature of the postsynaptic side is the postsynaptic density, a strip of granular material visible under the electron microscope on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (see Fig. 13-3). The most important molecular feature of the postsynaptic side is the cluster of transmitter receptors embedded within the postsynaptic membrane. Staining methods that use specific antibodies, toxins, or ligands coupled to some visible tag molecule can reveal the positions of the receptors.

In $>90 \%$ of all excitatory synapses in the CNS, the postsynaptic site is a dendritic spine. The ubiquity of spines implies that they serve prominent functions, but their small size (usually $<1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ long) makes their function extremely difficult to study. Spines come in a variety of shapes, and their density varies from one dendrite to another (Fig. 13-5); indeed, some central neurons have no spines. The postsynaptic density of spines (as for all central synapses) contains $>30$ proteins in high concentration, including transmitter receptors, protein kinases, a host of structural proteins, and proteins that are involved in endocytosis and glycolysis.

Numerous functions for spines have been proposed. It may be that spines increase the opportunity for a dendrite to form synapses with nearby axons. Many hypotheses have focused on the possibility that spines isolate individual synapses from the rest of a cell. This isolation may be electrical or chemical; the narrow spine neck may reduce current flow or the diffusion of chemicals from the spine head into the dendritic shaft. Evidence suggests that the high electrical

B, Electron micrograph of an axospinous synapse in the neocortex. Note that the dendritic spine (S) protrudes from the dendritic shaft (D), making contact with a presynaptic terminal. (From Feldman ML: In Peters A, Jones EG [eds]: Cerebral Cortex: Cellular Components of the Cerebral Cortex, vol 1. New York, Plenum, 1984, pp 123-200.)
resistance of the spine neck can amplify the size of an excitatory postsynaptic potential within the spine while reducing its amplitude along the shaft of the dendrite; this mechanism may allow neurons to integrate larger numbers of synaptic inputs. Activation of some excitatory synapses allows substantial amounts of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to enter the postsynaptic cell. Spines may compartmentalize this $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, thus allowing it to rise to higher levels or preventing it from influencing other synapses on the cell. Because increases in postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ are an essential trigger for many forms of long-term synaptic plasticity, an attractive but unproven possibility is that dendritic spines play an important role in the mechanisms of learning and memory.

## Some transmitters are used by diffusely distributed systems of neurons to modulate the general excitability of the brain

The brain carries out many sensory, motor, and cognitive functions that require fast, specific, spatially organized
neural connections and operations. Consider the detailed neural mapping that allows you to read this sentence or the precise timing required to play the piano. These functions require spatially focused networks (Fig. 13-6A).

Other functions, such as falling asleep, waking up, becoming attentive, or changing mood, involve more general alterations of the brain. Several systems of neurons regulate the general excitability of the CNS. Each of these modulatory systems uses a different neurotransmitter, and the axons of each make widely dispersed, diffuse, almost meandering synaptic connections to carry a simple message to vast regions of the brain. This arrangement can be achieved by a widely divergent network (see Fig. 13-6B). The functions of the different systems are not well understood, but each appears to be essential for certain aspects of arousal, motor control, memory, mood, motivation, and metabolic state. The modulatory systems are of central importance to clinical medicine. Both the activity of psychoactive drugs and the pathological processes of most psychiatric disorders seem to involve alterations in one or more of the modulatory systems.

![bo54099069a0](bo54099069a0.jpg)

Figure 13-6 Synaptic connections.

The brain has several modulatory systems with diffuse central connections. Although they differ in structure and function, they have certain similarities:

1. Typically, a small set of neurons (several thousand) forms the center of the system.
2. Neurons of the diffuse systems arise from the central core of the brain, most of them from the brainstem.
3. Each neuron can influence many others because each one has an axon that may contact tens of thousands of postsynaptic neurons spread widely across the brain.
4. The synapses made by some of these systems seem designed to release transmitter molecules into the extracellular fluid so that they can diffuse to many neurons rather than be confined to the vicinity of a single synaptic cleft.

The main modulatory systems of the brain are distinct anatomically and biochemically. Separate systems use norepinephrine, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), dopamine, ACh, or histamine as their neurotransmitter. They all tend to involve numerous metabotropic transmitter receptors (see p. 206). Unlike ionotropic receptors, which are themselves ion channels, metabotropic receptors are coupled to enzymes such as adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C through G proteins. For example, the brain has 10 to 100 times more metabotropic (i.e., muscarinic) ACh receptors than ionotropic (i.e., nicotinic) ACh receptors. We briefly describe the anatomy and possible functions of each major system (Fig. 13-7).

Norepinephrine-containing neurons are in the tiny locus coeruleus (from the Latin for "blue spot" because of the pigment in its cells), located bilaterally in the brainstem (see Fig. 13-7A). Each human locus coeruleus has $\sim 12,000$ neurons. Axons from the locus coeruleus innervate just about every part of the brain: the entire cerebral cortex,
the thalamus and hypothalamus, the olfactory bulb, the cerebellum, the midbrain, and the spinal cord. Just one of its neurons can make $>250,000$ synapses, and that cell can have one axon branch in the cerebral cortex and another in the cerebellar cortex! Locus coeruleus cells seem to be involved in the regulation of attention, arousal, and sleep-wake cycles as well as in learning and memory, anxiety and pain, mood, and brain metabolism. Recordings from awake rats and monkeys in behavioral studies show that locus coeruleus neurons are best activated by new, unexpected, nonpainful sensory stimuli in the animal's environment. They are least active when the animals are not vigilant, just sitting around quietly digesting a meal. The locus coeruleus may participate in general arousal of the brain during interesting events in the outside world.

Serotonin-containing neurons are mostly clustered within the nine raphé nuclei (see Fig. 13-7B). Raphé means "ridge" or "seam" in Greek, and indeed the raphé nuclei lie to either side of the midline of the brainstem. Each nucleus projects to different regions of the brain, and together they innervate most of the CNS in the same diffuse way as the locus coeruleus neurons. Similar to neurons of the locus coeruleus, cells of the raphé nuclei fire most rapidly during wakefulness, when an animal is aroused and active. Raphé neurons are quietest during certain stages of sleep. The locus coeruleus and the raphé nuclei are part of a venerable concept called the ascending reticular activating system, which implicates the reticular "core" of the brainstem in processes that arouse and awaken the forebrain. Raphé neurons seem to be intimately involved in the control of sleep-wake cycles as well as the different stages of sleep. Serotonergic raphé neurons have also been implicated in the control of mood and certain types of emotional behavior. Many hallucinogenic drugs, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), apparently exert their effects through interaction with serotonin

![bo55099069a0](bo55099069a0.jpg)

Figure 13-7 Four diffusely connected systems of central neurons using modulatory transmitters. A, Neurons containing norepinephrine are located in the locus coeruleus and innervate nearly every part of the CNS. B, Neurons containing serotonin are located in two groups of raphé nuclei and project to most of the brain. C, Neurons containing dopamine are located in the substantia nigra (and these project to the striatum) and the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain (and these project to the prefrontal cortex and parts of the limbic system). D, Neurons containing ACh are located in the basal forebrain complex, which includes the septal nuclei and nucleus basalis; the neurons project to the hippocampus and the neocortex. Other ACh-containing neurons originate in the pontomesencephalotegmental cholinergic complex and project to the dorsal thalamus and part of the forebrain.
receptors. Serotonin may also be involved in clinical depression; some of the most effective drugs now used to treat depression (e.g., fluoxetine [Prozac]) are potent blockers of serotonin re-uptake and thus prolong its action in the brain.

Although dopamine-containing neurons are scattered throughout the CNS, two closely related groups of dopaminergic cells have characteristics of the diffuse modulatory systems (see Fig. 13-7C). One of these groups is the substantia nigra in the midbrain. Its cells project axons to the striatum, a part of the basal ganglia, and they somehow facilitate the initiation of voluntary movement. Degeneration of the dopamine-containing cells in the substantia nigra produces the progressively worsening motor dysfunction of Parkinson disease. Another set of dopaminergic neurons lies in the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain; these neurons innervate the part of the forebrain that includes the prefrontal cortex and parts of the limbic system. They have been implicated in neural systems that mediate reinforcement or reward as well as in aspects of drug addiction and psychiatric disorders, most notably schizophrenia. Members of the class of antipsychotic drugs called neuroleptics are antagonists of certain dopamine receptors.

Acetylcholine is the familiar transmitter of the neuromuscular junction and the autonomic nervous system. Within the brain are two major diffuse modulatory cholinergic systems: the basal forebrain complex (which innervates the hippocampus and all of the neocortex) and the pontomesencephalotegmental cholinergic complex (which innervates the dorsal thalamus and parts of the forebrain) (see Fig. 13-7D). The functions of these systems are poorly understood, but interest has been fueled by evidence that they are involved in the regulation of general brain excitability during arousal and sleep-wake cycles as well as perhaps in learning and memory formation.

Collectively, the diffuse modulatory systems may be viewed as providing general regulation of brain function, much like the autonomic nervous system (see Chapter 14) regulates the organ systems of the body. Because their axons spread so widely within the CNS, the few modulatory neurons can have an inordinately strong influence on behavior.

## Electrical synapses serve specialized functions in the mammalian nervous system

Many cells are coupled to one another through gap junctions. The large and relatively nonselective gap junction channels (see p. 165) allow ion currents to flow in both directions (in most types of gap junctions) or unidirectionally (in rare types). It follows from Ohm's law that if two cells are coupled by gap junctions and they have different membrane voltages, current will flow from one cell into the other (see Fig. 6-18C). If the first cell generates an action potential, current will flow through the gap junction channels and depolarize the second cell; this type of current flow, for example, is the basis for conduction of excitation across cardiac muscle. Such an arrangement has all the earmarks of a synapse, and indeed, when gap junctions interconnect neurons, we describe them as electrical synapses.

Electrical synapses would seem to have many advantages over chemical synapses: they are extremely fast and limited only by the time constants of the systems involved, they use relatively little metabolic energy or molecular machinery, they are highly reliable, and they can be bidirectional. Indeed, electrical synapses have now been observed in nearly every part of the mammalian CNS. They interconnect inhibitory neurons of the cerebral cortex and thalamus, excitatory neurons of the brainstem and retina, and a variety of other neurons in the hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and spinal cord. At nearly all of these sites, the gap junction protein connexin-36 (Cx36)—which is expressed exclusively in CNS neurons and $\beta$ cells of the pancreas-is an essential component of the electrical synapse (see Fig. 6-18C). Glial cells in the brain express several other types of connexins. However, in all of the aforementioned sites, electrical synapses tend to be outnumbered by chemical synapses. Gap junctions universally interconnect the photoreceptors of the retina, astrocytes and other types of glia (see p. 289) throughout the CNS, and most types of cells early in development.

Why are chemical synapses, as complex and relatively slow as they are, more prevalent than electrical synapses in the mature brain? Comparative studies suggest several reasons for the predominance of chemical synapses among mammalian neurons. The first is amplification. Electrical synapses do not amplify the signal passed from one cell to the next; they can only diminish it. Therefore, if a presynaptic cell is small relative to its coupled postsynaptic cell, the current that it can generate through an electrical synapse will also be small, and thus "synaptic strength" will be low. By contrast, a small bolus of neurotransmitter from a chemical synapse can trigger an amplifying cascade of molecular events that can cause a relatively large postsynaptic change.

A second advantage of chemical synapses is their ability to either excite or inhibit postsynaptic neurons selectively. Electrical synapses are not inherently excitatory or inhibitory, although they can mediate either effect under the right circumstances. Chemical synapses can reliably inhibit by simply opening channels that are selective for ions with relatively negative equilibrium potentials; they can excite by opening channels selective for ions with equilibrium potentials positive to resting potential.

A third advantage of chemical synapses is that they can transmit information over a broad time domain. By using different transmitters, receptors, second messengers, and effectors, chemical synapses can produce a wide array of postsynaptic effects with time courses ranging from a few milliseconds to minutes and even hours. The effects of electrical synapses are generally limited to the time course of the presynaptic event.

A fourth advantage of chemical synapses is that they are champions of plasticity; their strength can be a strong function of recent neural activity, and they can therefore play a role in learning and memory, which are essential to the success of vertebrate species. Electrical synapses also display forms of long-term plasticity, although this has not been well studied in the mammalian CNS.

It might also be noted that the few perceived advantages of electrical synapses may be more apparent than real. Bidirectionality is clearly not useful in many neural circuits, and the difference in speed of transmission may be too small to matter in most cases. Electrical synapses serve important but specialized functions in the nervous system. They seem to be most prevalent in neural circuits in which speed or a high degree of synchrony is at a premium: quick-escape systems, the fine coordination of rapid eye movements, or the synchronization of neurons generating rhythmic activity. Gap junctions are also effective in diffusely spreading current through large networks of cells, which appears to be their function in photoreceptors and glia.

## NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN

The mammalian nervous system uses dozens of different neurotransmitters that act on $>100$ types of receptors; these receptors stimulate numerous second-messenger systems, which in turn regulate several dozen ion channels and enzymes. We call these pathways of synaptic signaling the transmitter systems. It is not enough to know the identity of a transmitter to predict its effect-one must also know the nature of the components that it interacts with, and these components may vary from one part of the brain to another and even between parts of a single neuron. The components

of the transmitter systems are extremely complex. This subchapter introduces the intricate and vital web of neurotransmitters. The clinical importance of the subject is difficult to overstate. It is likely that most drugs that alter mental function do so by interacting with neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Disorders of neurotransmitter systems are also implicated in many devastating brain disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, Parkinson disease, the damage of stroke, and drug addiction.

## Most of the brain's transmitters are common biochemicals

Most neurotransmitters are similar or identical to the standard chemicals of life, the same substances that all cells use for metabolism. Transmitter molecules can be large or small. The small ones, such as the amino acids glutamate, aspartate, GABA, and glycine, are also simple foods (Fig. 13-8A). Cells use amino acids as an energy source and for construction of essential proteins, but they have co-opted these common molecules for essential and widespread messenger functions in the brain. Another important class of small neurotransmitters is the amines, including the monoamines (e.g., ACh, serotonin, and histamine) listed in Figure 13-8B and the catecholamines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) listed in Figure 13-8C. Neurons synthesize these small transmitters by adding only a few chemical steps to the glucose and amino-acid pathways that are present in every cell. Purine derivatives can also be important transmitters. For example, a key molecule of cell metabolism that also serves as a neurotransmitter is ATP, which is the major chemical intermediate of energy metabolism and is present in many synaptic vesicles. It is also released from various synapses in the central and peripheral nervous systems. ATP appears to be the transmitter responsible for sympathetic vasoconstriction in small arteries and arterioles, for example. ATP acts on a variety of nucleotide receptors, both ionotropic and metabotropic. Adenosine is also a transmitter in the CNS.

The large-molecule transmitters, which constitute a much more numerous group, are proteins or small bits of protein called neuroactive peptides. A few of the better-studied neuropeptides are shown in Figure 13-9. Many were originally identified in non-neural tissues such as the gut or endocrine glands and were only later found in nerve terminals of the brain or peripheral nervous system. They vary in size from dipeptides (e.g., N -acetylaspartylglutamate) to large polypeptides. Among the neuroactive peptides are the endorphins (endogenous substances with morphine-like actions), which include small peptides called enkephalins. The term opioids refers to all substances with a morphinelike pharmacology-the endorphins (endogenous) as well as morphine and heroin (exogenous).

The synthesis of most neuropeptides begins like that of any other secretory protein (see p. 34), with the ribosomedirected assembly of a large prehormone. The prehormone is then cleaved to form a smaller prohormone in the Golgi apparatus and further reduced into small active neuropeptides that are packaged into vesicles. Thus, the synthesis of neuropeptides differs significantly from that of the small transmitters.

[^0]In summary, then, the neurotransmitters consist of a dozen or so small molecules plus 50 to 100 peptides of various sizes. The small transmitters are, as a rule, each stored and released by separate sets of neurons, although some types of neurons do use two or more small transmitters. The peptides, however, are usually stored and released from the same neurons that use one of the small transmitters (Table 13-1), an arrangement called colocalization of neurotransmitters. Thus, GABA may be paired with somatostatin in some synapses, serotonin and enkephalin in others, and so on. The colocalized transmitters may be released together, but of course each acts on its own receptors. In addition, both clear and dense-core vesicles contain ATP as well as their primary transmitter.

One of the unique substances functioning as a transmitter is a gaseous molecule, the labile free radical nitric oxide

All peptides are presented with their $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ termini (i.e., the first to be synthesized) to the left, as is now customary for proteins in general. However, note that for many of the peptide hormones, the amino-acid residues were numbered before this convention was established. The $p$ on the amino-terminal glutamate on some of these peptides stands for pyroglutamate. (○) N13-7
(NO). Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}\right)$ may also serve as transmitters, although evidence thus far is equivocal. NO is synthesized from L-arginine by many cells of the body (see p. 66). NO and CO can exert powerful biological effects by activating guanylyl cyclase, which converts GTP to cGMP. As a neurotransmitter, NO may have unique functions. It seems to be released from both presynaptic and what we normally think of as postsynaptic neurons. Because NO is not packaged into vesicles, its release does not require an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, although its synthesis does. NO may sometimes act as a retrograde messenger, that is, from postsynaptic to presynaptic structures. (○) N13-2 Because NO is small and membrane permeable, it can diffuse about much more freely than other transmitter molecules, even penetrating through one cell to affect another beyond it. On the other hand, NO is evanescent, and it breaks down rapidly. The functions of gaseous transmitters (or "gasotransmitters") are now being vigorously studied and hotly debated.

The endocannabinoids are another unusual group of putative neurotransmitters. They include the endogenous lipophilic molecules anandamide (from ananda, the Sanskrit word for "internal bliss") and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), both of which are arachidonic acid metabolites. These substances are called endocannabinoids because they mimic $\Delta^{9}$-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana, by binding to and activating specific G protein-coupled "cannabinoid" receptors. Remarkably, the brain has more cannabinoid receptors than any other GPCR type. Certain activated neurons synthesize and release endocannabinoids, which move readily across membranes to presynaptic terminals and modulate the further release of conventional transmitters such as GABA and glutamate. Their normal role in the brain is currently unknown. However, activation of cannabinoid receptors with low doses of THC leads to euphoria, relaxed sensations, decreased pain, and increased hunger; it can also impair

# N13-7 Pyroglutamate and C-Terminal Amides 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron, with George Farr providing the chemical structures

Figure 13-9 shows several examples of neuroactive peptides in which the N -terminal residue is pyroglutamate (indicated by a $p$ in the structure shown in the figure). Similarly, the figure shows several examples in which the C-terminal residue has an amide.

## Pyroglutamate

Figure 58-2 in the text shows the peptide backbone of a generic protein. Imagine that the leftmost (i.e., N-terminal) residue in this figure is the side chain for glutamate (see Table 2-1 in the text for a listing of side chains). A reaction of the carboxyl group on the glutamate side chain with the terminal amino group results in the creation of an amide derivative in the form of a five-membered ring. For example, eFigure 13-3 shows the structure of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).

This post-translational modification of a glutamate residue is called a pyroglutamate residue. In the figure, the peptide bonds are shown in red. The pyroglutamate is the magenta ring structure at the left.

eFigure 13-3 Structure of the tripeptide TRH.

## C-Terminal Amide

Figure 58-2 shows the peptide backbone of a protein. Notice that the rightmost (i.e., C-terminal) residue in this figure has a free carboxyl group. If this carboxyl group undergoes a reaction that transfers an $-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$, the result is an amide group (in the C-terminal residue of Figure 58-2, replace the $\mathrm{O}^{-}$group with $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ ). In the above figure, this amide is the magenta $-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ at the right.

For comparison, eFigure 13-4 shows a hypothetical tripeptide without the pyroglutamate at the N terminus and without the C-terminal amide.

problem-solving ability, short-term memory, and motor skills. High doses can alter personality and sometimes trigger hallucinations. THC and related drugs have promise for treatment of the nausea and vomiting of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, suppression of chronic pain, and stimulation of appetite in some patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Most of the chemicals we call neurotransmitters also exist in non-neural parts of the body. Each chemical may serve dual purposes in that it can mediate communication in the nervous system but do something similar or even entirely different elsewhere. Amino acids, of course, are used to make protein everywhere. NO is a local hormone that relaxes the smooth muscle in blood vessels (see p. 480). Surprisingly, the cells with the highest ACh levels are in the cornea of the eye, although corneal cells lack specific receptors for ACh. It is not clear what ACh does for corneal cells, but it almost certainly is not acting as a transmitter. One of the most interesting nonmessenger functions of transmitter molecules is their role in the development of the brain, even before synapses have appeared. At these early stages of development, transmitters may regulate cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, somehow helping to form the brain before they help operate it.

## Synaptic transmitters can stimulate, inhibit, or modulate the postsynaptic neuron

Each neuromuscular junction has a simple and stereotyped job: when an action potential fires in the motor neuron, the junction must reliably excite its muscle cell to fire an action potential and contract. Decisions about muscle contractions
(where, when, and how much) are made within the CNS, and the neuromuscular junction exists simply to communicate that decision to the muscle unambiguously and reliably. To perform this function, neuromuscular transmission has evolved to be very strong so that it is fail-safe under even the most extreme of physiological conditions.

Synapses between neurons usually have a more subtle role in communication, and they use a variety of mechanisms to accomplish their more complex tasks. Like neuromuscular junctions, some neuron-neuron synapses (excitatory) can rapidly excite. However, other synapses (inhibitory) can cause profound inhibition by decreasing postsynaptic excitability directly (postsynaptic inhibition). In a third broad class of synapse (modulatory), the synapse often has little or no direct effect of its own but instead regulates or modifies the effect of other excitatory or inhibitory synapses by acting on either presynaptic or postsynaptic membranes. These three basic types of neural synapses are exemplified by their input to the pyramidal neuron of the cerebral cortex. In the example shown in Figure 13-10, a pyramidal neuron in the visual cortex receives an excitatory synaptic input from the thalamus (with glutamate as the neurotransmitter), an inhibitory synaptic input from an interneuron (with GABA as the neurotransmitter), and a modulatory input from the locus coeruleus (with norepinephrine as the neurotransmitter).

Excitatory Synapses Pyramidal cells receive excitatory inputs from many sources, including the axons of the thalamus. Most fast excitatory synapses in the brain use glutamate as their transmitter, and the thalamus-to-cerebral cortex synapses are no exception (see Fig. 13-10). Aspartate may

Figure 13-10 Synaptic circuitry of the visual cortex. Visual pathways that originate in the retina activate neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. These glutamate-containing neurons in turn synapse on cortical pyramidal neurons and produce some excitation. Also within the primary visual cortex, a GABA-containing neuron mediates localized inhibition. Small cells in the locus coeruleus, a brainstem nucleus, make widely divergent connections onto cortical neurons and release norepinephrine and thus produce modulation.

also be a transmitter in some regions of the CNS. Both amino acids have similar effects on the postsynaptic excitatory amino-acid receptors. For convenience, these types of synapses are often presumptuously referred to as glutamatergic. These excitatory amino acids bind to a group of fast ligandgated cation channels. When activated by synaptic glutamate, glutamate-gated channels generate an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) that is very similar to the one produced by ACh at the neuromuscular junction (see p. 210), except that it is usually much smaller than the EPSP in muscle. In the example shown in Figure 13-11 (left side), glutamate produces the EPSP by activating a nonselective cation channel that has about the same conductance for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Thus, the reversal potential (see p. 146) of the EPSP is -0 mV , about midway between the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}\left(E_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$ and that for $\mathrm{K}^{+}\left(E_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$. An EPSP from the activation of a single glutamatergic synapse in the cerebral cortex peaks at 0.01 to a few millivolts (depending on many factors, including the size of the postsynaptic cell and the size of the synapse), whereas one neuromuscular EPSP reaches a peak of -40 mV -a difference of 40 - to 4000 -fold. Obviously, most glutamatergic synapses are not designed to be fail-safe. It takes the summation of EPSPs from many such synapses to depolarize a postsynaptic neuron to the threshold for triggering an action potential.

Inhibitory Synapses Skeletal muscle cells in vertebrates have only excitatory synapses. On the other hand, virtually all central neurons have numerous excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Thus, the excitability of most neurons at any moment is governed by the dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition. The inhibitory transmitters GABA and glycine are the transmitters at the large majority of inhibitory synapses. Indeed, the inhibitory synapse between the interneuron and the pyramidal cell in Figure 13-10 uses GABA. Both GABA and glycine bind to receptors that gate $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-selective channels (see p. 213). $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$conductance usually has an inhibitory influence because the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\left(E_{\mathrm{Cl}}\right)$ in neurons is near or slightly negative to the resting potential of the neuron. Thus, the reversal potential for the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) is the same as the $E_{\mathrm{Cl}}$. If $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$conductance increases, the $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ has a tendency to move toward $E_{\mathrm{Cl}}$ (see Fig. 13-11, right side). The effect is inhibitory because it tends to oppose other factors (mainly EPSPs) that might otherwise move the $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ toward or above the threshold for an action potential.

Modulatory Synapses Many forms of synaptic modulation influence the nervous system (see pp. 328-333). As an example, consider the axons arising from the locus coeruleus, which synapse widely on pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex (see Figs. 13-7A and 13-10). These axons release the transmitter norepinephrine, a classic modulator with multiple effects. Norepinephrine acts on $\beta$ adrenergic receptors in the pyramidal cell membrane (it may also act on $\alpha$ receptors at the same time). Unlike the actions of the fast aminoacid forms of synaptic transmission, this effect of norepinephrine by itself has little or no obvious influence on the activity of a resting neuron. However, a cell exposed to norepinephrine will react more powerfully when it is
![bo66099069a0](bo66099069a0.jpg)

Figure 13-11 Voltage dependence of EPSPs and IPSPs in the nervous system. An excitatory presynaptic neuron (cell A) and an inhibitory presynaptic neuron (cell B) both synapse on a third neuron (cell C). In this experiment, the investigators injected enough constant current into cell $C$ to initially set the $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ to each of the six values shown in the figure. For each record, the experimenter first stimulated the stimulatory presynaptic neuron to produce an EPSP in the postsynaptic neuron and then stimulated the inhibitory presynaptic neuron to produce an IPSP. These EPSPs and IPSPs reflect the activities of multiple synapses onto cell C. The reversal potential for the EPSP is -0 mV (i.e., stimulating the stimulatory presynaptic neuron has no effect) because $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conduct through the channel equally well. The reversal potential for the IPSP is at about -71 mV (i.e., stimulating the inhibitory presynaptic neuron has no effect). This value is $E_{\mathrm{Cl}}$, which indicates that the IPSP is mediated by a $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel.

Figure 13-12 Modulatory effect of norepinephrine. A, Injecting a neuron from the hippocampus with a sustained depolarizing current pulse leads to a "phasic" action potential response: frequent spiking at the beginning but adaptation as the depolarizing current pulse is maintained. B, The application of norepinephrine causes the spiking that is elicited by the depolarizing current pulse to be sustained longer ("tonic"). C, The cell returns to its control state as in A. (Data from Madison DV, Nicoll RA: Actions of noradrenaline recorded intracellularly in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurones, in vitro. J Physiol 372:221-244, 1986.)
stimulated by a strong excitatory input (usually by glutamatergic synapses), as shown in Figure 13-12. Thus, norepinephrine modulates the cell's response to other inputs.

The molecular mechanisms of neuromodulators are complex and diverse, but all begin with a GPCR that activates an intracellular signal cascade (see pp. 51-66). Binding of norepinephrine to the $\beta$ adrenergic receptor stimulates the intracellular enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which increases intracellular levels of cAMP (the second messenger), which in turn stimulates other enzymes to increase their rates of phosphorylation. Within the cortical neuron, phosphorylation of one or more types of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel decreases the probability of the channels' being open (see p. 163). Fewer open $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels mean higher membrane resistance, greater excitability, and less adaptation of spike firing rates during prolonged stimuli. This $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel pathway is but one of the many mechanisms by which norepinephrine can affect cells. Other effects are generated when norepinephrine activates other subtypes of adrenergic receptors and thus different secondmessenger systems coupled to different channels or enzymes. Modulatory transmitters allow the nervous system tremendous potential and flexibility to vary its state of excitability.

## G proteins may affect ion channels directly, or indirectly through second messengers

GPCRs exist in every cell (see pp. 51-66). In the preceding section we described one example, the receptor for norepinephrine and its second messenger-mediated effect on certain $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. However, norepinephrine alone has at least five major receptor types-two $\alpha$ receptors and three $\beta$ receptors-that act on numerous effectors. In fact, each transmitter has multiple GPCRs, and their effects are complex and interactive and engage almost all aspects of cell function through several intracellular messenger systems. The various GPCRs can recognize a wide range of transmitter types, from small molecules to peptides.

Activated G proteins can trigger a wide array of responses at synapses by either of the two general pathways introduced in Chapter 3: (1) the G protein may modulate the gating of an ion channel directly or by a very short second-messenger
pathway, and (2) the G protein may activate one of several enzyme systems that involve second messengers and subsequent signal cascades.

The first-and simplest-G-protein cascade involves a direct linkage from the receptor to the G protein to the channel and is sometimes called the membrane-delimited pathway. (T) N13-3 In this case the G protein may be the only messenger between the receptor and the effector. A variety of neurotransmitters use this pathway. For example, in heart muscle, ACh binds to a certain type of muscarinic ACh receptor $\left(\mathrm{M}_{2}\right)$ that activates a G protein, the $\beta \gamma$ subunits of which in turn cause a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel to open (see Fig. 13-13B, below). Other receptors in various cells can modulate other $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in a similar way.

One advantage of the membrane-delimited pathway is that it is relatively fast, beginning within 30 to 100 ms -not quite as fast as a ligand-gated channel, which uses no intermediary between receptor and channel, but faster than the many-messenger cascades described next. The membranedelimited pathway is also localized in comparison to the other cascades. Because the G protein cannot diffuse very far within the membrane, only channels nearby can be affected. This type of coupling also allows flexibility because many types of receptors can be coupled to a variety of channels by use of the appropriate G-protein intermediate.

The other general type of G-protein signaling involves enzyme systems and second messengers, often diffusing through the cytoplasm, to influence an ion channel. The terminology deserves some clarification. Traditionally, the small, diffusible intracellular chemicals (e.g., cAMP, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left[\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right]$ ) that help carry the message between a transmitter receptor and a channel are called second messengers. The transmitter itself is counted as the first messenger, but notice that by this logic the receptor is not a messenger at all, even though it transfers a signal from the neurotransmitter to a G protein. The G protein is also not counted as a messenger, nor are the various enzymes that may come before and after the traditional second messenger in any signal cascade. Different cascades involve different numbers of messengers, but obviously, most have many more than two! Alas, the terminology is entrenched,

# N13-3 The Membrane-Delimited Pathway for the Activation of Ion Channels by G Proteins 

## Contributed by Barry W. Connors

The first evidence for a membrane-delimited pathway came from patch-clamp experiments on inside-out patches containing a muscarinic ACh receptor $\left(M_{1}\right)$, the $G_{s}$ heterotrimeric $G$ protein, and a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel capable of being activated by G proteins. These experiments showed that the G protein's $\beta \gamma$ subunits-which remain attached to the membrane-are necessary for activating the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. Thus, everything that is required for the signal-transduction process to work is present in the small patch of membrane. Some authors have voiced a lingering doubt that the $\beta \gamma$ subunits can directly interact with ion channels. An alternative to a direct coupling between G-protein $\beta \gamma$ subunits and the channel is that some lipidsoluble "second messenger"-which is also in the plane of the membrane-mediates the interaction between the G-protein $\beta \gamma$ subunits and the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. However, whether the G protein-channel linkage is direct or occurs via some local membrane messenger, receptors and channels must be quite close for the membrane-delimited pathway to work.

Figure 13-13 Benefits of signal amplification. A, The neurotransmitter (NT) binds directly to a channel, thereby activating it. B, The neurotransmitter binds to a receptor that in turn activates 10 to 20 G proteins (see p. 53). In this example, each $\beta \gamma$ subunit directly activates a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. In addition, each $\alpha$ subunit activates an adenylyl cyclase (AC) molecule, and each AC molecule produces many cAMP molecules that activate protein kinase A (PKA). C, Each activated PKA molecule can phosphorylate and thereby modulate many channels.
although when we speak of second messengers, one should remember that a multiple-messenger cascade is almost always involved. As an added complication, two or more cascades, each with different types of messengers, may sometimes be activated by one type of receptor (an example of divergence; see below).

In Chapter 3, we discussed three of these longer, and slower, G-protein signal cascades: (1) the adenylyl cyclase pathway, (2) the phospholipase C pathway, and (3) the phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ pathway. Each is activated by a different set of receptors, each uses a different G protein, and each generates different intracellular messengers. Some of these messengers dissolve in the watery cytoplasm, whereas others diffuse within the fatty lipid bilayer. The final link in most of the messenger cascades is a kinase.

In a well-known example, cAMP binds to cAMPdependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), which then phosphorylates amino acids on $\mathrm{K}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the membrane. The addition of phosphate groups to the channel protein changes its conformation slightly, which may strongly influence its probability of being open (see p. 163). On page 542 we discuss the stimulation of the $\beta$ adrenergic receptor by norepinephrine, which ultimately results in a stronger heartbeat through phosphorylation and opening of myocardial voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. In the pyramidal cell of the
hippocampus, stimulation of $\beta$ adrenergic receptors increases [cAMP] ${ }_{i}$, which can activate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels but also inhibit some $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. As a result, the cell can fire more action potentials during prolonged stimuli (see Fig. 13-12).

If transmitter-stimulated kinases were allowed to madly phosphorylate without some method of reversing the process, all proteins would quickly become saturated with phosphates and further regulation would become impossible. Protein phosphatases save the day. They act rapidly to remove phosphate groups (see pp. 57-58), and thus the degree of channel phosphorylation at any moment depends on the dynamic balance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

## Signaling cascades allow amplification, regulation, and a long duration of transmitter responses

At this point you may be wondering about the perversity of such complex, interconnected, indirect messenger cascades. Do these long chains of command have any benefit? Why not use simple, fast, ligand-gated channels (Fig. 13-13A) for all transmitter purposes? In fact, complex messenger cascades seem to have advantages.

One important advantage is amplification. When activated, one ligand-gated channel is just that: one ion channel

in one place. However, when activated, one GPCR potentially influences many channels. Signal amplification can occur at several places in the cascade (see p. 51), and a few transmitter molecules can generate a sizable cellular effect. One stimulated receptor can activate perhaps 10 to 20 G proteins, each of which can activate a channel by a membranedelimited pathway such as the $\beta \gamma$ pathway (see Fig. 13-13B). Alternatively, the $\alpha$ subunit of one G protein can activate an adenylyl cyclase, which can make many cAMP molecules, and the cAMP molecules can spread to activate many kinases; each kinase can then phosphorylate many channels (see Fig. 13-13C). If all cascade components were tied together in a clump, signaling would be severely limited. The use of small messengers that can diffuse quickly also allows signaling at a distance, over a wide stretch of cell membrane. (C) N3-4 Signaling cascades also provide many sites for further regulation as well as interaction between cascades. Finally, signal cascades can generate long-lasting chemical changes in cells, which may form the basis for, among other things, a lifetime of memories.

## Neurotransmitters may have both convergent and divergent effects

Two of the most common neurotransmitters in the brain are glutamate and GABA. Either molecule can bind to any of several kinds of receptors, and each of these receptors can mediate a different effect. This ability of one transmitter to activate more than one type of receptor is sometimes called divergence.

Divergence is a rule among neurotransmitters. Nearly every well-studied transmitter can activate multiple receptor subtypes. Divergence means that one transmitter can affect different neurons (or even different parts of the same neuron) in very different ways. It also means that if a transmitter affects different neurons in different ways, it could be because each neuron has a different type of receptor. However, among transmitter systems that use second messengers, divergence may also occur at points beyond the level of the receptor. For example, norepinephrine can turn on or turn off a variety of ion channels in different cells (Fig. 13-14A). Some of these effects occur because norepinephrine activates different receptors, but some of these receptors may each activate more than one second messenger, or a single second messenger (e.g., cAMP) may activate a kinase that influences numerous different channels. Divergence may occur at any stage in the cascade of transmitter effects.

Neurotransmitters can also exhibit convergence of effects. This property means that multiple transmitters, each activating its own receptor type, converge on a single type of ion channel in a single cell. For example, some pyramidal cells of the hippocampus have $\mathrm{GABA}_{B}, 5-\mathrm{HT}_{1 \mathrm{~A}}, \mathrm{~A}_{1}$ (specific for adenosine), and SS (specific for somatostatin) receptors, all of which activate the same $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel (see Fig. 13-14B). Furthermore, in the same cells, norepinephrine, ACh, 5-HT, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and histamine all converge on and depress the slow $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Analogous to divergence, the molecular site of convergence may occur at a common second-messenger system, or different second messengers may converge on the same ion channel.

## FAST AMINO ACID-MEDIATED SYNAPSES IN THE CNS

Fast amino acid-mediated synapses account for most of the neural activity that we associate with specific information processing in the brain: events directly responsible for sensory perception, motor control, and cognition, for

In C, the inset shows a prototypic subunit, with a large extracellular glutamate-binding domain, a membrane-spanning segment, a short loop that partially re-enters the membrane from the cytosolic side, and two more membrane-spanning segments.

example. Glutamate-mediated excitation and GABAmediated inhibition have been intensively studied. In physiological terms, these are also the best understood of the brain's synapses, and this section describes their function.

As a rule, postsynaptic events are more easily measured than presynaptic events; thus, we know more about them. Of course, by measuring postsynaptic events, we also have a window onto the functions of the presynaptic terminal, and this is often the best view we can get of presynaptic functions. For this reason, we begin our description with the downstream, postsynaptic side of the synapse and then work backward to the presynaptic side.

## Most EPSPs in the brain are mediated by two types of glutamate-gated channels

Most glutamate-mediated synapses generate an EPSP with two distinct components, one much faster than the other. Both are triggered by the same presynaptic terminal releasing a single bolus of transmitter, but the two EPSP components are generated by different types of ion channels that are gated by distinct postsynaptic receptors-a case of transmitter divergence. The behavior of these channels helps in understanding the characteristics of the EPSP.

Glutamate can act on two major classes of receptors: GPCRs or metabotropic receptors, and ion channels or ionotropic receptors. As noted above, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs-the $m$ stands for metabotropic) have seven membrane-spanning segments and are linked to heterotrimeric G proteins (Fig. 13-15A). At least eight metabotropic receptors have been identified, and comparisons of their primary structure have been used to infer the evolutionary relationships among receptor subunits (see Fig. 13-15B). The mGluRs form three groups that differ in their sequence similarity, pharmacology, and associated signaltransduction systems.

The three classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors are the AMPA, NMDA, and kainate receptors (Table 13-2). By definition, each is activated by binding glutamate, but their pharmacology and functions differ. The receptor names are derived from their relatively specific agonists: AMPA stands for $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic

acid. NMDA stands for N -methyl-D-aspartate. The kainate receptor is named for one of its agonists, kainic acid, and it can also be activated by domoic acid. The three ionotropic glutamate receptors can also be distinguished by their selective antagonists. AMPA and kainate receptors, but not NMDA receptors, are blocked by drugs such as CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione). Moreover, AMPA receptors can be specifically antagonized by 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives, such as GYKI 53655. NMDA receptors, but not AMPA and kainate receptors, are blocked by APV (2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid). Selective antagonists of kainate receptors have also been discovered.

Ionotropic glutamate receptors are constructed from $\sim 14$ different subunits. Each of these has a large extracellular glutamate-binding domain, followed by a transmembrane segment, a loop that partially enters the membrane from the cytosolic side, and then two more transmembrane segments (see Fig. 13-15C). The loop appears to line the channel pore and may be important for ion selectivity. Kinetic and structural studies indicate that the receptors are heterotetramers, with four subunits arranged around a central channel. Comparisons of primary structures can be used to infer evolutionary relationships among receptor monomeric subunits. Figure 13-15D shows a hypothesized phylogenetic tree for the three classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, with the major subtypes clustered together. Note that the various NMDA receptor subunits (e.g., GluN1, GluN2A through GluN2D) that combine to make the NMDA receptors are more closely related to each other than to the subunits (e.g., GluK1 through GluK5) that combine to make the kainate receptors or to the subunits (e.g., GluA1 through GluA4) that combine to make the AMPA receptors. The metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors have separate family trees because, although both receptor types bind glutamate, they are so different in structure that they almost certainly evolved from different ancestral protein lines.

As noted above, most glutamate-mediated synapses generate an EPSP with two temporal components (Fig. 13-16A, C). The two phases of the glutamate-mediated EPSP have different pharmacological profiles, kinetics, voltage dependencies, ion dependencies, and permeabilities, and most important, they serve distinct functions in the brain. Pharmacological analysis reveals that the faster phase is mediated by an AMPA-type glutamate receptor and the slower phase by an NMDA-type glutamate receptor. These glutamate-gated channels have been extensively studied with
single-channel recording methods. Both AMPA and NMDA receptors have nearly equal permeability to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, but they differ in several ways.

AMPA-gated channels are found in most excitatory synapses in the brain, and they mediate fast excitation, with most types of AMPA channels normally letting very little $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into cells. Their single-channel conductance is relatively low, $\sim 15$ picosiemens (pS), and they show little voltage dependence.

NMDA-gated channels have more complex behavior. Each has a higher conductance, $\sim 50 \mathrm{pS}$, and much slower kinetics. The ion selectivity of NMDA channels is the key to their functions: permeability to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$causes depolarization and thus excitation of a cell, but their high permeability to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ allows them to influence $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ significantly. It is difficult to overstate the importance of intracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can activate many enzymes, regulate the opening of a variety of channels, and affect the expression of genes. Excess $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can even precipitate the death of a cell.

The gating of NMDA channels is unusual: at normal resting voltage (about $\sim 70 \mathrm{mV}$ ), the channel is clogged by $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, and few ions pass through it; the $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ pops out only when the membrane is depolarized above about -60 mV . Thus, the NMDA channel is voltage dependent in addition to being ligand gated; both glutamate and a relatively positive $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ are necessary for the channel to open. How do the NMDA-gated channels open? NMDA-gated channels coexist with AMPA-gated channels in many synapses of the brain. When the postsynaptic cell is at a relatively negative resting potential (see Fig. 13-16A, B), the glutamate released from a synaptic terminal can open the AMPA-gated channel, which is voltage independent, but not the NMDA-gated channel. However, when the postsynaptic cell is more depolarized because of the action of other synapses (see Fig. 13-16C, D), the larger depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane allows the NMDA-gated channel to open by relieving its $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ block. Indeed, under natural conditions, the slower NMDA channels open only after the membrane has been sufficiently depolarized by the action of the faster AMPA channels from many simultaneously active synapses.

The physiological function of kainate-gated channels is still largely a mystery, although recent evidence suggests that they may contribute to some glutamate-mediated EPSPs in specific neuron types. The kainate receptor channels also exist on presynaptic GABAergic and glutamatergic

# N13-4 Differential $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Permeabilities of AMPA- and NMDA-Type Glutamate Receptors 

## Contributed by Barry W. Connors

If the AMPA-type and NMDA-type glutamate receptor channels are so closely related phylogenetically (see Fig. 13-15D), how is it that they have such different $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeabilities? Most of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor channels have a relatively low $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeability because they include at least one GluA2 subunit. GluA2 (but not GluA1, GluA3, or GluA4) has a positively charge arginine residue at a particular site within the channel-forming domain. The arginine in GluA2 is critical for the low $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeability of the native AMPA-type receptor channel. GluA1, GluA3, and GluA4 all have a neutral glutamine in place of the arginine. Indeed, if one constructs a complete AMPA-gated channel in which none of the four subunits has the arginine at the critical site, this channel will have an unnaturally high $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeability. If one starts from such a channel lacking the critically placed arginines, reintroducing a single arginine into any of the four subunits restores the low $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeability.

Because the NMDA-gated channel is naturally permeable to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, one can guess that it follows the same structural rules as the AMPA-gated channel. Indeed, if one locates the homologous amino-acid residue where the neutral arginine would be in the AMPA-gated channel, one will find a neutral asparagine in all subunits of the NMDA-gated channel. Predictably these neutral asparagines-like glutamines at the homologous sites in the mutant subunits of the AMPA-gated channel (see previous paragraph)—allow $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to pass through the pore of NMDA-gated channels.

At more positive values of postsynaptic $V_{\mathrm{mu}}$ $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ detaches from NMDA receptor channel, allowing channel to open so that $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ rises.

Figure 13-16 Glutamate-gated channels. A, At most glutamate-mediated synapses, the EPSP (red curve) is the sum of two components: (1) a rapid component that is mediated by an AMPA receptor (green curve) and (2) a slow component that is mediated by an NMDA receptor (orange curve). In this example, in which the postsynaptic $V_{m}$ is relatively negative, the contribution of the NMDA receptor is very small. B, At a relatively negative initial $V_{m}$ in the postsynaptic cell, as in $\mathbf{A}$, the NMDA receptor does not open. The AMPA receptor, which is independent of postsynaptic $V_{m}$, opens. The result is a fast depolarization. C, In this example, in which the postsynaptic $V_{m}$ is relatively positive, the contribution of the NMDA receptor is fairly large. D, At a relatively positive initial $V_{m}$ in the postsynaptic cell, as in $\mathbf{C}$, glutamate activates both the AMPA and the NMDA receptors. The recruitment of the NMDA receptors is important because, unlike most AMPA receptors, they allow the entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and have slower kinetics.
terminals, where they regulate release of the inhibitory and excitatory transmitters (i.e., GABA and glutamate).

## Most IPSPs in the brain are mediated by the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor, which is activated by several classes of drugs

GABA mediates the bulk of fast synaptic inhibition in the CNS, and glycine mediates most of the rest. Both the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor and the glycine receptor are ionotropic receptors that are, in fact, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-selective channels. Note that $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ can also activate the relatively common $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{B}}$ receptor, which is a GPCR or metabotropic receptor that is linked to either the opening of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels or the suppression of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. Finally, GABA can activate the ionotropic $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{C}}$ receptor, found primarily in neurons of the retina.

Synaptic inhibition must be tightly regulated in the brain. Too much inhibition causes sedation, loss of consciousness,

and coma, whereas too little leads to anxiety, hyperexcitability, and seizures. The need to control inhibition may explain why the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor channel has, in addition to its GABA binding site, several other sites where chemicals can bind and thus dramatically modulate the function of the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor channel. For example, two classes of drugs, benzodiazepines (one of which is the tranquilizer diazepam [Valium]) and barbiturates (e.g., the sedative phenobarbital), each bind to their own specific sites on the outside face of the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor channel. By themselves, these drugs do very little to the channel's activity. However, when GABA is around, benzodiazepines increase the frequency of channel opening, whereas barbiturates increase the duration of channel opening. In addition, the benzodiazepines can increase $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$conductance of the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor channel. Figure 13-17A to $D$ shows the effects of barbiturates on both the IPSP and the single-channel currents. The result, for both the benzodiazepines and the barbiturates, is more inhibitory $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$current, stronger IPSPs, and the behavioral consequences of enhanced inhibition.

Surely, however, the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor did not evolve specialized binding sites just for the benefit of our modern drugs. This sort of logic has motivated research to find endogenous ligands, or natural chemicals that bind to the benzodiazepine and barbiturate sites and serve as regulators of inhibition. Figure 13-17E shows some of the binding sites on the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor. Among the potential natural modulators of the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor may be various metabolites of the steroid hormones progesterone, corticosterone, and testosterone. Some of these hormones increase the lifetime of GABA-activated single-channel currents or the opening frequency of these channels and may thus enhance inhibition. The steroid effect is unlike the usual genomic mechanisms of steroid hormones (see pp. 71-72). Instead, steroids modulate the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor in a manner similar to barbituratesdirectly, through binding sites that are distinct from the other drug-binding sites on the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor. Thus, these steroids are not the natural agonists of the benzodiazepine and barbiturate binding sites. The $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor is also subject to modulation by the effects of phosphorylation triggered by second-messenger signaling pathways within neurons.

## The ionotropic receptors for ACh, serotonin, GABA, and glycine belong to the superfamily of ligand-gated/pentameric channels

We now know the amino-acid sequences of all major ligandgated ion channels in the brain. Even though the receptors for ACh , serotonin, GABA, and glycine are gated by such different ligands and have such different permeabilities, they have the same overall structure: five protein subunits, with each subunit being made up of four membrane-spanning segments (as shown for the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor channel in Fig. 13-17E and inset). For example, inhibitory $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and glycine receptors have structures very similar to those of excitatory nicotinic ACh receptors, even though the first two are selective for anions and the last is selective for cations. For both the glycine and nicotinic ACh receptors, the transmitters bind only to the $\alpha$ subunits, whereas for the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor, the transmitter GABA binds to a site at the interface of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits.

Figure 13-17 Physiology and structure of the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor channel. A, When a pulse of GABA is released from a synapse, it elicits a small IPSP. B, In the presence of a low dose of pentobarbital, the pulse of synaptic GABA elicits a much larger IPSP. Thus, the barbiturate enhances inhibition. C, At the single-channel level, GABA by itself elicits brief channel openings. D, A barbiturate ( $50 \mu \mathrm{M}$ pentobarbital, in this case) does not by itself activate the $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor channel but increases the channel open time when GABA is present. E, The channel receptor is a heteropentamer. It has not only a pore for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$but also separate binding sites for GABA and several classes of channel modulators. The inset shows the presumed structure of one of the five monomers. The M2 domain of each of the five subunits presumably lines the central channel pore. (C and D, Data from Puia G, Santi MR, Vicini S, et al: Neurosteroids act on recombinant human $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptors. Neuron 4:769-765, 1990.)

The primary structures of the many subunit types are remarkably similar, particularly within the amino-acid sequences of the hydrophobic membrane-spanning segments. One such stretch, called the M2 domain, tends to have repeating sequences of the polar amino acids threonine and serine. Each of the five subunits that constitute a channel contributes one M2 domain, and the set of five combines to

form the water-lined pore through which ions can flow (see Fig. 13-17E). For the channels gated by GABA and glycine, selectivity for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$may be determined by positively charged arginines and lysines near the mouth of the pore.

Not quite all ligand-gated channels belong to the same superfamily. We have already seen that the family of ionotropic glutamate receptors is distinct from the family of ligand-gated/pentameric channels. Extensive evidence also indicates that ATP is a synaptic transmitter between certain neurons and at neuron-smooth-muscle cell synapses, with rapid actions similar to those of glutamate and ACh. One of the purinergic receptors or purinoceptors, called P2X, is an ATP-gated cation channel with relatively high $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeability. The sequence of this receptor bears little resemblance to those of either the ionotropic glutamate receptor family or the ligand-gated/pentameric channel superfamily. Instead, each subunit appears to have only two membranespanning segments, and a full channel comprises just three subunits. Functionally, the ATP-gated channel closely resembles the nicotinic ACh receptor; structurally, it is much more akin to the channel superfamily that includes voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see pp. 182-183) and to some mechanosensitive channels. This similarity appears to be a case of convergent evolution among ion channels.

## Most neuronal synapses release a very small number of transmitter quanta with each action potential

A single neuromuscular junction has $\sim 1000$ active zones (see p. 210). A single presynaptic impulse releases 100 to 200 quanta of transmitter molecules (i.e., ACh), which generates an EPSP of $>40 \mathrm{mV}$ in the muscle cell. This is excitation with a vengeance, because the total number of quanta is far more than necessary to cause the muscle cell to fire an action potential and generate a brief contraction. Evolution has designed a neuromuscular junction that works every time, with a large margin of excess for safety. Synapses in the brain are quite different. A typical glutamatergic synapse, which has as few as one active zone, generates EPSPs of only 10 to $1000 \mu \mathrm{~V}$. In most neurons, one EPSP is rarely enough to cause a postsynaptic cell to fire an action potential.

The basis for the small effect of central synapses has been explored by quantal analysis, with refinements of methods originally applied to the neuromuscular junction. In this approach, a single presynaptic axon is stimulated repeatedly while the postsynaptic response is recorded under voltageclamp conditions. The frequency distribution of amplitudes of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) is analyzed, as described for the neuromuscular junction (see Fig. 8-12B). Recall that according to standard quantal theory:

$$
m=n p
$$

Here, $m$ is the total number of quanta released, $n$ is the maximal number of releasable quanta (perhaps equivalent to the number of active zones), and $p$ is the average probability of release. Measurement of these parameters is very difficult. Only in rare cases in central neurons is it possible to find amplitude distributions of EPSCs with clearly separate peaks that may correspond to quantal increments of transmitter. In most cases, EPSC distributions are smooth and broad, which
makes quantal analysis difficult to interpret. The analysis is hampered because EPSCs are small, it is extremely difficult to identify each small synapse, the dendrites electrically filter the recorded synaptic signals, noise arises from numerous sources (including the ion channels themselves), and synapses exhibit considerable variability. Nevertheless, what is clear is that most synaptic terminals in the CNS release only a small number of transmitter molecules per impulse, often just those contained in a single quantum (e.g., 1000 to 5000 glutamate molecules). Furthermore, the probability of release of that single quantum is often substantially less than 1 ; in other words, a presynaptic action potential often results in the release of no transmitter at all. When a quantum of transmitter molecules is released, only a limited number of postsynaptic receptors is available for the transmitter to bind to, usually not more than 100. In addition, because not all the receptors open their channels during each response, only 10 to 40 channels contribute current to each postsynaptic response, compared with the thousands of channels opening in concert during each neuromuscular EPSP.

Because most glutamatergic synapses in the brain contribute such a weak excitatory effect, it may require the nearly simultaneous action of many synapses (and the summation of their EPSPs) to bring the postsynaptic membrane potential above the threshold for an action potential. The threshold number of synapses varies greatly among neurons, but it is roughly in the range of 10 to 100.

Some exceptions to the rule of small synaptic strengths in the CNS may be noted. One of the strongest connections in the CNS is the one between the climbing fibers and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (see Fig. 13-1B). Climbing fibers are glutamatergic axons arising from cells in the inferior olivary nucleus, and they are a critical input to the cerebellum. Climbing fibers and Purkinje cells have a dedicated, one-toone relationship. The climbing fiber branches extensively and winds intimately around each Purkinje cell, making numerous synaptic contacts. When the climbing fiber fires, it generates a massive EPSP ( $\sim 40 \mathrm{mV}$, similar to the neuromuscular EPSP) that evokes a burst of spikes in the Purkinje cell. Like the neuromuscular junction, the climbing fiber-Purkinje cell relationship seems to be designed to deliver a suprathreshold response every time it is activated. It achieves this strength in the standard way: each climbing fiber makes $\sim 200$ synaptic contacts with each Purkinje cell.

## When multiple transmitters colocalize to the same synapse, the exocytosis of large vesicles requires high-frequency stimulation

As we mentioned previously, some presynaptic terminals have two or more transmitters colocalized within them. In these cases, the small transmitters are packaged into relatively small vesicles ( $\sim 40 \mathrm{~nm}$ in diameter), whereas neuropeptides are in larger dense-core vesicles ( 100 to 200 nm in diameter), as noted above. This dual-packaging scheme allows the neuron some control over the relative release rates of its two types of transmitters (Fig. 13-18A). In general, low-frequency stimulation of the presynaptic terminal triggers the release of only the small transmitter (see Fig. 13-18B); co-release of both transmitters requires bursts of high-frequency stimulation (see Fig. 13-18C). This

frequency sensitivity may result from the size and spatial profile of presynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ levels achieved by the different patterns of stimulation. Presynaptic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are located close to the vesicle fusion sites. Low frequencies of activation yield only localized elevations of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, an amount sufficient to trigger the exocytosis of small vesicles near active zones. Larger peptide-filled vesicles are farther from active zones, and high-frequency stimulation may be necessary to achieve
higher, more distributed elevations of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. With this arrangement, it is obvious that the synaptic effect (resulting from the mixture of transmitters released) depends strongly on the way that the synapse is activated.

## PLASTICITY OF CENTRAL SYNAPSES

## Use-dependent changes in synaptic strength underlie many forms of learning

Arguably the greatest achievement of a brain is its ability to learn and to store the experience and events of the past so that it is better adapted to deal with the future. Memory is the ability to store and to recall learned changes, and nervous systems without memory are extremely handicapped. Although the biological bases for learning and memory are far from understood, certain principles have become clear. First, no single mechanism can explain all forms of memory. Even within a single organism, a variety of types of memory exist-and a variety of mechanisms underlie them. Second, evidence is strong that synapses are the physical site of many if not most forms of memory storage in the brain. As the major points of interaction between neurons, synapses are well placed to alter the processing capabilities of a neural circuit in interesting and useful ways. Third, the synaptic strength (i.e., the mean amplitude of the postsynaptic response) of many synapses may depend on their previous activity. The sensitivity of a synapse to its past activity can lead to a long-term change in its future effectiveness, which is all we need to build memory into a neural circuit.

Some forms of memory last just a few seconds or minutes, only to be lost or replaced by new memories. Working memory is an example. It is the continual series of fleeting memories that we use during the course of a day to remember facts and events, what was just spoken to us, where we put the phone down, whether we are coming or goingthings that are useful for the moment but need not be stored longer. Other forms of memory may last for hours to decades and strongly resist disruption and replacement. Such longterm memory allows the accumulation of knowledge over a lifetime. Some memories may be formed after only a single trial (recall a particularly dramatic but unique event in your life), whereas others form only with repeated practice (examples include speaking a language or playing a guitar). Detailed descriptions of the many types of memory are beyond the scope of this chapter, but it seems obvious that no single synaptic mechanism would suffice to generate all of them. Neurophysiologists have identified many types of synaptic plasticity, the term for activity-dependent changes in the effectiveness of synapses, and some of their mechanisms are well understood. However, it has been very difficult to demonstrate that specific forms of memory use particular types of synaptic plasticity, and correlation of memory with synaptic plasticity remains a coveted goal of current research.

## Short-term synaptic plasticity usually reflects presynaptic changes

Repetitive stimulation of neuronal synapses often yields brief periods of increased or decreased synaptic strength

B RESPONSE TO LOW-FREQUENCY STIMULATION

Figure 13-19 Facilitation, potentiation, depression, and habituation. (Data from Levitan IB, Kaczmarek LK: The Neuron: Cell and Molecular Biology, 2nd ed. New York, Oxford University Press, 1997.)
(Fig. 13-19). The usual nomenclature for the short-term increases in strength is facilitation (which lasts tens to hundreds of milliseconds), augmentation (which lasts several seconds), and post-tetanic potentiation (which lasts tens of seconds to several minutes and outlasts the period of highfrequency stimulation). Not all of them are expressed at every type of synapse. In general, the longer-lasting modifications require longer periods of conditioning stimuli. Shortterm decreases in synaptic strength include depression, which can occur during high-frequency stimulation, and habituation, which is a slowly progressing decrease that occurs during relatively low-frequency activation.

Three potential explanations may be offered for shortterm increases in synaptic strength. First, the presynaptic terminal may release more transmitter in response to each action potential. Second, the postsynaptic receptors may be more responsive to transmitter because of a change in their number or sensitivity. Third, both of these changes may occur simultaneously. Studies involving a variety of synapses
suggest that the first explanation is most often correct. In these cases, quantal analysis usually shows that synapses become stronger because more neurotransmitter is released during each presynaptic action potential; postsynaptic mechanisms generally do not play a role. This form of plasticity seems to depend on the influx of presynaptic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ during the conditioning tetanus. ( $\mathrm{N13-5}$ Katz and Miledi first proposed that synaptic strength is increased because of residual $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ left in the terminal after a conditioning train of stimuli at the neuromuscular junction. Recent work supports this hypothesis. The idea is that (1) a tetanic stimulus leads to a substantial increase in presynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, that saturates intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ buffers; (2) the high presynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, takes a relatively long time to decline to baseline, and prolonged stimulation requires prolonged recovery times; and (3) presynaptic action potentials arriving after the conditioning tetanus generate a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx that sums with the residual $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ from the preceding tetanus to yield a larger than normal peak $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Because the dependence of transmitter release on presynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is highly nonlinear, the increase in release after conditioning stimuli can be large. Several types of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitive proteins are present in the presynaptic terminal; the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding site on synaptotagmin triggers exocytosis, whereas $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding sites on other proteinsperhaps including protein kinase C (see pp. 60-61) and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs; see p. 60) regulate short-term increases in transmitter release.

Several mechanisms cause short-term decreases in synaptic strength, including the depletion of vesicles and the inactivation of presynaptic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. Habituation has been studied in the marine invertebrate Aplysia. The animal reflexively withdraws its gill in response to a stimulus to its skin. Vincent Castellucci and Eric Kandel (5) N13-6 found that withdrawal becomes less vigorous-that is, the animal habituates-when the stimulus is presented repeatedly. The basis for this behavioral habituation is, at least in part, a decrease in the strength of synapses made by skin sensory neurons onto gill-withdrawal motor neurons. Using quantal analysis, Castellucci and Kandel showed that synaptic habituation is due to fewer transmitter quanta being released per action potential. Thus, as with the short-term enhancements of synaptic strength, this example of habituation is due to presynaptic modifications.

## Long-term potentiation in the hippocampus may last for days or weeks

In 1973, Timothy Bliss and Terje Lømo described a form of synaptic enhancement that lasted for days or even weeks. This phenomenon, now called long-term potentiation (LTP), occurred in excitatory synapses of the mammalian cerebral cortex. LTP was generated by trains of highfrequency stimulation applied to the presynaptic axons, and it was expressed as an increase in the size of EPSPs. Several properties of LTP, including its longevity and its location in cortical synapses, made it immediately attractive as a candidate for the cellular basis of certain forms of vertebrate learning. Years of intensive research have revealed many details of the molecular mechanisms of LTP. They have also provided some evidence, albeit still indirect, that LTP is involved in some forms of learning. Numerous mechanistically distinct

Figure 13-20 Causing LTP by pairing presynaptic and postsynaptic stimuli. A, Pyramidal CA3 neurons in the hippocampus send axons (Schaffer collaterals) to synapse on pyramidal CA1 neurons. In the case of the "control" stimulus, the stimulating electrode stimulates collaterals that activate one set of synapses on the postsynaptic CA1 neuron. In this case, the CA1 neuron receives only presynaptic stimuli. In the case of the "test" stimulus, a second electrode stimulates a different set of collaterals that activate a different set of synapses on that same CA1 neuron. However, in this case, the presynaptic stimuli will be paired with a postsynaptic depolarization that is delivered by a third microelectrode. Aside from pairing or not pairing the presynaptic stimuli with a postsynaptic stimulus, the test and control pathways are equivalent. The third microelectrode records the EPSPs from the CA1 neuron in both the test and control experiments. B, In this case, the control Schaffer collaterals are stimulated. Each test pulse is represented by a point on the graph. However, because the CA1 neuron is not depolarized, the amplitude of the EPSPs remains constant (i.e., there is no LTP). C, In this case, the test Schaffer collaterals are stimulated. When the CA1 neuron is also depolarized, the amplitude of the EPSPs greatly increases (i.e., LTP has been induced).

LTP is easily demonstrated in several synaptic relays within the hippocampus, a part of the cerebral cortex that has often been considered essential for the formation of certain long-term memories. The best studied of these synapses is between the Schaffer collateral axons of CA3 pyramidal neurons (forming the presynaptic terminals) and CA1 pyramidal neurons (the postsynaptic neurons). In a typical experiment, the strength of synapses to the CA1 neuron is tested by giving a single shock about once every 10 seconds. Stimuli are applied separately to two sets of Schaffer collateral axons that form two different sets of synapses (Fig. 13-20A). If we stimulate a "control" Schaffer collateral once every 10 seconds, the amplitude of the EPSPs recorded in the postsynaptic CA1 neuron remains rather constant during many tens of minutes (see Fig. 13-20B). However, if we pair the presynaptic test shocks occurring once every 10 seconds to the "test" pathway with simultaneous postsynaptic depolarization of the CA1 neuron, the amplitude of the EPSP gradually increases several-fold (see Fig. 13-20C), which is indicative of LTP. In this case, the trigger for LTP was the pairing of a low-frequency presynaptic input and a strong postsynaptic depolarization. We already saw that Bliss and

Lemo originally induced LTP by activating the presynaptic axons with brief bursts of tetanic stimulation ( 50 to 100 stimuli at a frequency of $\sim 100 \mathrm{~Hz}$ ). Both strategies-presynaptic-postsynaptic pairing protocol and tetanic presynaptic stimulation-are effective ways to induce LTP.

The induction of LTP has several interesting features that enhance its candidacy as a memory mechanism. First, it is input specific, which means that only the activated set of synapses onto a particular cell will be potentiated, whereas unactivated synapses to that same neuron remain unpotentiated. Second, induction of LTP requires coincident activity of the presynaptic terminals plus significant depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. We saw this effect in Figure 13-20C, which showed that inducing LTP required coincident synaptic input and depolarization. Because single hippocampal synapses are quite weak, the requirement for substantial postsynaptic activation means that LTP is best induced in an in vivo situation by cooperativity-enough presynaptic axons must cooperate, or fire coincidentally, to strongly activate the postsynaptic cell. The cooperative property of LTP can be used to form associations between synaptic inputs. Imagine that two sets of weak inputs onto one cell are, by themselves, too weak to induce LTP. Perhaps each encodes some sensory feature of an object: the sight (input

1) and sound (input 2) of your pet cat. If the two firing together are strong enough to induce LTP, both sets of synaptic inputs will tend to strengthen, and the features that they encode (the sight and sound of the cat) will become associated in their enhanced ability to fire the postsynaptic cell. In contrast, for example, the sight of your cat and the sound of your alarm clock will rarely occur together, and their neural equivalents will not become associated.

The molecular mechanisms of one form of LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampus have been partially elucidated. The synapse uses glutamate as its transmitter, and both AMPA and NMDA receptors are activated to generate an EPSP. Induction of this type of LTP depends on an increase in postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ levels beyond a critical level and lasting for about 1 to 2 seconds. (Recall that the short-term forms of enhancement required a presynaptic increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$; see the preceding section.) Under most conditions, postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ levels rise during a tetanic stimulus because of the activation of NMDA receptors, the only type of glutamate-activated channel that is usually permeable to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (see Fig. 13-16). Recall also that the NMDA-type glutamate receptor channel is voltage dependent; to open, it requires $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ to be relatively positive. The cooperativity requirement of LTP is really a requirement for the activation of NMDA receptors so that $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can enter-if the postsynaptic $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is too negative (as it is when synaptic activation is weak), NMDA channels remain mostly closed. If activation is strong (as it is when multiple inputs cooperate or when tetanus occurs), $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ becomes positive enough to allow NMDA channels to open. The stimulus-induced rise in postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ activates at least one essential kinase: CaMKII (see p. 60). Blocking this kinase with drugs prevents induction of LTP. Several other types of kinases are implicated, but the evidence that these mediate-as opposed to modulate-LTP is equivocal.

The molecular pathways leading to the expression and maintenance of LTP are more obscure after the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced activation of CaMKII. Evidence has been presented both for and against postsynaptic and presynaptic changes as explaining the increase in synaptic strength. For the most commonly studied form of LTP described here (i.e., dependent on NMDA receptors), compelling evidence demonstrates a postsynaptic mechanism involving the recruitment of more AMPA receptors to the postsynaptic membrane. Sometimes, postsynaptic AMPA receptors appear to be functionally "silent" until LTP mechanisms activate them or insert them into the membrane. Evidence also suggests a presynaptic mechanism for enhancing transmitter release. This presynaptic hypothesis requires the presence of some unknown, rapidly diffusing retrograde messenger that can carry a signal from the postsynaptic side (where rising $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is clearly a trigger for LTP) back to the presynaptic terminal.

## Long-term depression exists in multiple forms

Memory systems may have mechanisms not only to increase synaptic strength but also to decrease it. In fact, long-term depression (LTD) can be induced in the same synapses within the hippocampus that generate the $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$-dependent LTP described in the preceding section. The critical feature that determines whether the synapses will strengthen or
weaken is simply the frequency of stimulation that they receive. For example, several hundred stimuli delivered at 50 Hz produce LTP, the same number delivered at 10 Hz has little effect, and at 1 Hz they produce LTD. One set of synapses can be strengthened or weakened repeatedly, which suggests that each process (LTP and LTD) acts on the same molecular component of the synapses. LTD induced in this way shows the same input specificity as LTP-only the stimulated synapses onto a cell are depressed.

Multiple forms of LTD differ according to their molecular mechanisms. One type depends on activation of mGluRs; another apparently requires activation of cannabinoid receptors. We describe the type of LTD that has been studied most extensively. The induction requirements of this form of hippocampal LTD are paradoxically similar to those of LTP: LTD induced by low-frequency stimulation depends on the activation of NMDA receptors, and it requires an increase in postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. The key determinant of whether a tetanic stimulus induces LTP or LTD may be the level to which postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ rises. Figure 13-21 illustrates a simple model of the induction mechanisms for LTD and LTP. Synaptic activation releases glutamate, which activates NMDA receptors, which in turn allow $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to enter the postsynaptic cell. In the case of high-frequency stimulation, postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ rises to very high levels; if stimulation is of low frequency, the rise in postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is more modest. High levels of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ lead to a net activation of protein kinases, whereas modest levels of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ preferentially activate protein phosphatases, perhaps calcineurin. The kinases and phosphatases in turn act on synaptic proteins or phosphoproteins that somehow regulate synaptic strength.

LTP-inducing stimuli phosphorylate specific residues on AMPA receptors and, conversely, dephosphorylate other residues on AMPA receptors. These post-translational changes are, however, only part of the story of long-term synaptic plasticity. LTP increases-and LTD decreases-the numbers of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane by modulating receptor trafficking into and out of the surface membrane. Longer lasting LTP- and LTD-induced changes seem to involve mechanisms that depend on protein synthesis, including structural changes in synapses and spines.

The simple scheme in Figure 13-21 leaves unidentified many of the steps between the rise in postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and the change in synaptic strength; most of the molecular details remain to be determined. However, if the model is correct, it means that synaptic strength (and, by implication, some memory) is under the dynamic control of cellular processes that determine postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Once again in physiology, $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ has been assigned a pivotal role in a vital process.

## Long-term depression in the cerebellum may be important for motor learning

A variety of other types of LTP and LTD have been described in other synapses and even within the same synapses of the CA1 region in the hippocampus. Clearly, multiple means and mechanisms may be used to strengthen and to weaken synapses in the brain over a range of time courses. We briefly describe one other well-studied type of synaptic modification in the mammalian brain, LTD in the cerebellum.

![bo82099069a0](bo82099069a0.jpg)

Figure 13-21 Proposed molecular mechanism for LTP and LTD. Glutamate release from the presynaptic terminal activates NMDA receptor channels, which allow $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to enter the postsynaptic cell. The glutamate also activates AMPA receptor channels. Whether the ultimate effect is LTP or LTD appears to depend on the extent to which $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ rises. High levels of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$-produced by high-frequency stimulationlead to a net activation of protein kinases and thus phosphorylation of one or more synaptic proteins that regulate synaptic strength. One hypothetical pathway has the phosphorylated/dephosphorylated synaptic proteins modulating the AMPA receptor channel. The result is LTP. The postsynaptic neuron may also be able to influence the presynaptic terminal. A moderate increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$-produced by low-frequency stimulation-preferentially activates protein phosphatases, which presumably dephosphorylate the same synaptic proteins as in the previous example. The result is LTD.

The cerebellum is a large brain structure that is important in motor control and strongly implicated in motor learning. The cortex of the cerebellum is a thin, multiply folded sheet of cells with an intricate but highly repetitious neural structure. The principal cell of the cerebellum is the Purkinje cell, a large neuron that uses GABA as its transmitter and whose axon forms the sole output of the cerebellar cortex. Purkinje cells receive two types of excitatory synaptic input: (1) each Purkinje cell receives powerful synaptic contact from just a single climbing fiber, which comes from a cell in the inferior olivary nucleus (see Fig. 13-1B), and (2) each Purkinje cell also receives synaptic input from $\sim 150,000$ parallel fibers, which originate from the tiny granule cells of the cerebellum itself. This remarkable conjunction of synaptic inputs is the basis for a theory of motor learning that was proposed by David Marr and James Albus in 1970. They predicted that the parallel-fiber synapses should change their strength only if they are active at the same time as the climbing fiber onto the same cell. This idea received important experimental support from the laboratory of Masao Ito.

Ito and colleagues monitored EPSPs in a Purkinje cell while stimulating some of its inputs from parallel fibers and its single input from the climbing fiber. They found that the EPSPs generated by the parallel fibers became smaller when both the parallel fibers and the cell's climbing fiber were coactivated at low frequencies. Stimulating either input alone did not cause any change. Cerebellar LTD can last at least several hours. As with the hippocampal LTP and LTD described above, cerebellar LTD showed input specificity: only those parallel fibers coactivated with the climbing fiber were depressed, whereas others with synapses onto the cell were unchanged.

The mechanism of cerebellar LTD has some similarities to that of LTD in the hippocampus, but it is also distinctly different. Parallel-fiber synapses weaken because of reduced effectiveness-a reduction in either number or sensitivityof postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors. As in the hippocampus, induction of cerebellar LTD requires an increase in postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. However, unlike in the hippocampus, no NMDA-type glutamate receptors are present in the mature cerebellum to mediate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux. Instead, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can enter Purkinje cells through voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels that are opened during the exceptionally powerful EPSP that the climbing fiber generates. In addition to a rise in postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, cerebellar LTD induction seems to require the

activation of mGluRs and protein kinase C by the parallel fibers. Increases in postsynaptic $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, and NO have also been implicated in LTD induction. At present, the relationships between these putative induction factors and the molecular pathways leading to the expression of cerebellar LTD are obscure.

As we pointed out for the hippocampus, most efficient memory systems need mechanisms for both weakening and strengthening of their synapses. It turns out that parallelfiber synapses of the cerebellum can be induced to generate

LTP as well as LTD by stimulating them at relatively low frequencies ( 2 to 8 Hz ). Cerebellar LTP, unlike hippocampal LTP, requires presynaptic but not postsynaptic increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Potentiation seems to be a result of increased transmitter release from the presynaptic terminal.

# THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 

George B. Richerson

When we are awake, we are constantly aware of sensory input from our external environment, and we consciously plan how to react to it. When we are asleep, the nervous system has a variety of mechanisms to dissociate cortical function from sensory input and somatic motor output. Among these mechanisms are closing the eyes, blocking the transmission of sensory impulses to the cortex as they pass through the thalamus, and effecting a nearly complete paralysis of skeletal muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep to keep us from physically acting out our dreams.

The conscious and discontinuous nature of cortical brain function stands in sharp contrast to that of those parts of the nervous system responsible for control of our internal environment. These "autonomic" processes never stop attending to the wide range of metabolic, cardiopulmonary, and other visceral requirements of our body. Autonomic control continues whether we are awake and attentive, preoccupied with other activities, or asleep. While we are awake, we are unaware of most visceral sensory input, and we avoid any conscious effort to act on it unless it induces distress. In most cases, we have no awareness of motor commands to the viscera, and most individuals can exert voluntary control over visceral motor output in only minor ways. Consciousness and memory are frequently considered the most important functions of the human nervous system, but it is the visceral control system-including the autonomic nervous system (ANS)-that makes life and higher cortical function possible.

We have a greater understanding of the physiology of the ANS than of many other parts of the nervous system, largely because it is reasonably easy to isolate peripheral neurons and to study them. As a result of its accessibility, the ANS has served as a key model system for the elucidation of many principles of neuronal and synaptic function.

## ORGANIZATION OF THE VISCERAL CONTROL SYSTEM

## The ANS has sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric divisions

Output from the central nervous system (CNS) travels along two anatomically and functionally distinct pathways: the somatic motor neurons, which innervate striated skeletal
muscle; and the autonomic motor neurons, which innervate smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, secretory epithelia, and glands. All viscera are richly supplied by efferent axons from the ANS that constantly adjust organ function.

The autonomic nervous system (from the Greek for "selfgoverning," functioning independently of the will) was first defined by Langley in 1898 as including the local nervous system of the gut and the efferent neurons innervating glands and involuntary muscle. Thus, this definition of the ANS includes only efferent neurons and enteric neurons. Since that time, it has become clear that the efferent ANS cannot easily be dissociated from visceral afferents as well as from those parts of the CNS that control the output to the ANS and those that receive interoceptive input. O N14-1 This larger visceral control system monitors afferents from the viscera and the rest of the body, compares this input with current and anticipated needs, and controls output to the body's organ systems.

The ANS has three divisions: sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the ANS are the two major efferent pathways controlling targets other than skeletal muscle (Fig. 14-1). Each innervates target tissue by a two-synapse pathway. The cell bodies of the first neurons lie within the CNS. These preganglionic neurons are found in columns of cells in the brainstem and spinal cord and send axons out of the CNS to make synapses with postganglionic neurons in peripheral ganglia interposed between the CNS and their target cells. Axons from these postganglionic neurons then project to their targets. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions can act independently of each other. However, in general, they work synergistically to control visceral activity and often act in opposite ways, like an accelerator and brake to regulate visceral function. An increase in output of the sympathetic division occurs under conditions such as stress, anxiety, physical activity, fear, or excitement, whereas parasympathetic output increases during sedentary activity, eating, or other "vegetative" behavior.

The enteric division of the ANS is a collection of afferent neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons that form networks of neurons called plexuses (from the Latin "to braid") that surround the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It can function as a separate and independent nervous system, but it is normally controlled by the CNS through sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers.

## Sympathetic preganglionic neurons originate from spinal segments T1 to L3 and synapse with postganglionic neurons in paravertebral or prevertebral ganglia

Preganglionic Neurons The cell bodies of preganglionic sympathetic motor neurons are located in the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord between levels T1 and L3. At these spinal levels, autonomic neurons lie in the intermediolateral cell column, or lateral horn, between the dorsal and ventral horns (Fig. 14-2). Axons from preganglionic sympathetic

neurons exit the spinal cord through the ventral roots along with axons from somatic motor neurons. After entering the spinal nerves, sympathetic efferents diverge from somatic motor axons to enter the white rami communicantes. These rami, or branches, are white because most preganglionic sympathetic axons are myelinated.

Paravertebral Ganglia Axons from preganglionic neurons enter the nearest sympathetic paravertebral ganglion through a white ramus. These ganglia lie adjacent to the vertebral column. Although preganglionic sympathetic fibers emerge only from levels T1 to L3, the chain of sympathetic ganglia extends all the way from the upper part of the neck to the coccyx, where the left and right sympathetic chains merge in the midline and form the coccygeal ganglion. In general, one ganglion is positioned at the level of each spinal root, but adjacent ganglia are fused in some cases. The most rostral ganglion, the superior cervical ganglion, arises from fusion of C 1 to C 4 and supplies the head and neck. The next two ganglia are the middle cervical ganglion, which arises from fusion of C5 and C6, and the inferior cervical ganglion (C7 and C8), which is usually fused with the first thoracic ganglion to form the stellate ganglion. Together, the middle cervical and stellate ganglia, along with the upper thoracic ganglia, innervate the heart, lungs, and bronchi. The

Sympathetic preganglionic neurons are shown in red and postganglionic neurons in dark blue-violet. Afferent (sensory) pathways are in blue. Interneurons are shown in black.

remaining paravertebral ganglia supply organs and portions of the body wall in a segmental fashion.

After entering a paravertebral ganglion, a preganglionic sympathetic axon has one or more of three fates. It may (1) synapse within that segmental paravertebral ganglion, (2) travel up or down the sympathetic chain to synapse within a neighboring paravertebral ganglion, or (3) enter the greater or lesser splanchnic nerve to synapse within one of the ganglia of the prevertebral plexus.

Prevertebral Ganglia The prevertebral plexus lies in front of the aorta and along its major arterial branches and includes the prevertebral ganglia and interconnected fibers (Fig. 14-3). The major prevertebral ganglia are named according to the arteries that they are adjacent to and include the celiac, superior mesenteric, aorticorenal, and inferior mesenteric ganglia. Portions of the prevertebral plexus extend down the major arteries and contain other named and unnamed ganglia and plexuses of nerve fibers, which altogether make up a dense and extensive network of sympathetic neuron cell bodies and nerve fibers.

Each preganglionic sympathetic fiber synapses on many postganglionic sympathetic neurons that are located within one or several nearby paravertebral or prevertebral ganglia. It has been estimated that each preganglionic sympathetic neuron branches and synapses on as many as 200 postganglionic neurons, which enables the sympathetic output to have more widespread effects. However, any impulse arriving at its target end organ has only crossed a single synapse between the preganglionic and postganglionic sympathetic neurons.

Postganglionic Neurons The cell bodies of postganglionic sympathetic neurons that are located within paravertebral ganglia send out their axons through the nearest gray rami communicantes, which rejoin the spinal nerves (see Fig. 14-2). These rami are gray because most postganglionic axons are unmyelinated. Because preganglionic sympathetic neurons are located only in the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal segments (T1 to L3), white rami are found only at these levels (Fig. 14-4, left panel). However, because each sympathetic ganglion sends out postganglionic axons, gray rami are present at all spinal levels from C 2 or C 3 to the coccyx. Postganglionic sympathetic axons from paravertebral and prevertebral ganglia travel to their target organs within other nerves or by traveling along blood vessels. Because the paravertebral and prevertebral sympathetic ganglia lie near the spinal cord and thus relatively far from their target organs, the postganglionic axons of the sympathetic division tend to be long. On their way to reach their targets, some postganglionic sympathetic axons travel

Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons originate from the brainstem and sacral spinal cord and synapse with postganglionic neurons in ganglia located near target organs

The cell bodies of preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are located in the medulla, pons, and midbrain and in the S2 through S4 levels of the spinal cord (see Fig. 14-4, right panel). Thus, unlike the sympatheticor thoracolumbar-division, whose preganglionic cell bodies are in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord, the parasympathetic-or craniosacral-division's preganglionic cell bodies are cranial and sacral. The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers originating in the brain distribute with four cranial nerves: the oculomotor nerve (CN III), the facial nerve (CN VII), the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), and the vagus nerve (CN X). The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers originating in S2 through S4 distribute with the pelvic splanchnic nerves.

Postganglionic parasympathetic neurons are located in terminal ganglia that are more peripherally located and more widely distributed than are the sympathetic ganglia. Terminal ganglia often lie within the walls of their target organs. Thus, in contrast to the sympathetic division, postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic division are short.

In some cases, individual postganglionic parasympathetic neurons are found in isolation or in scattered cell groups rather than in encapsulated ganglia.

Cranial Nerves III, VII, and IX The preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that are distributed with CN III, CN VII, and CN IX originate in three groups of nuclei.

1. The Edinger-Westphal nucleus is a subnucleus of the oculomotor complex in the midbrain (Fig. 14-5). Parasympathetic neurons in this nucleus travel in the oculomotor nerve (CN III) and synapse onto postganglionic neurons in the ciliary ganglion (see Fig. 14-4, right panel). The postganglionic fibers project to two smooth muscles of the eye: the constrictor muscle of the pupil and the ciliary muscle, which controls the shape of the lens (see Fig. 15-6).
2. The superior salivatory nucleus is in the rostral medulla (see Fig. 14-5) and contains parasympathetic neurons that project, through a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII), to the pterygopalatine ganglion (see Fig. 14-4, right panel). The postganglionic fibers supply the lacrimal glands, which produce tears. Another branch of the facial nerve carries preganglionic fibers to the submandibular ganglion. The postganglionic fibers supply two salivary glands, the submandibular and sublingual glands.

The CNS neuroanatomy of autonomic control has been difficult to define experimentally. However, a technique developed by Arthur Loewy and his colleagues that traces nerve tracts with the pseudorabies virus has helped to define more clearly the central pathways for autonomic control. For example, if axons of preganglionic sympathetic neurons are exposed to pseudorabies virus, the virus is transported back into the cell bodies, where it replicates. After a delay of several days, neurons that make synapses with these preganglionic neurons (i.e., "premotor" neurons) become infected and the virus is transported to their cell bodies. After longer periods of incubation, neurons farther upstream are also infected. Histological staining can then be used at different time points to visualize neurons that contain the virus at each level upstream.

3. The inferior salivatory nucleus and the rostral part of the nucleus ambiguus in the rostral medulla (see Fig. 14-5) contain parasympathetic neurons that project through the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) to the otic ganglion (see Fig. 14-4, right panel). The postganglionic fibers supply a third salivary gland, the parotid gland.

Cranial Nerve X Most parasympathetic output occurs through the vagus nerve (CN X). Cell bodies of vagal preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are found in the medulla within the nucleus ambiguus and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (see Fig. 14-5). This nerve supplies parasympathetic innervation to all the viscera of the thorax and abdomen, including the GI tract between the pharynx and distal end of the colon (see Fig. 14-4, right panel). Among other effects, electrical stimulation of the nucleus ambiguus results in contraction of striated muscle in the pharynx, larynx, and upper esophagus due to activation of somatic motor neurons (not autonomic), as well as slowing of the heart due to activation of vagal preganglionic parasympathetic neurons. Stimulation of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus induces many effects in the viscera, including initiation of secretion of gastric acid, insulin, and glucagon. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers of the vagus nerve join the esophageal, pulmonary, and cardiac plexuses and travel to terminal ganglia that are located within their target organs.

Sacral Nerves The cell bodies of preganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the sacral spinal cord (S2 to S4) are located in a position similar to that of the preganglionic sympathetic neurons-although they do not form a distinct intermediolateral column. Their axons leave through ventral roots and travel with the pelvic splanchnic nerves to their terminal ganglia in the descending colon and rectum (see p. 862), as well as to the bladder (see pp. 736-737) and the reproductive organs of the male (see p. 1104) and female (see p. 1127).

## The visceral control system also has an important afferent limb

All internal organs are densely innervated by visceral afferents. Some of these receptors monitor nociceptive (painful) input. Others are sensitive to a variety of mechanical and chemical (physiological) stimuli, including stretch of the heart, blood vessels, and hollow viscera, as well as $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, pH , blood glucose, and temperature of the skin and internal organs. Many visceral nociceptive fibers travel in sympathetic nerves (blue projections in Fig. 14-2). Most axons from physiological receptors travel with parasympathetic fibers. As is the case with somatic afferents (see p. 271), the cell bodies of visceral afferent fibers are located within the dorsal root ganglia or cranial nerve ganglia (e.g., nodose and petrosal ganglia). Ninety percent of these visceral afferents are unmyelinated.

The largest concentration of visceral afferent axons can be found in the vagus nerve, which carries non-nociceptive afferent input to the CNS from all viscera of the thorax and abdomen. Most fibers in the vagus nerve are afferents, even though all parasympathetic preganglionic output (i.e., efferents) to the abdominal and thoracic viscera also travels in
the vagus nerve. Vagal afferents, whose cell bodies are located in the nodose ganglion, carry information about the distention of hollow organs (e.g., blood vessels, cardiac chambers, stomach, bronchioles), blood gases (e.g., $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}, \mathrm{pH}$ from the aortic bodies), and body chemistry (e.g., glucose concentration) to the medulla.

Internal organs also have nociceptive receptors that are sensitive to excessive stretch, noxious chemical irritants, and very large decreases in pH . In the CNS, this visceral pain input is mapped (see pp. 400-401) viscerotopically at the level of the spinal cord because most visceral nociceptive fibers travel with the sympathetic fibers and enter the spinal cord at a specific segmental level along with a spinal nerve (see Fig. 14-2). This viscerotopic mapping is also present in the brainstem but not at the level of the cerebral cortex. Thus, awareness of visceral pain is not usually localized to a specific organ but is instead "referred" to the dermatome (see p. 273) that is innervated by the same spinal nerve. This referred pain results from lack of precision in the central organization of visceral pain pathways. Thus, you know that the pain is associated with a particular spinal nerve, but you do not know where the pain is coming from (i.e., from the skin or a visceral organ). For example, nociceptive input from the left ventricle of the heart is referred to the left T1 to T5 dermatomes and leads to discomfort in the left arm and left side of the chest, whereas nociceptive input from the diaphragm is referred to the C3 to C5 dermatomes and is interpreted as pain in the shoulder. This visceral pain is often felt as a vague burning or pressure sensation.

## The enteric division is a self-contained nervous system of the GI tract and receives sympathetic and parasympathetic input

The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a collection of nerve plexuses that surround the GI tract, including the pancreas and biliary system. Although it is entirely peripheral, the ENS receives input from the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the ANS. The ENS is estimated to contain $>100$ million neurons, including afferent neurons, interneurons, and efferent postganglionic parasympathetic neurons. Enteric neurons contain many different neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Thus, not only does the total number of neurons in the enteric division exceed that of the spinal cord, but the neurochemical complexity of the ENS also approaches that of the CNS. The anatomy of the ENS as well as its role in controlling GI function is discussed in Chapter 41.

The plexuses of the ENS are a system of ganglia sandwiched between the layers of the gut and connected by a dense meshwork of nerve fibers. The myenteric or Auerbach's plexus (Fig. 14-6) lies between the outer longitudinal and the inner circular layers of smooth muscle, whereas the submucosal or Meissner's plexus lies between the inner circular layer of smooth muscle and the most internal layer of smooth muscle, the muscularis mucosae (see Fig. 41-3). In the intestinal wall, the myenteric plexus is involved primarily in the control of motility, whereas the submucosal plexus is involved in the control of ion and fluid transport. Both the myenteric and the submucosal plexuses receive preganglionic parasympathetic innervation from the vagus nerve (or sacral nerves in the case of the distal portion of colon and rectum). Thus,

The external longitudinal muscle of the intestine was removed so that the view is of the plexus (the highly interconnected meshwork of neuron cell bodies, axons, and dendrites on the surface) spreading over the deeper circular layer of muscle. (From Burnstock G: Autonomic neuromuscular junctions: Current developments and future directions. J Anat 146:1-30, 1986.)
in one sense, the enteric division is homologous to a large and complex parasympathetic terminal ganglion. The other major input to the ENS is from postganglionic sympathetic neurons. Thus, the ENS can be thought of as "postganglionic" or as a "terminal organ" with respect to the parasympathetic division and "post-postganglionic" with respect to the sympathetic division. Input from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions modulates the activity of the ENS, but the ENS can by and large function normally without extrinsic input. The isolated ENS can respond appropriately to local stimuli and control most aspects of gut function, including initiating peristaltic activity in response to gastric distention, controlling secretory and absorptive functions, and triggering biliary contractions (Box 14-1).

## SYNAPTIC PHYSIOLOGY OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

## The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions have opposite effects on most visceral targets

All innervation of skeletal muscle in humans is excitatory. In contrast, many visceral targets receive both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs. These antagonistic inputs arise from the two opposing divisions of the ANS, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic.

In organs that are stimulated during physical activity, the sympathetic division is excitatory and the parasympathetic division is inhibitory. For example, sympathetic input increases the heart rate, whereas parasympathetic input decreases it. In organs whose activity increases while the

## BOX 14-1 PHOX2B: Master Gene of the Visceral Control System

During development, a complex genetic program expressed in each progenitor cell determines cell fateensuring that the cell migrates to the correct location and differentiates into the correct mature cell type. The genes that encode some transcription factors (see pp. 81-88) turn on at a specific time during development and trigger normal migration or differentiation of specific cell types. phox2b is a transcription factor required for the development of nearly all neurons within the visceral control system and almost no other class of neuron.
phox2b is expressed early in development in all neurons of the mammalian visceral control system-including preganglionic and postganglionic parasympathetic neurons, postganglionic (but not preganglionic) sympathetic enteric neurons, all visceral afferents, and neurons of the NTS, on which they synapse. No other cells express phox2b, except for neurons of the locus coeruleus in the pons (which plays an important role in cardiovascular control) and certain cranial nerve nuclei (most of which are important for respiratory output and for feeding). Knockout of the mouse $P H O X 2 B$ gene leads to loss of development of all these neurons and is fatal. ( $\$ \mathbf{N 1 4 - 9}$ In humans, heterozygous mutations in the $P H O X 2 B$ gene cause congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a congenital form of Ondine curse (see Box 32-5). Infants with this condition have problems with breathing while they sleep, probably because of a deficiency in detection of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in their blood or defective integration of this information by the NTS and other nuclei of the medulla. A subset of patients with PHOX2B mutations also have Hirschsprung disease (see Box 41-2), in which the ENS does not develop normally in a portion of the colon. This combination of CCHS and Hirschsprung disease is called Haddad syndrome. Some CCHS patients also develop tumors of derivatives of the sympathetic nervous system called neuroblastomas.

As a rule, the neural circuits that carry out individual tasks or behaviors (e.g., locomotion, sleep, vision) are formed by several classes of neurons that follow unrelated developmental pathways before they assemble into a circuit. So far, the visceral control system is unique in that most of its constituent neuronal types differentiate under the control of the same highly specific transcription factor, phox2b. PHOX2B can thus be considered the "master gene" of the visceral control system.
body is at rest, the opposite is true. For example, the parasympathetic division stimulates peristalsis of the gut, whereas the sympathetic division inhibits it.

Although antagonistic effects of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the ANS are the general rule for most end organs, exceptions exist. For example, the salivary glands are stimulated by both divisions, although stimulation by the sympathetic division has effects different from those of parasympathetic stimulation (see p. 894). In addition, some organs receive innervation from only one of these two divisions of the ANS. For example, sweat glands, piloerector muscles, and most peripheral blood vessels receive input from only the sympathetic division.

Synapses of the ANS are specialized for their function. Rather than possessing synaptic terminals that are typical of somatic motor axons, many postganglionic autonomic

At one time, scientists searched for "master genes" responsible for directing the development of each group of neurons that share a common function (e.g., all motor neurons or all neurons that contain gamma-aminobutyric acid). This search has been largely fruitless, except for $P H O X 2 B$, which is the closest example of a master gene in that it is expressed almost uniquely and nearly ubiquitously in neurons of the visceral control system. The implication is that these neurons are so closely related to each other in their function that they are bound together by a common developmental program. This common bond is so primitive that a homolog of $P H O X 2 B$ is even found in neurons of Ciona, a urochordate that is a marine animal made up primarily of an intestine that filters seawater.

neurons have bulbous expansions, or varicosities, that are distributed along their axons within their target organ (Fig. 14-7). It was once believed that these varicosities indicated that neurotransmitter release sites of the ANS did not form close contact with end organs and that neurotransmitters needed to diffuse long distances across the extracellular space to reach their targets. However, we now recognize that many varicosities form synapses with their targets, with a synaptic cleft extending $\sim 50 \mathrm{~nm}$ across. At each varicosity, autonomic axons form an "en passant" synapse with their end-organ target. This arrangement results in an increase in the number of targets that a single axonal branch can influence, with wider distribution of autonomic output.

## All preganglionic neurons-both sympathetic and parasympathetic-release acetylcholine and stimulate $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ nicotinic receptors on postganglionic neurons

At synapses between postganglionic neurons and target cells, the two major divisions of the ANS use different neurotransmitters and receptors (Table 14-1). However, in both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions, synaptic transmission between preganglionic and postganglionic neurons (termed ganglionic transmission because the synapse is located in a ganglion) is mediated by acetylcholine (ACh) acting on nicotinic receptors (Fig. 14-8). Nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated channels (i.e., ionotropic receptors) with a pentameric structure (see pp. 212-213). Table 14-2 summarizes some of the properties of nicotinic receptors. The nicotinic receptors on postganglionic autonomic neurons are of a molecular subtype $\left(\mathrm{N}_{2}\right)$ different from that found at the neuromuscular junction $\left(\mathrm{N}_{1}\right)$. Both are ligand-gated ion

channels activated by ACh or nicotine. However, whereas the $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ receptors at the neuromuscular junction (see p. 212) are stimulated by decamethonium and preferentially blocked by $d$-tubocurarine, (C) N0-2 the autonomic $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ receptors are stimulated by tetramethylammonium but resistant to $d$-tubocurarine. When activated, $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ receptors are both permeable to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Thus, nicotinic transmission triggered by stimulation of preganglionic neurons leads to rapid depolarization of postganglionic neurons.

## All postganglionic parasympathetic neurons release ACh and stimulate muscarinic receptors on visceral targets

All postganglionic parasympathetic neurons act through muscarinic ACh receptors on the postsynaptic target (see Fig. 14-8). Activation of this receptor can either stimulate or inhibit function of the target cell. Cellular responses induced by muscarinic receptor stimulation are more varied than are those induced by nicotinic receptors. Muscarinic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; see pp. 51-66)also known as metabotropic receptors-that (1) stimulate the hydrolysis of phosphoinositide and thus increase $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, and activate protein kinase C, (2) inhibit adenylyl cyclase and thus decrease cAMP levels, or (3) directly modulate $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels through the G-protein $\beta \gamma$ complex (see pp. 197-198 and 542). Because they are mediated by second messengers, muscarinic responses, unlike the rapid responses evoked by nicotine receptors, are slow and prolonged.

Muscarinic receptors exist in five different pharmacological subtypes ( $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ to $\mathrm{M}_{5}$ ) that are encoded by five different genes. All five subtypes are highly homologous to each other but very different from the nicotinic receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels. Subtypes $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ through $\mathrm{M}_{5}$ are each stimulated by ACh and muscarine and are blocked by atropine. These muscarinic subtypes have a heterogeneous distribution among tissues, and in many cases a given cell may express more than one subtype. (C) N14-3 Although a wide variety of antagonists inhibit the muscarinic receptors, none is completely selective for a specific subtype. However, it is possible to classify a receptor on the basis of its affinity profile for a battery of antagonists. Selective agonists for the different isoforms have not been available.

A molecular characteristic of the muscarinic receptors is that the third cytoplasmic loop (i.e., between the fifth and sixth membrane-spanning segments) is different in $\mathrm{M}_{1}, \mathrm{M}_{3}$, and $\mathrm{M}_{5}$ on the one hand and $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{M}_{4}$ on the other. This loop appears to play a role in coupling of the receptor to the

Muscarinic receptors are found both presynaptically and postsynaptically throughout the ANS. Many smooth muscles coexpress multiple muscarinic subtypes, each of which may play a different role in neurotransmission. Thus, it is sometimes difficult to predict the effects of applying ACh to a particular tissue.

![bo90099069a0](bo90099069a0.jpg)

Figure 14-8 Major neurotransmitters of the ANS. In the case of the somatic neuron, the pathway between the CNS and effector cell is monosynaptic. The neuron releases ACh, which binds to $\mathrm{N}_{1}$-type nicotinic receptors on the postsynaptic membrane (i.e., skeletal muscle cell). In the case of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions, the preganglionic neuron releases ACh, which acts at $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-type nicotinic receptors on the postsynaptic membrane of the postganglionic neuron. In the case of the postganglionic parasympathetic neuron, the neurotransmitter is ACh, but the postsynaptic receptor is a muscarinic receptor (i.e., GPCR) of one of five subtypes ( $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ to $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ ). In the case of most postganglionic sympathetic neurons, the neurotransmitter is norepinephrine. The postsynaptic receptor is an adrenergic receptor (i.e., GPCR) of one of two major subtypes ( $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ).

G protein downstream in the signal-transduction cascade. In general $\mathrm{M}_{1}, \mathrm{M}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ preferentially couple to $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{q}}$ and then to phospholipase C , with release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ and diacylglycerol (see p. 58). On the other hand $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{M}_{4}$ preferentially couple to $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{r}}$ or $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{o}}$ to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and thus decrease [cAMP], (see p. 53).

## Most postganglionic sympathetic neurons release norepinephrine onto visceral targets

Most postganglionic sympathetic neurons release norepinephrine (see Fig. 14-8), which acts on target cells through adrenergic receptors. The sympathetic innervation of sweat glands is an exception to this rule. N14-4 Sweat glands are innervated by sympathetic neurons that release ACh and
act via muscarinic receptors (see p. 571). The adrenergic receptors are all GPCRs and are highly homologous to the muscarinic receptors (see p. 341). Two major types of adrenergic receptors are recognized, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, each of which exists in multiple subtypes (e.g., $\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \beta_{1}, \beta_{2}$, and $\beta_{3}$ ). In addition, there are heterogeneous $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ receptors, with three cloned subtypes of each. Table 14-2 lists the signaling pathways that are generally linked to these receptors. For example, $\beta_{1}$ receptors in the heart activate the G, heterotrimeric G protein and stimulate adenylyl cyclase, which antagonizes the effects of muscarinic receptors.

Adrenergic receptor subtypes have a tissue-specific distribution. $\alpha_{1}$ receptors predominate on blood vessels, $\alpha_{2}$ on presynaptic terminals, $\beta_{1}$ in the heart, $\beta_{2}$ in high concentration in the bronchial muscle of the lungs, and $\beta_{3}$ in fat cells.

# N14-4 Cholinergic Sympathetic Neurons 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

From a macroscopic anatomical point of view, there is no doubt that the cholinergic sympathetic nerve endings of sudomotor nerves (i.e., the nerves that cause sweat secretion) and some vasomotor nerves are distal to the sympathetic ganglia. In this sense, these fibers are clearly "postganglionic." Indeed, these rare cholinergic sympathetic fibers run together from the sympathetic ganglion to the target organ together with the majority of adrenergic fibers.

From a physiological point of view, all of the sympathetic neurons that reach the adrenal medulla (see p. 343) are "preganglionic." That is, these fibers derive from neuron cell bodies that lie in the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord. Their axons then transit through the paravertebral ganglia of the sympathetic trunk (see the left side of Fig. 14-4) without synapsing, and then follow along the splanchnic nerves. Most of these axons then go directly to the adrenal medulla, where they synapse on their targets, the chromaffin cells. However, some axons transit through the celiac ganglion-again without synapsing-before reaching their target chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Thus, all sympathetic fibers that synapse on chromaffin cells are physiologically "preganglionic": a single neuron carries information from the spinal cord to the target cell. However, the sympathetic neurons that traverse the celiac ganglion before reaching the adrenal medulla could-from a macroscopic anatomical point of view-be regarded as postganglionic.

Authors in the 1960s and 1970s suggested that cholinergic sympathetic fibers that innervate the sweat glands (see pp. 342 and 571) and some of the vascular smooth muscle in skeletal muscle (see p. 539) derive from neuronal cell bodies in the spinal cord. This situation would be analogous to that of the cholinergic sympathetic innervation of the adrenal medulla. If this were true, then one could regard these cholinergic sympathetic sudomotor/ vasomotor fibers-physiologically-as being "preganglionic." However, more recent experiments suggest that these cholinergic sympathetic fibers can arise from neuron cell bodies located in sympathetic ganglia and that these neurons develop from neural crest cells (see p. 261). Using antibodies directed against
choline acetyltransferase (i.e., the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl coenzyme A and choline into ACh; see Fig. 13-8B and p. 210) and the vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT, which transports ACh from the cytoplasm of the nerve terminal into the synaptic vesicles; see Fig. 8-15), Schäfer and colleagues demonstrated that VAChT-positive "principal ganglionic cells" (i.e., postganglionic neurons) are present in paravertebral sympathetic ganglia at all levels of the thoracolumbar paravertebral chain. These observations are consistent with the idea that sudomotor nerve fibers and some vasomotor nerve fibers (e.g., skeletal microvasculature) are cholinergic postganglionic sympathetic neurons. These authors also demonstrated VAChTpositive principal ganglionic cells in two other sympathetic ganglia: the stellate and superior cervical ganglia.

Schäfer and colleagues also studied the developmental biology of postganglionic sympathetic neurons. They found that a small minority of sympathetic neurons have a cholinergic phenotype even during early embryonic development-before the neurons innervate sweat glands.

Thus, a true postganglionic sympathetic neuron-postganglionic in both the gross anatomical and the physiological sense of the word-can be cholinergic. In other words, a preganglionic sympathetic "first" neuron, with its cell body in the intermediolateral column, may synapse in a sympathetic ganglion with a postganglionic sympathetic "second" neuron that releases ACh at its nerve terminals. Thus, it is no longer necessary to assume that cholinergic sympathetic sudomotor/vasomotor neurons are, in fact, preganglionic fibers that traversed the sympathetic ganglion without synapsing.

This distribution has permitted the development of many clinically useful agents that are selective for different subtypes and tissues. For example, $\alpha_{1}$ agonists are effective as nasal decongestants, and $\alpha_{2}$ antagonists have been used to treat impotence. $\beta_{1}$ agonists increase cardiac output in congestive heart failure, whereas $\beta_{1}$ antagonists are useful antihypertensive agents. $\beta_{2}$ agonists are used as bronchodilators in patients with asthma and chronic lung disease.

The adrenal medulla (see pp. 1030-1034) is a special adaptation of the sympathetic division, homologous to a postganglionic sympathetic neuron (see Fig. 14-8). It is innervated by preganglionic sympathetic neurons, and the postsynaptic target cells, which are called chromaffin cells, have nicotinic ACh receptors. However, rather than possessing axons that release norepinephrine onto a specific target organ, the chromaffin cells reside near blood vessels and release epinephrine into the bloodstream. This neuroendocrine component of sympathetic output enhances the ability of the sympathetic division to broadcast its output throughout the body. Norepinephrine and epinephrine both activate all five subtypes of adrenergic receptor, but with different affinities (see Table 14-2). In general, the $\alpha$ receptors have a greater affinity for norepinephrine, whereas the $\beta$ receptors have a greater affinity for epinephrine.

## Postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons often have muscarinic as well as nicotinic receptors

The simplified scheme described in the preceding discussion is very useful for understanding the function of the ANS. However, two additional layers of complexity are superimposed on this scheme. First, some postganglionic neurons, both sympathetic and parasympathetic, have muscarinic in addition to nicotinic receptors. Second, at all levels of the

ANS, certain neurotransmitters and postsynaptic receptors are neither cholinergic nor adrenergic. We discuss the first exception in this section and the second in the following section.

If we stimulate the release of ACh from preganglionic neurons or apply ACh to an autonomic ganglion, many postganglionic neurons exhibit both nicotinic and muscarinic responses. Because nicotinic receptors $\left(\mathrm{N}_{2}\right)$ are ligand-gated ion channels, nicotinic neurotransmission causes a fast, monophasic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). In contrast, because muscarinic receptors are GPCRs, neurotransmission by this route leads to a slower electrical response that can be either inhibitory or excitatory. Thus, depending on the ganglion, the result is a multiphasic postsynaptic response that can be a combination of a fast EPSP through a nicotinic receptor plus either a slow EPSP or a slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) through a muscarinic receptor. Figure 14-9A shows a fast EPSP followed by a slow EPSP.

A well-characterized effect of muscarinic neurotransmission in autonomic ganglia is inhibition of a specific $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current called the $\mathbf{M}$ current. The M current is widely distributed in visceral end organs, autonomic ganglia, and the CNS. In the baseline state, the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel that underlies the M current is active and thereby produces slight hyperpolarization. In the example shown in Figure 14-9B, with the stabilizing M current present, electrical stimulation of the neuron causes only a single spike. If we now add muscarine to the neuron, activation of the muscarinic receptor turns off the hyperpolarizing M current and thus leads to a small depolarization. If we repeat the electrical stimulation in the continued presence of muscarine (see Fig. 14-9C), repetitive spikes appear because loss of the stabilizing influence of the M current increases the excitability of the neuron. The slow, modulatory effects of muscarinic responses greatly

A, Stimulation of a frog preganglionic sympathetic neuron releases ACh, which triggers a fast EPSP (due to activation of nicotinic receptors on the postganglionic sympathetic neuron), followed by a slow EPSP (due to activation of muscarinic receptors on the postganglionic neuron). B, In a rat sympathetic postganglionic neuron, the M current (mediated by a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel) is normally active, hyperpolarizing the neuron. Thus, injecting current elicits only a single action potential.

enhance the ability of the ANS to control visceral activity beyond what could be accomplished with only fast nicotinic EPSPs.

## Nonclassic transmitters can be released at each level of the ANS

In the 1930s, Sir Henry Dale (5)N14-5 first proposed that sympathetic nerves release a transmitter similar to epinephrine (now known to be norepinephrine) and parasympathetic nerves release ACh. For many years, attention was focused on these two neurotransmitters, primarily because they mediate large and fast postsynaptic responses that can be easily studied. In addition, a variety of antagonists are available to block cholinergic and adrenergic receptors and thereby permit clear characterization of the roles of these receptors in the control of visceral function. More recently, it has become evident that some neurotransmission in the ANS involves neither adrenergic nor cholinergic pathways. Moreover, many neuronal synapses use more than a single neurotransmitter. Such cotransmission is now known to be common in the ANS. As many as eight different neurotransmitters may be found within some neurons, a phenomenon known as colocalization (see Table 13-1). Thus, ACh and norepinephrine play important but not exclusive roles in autonomic control.

The distribution and function of nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) transmitters are only partially

understood. However, these transmitters are found at every level of autonomic control (Table 14-3), where they can cause a wide range of postsynaptic responses. These nonclassic transmitters may cause slow synaptic potentials or may modulate the response to other inputs (as in the case of the M current) without having obvious direct effects. In other cases, nonclassic transmitters have no known effects and may be acting in ways that have not yet been determined.

Although colocalization of neurotransmitters is recognized as a common property of neurons, it is not clear what controls the release of each of the many neurotransmitters. In some cases, the proportion of neurotransmitters released depends on the level of neuronal activity (see pp. 327-328). For example, medullary raphé neurons project to the intermediolateral cell column in the spinal cord, where they co-release serotonin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and substance P onto sympathetic preganglionic neurons. The proportions of released neurotransmitters are controlled by neuronal firing frequency: at low firing rates,
serotonin is released alone; at intermediate firing rates, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is also released; and at high firing rates, all three neurotransmitters are released. This frequency-dependent modulation of synaptic transmission provides a mechanism for enhancing the versatility of the ANS.

## Two of the most unusual nonclassic neurotransmitters, ATP and nitric oxide, were first identified in the ANS

It was not until the 1970s that a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic class of sympathetic or parasympathetic neurons was first proposed by Geoffrey Burnstock and colleagues, who suggested that ATP might act as the neurotransmitter. This idea, that a molecule used as an intracellular energy substrate could also be a synaptic transmitter, was initially difficult to prove. However, it is now clear that neurons use a variety of classes of molecules for intercellular communication (see pp. 314-322). Two of the most surprising examples of

nonclassic transmitters, nitric oxide (NO) and ATP, were first identified and studied as neurotransmitters in the ANS, but they are now known to be more widely used throughout the nervous system.

ATP ATP is colocalized with norepinephrine in postganglionic sympathetic vasoconstrictor neurons. It is contained in synaptic vesicles, is released on electrical stimulation, and induces vascular constriction when it is applied directly to vascular smooth muscle. The effect of ATP results from activation of $\mathrm{P}_{2}$ purinoceptors on smooth muscle, which include ligand-gated ion channels (P2X) and GPCRs (P2Y and P2U). P2X receptors are present on autonomic neurons and smooth-muscle cells of blood vessels, the urinary bladder, and other visceral targets. P2X receptor channels have a relatively high $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeability (see p. 327). In smooth muscle, ATP-induced depolarization can also activate voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (see pp. 189-190) and thus lead to an elevation in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and a rapid phase of contraction (Fig. 14-10).

Norepinephrine, by binding to $\alpha_{1}$ adrenergic receptors, acts through a heterotrimeric G protein (see pp. 51-66) to facilitate the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores and thereby produce a slower phase of contraction. Finally, the release of neuropeptide Y may, after prolonged and intense stimulation, elicit a third component of contraction.

Nitric Oxide In the 1970s, it was also discovered that the vascular endothelium produces a substance that induces relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. First called endothelium-derived relaxation factor, it was identified as the free radical NO in 1987. NO is an unusual molecule for intercellular communication because it is a short-lived gas. It is produced locally from L-arginine by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS; see pp. 66-67). The NO then diffuses a short distance to a neighboring cell, where its effects are primarily mediated by the activation of guanylyl cyclase.

NOS is found in the preganglionic and postganglionic neurons of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic

In this example, stimulation of a postganglionic sympathetic neuron causes three phases of contraction of a vascular smoothmuscle cell. Each phase corresponds to the response of the postsynaptic cell to a different neurotransmitter or group of transmitters. In phase 1, ATP binds to a P2X purinoceptor (a ligand-gated cation channel) on the smooth-muscle cell, which leads to depolarization, activation of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and the rapid phase of contraction. In phase 2, norepinephrine, acting through an $\alpha_{1}$ adrenergic receptor and a $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}} \mathrm{PLC} / \mathrm{P}_{3}$ cascade, leads to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from internal stores and the second phase of contraction. In phase 3, when neuropeptide Y is present, it acts through a Y1 receptor to somehow cause an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and thus produces the slowest phase of contraction.

Figure 14-11 Action of NO in the ANS. Stimulation of a postganglionic parasympathetic neuron can cause more than one phase of relaxation of a vascular smooth-muscle cell, corresponding to the release of a different neurotransmitter or group of transmitters. The first phase in this example is mediated by both NO and ACh. The neuron releases NO, which diffuses to the smooth-muscle cell. In addition, ACh binds to $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ muscarinic receptors (i.e., GPCRs) on endothelial cells; this leads to production of NO, which also diffuses to the smooth-muscle cell. Both sources of NO activate guanylyl cyclase (GC) and raise [cGMP] in the smooth muscle cell and contribute to the first phase of relaxation. In the second phase, which tends to occur more with prolonged or intense stimulation, the neuropeptide VIP (or a related peptide) binds to receptors on the smooth-muscle cell and causes delayed relaxation through an increase in [cAMP] or a decrease in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$.
divisions as well as in vascular endothelial cells. It is not specific for any type of neuron inasmuch as it is found in both norepinephrine- and ACh-containing cells as well as neurons containing a variety of neuropeptides. Figure 14-11 shows how a parasympathetic neuron may simultaneously release $\mathrm{NO}, \mathrm{ACh}$, and vasoactive intestinal peptide, each acting in concert to lower $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and relax vascular smooth muscle.

## CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM CONTROL OF THE VISCERA

## Sympathetic output can be massive and nonspecific, as in the fight-or-flight response, or selective for specific target organs

In 1915, Walter Cannon (5) N14-6 proposed that the entire sympathetic division is activated together and has a uniform effect on all target organs. In response to fear, exercise, and other types of stress, the sympathetic division produces a
massive and coordinated output to all end organs simultaneously, and parasympathetic output ceases. This type of sympathetic output is used to ready the body for life-threatening situations-the so-called fight-or-flight response. Thus, when a person is presented with a fearful or menacing stimulus, the sympathetic division coordinates all body functions to respond appropriately to the stressful situation. This response includes increases in heart rate, cardiac contractility, blood pressure, and ventilation of the lungs; bronchial dilatation; sweating; piloerection; liberation of glucose into the blood; inhibition of insulin secretion; reduction in blood clotting time; mobilization of blood cells by contraction of the spleen; and decreased GI activity. This mass response is a primitive mechanism for survival. In some people, such a response can be triggered spontaneously or with minimal provocation; each individual episode is then called a panic attack.

The fight-or-flight response is an important mechanism for survival, but under normal nonstressful conditions,

output of the sympathetic division can also be more discrete and organ specific. In contrast to Cannon's original proposal, the sympathetic division does not actually produce uniform effects on all visceral targets. Different postganglionic sympathetic neurons have different electrophysiological properties and release other neurotransmitters in addition to norepinephrine. This specific distribution of neuroactive chemicals among neurons is called chemical coding. For example, depolarization of guinea pig postganglionic sympathetic neurons in the lumbar sympathetic chain ganglia causes a brief burst of action potentials in $95 \%$ of the neurons and release of norepinephrine together with ATP and neuropeptide Y. These neurons are thought to innervate arteries and to induce vasoconstriction (see Fig. 14-10). In contrast, depolarization of postganglionic sympathetic neurons in the inferior mesenteric ganglion causes sustained firing in $80 \%$ of the neurons and release of norepinephrine together with somatostatin. These neurons appear to control gut motility and secretion. Thus, sympathetic neurons have cellular properties that are substantially variable. This variability permits the sympathetic division to produce different effects on targets with different functions.

## Parasympathetic neurons participate in many simple involuntary reflexes

As opposed to neurons in the sympathetic division, neurons in the parasympathetic division function only in a discrete, organ-specific, and reflexive manner. Together with specific visceral afferents and a small number of interneurons, parasympathetic neurons mediate simple reflexes involving target organs. For example, the output of the baroreceptor reflex (see pp. 537-539) is mediated by preganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Other examples include urination in response to bladder distention (see pp. 736-737); salivation in response to the sight or smell of food (see p. 895); vagovagal reflexes (see p. 857) in the GI tract, such as contraction of the colon in response to food in the stomach; and bronchoconstriction in response to activation of receptors in the lungs (see pp. 717718). The pupillary light reflex is an example of an involuntary parasympathetic reflex that can be tested at the bedside (see p. 362).

## A variety of brainstem nuclei provide basic control of the ANS

In addition to nuclei that contain parasympathetic preganglionic neurons (see Fig. 14-5), a variety of other brainstem structures are also involved in visceral control. These structures include the nucleus tractus solitarii, area postrema, ventrolateral medulla, medullary raphé, reticular formation, locus coeruleus, and parabrachial nucleus. These nuclei within the lower part of the brainstem mediate autonomic reflexes, control specific autonomic functions, or modulate the general level of autonomic tone. In some cases, these nuclei play a well-defined role in one specific autonomic function. For example, stimulation of a group of neurons in the rostral portion of the ventrolateral medulla increases sympathetic output to the cardiovascular system-without affecting respiration or sympathetic output to other targets.

In other cases, these nuclei are linked to more than one autonomic function. For example, the medullary raphé contains serotonergic neurons that project to cardiovascular, respiratory, and GI neurons, the reticular activating system, and pain pathways. Therefore, these neurons can affect the background level of autonomic tone. The specific functions of some nuclei are not known, and their involvement in autonomic control is inferred from their anatomical connections, a correlation between neuron activity and activity in autonomic nerves, or the effect of lesions.

One of the most important lower brainstem structures is the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in the medulla. The NTS contains second-order sensory neurons that receive all input from peripheral chemoreceptors (see pp. 710-713) and baroreceptors input (see p. 537), as well as non-nociceptive afferent input from every organ of the thorax and abdomen. Visceral afferents from the vagus nerve make their first synapse within the NTS, where they combine with other visceral (largely unconscious) afferent impulses derived from the glossopharyngeal (CN IX), facial (CN VII), and trigeminal (CN V) nerves. These visceral afferents form a large bundle of nerve fibers-the tractus solitarius-that the NTS surrounds. Afferent input is distributed to the NTS in a viscerotopic manner, with major subnuclei devoted to respiratory, cardiovascular, gustatory, and GI input. The NTS also receives input and sends output to many other CNS regions (Table 14-4), including the brainstem nuclei described above as well as the hypothalamus and the forebrain. These widespread interconnections allow the NTS to influence and to be influenced by a wide variety of CNS functions. Thus, the NTS is the major lower brainstem command center for visceral control. It integrates multiple inputs from visceral afferents and exerts control over autonomic output, thereby participating in autonomic reflexes that maintain the homeostasis of many basic visceral functions.

## The forebrain can modulate autonomic output, and reciprocally, visceral sensory input integrated in the brainstem can influence or even overwhelm the forebrain

Only a subset of the nervous system is necessary to maintain autonomic body homeostasis under most conditions. The necessary structures include (1) the brainstem nuclei discussed in the preceding section, (2) the brainstem nuclei that contain the parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, (3) the spinal cord, and (4) the peripheral ANS. These components are capable of acting autonomously, even without input from higher (i.e., rostral) forebrain regions. However, forebrain regions do play a role in coordinating and modulating activity in the lower centers. Many rostral CNS centers influence autonomic output; these centers include the hypothalamus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, insula, and other forebrain nuclei.

The hypothalamus, especially the paraventricular nucleus, is the most important brain region for coordination of autonomic output. The hypothalamus projects to the parabrachial nucleus, medullary raphé, NTS, central gray matter, locus coeruleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, nucleus ambiguus, and intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord. Thus, the hypothalamus can initiate and coordinate

an integrated response to the body's needs, including modulation of autonomic output as well as control of neuroendocrine function by the pituitary gland (see p. 978). The hypothalamus coordinates autonomic function with feeding, thermoregulation, circadian rhythms, water balance, emotions, sexual drive, reproduction, motivation, and other brain functions and thus plays a dominant role in the integration of higher cortical and limbic systems with autonomic control. The hypothalamus can also initiate the fight-orflight response. (○) N14-7

The hypothalamus often mediates interactions between the forebrain and the brainstem. However, a number of forebrain regions also have direct connections to brainstem nuclei involved in autonomic control. Most of these forebrain regions are part of the limbic system rather than the neocortex. The paucity of direct neocortical connections probably explains why individuals trained to control autonomic output by biofeedback can generally produce only relatively minor effects on overall autonomic activity rather than regulate output to specific organs. Most individuals are incapable of even limited cortical control over the ANS. However, even though we may have only minimal conscious control of autonomic output, cortical processes can strongly

modulate the ANS. Emotions, mood, anxiety, stress, and fear can all alter autonomic output (Table 14-5, top section). The pathways for these effects are unknown, but they could be mediated by direct connections or through the hypothalamus.

Not only does forebrain function influence the ANS, visceral activity also influences forebrain function. Visceral afferents reach the neocortex. However, because these afferents are not represented viscerotopically, they cannot be well localized. Nevertheless, visceral afferents can have profound effects on cortical function. Visceral input can modulate the excitability of cortical neurons (Box 14-2) and, in some cases, can result in such overpowering sensory stimuli that it is not possible to focus cortical activity on anything else (see Table 14-5, bottom section).

## CNS control centers oversee visceral feedback loops and orchestrate a feed-forward response to meet anticipated needs

The ANS maintains physiological parameters within an optimal range by means of feedback loops made up of sensors, afferent fibers, central autonomic control centers (discussed in the preceding section), and effector systems. These feedback loops achieve homeostasis by monitoring input from visceral receptors and adjusting the output of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions to

## BOX 14-2 Vagus Nerve Stimulation in the Treatment of Epilepsy

It is often not appreciated just how much effect the ANS can have on cortical function. Table 14-5 (bottom section) lists several examples in which strong input from visceral afferents can overwhelm cortical function to the point that concentrating on anything else is nearly impossible. As we have already noted, not only does the vagus nerve contain parasympathetic preganglionic motor fibers, it also contains a wide variety of sensory fibers from viscera in the thorax and abdomen. Discovery of the influence of vagal afferent input on seizures has led to development of the vagus nerve stimulator, which is used clinically. The surgically implanted device electrically stimulates the vagus nerve for 30 seconds every 5 minutes, 24 hours per day. In addition, when patients feel a seizure coming on (an aura), they can activate the device with a hand-held magnet to deliver extra pulses. Clinical studies have shown that this treatment reduces the number of seizures by about half in about one in four patients. It remains to be determined whether a subgroup of patients may be particularly responsive to this treatment. Side effects include hoarseness, coughing, and breathlessness. That this approach works at all indicates how important visceral input is to cortical function. Vagal input can influence many rostral brain structures, but it is not yet clear whether stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptor afferents, pulmonary afferents, or other visceral afferent pathways is important for the anticonvulsant effect. If the specific pathways could be identified, it might be possible to selectively stimulate these pathways or to activate them pharmacologically to produce an anticonvulsant effect with fewer side effects.
specific organs so that they maintain activity at a set-point determined by involuntary CNS control centers. As we have already noted, the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions usually act in opposite ways to make these adjustments. Blood pressure control is an example of a visceral feedback loop in which the CNS monitors current blood pressure through afferents from baroreceptors, compares it with an internally determined set-point, and appropriately adjusts output to the heart, blood vessels, adrenal gland, and other targets. An increase in blood pressure (see pp. 537-539) causes a reflex decrease in sympathetic output to the heart and an increase in parasympathetic output.

Instead of merely responding through feedback loops, the ANS also anticipates the future needs of the individual. For example, when a person begins to exercise, sympathetic output increases before the increase in metabolic need to prevent an exercise debt from occurring (see p. 1214). Because of this anticipatory response, alveolar ventilation rises to such an extent that blood levels of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (a byproduct of exercise) actually drop at the onset of exercise. This response is the opposite of what would be expected if the ANS worked purely through feedback loops, in which case an obligatory increase in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ levels would have preceded the increase in respiratory output (see pp. 716-717). Similarly, a trained athlete's heart rate begins to increase several seconds before the starting gun fires to signal the beginning of a $100-\mathrm{m}$ dash. This anticipation of future activity, or feedforward stimulation prior to (and during) exercise, is a key
component of the regulation of homeostasis during stress because it prevents large changes in physiological parameters that could be detrimental to optimal function. This type of response probably resulted in an evolutionary advantage that permitted the body to respond rapidly and more efficiently to a threat of danger. A system relying solely on feedback could produce a response that is delayed or out of phase with respect to the stimulus. The central neuronal pathways responsible for this anticipatory or feed-forward response are not known.

## The ANS has multiple levels of reflex loops

The human nervous system is built in a hierarchy that mirrors phylogenetic evolution (see pp. 269-274). Each of the successively more primitive components is capable of independent, organized, and adaptive behavior. In turn, the activity of each of the more primitive levels is modulated by rostral, more phylogenetically advanced components. (T) N14-II

The enteric nervous system of humans is homologous to the most primitive nervous system, the neural net of jellyfish. In both cases, the component neurons control motility and nutrient absorption and respond appropriately to external stimuli.

The autonomic ganglia are homologous to ganglionic nervous systems, such as those of annelid worms. Autonomic ganglia were previously considered a simple relay station for signals from the CNS to the periphery, but it is now clear that they integrate afferent input from the viscera and have substantial independent control mechanisms. The largest of the sympathetic ganglia, the superior cervical ganglion, contains about 1 million neurons. In addition to postganglionic cell bodies, autonomic ganglia also contain interneurons. Axons from interneurons, sensory receptors located in the end organs, and preganglionic neurons converge with postganglionic neuron dendrites to form a dense network of nerve fibers, or a neuropil, within the ganglion. This neuropil confers considerable computational capability on the ganglia. Whereas feedback from skeletal muscle occurs only in the CNS, the peripheral synapses of visceral afferents result in substantial integration of autonomic activity at peripheral sites. This integration is enhanced by the variety of neurotransmitters released, for example, by interneurons in autonomic ganglia (see Table 14-3). Thus, although fast neurotransmission from preganglionic neurons to postganglionic neurons is an important role of the autonomic ganglia, the ganglia are not simply relays.

The spinal cord, which coordinates activity among different root levels, first appeared with the evolution of chordates. The CNS of amphioxus, a primitive chordate, is essentially just a spinal cord. In humans who experience transection of the low cervical spinal cord-and in whom the outflow of the respiratory system is spared (see Chapter 32)-the caudal spinal cord and lower autonomic ganglia can still continue to maintain homeostasis. However, these individuals are incapable of more complex responses that require reflexes mediated by the cranial nerve afferents and cranial parasympathetic outflow. In many patients, this situation can lead to maladaptive reflexes such as autonomic hyper-reflexia, in which a full bladder results in hypertension and sweating (Boxes 14-3 and 14-4).

eFigure 14-1 At the lowest level, the ENS is an independent system consisting of afferent neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. One level up, the autonomic ganglia control the autonomic end organs, including the ENS. One further level up, the spinal cord controls certain autonomic ganglia and integrates response among different spinal cord levels. The brainstem receives inputs from visceral afferents and coordinates the control of all viscera. Finally, forebrain CNS centers receive input from the brainstem and coordinate the activity of the ANS via input to the brainstem.

# BOX 14-3 Crosstalk between Autonomic Functions Can be Pathological 

Visceral control of each of the body's organs occurs relatively independently of control of the others. However, some overlap in control systems can be noted for different components of the ANS. For example, stimulation of the baroreceptors causes inhibition of respiration. Conversely, the decrease in thoracic pressure that occurs during inspiration normally triggers a reflex decrease in heart rate. Many neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord have a firing pattern that is modulated in time with both the heartbeat and respiratory activity. This spillover may be responsible for the frequent observation of sinus arrhythmia on electrocardiograms of normal patients, in whom the heart rate is irregular because of an exaggeration of the normal influence of respiration on heart rate. These phenomena have no clear evolutionary advantage. Instead, they may simply be due to an error in separating closely related physiological control mechanisms.

In some cases, overlap between physiological control mechanisms can have serious consequences. For example, control of micturition overlaps with cardiorespiratory control. An increase in bladder pressure can lead to apnea and hypertension. Conversely, each breath is accompanied by an increase in neural outflow to the bladder. In patients with obstruction of urinary outflow, as can be seen in men with enlarged prostates, the bladder can become severely distended. If this obstruction is relieved suddenly by insertion of a catheter and the bladder is drained too rapidly, blood pressure can drop precipitously. In extreme cases, the hypotension causes syncope (fainting) or a stroke. A similar phenomenon can occur in some people with less provocation. During emptying of a relatively full bladder, blood pressure can drop precipitously and lead to postmicturition syncope, with the patient suddenly falling unconscious on the bathroom floor.

## BOX 14-4 Horner Syndrome

0ne of the keys to neurological diagnosis has always been neuroanatomical localization (Fig. 14-12). A classic condition in which it is important to define neuroanatomy is Horner syndrome: the combination of unilateral ptosis (drooping eyelid), miosis (small pupil), and anhidrosis (lack of sweating). Sympathetic neurons innervate the smooth muscle that elevates the eyelid (superior tarsal muscle), the pupillary dilator muscle, and the sweat glands of the face. Horner syndrome results from loss of the normal sympathetic innervation on one side of the face. The differential diagnosis for this syndrome is large, but it can be narrowed if the site of involvement of the sympathetic pathways can be identified. Involvement of first-order sympathetic neurons can occur at their cell bodies in the hypothalamus or along their axons traveling down to the ipsilateral intermediolateral column of the spinal cord. Thus, a first-order Horner syndrome can be due to ischemia of the lateral medulla (e.g., occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, so-called Wallenberg syndrome). In this case, other brainstem abnormalities will also be present. The second-order sympathetic neurons, or preganglionic neurons, can be affected at their origin in the intermediolateral column or along their axons. Those that supply the eye synapse in the superior cervical ganglion. A second-order Horner syndrome can be the first sign that a Pancoast tumor exists in the apex of the lung and is encroaching on the sympathetic nerves as they travel to the superior cervical ganglion. Finally, third-order sympathetic
neurons, or postganglionic neurons, can be involved at the ganglion or along their course to the eye. Because they travel within the wall of the carotid artery, these sympathetic nerves can be damaged during a carotid artery "dissection." Dissection is separation of the layers of the wall of the artery, often caused by a neck injury. In time, the damage to the vessel can lead to a blood clot that will obstruct blood flow. Thus, a Horner syndrome can be a warning that, without treatment, a stroke may be imminent. The key to proper diagnosis is to determine what nearby structures may be involved (the company that it keeps). Two pharmacological tests can also be administered. A dilute $2 \%$ to $10 \%$ cocaine solution blocks norepinephrine re-uptake into synaptic terminals so that the buildup of norepinephrine near the pupillary dilator muscle will dilate the pupil in a healthy person. Cocaine treatment will have less effect on the pupil of a patient with Horner syndrome regardless of where the lesion is because less norepinephrine is in the synaptic cleft. To determine if the Horner syndrome is postganglionic, a solution containing hydroxyamphetamine (Paredrine) can then be given. This drug will cause release of norepinephrine from synaptic terminals if they are present, so it will not cause pupillary dilation in a patient with a third-order Horner syndrome. A combination of a careful neurological examination with these tests will usually allow one to determine where in the sympathetic pathways damage has occurred, thus narrowing the differential diagnosis.

Figure 14-12 Anatomy of the sympathetic innervation to the eyelid, pupil, and facial sweat glands relevant in Horner syndrome. The diagram shows the three segments of this pathway: (1) A neuron with its cell body in the hypothalamus sends its axon down the intermediolateral column in the spinal cord (first-order neuron). (2) A preganglionic sympathetic neuron with its cell body in the intermediolateral column gets synaptic input from (1) and sends an axon to the superior cervical ganglion (second-order neuron). (3) A postganglionic sympathetic neuron with its cell body in the superior cervical ganglion sends axons to the superior tarsal (smooth) muscle that elevates the eyelid (along with the levator palpebrae skeletal muscle innervated by somatic motor neurons of CN III), pupillary dilator (smooth) muscles, and sweat glands of the face (third-order neuron). A lesion at any point in this pathway causes Horner syndrome.

All vertebrates have a brain that is segmented into three parts (see p. 261): the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon. With evolution, the more rostral parts took on a more dominant role. The brain of the ammocoete larva of the lamprey is dominated by the medulla, which is also the most vital part of the human brain; in contrast to destruction of more rostral structures, destruction of the medulla leads to instant death in the absence of life support. The medulla coordinates all visceral control and optimizes it for survival. In humans, normal body homeostasis can continue indefinitely with only a medulla, spinal cord, and peripheral ANS.

In fish, the midbrain became the dominant CNS structure in response to the increasing importance of vision. The brain of primitive reptiles is only a brainstem and paleocortex, without a neocortex; the corpus striatum is the dominant structure. Thus, the brainstem is sometimes referred to as the reptilian brain. Finally, the neocortex appeared in mammals and became dominant. The phylogenetically advanced portions of the CNS rostral to the medullaincluding the hypothalamus, limbic system, and cortexcoordinate activity of the ANS with complex behaviors, motivations, and desires, but they are not required for normal homeostasis.

As a result of this hierarchy, impulses from most visceral afferents never reach the cortex, and we are not usually conscious of them. Instead, they make synapses within the enteric plexuses, autonomic ganglia, spinal cord, and brainstem, and they close reflex loops that regulate visceral output at each of these levels.

# SENSORY TRANSDUCTION 

Barry W. Connors

## Sensory receptors convert environmental energy into neural signals

Sensation is a cognitive process that requires the full powers of the central nervous system (CNS). Sensation begins with the sensory receptors that actually interface with the world, and these receptors use energy from the environment to trigger electrochemical signals that can be transmitted to the brain-a process called sensory transduction. An understanding of transduction processes is crucial for several reasons. Without these processes, sensation fails. Moreover, a variety of diseases that specifically affect sensory receptors can impair or abolish sensation without damaging the brain. Transduction also sets the basic limits of perception. It determines the sensitivity, range, speed, versatility, and vigor of a sensory system.

We have a variety of senses, each tuned to particular types of environmental energy. These sensory modalities include the familiar ones of seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and tasting, as well as our senses of pain, balance, body position, and movement. In addition, other intricate sensory systems of which we are not conscious monitor the internal milieu and report on the body's chemical and metabolic state. Early in the 19th century, the physiologist Johannes Müller recognized that neurons that are specialized to evaluate a particular type of stimulus energy will produce the appropriate sensation regardless of how they are activated. For example, banging your eye can produce perceptions of light even in the dark, and seizure activity in a region of the cortex devoted to olfaction can evoke repulsive smells even in a rose garden. This property has been called univariance; in other words, the sensory receptor and its subsequent neural circuits do not know what stimulated them-they give the same type of response regardless. Specificity for each modality is ensured by the structure and position of the sensory receptor.

## Sensory transduction uses adaptations of common molecular signaling mechanisms

Evolution is a conservative enterprise. Good ideas are retained, and with slight modification they are adapted to new purposes. Sensory transduction is a prime example of this principle. The sensory processes that are now understood at the molecular level use systems that are closely
related to the ubiquitous signaling molecules in eukaryotic cells. Some modalities (vision, olfaction, some types of taste, and other chemoreception) begin with integral membrane proteins that belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; see pp. 51-52). The second-messenger pathways use the same substances that are used for so many nonsensory tasks in cells, such as cyclic nucleotides, inositol phosphates, and kinases. Other sensory systems (mechanoreceptors, including the hair cells of audition and the vestibular organs, as well as some taste cells) use modified membrane ion channels in the primary transduction process. Although the structures of most of these channels have not yet been determined, their biophysical properties are generally unremarkable, and they are likely to be related to other, nonsensory ion channels. Indeed, the gating of many ion channels from "nonsensory" cells is sensitive to the physical distortion of the membrane that they lie in, which implies that mechanosensitivity is a widespread (although perhaps epiphenomenal) feature of integral membrane proteins.

To achieve a specificity for certain stimulus energies, many sensory receptors must use specialized cellular structures. These, too, are usually adapted from familiar components. Various receptors are slightly modified epithelial cells. Some situate their transduction sites on modified cilia, whereas others use muscle cells or collagen fibers to channel the appropriate forces to the sensory axon. Many are neurons alone, often just bare axons with no specialization visible by microscopy. Most sensory transduction cells (e.g., oxygen and taste sensors, but not olfactory receptors) lack their own axon to communicate with the CNS. For these cells, the communication system of choice is a relatively standard, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent system of synaptic transmission onto a primary sensory neuron.

## Sensory transduction requires detection and amplification, usually followed by a local receptor potential

Functionally, sensory transducers follow certain general steps. Obviously, they must detect stimulus energy, but they must do so with enough selectivity and speed that stimuli of different types, from different locations, or with different timing are not confused. In most cases, transduction also

involves one or more steps of signal amplification so that the sensory cell can reliably communicate the detection of small stimuli (e.g., a few stray photons or a smattering of drifting molecules) to a large brain in an environment with much sensory noise. The sensory cell must then convert the amplified signal into an electrical change by altering the gating of some ion channel. This channel gating leads to alterations of the membrane potential $\left(V_{m}\right)$ in the receptor cell-otherwise known as a receptor potential. The receptor potential is not an action potential but a graded electrotonic event that can either modulate the activity of other channels (e.g., voltagegated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels) or trigger action potentials in a different portion of the same cell. Very often, the receptor potential regulates the flux of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the cell and thus controls the release of some synaptic transmitter molecule onto the sensory afferent neuron.

Ultimately, receptor potentials determine the rate and pattern of action potential firing in a sensory neuron. This firing pattern is the signal that is actually communicated to the CNS. Useful information may be encoded in many features of the firing, including its rate, its temporal patterns, its periodicity, its consistency, and its patterns when compared with the signals of other sensory neurons of the same or even different modalities.

## CHEMORECEPTION

## Chemoreceptors are ubiquitous, diverse, and evolutionarily ancient

Every cell is bathed in chemicals. Molecules can be food or poison, or they may serve as signals of communication between cells, organs, or individuals. The ability to recognize and respond to environmental chemicals can allow cells to find nutrients, avoid harm, attract a mate, navigate, or regulate a physiological process. Chemoreception has basic and universal advantages. It is the oldest form of sensory transduction, and it exists in many forms. Chemoreception does not even require a nervous system. Single-celled organisms such as bacteria can recognize and respond to substances in their environment. In the broadest sense, every cell in the human body is chemosensitive, and chemical signaling between cells is the basis for internal communication through endocrine systems and neurotransmission. In this chapter, we restrict ourselves to chemoreception as a sensory system, the interface between the nervous system and the external and internal chemical milieu.

Chemicals reach the human body by oral or nasal ingestion, contact with the skin, or inhalation, and once there, they diffuse or are carried to the surface membranes of receptor cells through the various aqueous fluids of the body (e.g., mucus, saliva, tears, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], blood plasma). The nervous system constantly monitors these chemical comings and goings with a diverse array of chemosensory receptors. The most familiar of these receptors are the sensory organs of taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction). However, chemoreception is widespread throughout the body. Chemoreceptors in the skin, mucous membranes, respiratory tract, and gut warn against irritating substances, and chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies (see pp. 710-712) measure blood levels of $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$.

## Taste receptors are modified epithelial cells, whereas olfactory receptors are neurons

The tasks of gustatory and olfactory receptors appear similar at first glance. Both recognize the concentration and identity of dissolved molecules, and they communicate this information to the CNS. In fact, the two systems operate in parallel during eating, and the flavors of most foods are strongly dependent on both taste and smell. The anatomy of the human olfactory system is well adapted to detect odors orthonasally, from the environment, and retronasally, from volatile chemicals released as we chew food. However, the receptor cells of gustation and olfaction are quite different. Olfactory receptors are neurons. Each olfactory cell has small dendrites at one end that are specialized to identify chemical stimuli, and at the other end an axon projects directly into the brain. Taste receptor cells are not neurons but rather modified epithelial cells that synapse onto the axons of sensory neurons that communicate with the CNS.

Taste Receptor Cells Taste receptors are located mainly on the dorsal surface of the tongue (Fig. 15-1A), concentrated within small but visible projections called papillae (see Fig. 15-1B). Papillae are shaped like ridges, pimples, or mushrooms, and each is a few millimeters in diameter. Each papilla in turn has numerous taste buds (see Fig. 15-1C). One taste bud contains 50 to 150 taste receptor cells, numerous basal and supporting cells that surround the taste cells, plus a set of sensory afferent axons. Most people have 2000 to 5000 taste buds, although exceptional cases range from 500 to 20,000 .

The chemically sensitive part of a taste receptor cell is a small apical membrane region near the surface of the tongue. The apical ends have thin extensions called microvilli that project into the taste pore, a small opening on the surface of the tongue where the taste cells are exposed to the contents of the mouth. Taste cells form synapses with the primary sensory axons near the bottom of the taste bud. However, processing may be more complicated than a simple receptor-to-axon relay. Receptor cells also make both electrical and chemical synapses onto some of the basal cells, some basal cells synapse onto the sensory axons, and some type of information-processing circuit may be present within each taste bud itself.

Cells of the taste bud undergo a constant cycle of growth, death, and regeneration. Each taste cell lives about 2 weeks. The turnover of taste cells depends on the influence of the sensory nerve because if the nerve is cut, taste buds degenerate.

Olfactory Receptor Cells We smell with receptor cells in the thin main olfactory epithelium, which is placed high in the nasal cavity (Fig. 15-2A). We will not discuss several other accessory olfactory systems, including the vomeronasal organ, which primarily detect pheromones. The main olfactory epithelium has three primary cell types: olfactory receptor cells are the site of transduction; support cells are similar to glia and, among other things, help produce mucus; and stem cells, called basal cells, are the source of new receptor cells (see Fig. 15-2B). Olfactory receptors (similar to taste receptors) continually die, regenerate, and grow in a cycle

that lasts -4 to 8 weeks. Olfactory receptor cells are one of the very few types of neurons in the mammalian nervous system that are regularly replaced throughout life.

As we breathe or sniff, chemical odorants waft through the many folds of the nasal passages. However, to contact the receptor cells, odorants must first dissolve in and diffuse through a thin mucous layer, which has both a viscous and a watery portion. The normal olfactory epithelium exudes a mucous layer 20 to $50 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ thick. Mucus flows constantly and is normally replaced about every 10 minutes. Mucus is a complex, water-based substance containing dissolved glycosaminoglycans (see p. 39); a variety of proteins, including antibodies, odorant-binding proteins, and enzymes; and various salts. The antibodies are critical because olfactory cells offer a direct route for viruses (e.g., rabies) or bacteria to enter the brain. Odorant-binding proteins in the mucus probably facilitate the diffusion of odorants toward and away from the receptors. Enzymes may help clear the mucus of odorants and thus speed recovery of the receptors from transient odors.

Both the absolute size and the receptor density of the olfactory epithelium vary greatly among species, and they help determine olfactory acuity. The surface area of the human olfactory epithelium is only $\sim 10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, but this limited area is enough to detect some odorants at concentrations as low as a few parts per trillion. The olfactory epithelia of some dogs may be over $170 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and dogs have $>100$ times as many receptors in each square centimeter as humans do. The olfactory acuity of some breeds of dog is legendary and far surpasses that of humans. Dogs can often detect the scent of someone who walked by hours before.

## Complex flavors are derived from a few basic types of taste receptors, with contributions from sensory receptors of smell, temperature, texture, and pain

Studies of taste discrimination in humans imply that we can distinguish among 4000 to 10,000 different chemicals with our taste buds. However, behavioral evidence suggests that these discriminations represent only five primary taste qualities: bitter, salty, sweet, and sour plus a primary quality called umami ("delicious" in Japanese). Umami is the taste of certain L-amino acids, epitomized by L-glutamate (monosodium glutamate [MSG], the familiar culinary form). Growing evidence suggests that mammals have a taste system for free fatty acids. Unlike an olfactory receptor cell, which apparently expresses only one receptor type (see p. 358), a taste receptor cell may express several.

In many cases, there is an obvious correlation between the chemistry of tastants (i.e., chemicals being tasted) and the quality of their taste. Most acids taste sour and most salts taste salty. However, for many other tastants, the linkage between taste and chemical structure is not clear. The familiar sugars (e.g., sucrose and fructose) are satisfyingly sweet, but certain proteins (e.g., monellin) and artificial sweeteners (e.g., saccharin and aspartame, the latter of which is made from two amino acids: L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester) are 10,000 to 100,000 times sweeter by weight than these sugars. Bitter substances are also chemically diverse. They include simple ions such as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$( KCl actually simultane-
ously evokes both bitter and salty tastes), larger metal ions such as $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, and complex organic molecules such as quinine.

If the tongue has only four or five primary taste qualities available to it, how does it discriminate among the myriad complex flavors that embellish our lives? First, the tongue's response to each tastant reflects distinct proportions of each of the primary taste qualities. In this sense, the taste cells are similar to the photoreceptors of our eyes; with only three different types of color-selective photoreceptive cone cells, we can distinguish a huge palette of colors. Second, the flavor of a tastant is determined not only by its taste but also by its smell. Taste and smell operate in parallel, with information converging in the CNS to aid the important discrimination of foods and poisons. For example, without the aid of olfaction, an onion tastes much like an apple-and both are quite bland. Third, the mouth is filled with other types of sensory receptors that are sensitive to texture, temperature, and pain, and these modalities enhance both the identification and enjoyment of foods. A striking example is the experience of spicy food, which is enjoyable to some but painful to others. The spiciness of hot peppers is generated by the chemical capsaicin, not because of its activation of taste receptor cells but because of its stimulation of heat-sensitive pain receptors in the mouth.

## Taste transduction involves many types of molecular signaling systems

The chemicals that we taste have diverse structures, and taste receptors have evolved a variety of mechanisms for transduction. The taste system has adapted many types of membranesignaling systems to its purposes. Tastants may pass directly through ion channels (salty and sour), bind to and block ion channels (sour) or bind to membrane receptors that activate second-messenger systems, which in turn open or close ion channels (sweet, bitter, and umami). Taste cells use specialized variations of these processes to initiate meaningful signals to the brain.

The receptor potentials of taste cells are usually depolarizing. At least some taste receptor cells can fire action potentials similar to those of neurons, but if the membrane is sufficiently depolarized by whatever means, voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels open, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enters the cytoplasm and triggers the release of transmitter molecules. Both the type of neurotransmitter and its mechanism of its release differ by cell type. Sour and salty taste cells use a conventional $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-$ triggered vesicular mechanism to release serotonin onto gustatory axons, whereas sweet-, bitter-, and umami-selective taste cells use a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-triggered nonvesicular mechanism to release ATP as their transmitter.

Evidence from mice suggests that each taste receptor cell responds to only one of the five basic taste modalities. Each of the taste receptor cells is, in turn, hard-wired to the CNS to convey a particular taste quality. For example, if we genetically alter a mouse to express a bitter receptor in sweet taste receptor cells, the mouse-naturally attracted to sweet tastants-will be attracted to bitter tastants, which now will taste sweet.

The complex diversities of taste transduction are not yet fully understood. The following is a summary of the

![bo98099069a0](bo98099069a0.jpg)

Figure 15-3 Cellular basis of taste transduction. Although, for convenience, we show two taste modalities in $\mathbf{A}$ and three in $\mathbf{B}$, individual taste cells do not express more than one of the taste mechanisms. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PLC, phospholipase C.
best-understood transduction processes for the five primary taste qualities in mammals (Fig. 15-3).

Salty The most common salty-tasting chemical is NaCl , or table salt. The taste of salt is mainly the taste of the cation $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. At relatively low concentrations ( 10 to 150 mM ), NaCl is usually attractive to animals; at higher concentrations it is increasingly aversive. Completely different mechanisms transduce low and high $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$. Salt-sensitive taste cells detect low $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ using the epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel ENaC (see Fig. 15-3A), which is blocked by the drug amiloride (see pp. 758-759). These cells also have an amiloride-insensitive cation channel that contributes to salt transduction. Unlike the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel that generates action potentials in excitable cells, the taste channels are relatively insensitive to voltage and stay open at rest. However, transduction of the $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$in a mouthful of food is somewhat analogous to the behavior of a neuron during the upstroke of an action potential. When $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$rises outside the receptor cell, the gradient for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ across the membrane becomes steeper, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$diffuses down its electrochemical gradient (i.e., it flows into the cell), and the resultant inward current causes the membrane to depolarize to a new voltage. Neurons depolarize during their action potential by increasing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance at a fixed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient (see Fig. 7-4). In contrast, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-sensitive taste cells depolarize by increasing the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient at a fixed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$permeability. The resultant graded depolarization of the taste cell is defined as its receptor potential.

High concentrations of NaCl and other salts taste bad to humans, and animals normally avoid ingesting them. In mice, high $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ activates bitter and sour taste cells, although the mechanism is not clear. Bitter and sour tastants normally trigger avoidance, and the offensive qualities of high $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ seem to stimulate the same avoidance pathways.

Anions may affect the taste of salts by modulating the saltiness of the cation or by adding a taste of their own. NaCl tastes saltier than Na acetate, perhaps because the larger an anion is, the more it inhibits the salty taste of the cation. Na saccharin is sweet because the anion saccharin activates sweetness receptors; it is not salty because $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is present at a very low concentration.

Sour Sourness is evoked by protons ( $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions). Acidity may affect taste receptors in several ways (see Fig. 15-3A). Sour taste cells express a type of acid-sensitive channel complex comprising the nonselective cation channel TRPP3 (see Table 6-2, family No. 5; also known as PKD2L1) and PKD1L3; both are related to proteins implicated in polycystic kidney disease. Selective elimination of taste cells expressing TRPP3 abolishes the gustatory response to acidic stimuli. Protons may also affect the gating of other cation-selective channels such as the hyperpolarization-activated channels (HCNs; see Table 6-2, family No. 3) and the acid-sensitive channels (ASICs; see Table 6-2, family No. 14) that would lead to depolarization of taste cells.

Carbonated liquids evoke interesting sensations. Carbonation-high levels of dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-can activate the gustatory, olfactory, and somatosensory neurons. Sour taste cells seem to be critical for the gustatory features of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. These cells express an extracellular form of carbonic anhydrase, CA IV, an enzyme that rapidly catalyzes the conversion of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ into $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Thus, in the presence of CA IV, increased $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ leads to the production of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$that may act on effectors in the receptor cells to mediate the taste of carbonation. Consistent with this, mountain climbers taking acetazolamide, the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, to treat acute mountain sickness (see p. 1232) have reported that beer and soda taste disappointingly flat.

Sweet Sweetness is sensed when molecules bind to specific receptor sites on the taste cell membrane and activate a cascade of second messengers (see Fig. 15-3B). Two families of taste receptor genes-the T1R family and T2R familyseem to account for sweet, bitter, and umami transduction. These taste receptors are GPCRs (see pp. 51-66), and all use the same basic second-messenger pathway. In the case of sweetness transduction, the tastant (e.g., a sugar molecule) binds to a taste receptor that consists of a dimer of T1R2 and T1R3 GPCRs. The activated receptor then activates a G protein that stimulates phospholipase C (PLC), which in turn increases its production of the messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right.$; see p. 58). $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ triggers the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from internal stores, and the rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, then activates a relatively nonselective cation channel called TRPM5 (see Table 6-2, family No. 5), which is specific for taste cells. Opening TRPM5 depolarizes the taste cell, triggering the release of neurotransmitter onto the primary gustatory axon (see Fig. 15-3B). The sweet receptor complex-the T1R2/ T1R3 dimer-is broadly sensitive to sweet-tasting substances. It appears that sweet-sensing taste cells do not express receptors for either bitter or umami. (5) N15-1

Bitter Bitterness often warns of poison. Perhaps because poisons are so chemically diverse, we have about 25 different types of bitter receptors to sense them. These are dimers of GPCRs in the T2R family. Animals are not very good at distinguishing between different bitter substances, probably because each bitter taste cell expresses most or all of the 25 T2Rs. It may be more important to recognize that something is bitter, and potentially poisonous, than it is to recognize precisely what type of poison it may be. Bitter compounds trigger responses at much lower concentrations (i.e., they have much binding higher affinities) than sweet and umami substances. Stimulation of the T2Rs activates a second-messenger pathway that is apparently identical to the one that sweet receptors activate: G proteins, PLC, $\mathrm{IP}_{3},\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, increase, and TRPM5 channel opening. We do not confuse the tastes of sweet and bitter substances because even though they trigger similar signaling systems, each transduction cascade occurs within a specific sweet or bitter taste cell. Moreover, each taste cell makes synaptic contact with a different primary gustatory axon that leads into the CNS.

Amino Acids Amino acids are critical nutrients that are vital as an energy source and for construction of proteins.

Probably as a consequence, many amino acids taste good, although some taste bitter. The umami taste, which we know well from some Asian restaurants, is triggered by a mechanism very similar to that for sweet taste. The umami receptor is a heterodimer comprising two members of the T1R family, T1R1 and T1R3. Note that the umami and sweet receptors share T1R3. The taste for some L-amino acids seems to depend on T1R1 because mice that lack it are unable to discriminate glutamate and other amino acids, although they retain their ability to detect sweet substances. (5) N15-1 The umami receptor activates the same signaling mechanisms that sweet and bitter receptors do: G proteins, $\mathrm{PLC}, \mathrm{IP}_{3}$, $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, increase, and TRPM5 channel opening. Again, by isolating the umami receptors in taste cells that do not also express sweet and bitter receptors, the CNS can distinguish the various tastes from one another by somehow knowing which taste cell connects to a particular gustatory axon.

## Olfactory transduction involves specific receptors, G protein-coupled signaling, and a cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel

Our ability to smell chemicals is better developed than our ability to taste them. By one estimate, we can smell $>400,000$ different substances. Interestingly, $\sim 80 \%$ of them smell unpleasant. As with taste, it seems likely that smell evolved to serve important protective functions, such as warning us away from harmful substances. The main and accessory olfactory systems can also detect pheromones, volatile chemicals used by individuals of a species to trigger stereotyped behavioral or hormonal changes. In some species, olfaction even allows one individual to detect whether others are dangerous or ill. With the ability to discriminate so many different smells, you might also expect many different types of transduction mechanisms, as in the taste system. In fact, the main olfactory receptors probably use only one secondmessenger mechanism. Figure 15-4 summarizes the chain of events in the main olfactory receptor cells that leads to action potentials in the olfactory nerve (i.e., cranial nerve I [CN I]).

Step 1: The odorant binds to a specific olfactory receptor protein in the cell membrane of a cilium of an olfactory receptor cell.
Step 2: Receptor activation stimulates a heterotrimeric G protein called $\mathbf{G}_{\text {olf }}$ (see Table 3-2).
Step 3: The $\alpha$ subunit of $\mathrm{G}_{\text {olf }}$ in turn activates an adenylyl cyclase (specifically, ACIII), which produces cAMP.
Step 4: The cAMP binds to a CNG cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel (see Table 6-2, family No. 4).
Step 5: Opening of this channel increases permeability to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.
Step 6: The net inward current leads to membrane depolarization and increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$.
Step 7: The increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ opens $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels called anoctamin2 (ANO2; see Table 6-2, family No. 17). Opening of these channels produces more depolarization because of the relatively high $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}$ of olfactory receptor neurons.
Step 8: If the receptor potential exceeds the threshold, it triggers action potentials in the soma that travel down the axon and into the brain.

# N15-1 Diversity of Sweet and Umami Taste Reception 

## Contributed by Barry Connors

Taste receptors are quite diverse among species, and this leads to considerably different taste preferences that may be adaptations to each animal's ecological niche. Preferences for sweet substances are strongly determined by the T1R subunits. Some species, notably cats and some other carnivores, lack a functional T1R2 gene and are indifferent to compounds that humans consider sweet. Mice are usually uninterested in aspartame, the artificial sweetener favored by people, but introducing the human T1R2 gene into the taste cells of a mouse makes them responsive to aspartame. Some mammalian species (including all types of bats) lack a functional T1R1 receptor and presumably cannot taste amino acids.

Figure 15-4 Cellular mechanism of odor sensation.

All this molecular machinery, with the exception of the action potential mechanism, is squeezed into the thin cilia of olfactory receptor cells. Moreover, additional modulatory schemes also branch from this basic pathway.

Olfactory receptor cells express a huge family of receptor proteins; in fact, olfactory receptor genes are the largest family of mammalian genes known! Their discovery in the early 1990s earned Linda Buck and Richard Axel the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (5) N15-2 Rodents have $>1000$ different olfactory receptor genes. Humans have $\sim 350$ genes that encode functional receptor proteins. This family of olfactory receptor proteins belongs to the superfamily of GPCRs (see pp. 51-52) that also includes the phototransduction protein rhodopsin and the taste receptors for sweet, bitter, and umami described above as well as the receptors for a wide variety of neurotransmitters.

The extracellular surfaces of olfactory receptor proteins have odorant binding sites, each slightly different from the others. Presumably, each receptor protein can bind only certain types of odorants; therefore, some degree of selectivity is conferred to different olfactory receptor cells. Remarkably, each receptor cell seems to express only a single gene of the 1000 different odorant receptor genes in rodents. Thus, 1000 different types of olfactory receptor cells are present, each identified by the one receptor gene that it expresses. Because each odorant may activate a large proportion of the different receptor types, the central olfactory system's task is to decode the patterns of receptor cell activity that signals the identity of each smell.

The structure of the olfactory cAMP-gated channel is closely related to that of the light-activated channel in photoreceptors of the retina, which is normally gated by an increase in [cGMP] $\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{o}}$. The olfactory channel and the photoreceptor channel almost certainly evolved from one ancestral CNG channel, just as the olfactory receptor and photoreceptor proteins probably evolved from an ancestral receptor with seven membrane-spanning segments.

Termination of the olfactory response occurs when odorants diffuse away, scavenger enzymes in the mucous layer break them down, or cAMP in the receptor cell activates other signaling pathways that end the transduction process.

## VISUAL TRANSDUCTION

The environment of most species is enveloped by light (Fig. 15-5). Animals have evolved a variety of mechanisms to transduce and detect light. Their brains analyze visual information to help them locate food, avoid becoming food, find a mate, navigate, and generally recognize distant objects. Light is an exceptionally useful source of information about the world because it is nearly ubiquitous and can travel far and fast and in straight lines with relatively little dispersion of its energy. The vertebrate eye, which we describe here, has two major components: an optical part to gather light and to focus it to form an image and a neural part (the retina) to convert the optical image into a neural code.

## The optical components of the eye collect light and focus it onto the retina

The optical structures of the eye are among the most sophisticated of the specialized non-neural sensory endings, and they are often compared with a camera. As cameras have become more technologically sophisticated, the analogy has improved because the eye has systems to focus automatically, adjust its sensitivity for widely different light levels, move to track and stabilize a target, and even keep its surface washed and clear (obviously, cameras still have room for improvement). The similarity to a camera breaks down when we
consider the retina, which is decidedly not like standard photographic film or electronic light detectors.

Figure 15-6A shows a cross section through the human eye. A ray of light entering the eye passes through several relatively transparent elements to reach the retina; these elements include a thin film of tears and then the cornea, the aqueous humor, the lens, and finally the vitreous humor. Tears are a surprisingly complex liquid, based on a plasma ultrafiltrate. They bathe the cornea in a layer that is $<10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ thick, keep it wet, and allow $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to diffuse from the air to the corneal cells. Tears also contain lysozymes and antibodies to counter infection, a superficial oily layer that greatly slows

evaporation and prevents spillage at the lid margins, and a thin mucoid layer to wet the surface of the cornea and to allow the tears to spread smoothly. Tears also help flush away foreign substances. The cornea is a thin, transporting epithelium that is devoid of blood vessels and has a cell structure specialized to maintain its high transparency. (5) N15-2A The ciliary epithelium, a part of the ciliary body, constantly secretes aqueous humor, a protein-free ultrafiltrate of blood plasma, into the posterior chamber of the eye. The aqueous humor then flows between the iris and the anterior surface of the lens and reaches the anterior chamber through the pupil. This aqueous humor keeps the anterior portion of the eye slightly pressurized ( $\sim 20 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ), which helps maintain the eye's shape. The canals of Schlemm drain the aqueous humor. Excess pressure in the anterior chamber produces a disease called glaucoma. In the most common form of glaucoma, blockage of the canals of Schlemm leads to increased intraocular pressure. Pressure damages and kills ganglion cell axons at the optic disc, where they leave the eye and enter the optic nerve. The lens is an onion-like structure with closely packed columnar cells that are arranged in concentric shells and encased by a thin, tough, transparent capsule that is composed of epithelial cells. The cells of the lens have a high concentration of proteins called $\alpha$-crystallins, which help increase the density of the lens and enhance its focusing power. The posterior chamber, which is filled with a gelatinous substance called vitreous humor, is also kept pressurized by the production of aqueous humor.

The light must be focused to generate a clear optical image on the retina. This is accomplished by the cornea and, to a lesser extent, the lens. Focusing requires the path of the light to be bent, or refracted. Refraction can occur when light passes from a medium in which it travels relatively fast into a medium in which it travels relatively slowly, or vice versa. The index of refraction for a substance is essentially a measure of the speed of light within it; for example, light travels faster through air (index of refraction, 1.0003) than through the denser substance of the cornea (index of refraction, 1.376). Two things determine how much a light ray is refracted: the difference in the refractive indices of the two media and the angle between the incident light and the interface between the two media. Simple convex lenses use curved surfaces to control the refraction of light rays so that they converge (or focus) on a distant surface. The focal power (D) of one surface of a spherical lens is

$$
\text { Focal power }=\frac{n_{2}-n_{1}}{r}
$$

Here, $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are the refractive indices of the first and second medium and $r$ is the radius of curvature of the lens in meters. The unit of focal power is a diopter $\left(1 \mathrm{D}=1 \mathrm{~m}^{-1}\right)$. Focal power is the reciprocal of focal length. Thus, parallel light rays entering a 1-D lens are focused at 1 m and those entering a 2-D lens are focused at 0.5 m .

In the case of the eye, most of the focusing takes place at the interface between the air and the tear-covered anterior surface of the cornea because this region is where light encounters the greatest disparity in refractive indices on its path to the retina (see Fig. 15-6B). With a change of 0.376 in refractive index and a radius of outer curvature of 7.8 mm
in a typical human cornea, the focal power is 48.2 D . The curvature on the inner surface of the cornea is reversed, so some focal power is lost as light passes into the aqueous humor. However, the change in refractive index at this surface is only 0.040 , so the change is only -5.9 D . The lens of the eye, with convex curvature on both sides, has a potentially greater focal power than the cornea. However, because of the small difference in refractive index between the substance of the lens and the aqueous and vitreous humors surrounding it, the effective focal power of the lens is lower. The summed focal power of the optics of the relaxed eye is -60 D , which allows it to focus light from distant objects onto the retina, the center of which is $\sim 24 \mathrm{~mm}$ behind the surface of the cornea (Fig. 15-7A).

# N15-2A The Cornea 

## Contributed by Mark Parker

The cornea is a transparent structure that consists of a collagen matrix called the stroma sandwiched between two layers of epithelia. The anterior corneal epithelium is a stratified squamous layer that faces the tear-film on the surface of the eye. The posterior corneal epithelium, or corneal endothelium, is a simple cuboidal cell layer that faces the aqueous humor in the anterior chamber of the eye. The stroma accounts for approximately $90 \%$ of the total thickness of the cornea. The transparency of the stroma depends on the maintenance of the appropriate hydration state or deturgescence of the collagen matrix. Disturbance of the structural array of collagen fibers within the matrix by dehydration or overhydration of the stroma results in increased scattering of light rays, a phenomenon called corneal opacification, and a consequent loss of vision. Both epithelial layers contribute toward maintaining stromal deturgescence. The anterior corneal epithelium protects the hydrated stroma from physical damage and prevents evaporation of fluid from the stroma. The corneal endothelium forms a leaky barrier between the stroma and the anterior chamber, allowing the paracellular leak of nutrient-rich fluid from the aqueous humor into the stroma. The endothelial cells pump ions from the stromal fluid into the aqueous humor via a transcellular route, thereby promoting the return of fluid from the stroma back into the anterior chamber, preventing corneal edema. Disruption of stromal collagen-structure or endothelial pump-function produces a group of diseases called corneal dystrophies.

image is, of course, upside down relative to the object that produced it.

A normal resting eye is focused on distant objects, beyond $\sim 7 \mathrm{~m}$. If it were fixed in this position, it would be impossible to see objects that are close up. To focus objects that are closer than 7 m away, the eye needs to increase its focal power, a process called accommodation. The eye achieves this goal by changing the shape of the lens (see Fig. 15-6A). At rest, the lens is suspended around its edge by elastic zonal fibers that keep its capsule stretched and relatively flattened. To accommodate, the ciliary muscle fibers contract and release some of the tension in the zonal fibers. Relieved of the radial pull of its fibers, the lens becomes rounder. This increased curvature means increased focal power and a shift of the focal point closer to the eye (see Equation 15-1). There are limits to accommodation, of course, and they are strongly age dependent. Young children have the most pliable lenses and can increase their focal power up to 12 to 14 D . Their near point, the closest distance that they are able to focus, is about at the end of their nose.

With age, the lens becomes stiffer and less able to round up and accommodate. By age 30, the near point is $\sim 10 \mathrm{~cm}$, and by the mid-40s, it stretches beyond arm's length. The loss of accommodation with age is called presbyopia (from the Greek presbus [old] + ops [eye]); it is the reason that glasses for reading are unavoidable for almost everyone past middle age. Additional refractive flaws may be caused by an eye that is too long or short for its focusing power or by aberrations in the refracting surfaces of the eye. Myopia, or nearsightedness, occurs when the eye is too long; distant objects focus in front of the retina and appear blurred (see Fig. 15-7B). Hyperopia (or hypermetropia), or farsightedness, is a feature of eyes that are too short; even with the lens fully accommodated, a near object focuses behind the retina and appears blurry (see Fig. 15-7C). People with myopia can wear concave lenses that move the focal plane of all images back toward the retina. Those with hyperopia can wear convex lenses that move the focal plane forward. Astigmatism is caused by uneven curvature of the refractive surfaces of the eye (see Fig. 15-7D). As a result, a point source of light cannot be brought to a precise focus on the retina. The resultant diffuse focusing leads to blurring of the image. Most people with astigmatic vision can also wear lenses that compensate for the aberrant focusing properties of their eyes.

The iris is the colored structure that is visible through the window of the cornea. The iris's hue comes from pigments in its cells, but its function is to create and to adjust the round opening that it encircles-the pupil. The pupil is like the aperture of the camera, and the iris is the diaphragm that regulates the amount of light allowed to enter the eye. The iris has sphincter muscles, innervated by postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the ciliary ganglion (see Fig. 14-4 and Fig. 15-8), that allow it to constrict (miosis).
(7) M15-3 The iris also has radially oriented muscles, innervated by postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion (see Fig. 14-4), that allow it to dilate (mydriasis). Pupil size depends on the balance of the two autonomic inputs. The regulation of pupillary size by ambient light levels is called the pupillary light reflex (see Fig. 15-8). Light striking the retina stimulates fibers in the optic nerve that synapse in the brainstem in the nuclei of the posterior

commissure. The next neuron projects to the EdingerWestphal nuclei on both sides of the brain (see Fig. 14-5), stimulating preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that travel to both ciliary ganglia. These neurons activate postganglionic parasympathetic neurons that constrict both pupils. Thus, control of the pupils in the two eyes is "yoked": an increase in light to only one eye causes its pupil to constrict (the direct light response), but it also causes an identical constriction in the other eye, even if that eye saw only constant light levels (the consensual light response). Pupillary responses serve two functions: (1) they regulate the total amount of light that enters the eye (over a range of $\sim 16$-fold), and (2) they affect the quality of the retinal image in the same way that the aperture affects the depth of focus of a camera (a smaller pupil diameter gives a greater depth of focus).

Other peripheral structures are also essential to proper visual function. The most important are the extraocular muscles that control eye movements. Figure 15-6A shows two such muscles, the lateral and medial rectus muscles. The extraocular muscles determine the direction of gaze, the

# N15-3 Importance of Pupil Size for Depth of Focus 

## Contributed by Barry Connors

Imagine that a photographer focuses a camera on an object by adjusting the focal power of the camera lens (see Equation 15-1). In principle, only objects at a particular distance from the camera will be in sharp focus. However, if the photographer stops down the diaphragm behind the lens of a camera (to high F values), only fairly parallel rays of light can enter the camera, so that the depth of focus is very broad. In other words, because the camera is receiving very little information concerning the distance to an object, objects at rather different distances from the camera may all appear to be more or less in focus.

Just the opposite happens when the photographer opens up the diaphragm (to very low F values). In this case, the depth of focus is very shallow, so that the only objects that are in sharp focus are those at a particular distance from the camera. Other objects that are closer or further from the camera will appear blurred to varying extents, depending on their distance from the point of optimal focus.

In the eye, miosis (pupillary constriction) is the equivalent of a stopped-down diaphragm (high F value), whereas mydriasis (pupillary dilation) is the equivalent of a fully open diaphragm (low F value). Thus, under conditions of mydriasis (e.g., with sympathetic stimulation or in response to low light levels), the depth of focus can be very shallow, which can cause close objects to appear blurred if the lens is unable to sufficiently accommodate (i.e., to increase its focal power). Blurring is especially problematic with increasing age (e.g., $>40$ years), when accommodation becomes progressively limited-a condition known as presbyopia.

tracking of objects, and the coordination of the two eyes to keep their retinal images aligned as the eye, head, and visual world move about. Nuclei in the brainstem also control these tracking functions.

## The retina is a small, displaced part of the CNS

The retina is a very thin ( $\sim 200 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ thick in humans) sheet of tissue that lines the back of the eye and contains the lightsensitive cells, the photoreceptors. Photoreceptors capture photons, convert their light energy into chemical free energy, and ultimately generate a synaptic signal for relay to other visual neurons in the retina.

The retina is, histologically and embryologically, a part of the CNS. Not only does it transduce light into neural signals, but it also does some remarkably complex processing of visual information before passing it on to other regions of the brain. In addition to the photoreceptor cells, the retina has four additional types of neurons that form an orderly but intricate neural circuit (Fig. 15-9). One type, the ganglion cell, generates the sole output of the retina by sending its axons to the thalamus through the optic nerve (CN II).

The retina is a highly laminated structure. Through a quirk of evolution, the photoreceptors of the vertebrate eyerods and cones-are on the outer surface of the retina, that is, the side facing away from the vitreous humor and incoming light. Thus, to reach the transducing cells, light has to first pass through all the retinal neurons. This path causes only minor distortion of image quality because of the thinness and transparency of the neural layers. This seemingly inverted arrangement may actually be an advantage for housekeeping of the eye. Rods and cones undergo a continuous process of renewal, sloughing off membrane from their outer segments and rebuilding them. They also demand a relatively high energy supply. Because they face the back of the eye, these photoreceptors are close to the pigment epithelium, which aids the renewal process, and to the blood vessels that supply the retina. These poorly transparent structures (i.e., pigment epithelium and blood vessels) are thus isolated from the light path. In fact, the pigment epithelium also absorbs photons that are not first captured by photoreceptors, before they can be reflected and degrade the visual image.

Each human eye has $>100 \times 10^{6}$ photoreceptors but only $1 \times 10^{6}$ ganglion cells, which implies a high degree of convergence of information as it flows from the transducing cells to the output cells. Some of this convergence is mediated by a set of interneurons (i.e., cells that make synaptic connections only within the retina) called bipolar cells, which directly connect photoreceptors and ganglion cells in a mainly radial direction (see Fig. 15-9). The two remaining types of retinal neurons, horizontal cells and amacrine cells, are interneurons that mainly spread horizontally. Horizontal cells synapse within the outer layer of the retina and interconnect photoreceptors and bipolar cells to themselves and to each other. Horizontal cells often mediate interactions over a wide area of retina. Amacrine cells synapse within the inner layer of the retina and interconnect both bipolar cells and ganglion cells. The circuitry of the retina is much more complex than this picture implies. One hint of this
complexity is that its four primary types of neurons are in turn divided into at least 10 to 20 distinct subtypes, each with different physiological and morphological features.

The thinness of the mammalian retina has an interesting biophysical consequence. Because signaling distances are so short, synaptic potentials can usually spread effectively within its neurons without the help of conventional action potentials. Electrotonic spread of potentials along the dendrites is generally enough. The main exceptions are the ganglion cells, which use action potentials to speed visual information along their axons to the thalamus, which is deep within the brain.

## There are three primary types of photoreceptors: rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells

The two main types of photoreceptors, rods and cones, are named for their characteristic shapes (see Fig. 15-9). The human retina has only one type of rod, which is responsible for our monochromatic dark-adapted vision, and three subtypes of cones, which are responsible for the color-sensitive vision that we experience in brighter environments. Rods outnumber cones by at least 16:1, and each type of photoreceptor is spread in a distinct pattern across the retina.

The mammalian retina has a third type of light-sensitive cell, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC). This cell is a rare subtype of ganglion cell that expresses its own photopigment. Unlike the vast majority of ganglion cells, ipRGCs can respond to bright light even in the absence of input from rods and cones. The ipRGCs are involved in several nonimaging functions of the visual system.

In the central area of the primate retina is a small pit 300 to $700 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter (which accounts for 1 to 2.3 degrees of visual angle) called the fovea, which collects light from the center of our gaze (see Fig. 15-6). Several adaptations of the fovea allow it to mediate the highest visual acuity in the retina. Neurons of the inner layer of retina are actually displaced laterally to the side of the fovea to minimize light scattering on the way to the receptors. In addition, within the fovea, the ratio of photoreceptors to ganglion cells falls dramatically. Most foveal receptors synapse on only one bipolar cell, which synapses on only one ganglion cell (Fig. 15-10A). Because each ganglion cell is devoted to a very small portion of the visual field, central vision has high resolution. In other words, the receptive field of a foveal ganglion cell (i.e., the region of stimulus space that can activate it) is small. At the periphery, the ratio of receptors to ganglion cells is high (see Fig. 15-10B); thus, each ganglion cell has a large receptive field. The large receptive field reduces the spatial resolution of the peripheral portion of the retina but increases its sensitivity because more photoreceptors collect light for a ganglion cell. Foveal vision is purely cone mediated, and the sheet of foveal photoreceptors consists of only the smallest cones packed at the highest density ( $\sim 0.3 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ from the center of one cone to another). Cone density falls to very low levels outside the fovea, and rod density rises. Both rods and cones mediate peripheral vision (i.e., nonfoveal vision, or vision at visual angles $>10$ degrees away from the center of the fovea and thus the center of gaze).

Figure 15-9 Neural circuits in the primate retina. Notice that the incoming light reaches intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) immediately, but hits rod and cone photoreceptor cells only after passing through several thin, transparent layers of other neurons. The pigment epithelium absorbs the light not absorbed by the photoreceptor cells and thus minimizes reflections of stray light. The ganglion cells communicate to the thalamus by sending action potentials down their axons. However, the photoreceptor cells and other neurons communicate by graded synaptic potentials that are conducted electrotonically.

Figure 15-10 Comparison of the synaptic connections and receptive fields in the fovea and periphery of the retina.

Rods and cones are elongated cells with synaptic terminals, an inner segment, and an outer segment (see Fig. 15-9). The synaptic terminals connect to the inner segment by a short axon. The inner segment contains the nucleus and metabolic machinery; it synthesizes the photopigments and has a high density of mitochondria. The inner segment also serves an optical function-its high density funnels photons into the outer segment. A thin ciliary stalk connects the inner segment to the outer segment. The outer segment is the transduction site, although it is the last part of the cell to see the light. Structurally, the outer segment is a highly modified cilium. Each rod outer segment has $\sim 1000$ tightly packed stacks of disk membranes, which are flattened,
membrane-bound intracellular organelles that have pinched off from the outer membrane. Cone outer segments have similarly stacked membranes, except that they are infolded and remain continuous with the outer membrane. The disk membranes contain the photopigments-rhodopsin in rods and molecules related to rhodopsin in cones. Rhodopsin moves from its synthesis site in the inner segment through the stalk and into the outer segment through small vesicles whose membranes are packed with rhodopsin to be incorporated into the disks.

## Rods and cones hyperpolarize in response to light

The remarkable psychophysical experiments of Hecht and colleagues in 1942 demonstrated that five to seven photons, each acting on only a single rod, are sufficient to evoke a sensation of light in humans. Thus, the rod is performing at the edge of its physical limits because there is no light level smaller than 1 photon. To detect a single photon requires a prodigious feat of signal amplification. As Denis Baylor has pointed out, "the sensitivity of rod vision is so great that the energy needed to lift a sugar cube one centimeter, if converted to a blue-green light, would suffice to give an intense sensation of a flash to every human who ever existed."

Phototransduction involves a cascade of chemical and electrical events to detect, to amplify, and to signal a response to light. As do many other sensory receptors, photoreceptors use electrical events (receptor potentials) to carry the visual signal from the outer segment to their synapses. Chemical messengers diffusing over such a distance would simply be too slow. A surprising fact about the receptor potential of rods and cones is that it is hyperpolarizing. Light causes the cell's $V_{m}$ to become more negative than the resting potential that it maintains in the dark (Fig. 15-11A). At low light intensities, the size of the receptor potential rises linearly with light intensity; but at higher intensities, the response saturates.

Hyperpolarization is an essential step in relaying the visual signal because it directly modulates the rate of transmitter release from the photoreceptor onto its postsynaptic neurons. This synapse is conventional in that it releases more transmitter-in this case glutamate-when its presynaptic terminal is depolarized and less when it is hyperpolarized. Thus, a flash of light causes a decrease in transmitter secretion. The upshot is that the vertebrate photoreceptor is most active in the dark.

How is the light-induced hyperpolarization generated? Figure 15-11B shows a method to measure the current flowing across the membrane of the outer segment of a single rod. In the dark, each photoreceptor produces an ionic current that flows steadily into the outer segment and out of the inner segment. This dark current is carried mainly by inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions in the outer segment and by outwardly directed $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions from the inner segment (see Fig. 15-11C). $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$flows through a nonselective cation channel of the outer segment, which light indirectly regulates, and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ flows through a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel in the inner segment, which light does not regulate. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$carries $\sim 90 \%$ of the dark current in the outer segment, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \sim 10 \%$. In the dark, $V_{m}$ is about $\sim 40 \mathrm{mV} . \mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps, primarily located within the inner segments, remove the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and import $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. An $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{Ca}$ exchanger removes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the outer segment.

Figure 15-11 Phototransduction. A, The experiment for which results are summarized here was performed on a red-sensitive cone from a turtle. A brief flash of light causes a hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell. The size of the peak and the duration of the receptor potential increase with the increasing intensity of the flash. At low light intensities, the magnitude of the peak increases linearly with light intensity. At high intensities, the peak response saturates, but the plateau becomes longer. B, A single rod has been sucked into a pipette, which allows the investigators to monitor the current. The horizontal white band is the light used to stimulate the rod. C, In the absence of light, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$enters the outer segment of the rod through cGMPgated channels and depolarizes the cell. The electrical circuit for this dark current is completed by $\mathrm{K}^{+}$leaving the inner segment. The dark current, which depolarizes the cell, leads to constant transmitter release. D, In the presence of light, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$can no longer enter the cell because cGMP levels are low, and the cGMP-gated channel closes. The photoreceptor cell thus hyperpolarizes, and transmitter release decreases. (A, Data from Baylor DA, Hodgkin AL, Lamb TD: The electrical response of turtle cones to flashes and steps of light.

B, The absorption of a photon by 11-cis retinal causes the molecule to isomerize to all-trans retinal. C, After rhodopsin absorbs a photon of light, it activates many transducins. The activated $\alpha$ subunit of transducin (G $\alpha_{s}$ ) in turn activates phosphodiesterase, which hydrolyzes cGMP. The resultant decrease in (cGMP), closes cGMP-gated channels and produces a hyperpolarization (receptor potential).

Filipek and K. Palczewski.)

Absorption of photons leads to closure of the nonselective cation channels in the outer segment. The total conductance of the cell membrane decreases. Because the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels of the inner segment remain open, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$continues to flow out of the cell, and this outward current causes the cell to hyperpolarize (see Fig. 15-11D). The number of cation channels that close depends on the number of photons that are absorbed. The range of one rod's sensitivity is 1 to $\sim 1000$ photons.

Baylor and colleagues measured the minimum amount of light required to produce a change in receptor current (see Fig. 15-11B). They found that absorption of 1 photon suppresses a surprisingly large current, equivalent to the entry of $>10^{6} \mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions, and thus represents an enormous amplification of energy. The single-photon response is also much larger than the background electrical noise in the rod, as it must be to produce the rod's high sensitivity to dim light. Cones respond similarly to single photons, but they are inherently noisier and their response is only $\sim 1 / 36$ the size of that in the rod. Cone responses do not saturate, even at the brightest levels of natural light. Cones also respond faster than rods.

## Rhodopsin is a G protein-coupled "receptor" for light

How can a single photon stop the flow of 1 million $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions across the membrane of a rod cell? The process begins when the photon is absorbed by rhodopsin, the light receptor molecule. Rhodopsin is one of the most tightly packed proteins in the body, with a density of $\sim 30,000$ molecules per square micrometer in the disk membranes. Thus, the packing ratio is 1 protein molecule for every 60 lipid molecules! One rod contains $\sim 10^{5}$ rhodopsin molecules. This staggering density ensures an optimized capture rate for photons passing through a photoreceptor. Even so, only $\sim 10 \%$ of the light entering the eye is used by the receptors. The rest is either absorbed by the optical components of the eye or passes between or through the receptors. Rhodopsin has two key components: retinal and the protein opsin. Retinal is the aldehyde of vitamin A, or retinol ( $\sim 500 \mathrm{Da}$ ). Opsin is a single polypeptide ( $\sim 41 \mathrm{kDa}$ ) with seven membranespanning segments (Fig. 15-12A). It is a member of the superfamily of GPCRs (see pp. 51-52) that includes many neurotransmitter receptors as well as the olfactory receptor molecules.

To be transduced, photons are actually absorbed by retinal, which is responsible for rhodopsin's color. The tail

of retinal can twist into a variety of geometric configurations, one of which is a kinked and unstable version called 11-cis retinal (see Fig. 15-12B). The cis form sits within a pocket of the opsin (comparable to the ligand-binding site of other GPCRs) and is covalently bound to it. However, because of its instability, the cis form can exist only in the dark. If 11-cis retinal absorbs a photon, it isomerizes within 1 ps to a straighter and more stable version called all-trans retinal. This isomerization in turn triggers a series of conformational changes in the opsin that lead to a form called metarhodop$\sin$ II, which can activate an attached molecule called transducin. Transducin carries the signal forward in the cascade and causes a reduction in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance. Soon after isomerization, all-trans retinal and opsin separate in a process called bleaching; this separation causes the color to change from the rosy red of rhodopsin (rhodon is Greek for the color "rose") to the pale yellow of opsin. The photoreceptor cell converts all-trans retinal to retinol (vitamin A), which then translocates to the pigment epithelium and becomes 11-cis retinal. This compound makes its way back to the outer segment, where it recombines with opsin. This cycle of rhodopsin regeneration takes a few minutes.

Transducin is so named because it transduces the lightactivated signal from rhodopsin into the photoreceptor membrane's response (see Fig. 15-12C). Transducin was the first of the large family of GTP-binding proteins (G proteins; see p. 52) to be identified, and its amino-acid sequence is very similar to that of other G proteins (see Table 3-2). When it is activated by metarhodopsin, the $\alpha$ subunit of transducin exchanges a bound GDP for a GTP and then diffuses within the plane of the membrane to stimulate a phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes cGMP to $5^{\prime}$-guanylate monophosphate.
cGMP is the diffusible second messenger that links the light-activated events of the disk membranes to the electrical events of the outer membrane. A key discovery by Fesenko and colleagues in 1985 showed that the "light-sensitive" cation channel of rods is actually a cGMP-gated cation channel (see pp. 169-172). This CNG channel was the first of its kind to be discovered (we have already discussed a similar channel in olfactory receptors). In the dark, a constitutively active guanylyl cyclase that synthesizes cGMP from GTP keeps cGMP levels high within the photoreceptor cytoplasm. This high [cGMP], causes the cGMP-gated cation channels to spend much of their time open and accounts for the dark current (see Fig. 15-11C). Because light stimulates the phosphodiesterase and thus decreases [cGMP] $\mathrm{l}_{\mathrm{l}}$, light reduces the number of open cGMP-gated cation channels and thus reduces the dark current. The photoreceptor then hyperpolarizes, transmitter release falls, and a visual signal is passed to retinal neurons.

Strong amplification occurs along the phototransduction pathway. The absorption of 1 photon activates 1 metarhodopsin molecule, which can activate $\sim 700$ transducin molecules within $\sim 100 \mathrm{~ms}$. These transducin molecules activate phosphodiesterase, which increases the rate of cGMP hydrolysis by $\sim 100$-fold. One photon leads to the hydrolysis of $\sim 1400$ cGMP molecules by the peak of the response, thus reducing [cGMP] by $\sim 8 \%$ in the cytoplasm around the activated disk. This decrease in [cGMP] ${ }_{1}$ closes $\sim 230$ of the 11,000 cGMP-gated channels that are open in the dark. As a result, the dark current falls by $\sim 2 \%$.

The cGMP-gated channel has additional interesting properties. It responds within milliseconds when [cGMP] $]_{1}$ rises, and it does not desensitize in response to cGMP. The concentration-response curve is very steep at low [cGMP] $]_{1}$ because opening requires the simultaneous binding of three cGMP molecules. Thus, the channel has switch-like behavior at physiological levels of cGMP. Ion conductance through the channel also has steep voltage dependence because $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ strongly block the channel (as well as permeate it) within its physiological voltage range. This open-channel block (see Fig. 7-20D) makes the normal single-channel conductance very small, among the smallest of any ion channel; the open channel normally carries a current of only $3 \times$ $10^{-15} \mathrm{~A}(3 \mathrm{fA})$ ! The currents of ion channels are inherently "noisy" as they flicker open and closed. However, the 11,000 channels-each with currents of 3 fA -summate to a rather noise-free dark current of 11,000 channels $\times 3 \mathrm{fA}$ per channel $=33 \mathrm{pA}$. In contrast, if 11 channels-each with currents of 3 pA -carried the dark current of 33 pA , the $2 \%$ change in this signal $(0.66 \mathrm{pA})$ would be smaller than the noise produced by the opening and closing of a single channel ( 3 pA ). Thus, the small channels give the photoreceptor a high signal-to-noise ratio.

The [cGMP] ${ }_{1}$ in the photoreceptor cell represents a dynamic balance between the synthesis of cGMP by guanylyl cyclase and the breakdown of cGMP by phosphodiesterase. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, which enters through the relatively nonselective cGMPgated channel, synergistically inhibits the guanylyl cyclase and stimulates the phosphodiesterase. These $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensitivities set up a negative-feedback system. In the dark, the incoming $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ prevents runaway increases in $\left[\mathrm{cGMP}_{1}\right]_{1}$. In the light, the ensuing decrease in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{1}$ relieves the inhibition on guanylyl cyclase, inhibits the phosphodiesterase, increases [cGMP] $]_{1}$, and thus poises the system for channel reopening.

When a light stimulus terminates, the activated forms of each component of the transduction cascade must be inactivated. One mechanism of this termination process appears to involve the channels themselves. As described in the preceding paragraph, closure of the cGMP-gated channels in the light leads to a fall in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{1}$, which helps replenish cGMP and facilitates channel reopening. Two additional mechanisms involve the proteins rhodopsin kinase and arrestin. Rhodopsin kinase phosphorylates light-activated rhodopsin and allows it to be recognized by arrestin. Arrestin, an abundant cytosolic protein, binds to the phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin and completely terminates its ability to activate transducin.

## The eye uses a variety of mechanisms to adapt to a wide range of light levels

The human eye can operate effectively over a $10^{10}$-fold range of light intensities, which is the equivalent of going from almost total darkness to bright sunlight on snow. However, moving from a bright to a dark environment, or vice versa, requires time for adaptation before the eye can respond optimally. Adaptation is mediated by several mechanisms. One mechanism mentioned above is regulation of the size of the pupil by the iris, which can change light sensitivity by $\sim 16$ fold. That still leaves the vast majority of the range to account

![bo114099069a0](bo114099069a0.jpg)

Figure 15-13 Effect of dark adaptation on the visual threshold. The subject was exposed to light at a level of 1600 millilumens and then switched to the dark. The graph is a plot of the time course of the subject's relative threshold (on a log scale) for detecting a light stimulus. (Data from Hecht S, Shlaer S, Smith EL, et al: The visual functions of the complete color blind. J Gen Physiol 31:459-472, 1948.)
for. During dark adaptation, two additional mechanisms with very different time courses are evident, as we can see from a test of the detection threshold for the human eye (Fig. 15-13). The first phase of adaptation is finished within $\sim 10$ minutes and is a property of the cones; the second takes at least 30 minutes and is attributed to the rods. A fully darkadapted retina, relying on rods, can have a light threshold that is as much as 15,000 times lower than a retina relying on cones. In essence, then, the human eye has two retinas in one, a rod retina for low light levels and a cone retina for high light levels. These two systems can operate at the same time; when dark adapted, the rods can respond to the lowest light levels, but cones are available to respond when brighter stimuli appear.

The rapid and slow phases of adaptation that are discussed in the preceding paragraph have both neural and photoreceptor mechanisms. The neural mechanisms are relatively fast, operate at relatively low ambient light levels, and involve multiple mechanisms within the neuronal network of the retina. The photoreceptor mechanisms involve some of the processes that are described in the previous section. Thus, in bright sunlight, rods become ineffective because most of their rhodopsin remains inactivated, or bleached. cGMP-gated channels are closed and thus $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry is blocked, so $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ falls to a few nanomolar as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is removed by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} /\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)$exchanger NCKX1 (SLC24A1; see Table 5-4). After returning to darkness, the rods slowly regenerate rhodopsin and become sensitive once again. However, a component of the cGMP system also regulates photoreceptor sensitivity. In the dark, when baseline [cGMP] is relatively high, substantial amounts of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enter through cGMP-gated channels. The resultant high $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ (several hundred nanomolars) inhibits guanylyl cyclase and stimulates phosphodiesterase, thereby preventing [cGMP] from rising too high. Conversely, when background light levels are high, this same feedback system causes baseline [cGMP] to remain high so that [cGMP] can fall in response to further increases in light levels. Otherwise, the signal-transduction system would become saturated. In other words, the photoreceptor adapts to the increased background light intensity and remains responsive to small changes. Additional adaptation mechanisms regulate the sensitivity of rhodopsin, guanylyl cyclase, and the cGMP-gated channel. Clearly, adaptation involves an intricate network of molecular interactions.

## Color vision depends on the different spectral sensitivities of the three types of cones

The human eye responds only to a small region of the electromagnetic spectrum (see Fig. 15-5), but within it, we are exquisitely sensitive to the light's wavelength. We see assorted colors in a daytime panorama because objects absorb some wavelengths while reflecting, refracting, or transmitting others. Different sources of light may also affect the colors of a scene; the light from tungsten bulbs is reddish, whereas that of fluorescent bulbs is bluish.

Research on color vision has a long history. In 1801, Thomas Young first outlined the trichromatic theory of color vision, which was championed later in the 19th century by Hermann von Helmholtz. These investigators found that they could reproduce a particular sample hue by mixing the correct intensities of three lights with the primary hues blue, green, and red. They proposed that color vision, with its wide range of distinct, perceived hues, is based on only three different pigments in the eye, each absorbing a different range of wavelengths. Microspectrophotometry of single cones in 1964 amply confirmed this scheme. Thus, although analysis of color by the human brain is sophisticated and complex, it all derives from the responses of only three types of photopigments in cones.

Our sensitivity to the wavelength of light depends on the retina's state of adaptation. When it is dark adapted (also called scotopic conditions), the spectral sensitivity curve for human vision is shifted toward shorter wavelengths compared with the curve obtained after light adaptation (photopic conditions; Fig. 15-14A). The absolute sensitivity to light can also be several orders of magnitude higher under scotopic conditions (see Fig. 15-13). The primary reason for the difference in these curves is that rods are doing the transduction of dim light under dark-adapted conditions, whereas cones transduce in the light-adapted eye. As we would predict, the spectral sensitivity curve for scotopic vision is quite similar to the absorption spectrum of the rods' rhodopsin, with a peak at 500 nm .

The spectral sensitivity of the light-adapted eye depends on the photopigments in the cones. Humans have three different kinds of cones, and each expresses a photopigment with a different absorbance spectrum. The peaks of their absorbance curves fall at $\sim 420,530$, and 560 nm , which correspond to the violet, yellow-green, and yellow-red regions of the spectrum (see Fig. 15-14B). The three cones and their pigments were historically called blue, green, and red,

B ABSORBANCE SPECTRA OF THE HUMAN PHOTOPIGMENTS
![bo116099069a0](bo116099069a0.jpg)

Figure 15-14 Sensitivity of vision and photoreceptors at different wavelengths of light. A, The graph shows the results of a psychophysical experiment. Under dark-adapted (scotopic) conditions, the human eye is maximally sensitive at -500 nm . Under light-adapted (photopic) conditions, the eye is maximally sensitive at -560 nm . B, The spectral sensitivity of rods (obtained with a spectrophotometer) peaks at -500 nm ; that of the three types of cones peaks at -420 nm for the $S$ (blue) cone, -530 nm for the $M$ (green) cone, and -560 nm for the $L$ (red) cone; and that of melanopsin peaks at -475 nm . Each absorbance spectrum has been normalized to its peak sensitivity. (A, Data from Knowles A: The biochemical aspects of vision. In Barlow HB, Mollon JD [eds]: The Senses. Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press, 1982, pp 82-101; B, rhodopsin data from Dartnell HJ, Bowmaker JK, Mollon JD: Microspectrophotometry of human photoreceptors. In Mollon JD, Sharpe LT [eds]: Colour Vision. London, Academic Press, 1983, pp 69-80; melanopsin data from Matsuyama T, Yamashita T, Imamoto Y, Shichida Y: Photochemical properties of mammalian melanopsin. Biochemistry 51:5454-5462, 2012.)
respectively. They are now more commonly called S, M, and L (for short, medium, and long wavelengths); we use this terminology here. Because the absolute sensitivity of the short-wavelength cone is only one tenth that of the other two, the spectral sensitivity of photopic human vision is dominated by the two longer-wavelength cones (compare the spectral sensitivity functions in Fig. 15-14A with the absorbance spectra of the cones in Fig. 15-14B).

Single cones do not encode the wavelength of a light stimulus. If a cone responds to a photon, it generates the same response regardless of the wavelength of that photon. A glance at Figure 15-14B shows that each type of cone pigment can absorb a wide range of wavelengths. The pigment in a cone is more likely to absorb photons when their wavelength is at its peak absorbance, but light hitting the cone on the fringe of its absorbance range can still generate a large response if the light's intensity is sufficiently high. This property of response univariance is the reason that vision in an eye with only one functioning pigment (e.g., scotopic vision using only rods) can only be monochromatic. With a single pigment system, the distinction between different colors and between differences in intensity is confounded. Two different cones (as in most New World monkeys), each with a different but overlapping range of wavelength sensitivities, remove much of the ambiguity in encoding the wavelength of light stimuli. With three overlapping pigments (as in Old World monkeys and humans), light of a single wavelength stimulates each of the three cones to different degrees, and light of any other wavelength stimulates these cones with a distinctly different pattern. Because the nervous system can compare the relative stimulation of the three cone types to decode the wavelength, it can also distinguish changes in the intensity (luminance) of the light from changes in its wavelength.

Color capabilities are not constant across the retina. The use of multiple cones is not compatible with fine spatial discrimination because of wavelength-dependent differences in the eye's ability to focus light, known as chromatic aberration, and because very small objects may stimulate only single cones. The fovea has only M and L cones, which limits its color discrimination in comparison to the peripheral portions of the retina but leaves it best adapted to discriminate fine spatial detail (Box 15-1).

The four different human visual pigments have a similar structure. The presence of retinal and the mechanisms of its photoisomerization are essentially identical in each. The main difference is the primary structure of the attached protein, the opsin. M and L opsins share $96 \%$ of their amino acids. Pairwise comparisons among the other opsins show only $44 \%$ or lower sequence similarity, however. Apparently, the different amino-acid structures of the opsins affect their charge distributions in the region of the 11-cis retinal and shift its absorption spectrum to give the different pigments their specific spectral sensitivities.

## The ipRGCs have unique properties and functions

The ipRGC, the third retinal photoreceptor, differs from rods and cones in fundamental ways. First, instead of expressing rhodopsin or cone opsins, ipRGCs use a related but unique light-sensitive protein called melanopsin that is most

## BOX 15-1 Inherited Defects in Color Vision

inherited defects in color vision are relatively common, and many are caused by mutations in visual pigment genes. For example, $8 \%$ of white males and $1 \%$ of white females have some defect in their $L$ or $M$ pigments caused by $X$-linked recessive mutations. A single abnormal pigment can lead to either dichromacy (the absence of one functional pigment) or anomalous trichromacy (a shift in the absorption spectrum of one pigment relative to normal), often with a consequent inability to distinguish certain colors. Jeremy Nathans and colleagues found that men have only one copy of the L pigment gene; but located right next to it on the $X$ chromosome, they may have one to three copies of the $M$ pigment gene. He proposed that homologous recombination could account for the gene duplication, loss of a gene, or production of the hybrid L-M genes that occur in red-green color blindness. Hybrid L-M pigments have spectral properties intermediate between those of the two normal pigments, probably because their opsins possess a combination of the traits of the two normal pigments.

Lack of two of the three functional cone pigments leads to monochromacy. The number of people who have such true color blindness is very small, $<0.001 \%$ of the population. For example, S-cone monochromacy is a rare X-linked disorder in which both $L$ and $M$ photopigments are missing because of mutations on the $X$ chromosome. The $S$ pigment gene is on chromosome 7 .
sensitive in the blue part of the spectrum ( 475 nm; see Fig. 15-14B). Second, ipRGCs depolarize in response to light, and if the stimulus is strong enough, they generate action potentials. Rods and cones hyperpolarize when illuminated and never generate action potentials. Third, to reach threshold, the ipRGCs require very bright light-several orders of magnitude stronger than the threshold for cone responses. Fourth, ipRGCs take seconds to respond, and they quite faithfully maintain their responses even when light levels are sustained for hours.

Most of the molecular components of melanopsinmediated phototransduction in ipRGCs are unknown. However, ipRGCs resemble invertebrate photoreceptors much more than they resemble rods and cones. Melanopsin seems to activate a G protein of the $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{a}}$ family (see Table 3-2), which stimulates PLC to produce $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and diacylglycerol (DAG); this causes TRP channels to open and depolarizes the neuron. When light hits rods and cones it reduces [cGMP] ${ }_{i}$, causing CNG channels to close and hyperpolarizing the photoreceptor (see p. 368). Ironically, although ipRGCs are by definition intrinsically photosensitive they also receive some input from rods and cones via synapses of bipolar cells and amacrine cells.

What are the functions of ipRGCs? With their slow, maintained responses to relatively bright light, they seem well equipped for reporting the levels of ambient daytime illumination. With their very large receptive fields, sparse numbers, and sluggishness, ipRGCs are not well adapted to the imageforming functions we usually think of as "vision"-processes that cones and rods perform so well. In fact, ipRGCs help to mediate a variety of non-image-forming processes that are
reflexive and subconscious. The body maintains circadian rhythms for most physiological processes; some ipRGCs send axons to the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus to ensure that its circadian clock is synchronized with the light-dark cycles of day and night. The ipRGCs mediate the pupillary light reflex by sending axons to the pretectal nuclei (see Fig. 15-8). Activity of ipRGCs inhibits the production of melatonin by the pineal gland. They also provide photic information to some of the brain's sleep-wake regulatory systems.

## VESTIBULAR AND AUDITORY TRANSDUCTION: HAIR CELLS

Balancing on one foot and listening to music both involve sensory systems that have similar transduction mechanisms. Sensation in both the vestibular and auditory systems begins with the inner ear, and both use a highly specialized kind of receptor called the hair cell. Common structure and function often suggest a common origin, and indeed, the organs of mammalian hearing and balance both evolved from the lateral line organs present in all aquatic vertebrates. The lateral line consists of a series of pits or tubes along the flanks of an animal. Within each indentation are clusters of sensory cells that are similar to hair cells. These cells have microvilli-like structures that project into a gelatinous material that in turn is in contact with the water in which the animal swims. The lateral line is exquisitely sensitive to vibrations or pressure changes in the water in many animals, although it is also sensitive to temperature or electrical fields in some species. Reptiles abandoned the lateral line during their evolution, but they retained the hair cellcentered sensory structures of the inner ear that evolved from the lateral line.

The vestibular system generates our sense of balance and the auditory system provides our sense of hearing. Vestibular sensation operates constantly while we are awake and communicates to the brain the head's orientation and changes in the head's motion. Such information is essential for generating muscle contractions that will put our body where we want it to be, reorienting the body when something pushes us aside (vestibulospinal reflexes), and moving our eyes continually so that the visual world stays fixed on our retinas even though our head may be nodding about (vestibuloocular reflexes). (○) N15-4 Vestibular dysfunction can make it impossible to stabilize an image on our moving retinas, and it causes the disconcerting feeling that the world is uncontrollably moving around-vertigo. Walking and standing can be difficult or impossible. With time, compensatory adjustments are made as the brain learns to substitute more visual and proprioceptive cues to help guide smooth and accurate movements.

Auditory sensation is often at the forefront of our conscious experience, unlike vestibular information, which we rarely notice unless something goes wrong. Hearing is an exceptionally versatile process that allows us to detect things in our environment, to precisely identify their nature, to localize them well at a distance, and, through language, to communicate with speed, complexity, nuance, and emotion.

# N15-4 Vestibulo-ocular Reflexes 

## Contributed by Philine Wangemann

Through vestibulospinal reflexes, the vestibular system influences body posture, which is essential for balancing our body, preventing it from falling, and-when falling-lifting our head to prevent it from impact injury. Further, through vestibulo-ocular reflexes, the vestibular system influences movements of the eyes, which stabilize images on our retinas during head movements.

Since visual processing in the retina is relatively slow, it is necessary to stabilize the images of the world on the retina. Stabilizing reflexes, collectively called vestibulo-ocular reflexes, enable you to read this text while shaking your head. Note that it is much more difficult to read while shaking the book! The vestibular system measures head movements and elicits compensatory movements of the eyes (eFig. 15-1). The position of each eye is controlled by three pairs of muscles that control horizontal, vertical and rotational eye movements. Vestibulo-ocular reflexes are linked to all five vestibular organs to enable compensatory eye movements in every direction. Muscles that control horizontal eye movements are linked to the horizontal semicircular canals and the utricle. Muscles that control vertical eye movements are linked to the anterior and posterior semicircular canals and the saccule. Finally, muscles that control rotational eye movements are linked to the anterior and posterior semicircular canals and the utricle. Vestibulo-ocular reflexes can be suppressed during the observation of moving targets-for example, watching a bird or a ball flying by.

During large rotations, for example during spinning, the eye movements required for stabilizing an image on the retina exceed the limits of the orbit. Under these conditions, vestibulo-ocular reflexes elicit fast reset movements of the eyes. Alternations between slow movements of the eyes intended to stabilize images on the retina and fast reset motions are called nystagmus (from the Greek nystagmos [tired or sleepy, like the nodding movement of the head just before falling asleep]). Nystagmus can occur in all directions and is named by the direction of the fast reset phase (e.g., rightward nystagmus). Lesions of the vestibular system, for example in head trauma or stroke, can lead to a spontaneous nystagmus when altered neuronal activity is falsely interpreted as head movements. Nystagmus induced by body rotations or by a caloric test is used clinically to evaluate vestibular function because lesions alter or eliminate nystagmus. The caloric test consists of introducing cold $\left(30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ or warm $\left(40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ water into the external ear canal. Temperature changes induce convective movements of endolymph that are interpreted as head rotations. Comparisons of the caloric responses of the left and right ear can be used to localize lesions.

Figure 15-1 Example of a vestibulo-ocular reflex. A, Head rotation to the left causes endolymph to push and pull on the cupulae of the left and right horizontal canals, respectively. B, Movement of the cupula tilts hair bundles in the ampulla of the left horizontal canal in the stimulatory direction, leading to excitation of afferent dendrites and an increase in the frequency of action potentials. Conversely, movement of the cupula tilts hair bundles in the ampulla of the right horizontal canal in the inhibitory direction, which leads to a cessation of afferent stimulation and a decrease in the frequency of action potentials. C, Head rotations have a linear component that results from centrifugal forces against gravity. Centrifugal forces move the otolith membranes of the left and right macula utricle to the left. Displacements of the otolith membranes causes stimulation and inhibition of afferent activity depending on the orientation of the hair bundles. Note that the simple left head movement is coded by an intricate pattern of increased and decreased neuronal activity. The pattern is analyzed by the vestibular nuclei and used to elicit compensatory movements of the eyes to ensure that images remain stable on the retina during head movements.

## Bending the stereovilli of hair cells along one axis causes cation channels to open or to close

Hair cells are mechanoreceptors that are specialized to detect minuscule movement along one particular axis. The hair cell is an epithelial cell (see pp. 43-45); the hair bundles project from the apical end, whereas synaptic contacts occur at the basal end. Hair cells are somewhat different in the vestibular and auditory systems. In this section, we illustrate concepts mainly with the vestibular hair cell (Fig. 15-15A), which comes in two subtypes. Vestibular type I cells have a bulbous basal area, surrounded by a calyx-shaped afferent nerve terminal (see Fig. 15-15B, left). Vestibular type II hair cells are more cylindrical and have several simple, boutonshaped afferent nerve terminals (see Fig. 15-15B, right). Auditory hair cells also come in two varieties, inner hair cells and outer hair cells (see pp. 378-380). However, all hair cells sense movement in basically the same way.

As part of their hair bundles, vestibular hair cells (see Fig. 15-15B) have one large kinocilium, which is a true cilium with the characteristic $9+2$ pattern of microtubules (see Fig. 2-11C). The role of the kinocilium is unknown. In mammals, auditory hair cells lose their kinocilium with maturity.

Both vestibular and auditory hair cells have 50 to 150 stereovilli, which are filled with actin and are more akin to microvilli. The stereovilli-often called stereocilia, although they lack the typical $9+2$ pattern of true cilia-are 0.2 to
$0.8 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter and are generally 4 to $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in height. These "hairs" are arranged in a neat array. In the vestibular system, the kinocilium stands tallest along one side of the bundle and the stereovilli fall away in height to the opposite side (see Fig. 15-15B). Stereovilli are narrower at their base and insert into the apical membrane of the hair cell, where they make a sort of hinge before connecting to a cuticular plate. Within the bundle, stereovilli are connected one to the next, but they can slide with respect to each other as the bundle is deflected side to side. The ends of the stereovilli are interconnected with very fine strands called tip links, which are visible by electron microscopy.

The epithelium of which the hair cells are a part separates perilymph from endolymph. The perilymph bathes the basolateral side of the hair cells. In composition (i.e., relatively low $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, high $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$), perilymph is similar to CSF. Its voltage is zero-close to that of most other extracellular fluids in the body. The basolateral resting potential of vestibular hair cells and auditory inner hair cells is about -40 mV (see Fig. 15-15B). The endolymph bathing the stereovilli is singular in composition. It has a very high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$ $(150 \mathrm{mM})$ and a very low $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right](1 \mathrm{mM})$, more like cytoplasm than extracellular fluid. It also has a relatively high $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right](30 \mathrm{mM})$. The voltage of the vestibular endolymph is $\sim 0 \mathrm{mV}$ relative to perilymph. Across the apical membrane of vestibular hair cells, the chemical gradient for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is small. However, the electrical gradient is fairly large, $\sim 40 \mathrm{mV}$. Thus,

Figure 15-16 Mechanotransduction in the hair cell. Both panels portray a vestibular hair cell, with an endolymph voltage of 0 mV . A, At rest, a small amount of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$leaks into the cells, driven by the negative membrane potential and high apical $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$. Mechanical deformation of the hair bundle toward the longer stereovilli increases the opening of nonselective cation channels at the tips of the stereovilli, which allows $\mathrm{K}^{+}$influx and depolarizes the cell. In all hair cells except the auditory outer hair cells, the depolarization activates voltage-sensitive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels on the basal membrane, causing release of synaptic vesicles and stimulating the postsynaptic membrane of the accompanying sensory neuron. B, Mechanical deformation of the hair bundle away from the longer stereovilli causes the nonselective cation channels to close, which leads to hyperpolarization.
a substantial force tends to drive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$into the vestibular hair cell across the apical membrane. We will see that the driving force for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$influx is even higher in the auditory system (see p. 378).

The appropriate stimulus for a hair cell is the bending of its hairs, but not just any deflection will do. Bending of the hair bundle toward the longer stereovilli (Fig. 15-16A) excites the cell and causes a depolarizing receptor potential (see pp. 353-354). Bending of the hair bundle away from the longer stereovilli (see Fig. 15-16B) hyperpolarizes the cell.

Only tiny movements are needed. In auditory hair cells, as little as 0.5 nm (which is the diameter of a large atom) gives a detectable response, and the response is saturated at $\sim 150 \mathrm{~nm}$, about the diameter of one stereovillus or 1 degree of angular deflection! In fact, the sensitivity of hair cells is limited only by noise from the brownian motion of surrounding molecules. The cell is also exquisitely selective to direction. If the hairs are bent along the axis 90 degrees to their preferred direction, they are less than one tenth as responsive.

Mechanotransduction in hair cells seems to be accomplished by directly linking the movement of the stereovilli to the gating of apical mechanosensitive cation channels. Electrical measurements, as well as the imaging of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, imply that the transduction channels are located near the tips of the stereovilli. How is channel gating connected to movement of the hairs? The latency of channel opening is extremely short, $<40 \mu \mathrm{~s}$. If one deflects the hairs more rapidly, the channels are activated more quickly. This observation suggests a direct, physical coupling inasmuch as diffusion of a second messenger would take much longer. Corey and Hudspeth have suggested a spring-like molecular linkage between the movement of stereovilli and channel gating. The tip links may be the tethers between stereovilli and the channels, with the channels located at the lower ends of the tip links. Tip links themselves are formed from two types of cadherins, cadherin 23 and protocadherin 15, which form strands of high stiffness. Brief exposure to low$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ solutions destroys the tip links, without otherwise causing obvious harm to the cells, and thereby abolishes transduction.

The mechanosensitive channels at the tips of the stereovilli are nonselective cation channels with relatively large unitary conductances ( 150 to 300 picosiemens, depending on hair cell type), allowing monovalent and some divalent cations, including $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, to pass easily. Each stereovillus has no more than two channels, which makes their identification elusive. Under physiological conditions, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$carries most of the current through the transduction channels. When the cell is at rest-hairs straight up-a small but steady leak of depolarizing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current flows through the cell. This leak allows the hair cell to respond to both positive and negative deflections of its stereovilli. A positive deflection-toward the tallest stereovilli-further opens the apical channels, leading to influx of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and thus depolarization. $\mathrm{K}^{+}$leaves the cell through mechanoinsensitive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels on the basolateral side (see Fig. 15-16A), along a favorable electrochemical gradient. A negative deflection closes the apical channels and thus leads to hyperpolarization (see Fig. 15-16B).

A hair cell is not a neuron. Hair cells do not project axons of their own, and most do not generate action potentials. Instead-in the case of vestibular hair cells and auditory inner hair cells-the membrane near the presynaptic (i.e., basolateral) face of the cell has voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels that are somewhat active at rest but more active during mechanically induced depolarization (i.e., the receptor potential) of the hair cell. The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that enters the hair cell through these channels triggers the graded release of glutamate as well as aspartate in the case of vestibular hair cells. These excitatory transmitters stimulate the postsynaptic terminal of sensory neurons that transmit information to the

Figure 15-17 The ear, cochlea, and semicircular canals. A, This section through the right ear of a human shows the outer, middle, and inner ear. B, The labyrinth consists of an auditory and a vestibular portion. The auditory portion is the cochlea. The vestibular portion includes the two otolithic organs (the utricle and saccule) and the three semicircular canals.
brain. The greater the transmitter release, the greater the rate of action potential firing in the postsynaptic axon.

In mammals, all hair cells-whether part of the vestibular or auditory system-are contained within bilateral sets of interconnected tubes and chambers called, appropriately enough, the membranous labyrinth (Fig. 15-17). The vestibular portion has five sensory structures: two otolithic organs, which detect gravity (i.e., head position) and linear head movements, and three semicircular canals, which detect head rotation. Also contributing to our sense of spatial orientation and motion are proprioceptors (see pp. 383-389) and the visual system (see pp. 359-371). $\Theta$ N15-S The auditory portion of the labyrinth is the spiraling cochlea, which detects rapid vibrations (sound) transmitted to it from the surrounding air.

The ultimate function of each of these sensory structures is to transmit mechanical energy to their hair cells. In each case, transduction occurs in the manner described above. The specificity of the transduction process depends much less on the hair cells than on the structure of the labyrinth organs around them.

## The otolithic organs (saccule and utricle) detect the orientation and linear acceleration of the head

The otolithic organs are a pair of relatively large chambersthe saccule and the utricle-near the center of the labyrinth (see Fig. 15-17B). These otolithic organs as well as the semicircular canals are (1) lined by epithelial cells, (2) filled with endolymph, (3) surrounded by perilymph, and (4) encased in the temporal bone. Within the epithelium, specialized
vestibular dark cells secrete $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and are responsible for the high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$of the endolymph. The mechanism of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion is similar to that by the stria vascularis in the auditory system (see p. 378).

The saccule and utricle each have a sensory epithelium called the macula, which contains the hair cells that lie among a bed of supporting cells. The stereovilli project into the gelatinous otolithic membrane, a mass of mucopolysaccharides that is studded with otoliths or otoconia (Fig. 15-18A, B). Otoconia are crystals of calcium carbonate, 1 to $5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter, that give the otolithic membrane a higher density than the surrounding endolymph. With either a change in the angle of the head or a linear acceleration, the inertia of the otoconia causes the otolithic membrane to move slightly, deflecting the stereovilli.

The macula is vertically oriented (in the sagittal plane) within the saccule and horizontally oriented within the utricle when the head is tilted down by $\sim 25$ degrees, as during walking. Recall that hair cells are depolarized or hyperpolarized when stereovilli bend toward or away from the kinocilium, respectively (see Fig. 15-16). In the saccule, the kinocilia point away from a curving reversal line that divides the macula into two regions (see Fig. 15-18D). In the utricle, the kinocilia point toward the reversal line. The hair cells of the saccule and utricle respond well to changes in head angle and to acceleration of the sort that is experienced as a car or an elevator starts or stops. Of course, the head can tilt or experience acceleration in many directions. Indeed, the orientations of hair cells of the saccule and utricle covers a full range of directions. Any tilt or linear acceleration of the head will enhance the stimulation of some hair cells,

# N15-5 Spatial Orientation 

## Contributed by Philine Wangemann

Proprioceptors in the skin, in tendons and muscles, and in joints provide information about posture, and the visual system provides clues from our surrounding. Although the vestibular system contributes to our conscious perception of motion and body position, vestibular information is mostly processed subconsciously. Through vestibulospinal reflexes, the vestibular system influences body posture, which is essential for balancing our body, preventing it from falling, and, when it falls, lifting our head to prevent it from impact injury. Further, through vestibulo-ocular reflexes, (1) N15-4 the vestibular system influences movements of the eyes, which stabilize images on our retinas during head movements.

## The semicircular canals detect the angular acceleration of the head

Semicircular canals (see Fig. 15-17B) also sense acceleration, but not the linear acceleration that the otolithic organs prefer.

Angular acceleration generated by sudden head rotations is the primary stimulus for the semicircular canals. Shake your head side to side or nod it up and down. Each rotation of your head will excite some of your canals and inhibit others.

The semicircular canals stimulate their hair cells differently than the otolithic organs. In each canal, the hair cells are clustered within a sensory epithelium (the crista ampullaris) that is located in a bulge along the canal called the ampulla (see Fig. 15-18C). The hair bundles-all of which have the same orientation-project into a gelatinous, domeshaped structure called the cupula, which spans the lumen of the ampulla. The cupula contains no otoconia, and its mucopolysaccharides have the same density as the surrounding endolymph. Thus, the cupula is not sensitive to linear acceleration. However, with a sudden rotation of the canal, the endolymph tends to stay behind because of its inertia. (C) N15-4 The endolymph exerts a force on the movable cupula, much like wind on a sail. This force bows the cupula, which bends the hairs and (depending on the direction of rotation) either excites or suppresses the release of transmitter from the hair cells onto the sensory axons of the vestibular nerve. This arrangement makes the semicircular canals very sensitive to angular acceleration of the head. (C) N15-7

## N15-6 Vestibular Innervation

## Contributed by Philine Wangemann

The vestibular system is innervated by the vestibular nerve, which is a branch of CN VIII. The vestibular nerve is comprised of afferent and efferent fibers.

Afferent fibers consist of dendrites of nerve cells from Scarpa's ganglion housed within the temporal bone. Afferent dendrites contact multiple hair cells within small regions of a macula or crista. Integration over several sensory cells increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensory information. Axons of Scarpa's ganglion cells contact the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei in the brainstem. Vestibular nuclei analyze information from the labyrinths on both sides of the head and control oculomotor and postural reflexes.

Efferent innervation of the vestibular labyrinth originates from cell bodies that are located lateral to the facial genu in the brainstem. Bilateral axons to the left and right vestibular system synapse onto afferent calyces of type I hair cells and onto type II vestibular hair cells. Vestibular efferent innervation has been hypothesized to maintain long-term calibration of afferent activity between the two vestibular labyrinths.

## N15-7 Sensitivity of Semicircular Canals to Head Rotation

## Contributed by Barry Connors

If head rotation is maintained at a constant velocity, the friction between the endolymph and the canal walls eventually makes the two move together, so that the bending of the cupula gradually extinguishes during $\sim 15$ seconds. When rotation is then stopped, the inertia of the endolymph causes bending of the cupula in the other direction and thus gives a temporary sensation of counter-rotation.

Each side of the head has three semicircular canals that lie in approximately orthogonal planes. The anterior canal is tilted $\sim 41$ degrees anterolaterally from the sagittal plane, the posterior canal is tilted $\sim 56$ degrees posterolaterally from the sagittal plane, and the lateral canal is tipped $\sim 25$ degrees back from the horizontal plane. Because each canal best senses rotation about a particular axis, the three together give a good representation of all possible angles of head rotation. This complete representation is further ensured because each canal is paired with another on the opposite side of the head. Each member of a pair sits within the same plane and responds to rotation about the same axis. However, whereas rotation excites the hair cells of one canal, it inhibits the canals of its contralateral axis mate. This push-pull arrangement presumably increases the sensitivity of detection.

## The outer and middle ears collect and condition air pressure waves for transduction within the inner ear

Sound is a perceptual phenomenon that is produced by periodic longitudinal waves of low pressure (rarefactions) and high pressure (compressions) that propagate through air at a speed of 330 to $340 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Absolute sound depends on the amplitude of the longitudinal wave, measured in pascals (Pa). Intensities of audible sounds are commonly expressed in decibel sound pressure level ( dB SPL ), which relates the absolute sound intensity $\left(P_{\mathrm{T}}\right)$ to a reference pressure $\left(P_{\text {ref }}\right)$ of $20 \mu \mathrm{~Pa}$, close to the average human threshold at 2000 Hz .

$$
\mathrm{dB} \mathrm{SPL}=10 \times \log _{10} \frac{\left(P_{\mathrm{T}}\right)^{2}}{\left(P_{\text {ref }}\right)^{2}}=20 \times \log _{10} \frac{P_{\mathrm{T}}}{P_{\text {ref }}}
$$

The logarithmic scale compresses the wide extent of sound pressures into a convenient range. An increase of 6 dB SPL corresponds to a doubling of the absolute sound pressure level; an increase of 20 dB SPL corresponds to a 10 -fold increase.

Sound can be a pure tone of a single frequency, measured in hertz $(\mathrm{Hz})$. Sounds produced by musical instruments or the human voice consist of a perceived fundamental frequency (pitch) and overtones. Sound that is noise contains no recognizable periodic elements. (○) N15-8 Pure tones are used clinically for the determination of hearing thresholds (pure-tone audiogram). Humans do not perceive sounds that have the same sound pressure level but different frequencies as equally loud. The psychoacoustic phon scale accounts for these differences in perception. (○) N15-9

Sound waves vary in frequency, amplitude, and direction; our auditory systems are specialized to discriminate all three. We can also interpret the rapid and intricate temporal patterns of sound frequency and amplitude that constitute words and music. Encoding of sound frequency and amplitude begins with mechanisms in the cochlea, followed by further analysis in the CNS. To distinguish the direction of a sound along the horizontal plane, the brain compares signals from the two ears.

All mammalian ears are strikingly similar in structure. The ear is traditionally divided into outer, middle, and inner components (see Fig. 15-17A). We discuss the outer and middle ear here. The inner ear consists of the
membranous labyrinth, with both its vestibular and auditory components.

Outer Ear Proceeding from outside to inside, the most visible part of the ear is the pinna, a skin-covered flap of cartilage, and its small extension, the tragus. Together, they funnel sound waves into the external auditory canal. These structures, which compose the outer ear, focus sound waves on the tympanic membrane. Many animals (e.g., cats) can turn each pinna independently to facilitate hearing without changing head position. The shapes of the pinna and tragus tend to emphasize certain sound frequencies over others, depending on their angle of incidence. The external ear parts in humans are essential for localization of sounds in the vertical plane. Sound enters the auditory canal both directly and after being reflected; the sound that we hear is a combination of the two. Depending on a sound's angle of elevation, it is reflected differently off the pinna and tragus. Thus, we hear a sound coming from above our head slightly differently than a sound coming from straight in front of us.

The external auditory canal is lined with skin and penetrates $\sim 2.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ into the temporal bone, where it ends blindly at the eardrum (or tympanic membrane). Sound causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate, much like the head of a drum.

Middle Ear The air-filled chamber between the tympanic membrane on one side and the oval window on the other is the middle ear (see Fig. 15-17A). The eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx and makes it possible to equalize the air pressure on opposite sides of the tympanic membrane. The eustachian tube can also provide a path for throat infections and epithelial inflammation to invade the middle ear and lead to otitis media. The primary function of the middle ear is to transfer vibrations of the tympanic membrane to the oval window (Fig. 15-19). The key to accomplishing this task is a chain of three delicate bones called ossicles: the malleus (or hammer), incus (anvil), and stapes (stirrup). The ossicles are the smallest bones in the body.

Vibration transfer is not as simple as it might seem because sound starts as a set of pressure waves in the air (within the ear canal) and ends up as pressure waves in a watery cochlear fluid within the inner ear. Air and water have very different acoustic impedances, which is the tendency of each medium to oppose movement brought about by a pressure wave. (○) N15-10 This impedance mismatch means that sound traveling directly from air to water has insufficient pressure to move the dense water molecules. Instead, without some system of compensation, $>97 \%$ of a sound's energy would be reflected when it met a surface of water. The middle ear serves as an impedance-matching device that saves most of the aforementioned energy by two primary methods. First, the tympanic membrane has an area that is $\sim 20$-fold larger than that of the oval window, so a given pressure at the air side (the tympanic membrane) is amplified as it is transferred to the water side (the footplate of the stapes). Second, the malleus and incus act as a lever system, which again amplifies the pressure of the wave. Rather than being reflected, most of the energy is successfully transferred to the liquids of the inner ear.

## N15-9 Phon Scale

## Contributed by Philine Wangemann

Sounds that have identical decibel sound pressure levels (dB SPL) are not perceived as equally loud at all frequencies. The phon scale, which accounts for these differences in perception, has been developed by asking a number of human subjects to adjust the intensities of test tones to be equal in loudness to
reference tones of 1000 Hz (eFig. 15-3). The normal hearing threshold is -4 phon, discomfort is perceived at 110 phon, and the pain threshold is at 130 phon. Industrial noise levels are often given in units of A-weighted decibels, or dB(A). The dB(A) scale is weighted to approximate human loudness perception.

## N15-10 Acoustic Impedance

## Contributed by Barry Connors

Acoustic impedance is defined as the ratio of sound pressure to volume velocity. Air has a low acoustic impedance. Consider what happens when the membrane of a loudspeaker is displaced in air. Because the air is very compressible, the displacement of the loudspeaker membrane does not increase air pressure very much, but it does impart a high volume velocity to the air. On the other hand, the acoustic impedance of water is about 10,000 times higher than that of air because water is highly incompressible and dense. Consider what happens when we submerge a watertight loudspeaker in water. If we were able to displace the
loudspeaker membrane to the same extent just as fast as we did when the loudspeaker was in air, we would find that the resulting pressure wave would be far greater. (The way we set up this thought experiment, the volume velocities would be identical in the two cases.)

In the case of the ear-which takes advantage of (1) the area difference between the tympanic membrane and the oval window, and (2) the lever action of the ossicles-the pressure amplification occurs at the expense of volume velocity, thereby conserving energy.

Figure 15-19 The middle ear. Displacement of the stapes and the oval window moves fluid in the scala vestibuli, causing opposite fluid movement in the scala tympani and thus an opposite displacement of the round window. (Data from Philine Wangemann, Kansas State University.)

Two tiny muscles of the middle ear, the tensor tympani and the stapedius, insert onto the malleus and the stapes, respectively. These muscles exert some control over the stiffness of the ossicular chain, and their contraction serves to dampen the transfer of sound to the inner ear. They are reflexively activated when ambient sound levels become high. These reflexes are probably protective and may be particularly important for suppression of self-produced sounds, such as the roar you produce in your head when you speak or chew.

## The cochlea is a spiral of three parallel, fluid-filled tubes

The auditory portion of the inner ear is mainly the cochlea, a tubular structure that is $\sim 35 \mathrm{~mm}$ long and is coiled 2.5 times into a snail shape about the size of a large pea (Fig. 15-20). Counting its stereovilli, the cochlea has a million moving parts, which makes it the most complex mechanical apparatus in the body.

The cut through the cochlea in the lower left drawing in Figure 15-20 reveals five cross sections of the spiral. We see
![bo125099069a0](bo125099069a0.jpg)

Figure 15-21 $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion into the endolymph by the stria vascularis. (Data from Philine Wangemann, Kansas State University.)
that in each cross section, two membranes divide the cochlea into three fluid-filled compartments. On one side is the compartment called the scala vestibuli (see Fig. 15-20, right side), which begins at its large end near the oval windowwhere vibrations enter the inner ear. Reissner's membrane separates the scala vestibuli from the middle compartment, the scala media. The other boundary of the scala media is the basilar membrane, on which rides the organ of Corti and its hair cells. Below the basilar membrane is the scala tympani, which terminates at its basal or large end at the round window. Both the oval and round windows look into the middle ear (see Fig. 15-19B).

Both the scala vestibuli and scala tympani are lined by a network of fibrocytes and filled with perilymph (see pp. 372-373). Like its counterpart in the vestibular system, this perilymph is akin to CSF (i.e., low $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, high $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$). Along the lengths of scala vestibuli and scala tympani, the two perilymphs communicate through the leaky interstitial fluid spaces between the fibrocytes. At the apex of the cochlea, the two perilymphs communicate through a small opening called the helicotrema. Cochlear perilymph communicates with vestibular perilymph through a wide passage at the base of the scala vestibuli (see Fig. 15-17B), and it communicates with the CSF through the cochlear aqueduct.

The scala media is filled with endolymph. Like its vestibular counterpart-with which it communicates through the ductus reuniens (see Fig. 15-17B)—auditory endolymph is extremely rich in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Unlike vestibular endolymph, which has the same voltage as the perilymph, auditory endolymph has a voltage of $+80 \mathrm{mV}$ relative to the perilymph (see Fig. 15-20, right side). This endocochlear potential, which is the highest transepithelial voltage in the body, is the main driving force for sensory transduction in both inner and outer hair cells. Moreover, loss of the endocochlear potential is a frequent cause of hearing loss. A highly vascularized tissue called the stria vascularis secretes the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$into the scala media, and the resulting $\mathrm{K}^{+}$gradient between endolymph and perilymph generates the strong endocochlear potential.

The stria vascularis is functionally a two-layered epithelium (Fig. 15-21). Marginal cells separate endolymph from a very small intrastrial compartment inside the stria vascularis, and basal cells separate the intrastrial compartment from the interstitial fluid of the spiral ligament, which is contiguous with perilymph. Gap junctions connect one side of the basal cells to intermediate cells and the other side of the basal cells to fibrocytes of the spiral ligament. This architecture is essential for generation of the endocochlear potential.

The fibrocytes are endowed with $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake mechanisms that maintain a high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, in the intermediate cells. The $\mathrm{KCNJ} 10 \mathrm{~K}^{+}$channel of the intermediate cells generates the endocochlear potential. The $\mathrm{K}^{+}$equilibrium potential of these cells is extremely negative because of the combination of their very high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, and the very low $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$of the intrastrial fluid. Finally, the marginal cells support the endocochlear potential by mopping up the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from the intrastrial fluidkeeping the intrastrial $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$very low-and depositing the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ in the endolymph through a $\mathrm{KCNQ} 1 \mathrm{~K}^{+}$channel.

## Inner hair cells transduce sound, whereas the active movements of outer hair cells amplify the signal

The business end of the cochlea is the organ of Corti, (1) N15-11 the portion of the basilar membrane that contains the hair cells. The organ of Corti stretches the length of the basilar membrane and has four rows of hair cells: one row of $\sim 3500$ inner hair cells and three rows with a total of $\sim 16,000$ outer hair cells (Fig. 15-22). In the auditory system, the arrangement of stereovilli is also quite orderly. The hair cells lie within a matrix of supporting cells, with their apical ends facing the endolymph of the scala media (Fig. 15-23A). The stereovilli of inner hair cells (see Fig. 15-23B) are unique in that they float freely in the endolymph. The stereovilli of the outer hair cells (see Fig. 15-23C) project into the gelatinous, collagen-containing tectorial membrane. The tectorial membrane is firmly attached only along one edge, with a sort of hinge, so that it is free to tilt up and down.

How do air pressure waves actually stimulate the auditory hair cells? Movements of the stapes against the oval window create traveling pressure waves within the cochlear fluids. Consider, for example, what happens as sound pressure falls in the outer ear.

Step 1: Stapes moves outward. As a result, the oval window moves outward, causing pressure in the scala vestibuli to decrease. Because the perilymph that fills the scala vestibuli and scala tympani is incompressible and the cochlea is encased in rigid bone, the round window moves inward (see Fig. 15-19B).
Step 2: Scala vestibuli pressure falls below scala tympani pressure.
Step 3: Basilar membrane bows upward. Because Reissner's membrane is very thin and flexible, the low scala vestibuli pressure pulls up the incompressible scala media, which in turn causes the basilar membrane (and the organ of Corti) to bow upward.
Step 4: Organ of Corti shears toward hinge of tectorial membrane. The upward bowing of the basilar membrane creates a shear force between the hair bundle of the outer hair cells and the attached tectorial membrane.
Step 5: Hair bundles of outer hair cells tilt toward their longer stereovilli.
Step 6: Transduction channels open in outer hair cells. Because $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is the major ion, the result is depolarization of the outer hair cells (see Fig. 15-16A)—mechanical to electrical transduction. The transduction-induced changes in membrane potential are called receptor potentials. The molecular mechanisms of these $V_{\mathrm{m}}$

changes (see p. 373) are basically the same as in vestibular hair cells.
Step 7: Depolarization contracts the motor protein prestin. Outer hair cells of mammals express very high levels of prestin (named for the musical notation presto, or fast). The contraction of myriad prestin molecules-each attached to its neighbors-causes the outer hair cell to contract; this phenomenon is unique to outer hair cells and is called electrical to mechanical transduction or electromotility. Conversely, hyperpolarization (during downward movements of the basilar membrane) causes outer hair cells to elongate. Indeed, imposing changes in $V_{m}$ causes cell length to change by as much as $\sim 5 \%$. The change in shape is fast, beginning within $100 \mu \mathrm{~s}$. The mechanical response of the outer hair cell does not depend on ATP, microtubule or actin systems, extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, or changes in cell volume. Prestin is a member of the SLC26 family of anion transporters (see p. 125), although it is not clear whether prestin also functions as an anion transporter.
Step 8: Contraction of outer hair cells accentuates upward movement of the basilar membrane. Conversely, outer hair cell elongation (during downward movements of the basilar membrane) accentuates the downward movement of the basilar membrane. Thus, outer hair cells act as a cochlear amplifier-sensing and then rapidly accentuating movements of the basilar membrane. The electromotility of outer hair cells is a prerequisite for sensitive hearing and, as we will see (see pp. 380-383), the ability to discriminate frequencies sharply. In the absence of prestin, the cochlear amplifier ceases to function and animals become deaf.
Step 9: Endolymph moves beneath the tectorial membrane. The upward movement of the basilar membraneaccentuated by the cochlear amplifier-forces endolymph to flow out from beneath the tectorial membrane, toward its tip.
Step 10: Inner hair cell hair bundles bend toward longer stereovilli. The flow of endolymph now causes the freefloating hair bundles of the inner hair cells to bend.
Step 11: Transduction channels open in inner hair cells. As in the outer hair cells, the result is a depolarization.
Step 12: Depolarization opens voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ rises in the inner hair cells.
Step 13: Synaptic vesicles fuse, releasing glutamate. The neurotransmitter triggers action potentials in afferent neurons, relaying auditory signals to the brainstem. Note that the main response to depolarization is very different in the two types of hair cells. The outer hair cell contracts and thereby amplifies the movement of the basilar membrane. The inner hair cell releases neurotransmitter.

When the stapes reverses direction and moves inward, all of these processes reverse as well. The basilar membrane bows downward. In the outer hair cells, transduction channels close, causing hyperpolarization and cell elongation. The accentuated downward movement of the basilar membrane causes endolymph to move back under the tectorial membrane. In inner hair cells, transduction channels close, causing hyperpolarization and reduced neurotransmitter release.

A fascinating clue to the existence of the cochlear amplifier was the early observation that the ear not only detects sounds, but also generates them! Short click sounds trigger an "echo," a brief vibration of the tympanic membrane that far outlasts the click. A microphone in the auditory canal can detect the echo, which is called an evoked otoacoustic emission. On occasion, damaged ears may produce spontaneous otoacoustic emissions that can even be loud enough to be heard by a nearby listener. N15-12 The source of evoked otoacoustic emissions is the prestin-mediated cochlear amplifier: sounds outside the ear lead to vibrations of the basilar membrane, which trigger active length changes of the outer hair cells, and these in turn accentuate the vibrations of the basilar membrane (step 8). In otoacoustic emission, the system then works in reverse as the basilar membrane causes pressure waves in the cochlear fluids, which vibrate the oval window, ossicles, and tympanic membrane, and finally generates new pressure waves in the air of the auditory canal.

The cochlea receives sensory and motor innervation from the auditory or cochlear nerve, a branch of CN VIII. We discuss the motor innervation below (see p. 382). The cell bodies of the sensory or afferent neurons of the cochlear nerve lie within the spiral ganglion, which corkscrews up around the axis of the cochlea (see Fig. 15-20, lower left). The dendrites of these neurons contact nearby hair cells, whereas the axons project to the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem (see Fig. 16-15). About $95 \%$ of the roughly 30,000 sensory neurons (i.e., type I cells) of each cochlear nerve innervate the relatively few inner hair cells-the true auditory sensory cells. The remaining $5 \%$ of spiral ganglion neurons (i.e., type II cells) innervate the abundant outer hair cells, which are so poorly innervated that they must contribute very little direct information about sound to the brain.

## The frequency sensitivity of auditory hair cells depends on their position along the basilar membrane of the cochlea

The subjective experience of tonal discrimination is called pitch. Young humans can hear sounds with frequencies from $\sim 20$ to $20,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$. (1) N15-13 This range is modest by the standards of most mammals because many hear up to $50,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$, and some, notably whales and bats, can hear sounds with frequencies $>100,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$.

A continuous pure tone (see p. 376) produces a wave that travels along the basilar membrane and has different amplitudes at different points along the base-apex axis (Fig. 15-24A). Increases in sound amplitude cause an increase in the rate of action potentials in auditory nerve axons-rate coding. (1) N15-14 The frequency of the sound determines where along the cochlea the cochlear membranes vibrate most-high frequencies at one end and low at the otherand thus which hair cells are stimulated. This selectivity is the basis for place coding in the auditory system; that is, the frequency selectivity of a hair cell depends mainly on its longitudinal position along the cochlear membranes. The cochlea is essentially a spectral analyzer that evaluates a complex sound according to its pure tonal components, with each pure tone stimulating a specific region of the cochlea.

## N15-12 Otoacoustic Emissions

## Contributed by Philine Wangemann

Amplification by the outer hair cells evokes vibrations of the basilar membrane that travel through the middle ear, set the tympanic membrane in motion, and produce a sound that comes out of the ear canal. Clinically most relevant are transient otoacoustic emissions and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. Transient otoacoustic emissions are sounds that are detected in the ear canal milliseconds after a very brief stimulus. Amplification by the outer hair cells is nonlinear, which means that the cochlea produces and emits distortion products. Distortion products in response to two pure tones at nearby frequencies $\left(f_{1}\right.$ and $\left.f_{2}\right)$ relate to these stimuli by simple math, for example, $2 f_{1}-f_{2}$ or $2 f_{2}-f_{1}$. Transient otoacoustic emissions and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions provide useful clues for the evaluation of outer hair cell function.

## N15-13 Auditory Range

## Contributed by Philine Wangemann

The auditory frequency range of the human ear is well adapted to the perception of speech, which encompasses frequencies between 60 and $12,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$. We can comfortably hear sounds with amplitudes from 0 to 120 dB SPL. Higher sound pressure levels cause pain and destruction of the ear. N15-9. Typical sound pressure levels are 20 dB SPL for whispering, 60 dB SPL for normal conversation, 80 dB SPL for loud traffic, and 120 dB SPL for a nearby train horn.

## N15-14 Rate Coding

## Contributed by Philine Wangemann

Amplitude information is transmitted by rate coding. Rate coding refers to the principle that increases in sound amplitude result in an increase the rate of action potentials. Cooperation between neurons is required to code the full range of sound pressure levels from 0 to 120 dB SPL.

A ENVELOPE OF MAXIMUM WAVE AMPLITUDES
![bo131099069a0](bo131099069a0.jpg)

Figure 15-24 Waves along the basilar membrane of the cochlea. A, As a wave generated by a sound of a single frequency travels along the basilar membrane, its amplitude changes. The green and yellow curves represent a sample wave at two different times. The upper and lower broken lines (i.e., the envelope) encompass all maximum amplitudes of all waves, at all points in time. Thus, a wave can never escape the envelope. The figure exaggerates the amplitudes of the traveling waves $\sim 1$ million-fold. B, For a pure tone of $10,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$, the envelope is confined to a short region of the basilar membrane near the stapes. For pure tones of 4000 Hz and 200 Hz , the widest part of the envelope moves closer to the helicotrema. C, The cochlea narrows in diameter from base to apex, whereas the basilar membrane tapers in the opposite direction.

Using optical methods to study cadaver ears, Georg von Békésy found that sounds of a particular frequency generate relatively localized waves in the basilar membrane and that the envelope of these waves changes position according to the frequency of the sound (see Fig. 15-24B). Low frequencies generate their maximal amplitudes near the apex. As sound frequency increases, the envelope shifts progressively toward the basal end (i.e., near the oval and round windows). For his work, von Békésy (5) N15-15 received the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Two properties of the basilar membrane underlie the low-apical to high-basal gradient of resonance: taper and stiffness (see Fig. 15-24C). If we could unwind the cochlea
and stretch it straight, we would see that it tapers from base to apex. The basilar membrane tapers in the opposite direction-wider at the apex, narrower at the base. More important, the narrow basal end is $\sim 100$-fold stiffer than its wide and floppy apical end. Thus, the basilar membrane resembles a harp. At one end-the base, near the oval and round windows-it has short, taut strings that vibrate at high frequencies. At the other end-the apex-it has longer, looser strings that vibrate at low frequencies.

Although von Békésy's experiments were illuminating, they were also paradoxical. A variety of experimental data suggested that the tuning of living hair cells is considerably sharper than the broad envelopes of von Békésy's traveling

Figure 15-25 Peak movement of the basilar membrane. The graph illustrates the displacement of the basilar membrane in response to a pure tone as a function of distance along the base-to-apex axis. The dashed line indicates the displacement threshold for triggering of an electrical response. (Data from Ashmore JF: Mammalian hearing and the cellular mechanisms of the cochlear amplifier. In Corey DP, Roper SD [eds]: Sensory Transduction. New York, Rockefeller University Press, 1992, pp 396-412.)
waves on the basilar membrane could possibly produce. (C) N15-16 Recordings from primary auditory nerve cells are also very sharp, implying that this tuning must occur within the cochlea, not in the CNS. Some enhancement of tuning comes from the structure of the inner hair cells themselves. Those near the base have shorter, stiffer stereovilli, which makes them resonate to higher frequencies than possible with the longer, floppier stereovilli on cells near the apex.

The blue curve in Figure 15-25 approximates von Békésy's envelope of traveling waves for a passive basilar membrane from cadavers. It is important to note that von Békésy used unnaturally loud sounds. With reasonable sound levels, the maximum passive displacement of the basilar membrane would be slightly more than 0.1 nm . This distance is less than the pore diameter of an ion channel and also less than the threshold ( 0.3 to 0.4 nm ) for an electrical response from a hair cell. However, measurements from the basilar membrane in living animals (the orange curve in Fig. 15-25) by very sensitive methods show that movements of the basilar membrane are much more localized and much larger than predicted by von Békésy. The maximal physiological displacement is $\sim 20$-fold greater than threshold and $\sim 40$-fold greater than that predicted by the passive von Békésy model. Moreover, the physiological displacement decays sharply on either side of the peak, $>100$-fold within $\sim 0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ (recall that the human basilar membrane has a total length of $>30 \mathrm{~mm}$ ).

Both the extremely large physiological excursions of the basilar membrane and the exquisitely sharp tuning of the cochlea depend on the cochlear amplifier (see p. 380). Indeed, selectively damaging outer hair cells-with large doses of certain antibiotics, for example-considerably dulls the sharpness of cochlear tuning and dramatically reduces the amplification.

The brain can control the tuning of hair cells. Axons that arise in the superior olivary complex in the brainstem

## BOX 15-2 Cochlear Implants

The most common cause of human deafness is damage to the hair cells of the cochlea. (C) N15-18 This damage can be caused by genetic factors, a variety of drugs (e.g., some antibiotics, including quinine), chronic exposure to excessively loud sounds, and other types of disease. Even when all hair cells have been destroyed, if the auditory nerve is intact, it is often possible to restore substantial hearing with a cochlear implant.

A cochlear implant (C) N15-19 is essentially an electronic cochlea. Most of the system resides outside the body. The user wears a headpiece with a microphone, which is connected to a small, battery-powered digital speech processor. This processor sends signals to a miniature radio transmitter next to the scalp, which transmits digitally encoded signalsno wires penetrate the skin-to a receiver/decoder that is surgically implanted in the mastoid bone behind the ear. A very thin and flexible set of wires carries the signals through a tiny hole into the basal end of the cochlea, where an array of 8 to 22 electrodes lies adjacent to the auditory nerve endings (where healthy hair cells would normally be) along the cochlea. Each electrode activates a small portion of the auditory nerve axons.

The cochlear implant exploits the tonotopic arrangement of auditory nerve fibers. By stimulating near the base of the cochlea, it is possible to trigger a perception of high-frequency sounds; stimulation toward the apex evokes low-frequency sounds. The efficacy of the implant can be extraordinary. Users require training of a few months or longer, and in many cases, they achieve very good comprehension of spoken speech, even as it comes across on a telephone.

As the technology and safety of cochlear implants have improved, so has their popularity. By 2010, >200,000 people were using cochlear implants worldwide, $\sim 80,000$ of them infants and children. The best candidates for cochlear implants are young children (optimally as young as 1 year) and older children or adults whose deafness was acquired after they learned some speech. Children older than $\sim 7$ years and adults whose deafness preceded any experience with speech generally do not fare as well with cochlear implants. The systems of sensory neurons in the brain, including the auditory system, need to experience normal inputs at a young age to develop properly. When the auditory system is deprived of sounds early in life, it can never develop completely normal function even if sensory inputs are restored during adulthood.
synapse mainly on the outer hair cells and, sparsely, on the afferent axons that innervate the inner hair cells. (C) N15-17 Stimulation of these olivocochlear efferent fibers suppresses the responsiveness of the cochlea to sound and is thought to provide auditory focus by suppressing responsiveness to unwanted sounds-allowing us to hear better in noisy environments (Box 15-2). The main efferent neurotransmitter is acetylcholine ( ACh ), which activates ionotropic ACh receptors (see pp. 206-207)-nonselective cation channels-and triggers an entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activates $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, causing a hyperpolarization-effectively an inhibitory postsynaptic potential-that suppresses the electromotility of outer hair cells and action potentials in afferent dendrites. Thus, the efferent axons allow the brain to control the gain of the inner ear.

## N15-16 Sharpening of Cochlear Tuning

## Contributed by Philine Wangemann

Outer hair cells express the motor protein prestin along the lateral cell wall, which is responsible for electromotility. Transduction-mediated depolarization of outer hair cells during upward movements of the basilar membrane causes prestin to contract; this shortens the hair cell body and increases the upward movement of the basilar membrane (see Fig. 15-23). Conversely, hyperpolarization during downward movements of the basilar membrane expands prestin, elongates the outer hair cells, and enlarges the downward movement of the basilar membrane. This electromotility, which amplifies and sharpens the peak of the sound-induced traveling wave, is a prerequisite for the sensitivity of hearing and the ability to sharply discriminate frequencies (see Fig. 15-25).

## N15-18 Conductive Hearing Loss

## Contributed by Philine Wangemann

Conductive hearing losses are disorders that compromise the conduction of sound through the external ear, tympanic membrane, or middle ear. Pressure differences across the tympanic membrane (eardrum) can rupture it. Accumulations of fluid in the middle ear can lead to conductive hearing losses that are seen particularly often in children with middle ear infections (otitis media). With proper treatment, the hearing loss due to otitis media is usually self-limited. Otosclerosis, which stiffens the ossicular chain, is another common cause of conductive hearing loss.

Treatments for conductive hearing loss encompass a palette of devices including hearing aids and middle ear implants. Hearing aids amplify the sound in the external ear canal. Prosthetic devices can replace the tympanic membrane and the ossicular chain. Middle ear implants are clamped onto the incus and enhance the vibrations of the ossicular chain.

## N15-17 Central Processing of Auditory Patterns

## Contributed by Philine Wangemann

Auditory patterns are analyzed in the medial geniculate and the auditory cortex. Neurons in these areas are often highly specialized and respond only to a specific frequency and intensity pattern. Interpretation of sound elements requires cortical input beyond the auditory cortex.

Central processing is clinically evaluated by auditory brainstem recordings. The coordinated firing of groups of neurons in responses to brief stimuli (clicks or tone pips) produces transient voltage fluctuations that can be detected with surface electrodes. Distinctive voltage fluctuations occur 2 to 12 ms after the stimulus and can be associated with neuronal activity in the auditory pathway including the cochlear nerve, cochlear nucleus, and superior olivary complex.

## SOMATIC SENSORY RECEPTORS, PROPRIOCEPTION, AND PAIN

Somatic sensation is the most widespread and diverse of the body's sensory systems (soma means "body" in Greek). Its receptors are distributed throughout the body instead of being condensed into small and specialized sensory surfaces, as most other sensory systems are arranged. Somatosensory receptors cover the skin, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscles, bones and joints, major internal organs, epithelia, and cardiovascular system. These receptors also vary widely in their specificity. The body has mechanoreceptors to transduce pressure, stretch, vibration, and tissue damage; thermoreceptors to gauge temperature; and chemoreceptors to sense a variety of substances. Somatic sensation (or somesthesia) is usually considered to be a combination of at least four sensory modalities: the senses of touch, temperature, body position (proprioception), and pain (nociception).

## A variety of sensory endings in the skin transduce mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli

To meet a wide array of sensory demands, many kinds of specialized receptors are required. Somatic sensory receptors range from simple bare nerve endings to complex combinations of nerve, muscle, connective tissue, and supporting cells. As we have seen, the other major sensory systems have only one type of sensory receptor or a set of very similar subtypes.

Mechanoreceptors, which are sensitive to physical distortion such as bending or stretching, account for many of the somatic sensory receptors. They exist throughout our bodies and monitor the following: physical contact with the skin, blood pressure in the heart and vessels, stretching of the gut and bladder, and pressure on the teeth. The transduction site of these mechanoreceptors is one or more unmyelinated axon branches. Our progress in understanding the molecular nature of mechanosensory transduction has been relatively slow. Similar to the transduction process in hair cells, that in cutaneous mechanoreceptive nerve endings probably involves the gating of ion channels. Some of these channels belong to the TRP superfamily (see Table 6-2, family No. 5).

Thermoreceptors respond best to changes in temperature, whereas chemoreceptors are sensitive to various kinds of chemical alterations. In the next three sections, we discuss mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, and chemoreceptors that are located in the skin.

## Mechanoreceptors in the skin provide sensitivity to specific stimuli such as vibration and steady pressure

Skin protects us from our environment by preventing evaporation of body fluids, invasion by microbes, abrasion, and damage from sunlight. However, skin also provides our most direct contact with the world. The two major types of mammalian skin are hairy and glabrous. Glabrous skin (or hairless skin) is found on the palms of our hands and fingertips and on the soles of our feet and pads of our toes (Fig. 15-26A).

A GLABROUS (HAIRLESS) SKIN
![bo133099069a0](bo133099069a0.jpg)

Figure 15-26 Sensors in the skin. (Data from Mendelson M, Loewenstein WR: Mechanisms of receptor adaptation. Science 144:554-555, 1964.)

Hairy skin makes up most of the rest and differs widely in its hairiness. Both types of skin have an outer layer, the epidermis, and an inner layer, the dermis, and sensory receptors innervate both. The receptors in the skin are sensitive to many types of stimuli and respond when the skin is vibrated, pressed, pricked, or stroked, or when its hairs are bent or pulled. These are quite different kinds of mechanical energy, yet we can feel them all and easily tell them apart. Skin also has exquisite sensitivity; for example, we can reliably feel a dot only 0.006 mm high and 0.04 mm across when it is stroked across a fingertip. The standard Braille dot is 167 times higher!

The sensory endings in the skin take many shapes, and most of them are named after the 19th-century European histologists who observed them and made them popular. The largest and best-studied mechanoreceptor is Pacini's corpuscle, which is up to 2 mm long and almost 1 mm in diameter (see Fig. 15-26B). Pacini's corpuscle is located in the subcutaneous tissue of both glabrous and hairy skin. It has an ovoid capsule with 20 to 70 onion-like, concentric layers of connective tissue and a nerve terminal in the middle. The capsule is responsible for the rapidly adapting response of the Pacini's corpuscle. When the capsule is compressed, energy is transferred to the nerve terminal, its membrane is deformed, and mechanosensitive channels open. Current flowing through the channels generates a depolarizing receptor potential that, if large enough, causes the axon to fire an action potential (see Fig. 15-26B, left panel). However, the capsule layers are slick, with viscous fluid between them. If the stimulus pressure is maintained, the layers slip past one another and transfer the stimulus energy away so that the underlying axon terminal is no longer deformed and the receptor potential dissipates (see Fig. 15-26B, right panel). When pressure is released, the events reverse themselves and the terminal is depolarized again. In this way, the non-neural covering of Pacini's corpuscle specializes the corpuscle for sensing of vibrations and makes it almost unresponsive to steady pressure. Pacini's corpuscle is most sensitive to vibrations of 200 to 300 Hz , and its threshold increases dramatically below 50 Hz and above $\sim 500 \mathrm{~Hz}$. The sensation evoked by stimulation of Pacini's corpuscle is a poorly localized humming feeling.

Werner Loewenstein and colleagues in the 1960s showed the importance of the Pacini corpuscle's capsule to its frequency sensitivity. With fine microdissection, they were able to strip away the capsule from single corpuscles. They found that the resultant naked nerve terminal is much less sensitive to vibrating stimuli and much more sensitive to steady pressure. Clearly, the capsule modifies the sensitivity of the bare mechanoreceptive axon. The encapsulated Pacini corpuscle is an example of a rapidly adapting sensor, whereas the decapsulated nerve ending behaves like a slowly adapting sensor.

Several other types of encapsulated mechanoreceptors are located in the dermis, but none has been studied as well as Pacini's corpuscle. Meissner's corpuscles (see Fig. 15-26A) are located in the ridges of glabrous skin and are about one tenth the size of Pacini's corpuscles. They are rapidly adapting, although less so than Pacini's corpuscles. Ruffini's corpuscles resemble diminutive Pacini's corpuscles and, like Pacini's corpuscles, occur in the subcutaneous tissue of both
hairy and glabrous skin. Their preferred stimuli might be called "fluttering" vibrations. As relatively slowly adapting receptors, they respond best to low frequencies. Merkel's disks are also slowly adapting receptors made from a flattened, non-neural epithelial cell that synapses on a nerve terminal. They lie at the border of the dermis and epidermis of glabrous skin. It is not clear whether it is the nerve terminal or epithelial cell that is mechanosensitive. The nerve terminals of Krause's end bulbs appear knotted. They innervate the border areas of dry skin and mucous membranes (e.g., around the lips and external genitalia) and are probably rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors.

The receptive fields of different types of skin receptors vary greatly in size. Pacini's corpuscles have extremely broad receptive fields (Fig. 15-27A), whereas those of Meissner's corpuscles (see Fig. 15-27B) and Merkel's disks are very small. The last two seem to be responsible for the ability of the fingertips to make very fine tactile discriminations. Small receptive fields are an important factor in achieving high spatial resolution. Resolution varies widely, a fact easily demonstrated by measuring the skin's two-point discrimination. Bend a paper clip into a U shape. Vary the distance between the tips and test how easily you can distinguish the touch of one tip versus two on your palm, your fingertips, your lips, your back, and your foot. To avoid bias, a colleague-rather than you-should apply the stimulus. Compare the results with standardized data (see Fig. 15-27C).

The identities of somatosensory transduction molecules remain elusive. A variety of TRP channel subtypes transduce mechanical stimuli in invertebrate species (e.g., Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans). In mammals, rapidly adapting ion channels are associated with receptors for light touch, and several of the TRPC channels appear to be involved in sensitivity to light touch in mice. A non-TRP protein named Piezo2 is associated with rapidly adapting mechanosensory currents in mouse sensory neurons, and knocking down the expression of Piezo2 expression causes deficits in touch. Other mechanosensory channels are expressed in some sensory neurons, including TRPA1 and TRPV4, two-pore potassium channels (KCNKs), and degenerin/epithelial sodium channels (especially ASIC1 to ASIC3 and their accessory proteins), but their roles in mammalian mechanosensation are still controversial.

One reason it is difficult to identify mechanosensory channels is that they often need to be associated with other cellular components in order to be sensitive to mechanical stimuli. The mechanisms by which mechanical force is transferred from cells and their membranes to mechanosensitive channels are unclear. Ion channels may be physically coupled to either extracellular structures (e.g., collagen fibers) or cytoskeletal components (e.g., actin, microtubules) that transfer energy from deformation of the cell to the gating mechanism of the channel. Mechanically gated ion channels of sensory neurons, including those requiring Piezo2, depend on the actin cytoskeleton. Some channels may be sensitive to stress, sheer, or curvature of the lipid bilayer itself and require no other types of anchoring proteins. Other channels may respond to mechanically triggered second messengers such as DAG (acting directly on the channel) or $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ (acting indirectly via an $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ receptor).

Figure 15-27 Receptive fields and spatial discrimination of skin mechanoreceptors. A, Each of the two black dots indicates an area of maximal sensitivity of a single Pacini corpuscle. Each blue-green area is the receptive field of a corpuscle (i.e., the corpuscle responds when stimulus strength increases sufficiently anywhere within the area). B, Each dot represents the entire receptive field of a single Meissner corpuscle. Note that the fields are much smaller than in A. C, The horizontal bars represent the minimum distance at which two points can be perceived as distinct at various locations over the body. Spatial discrimination depends on both receptor density and receptive-field size. (A and B, Data from Vallbo AB, Johansson RS: Properties of cutaneous mechanoreceptors in the human hand related to touch sensation. Hum Neurobiol 3:3-14, 1984; C, data from Weinstein S: Intensive and extensive aspects of tactile sensitivity as a function of body part, sex and laterality. In Kenshalo DR [ed]: The Skin Senses. Springfield, IL, Charles C Thomas, 1968.)

Two things determine the sensitivity of spatial discrimination in an area of skin. The first is the size of the receptors' receptive fields-if they are small, the two tips of your paper clip are more likely to stimulate different sets of receptors. The second parameter that determines spatial discrimination is the density of the receptors in the skin. Indeed, two-point discrimination of the fingertips is better than that of the palm, even though their receptive fields are the same size. The key to finer discrimination in the fingertips is their higher density of receptors. Crowding more receptors into each square millimeter of fingertip has a second advantage: because the CNS receives more information per stimulus, it has a better chance of detecting very small stimuli.

Although we rarely think about it, hair is a sensitive part of our somatic sensory system. For some animals, hairs are a major sensory system. Rodents whisk long facial vibrissae (hairs) and feel the texture, distance, and shape of their local environment. Hairs grow from follicles embedded in the skin, and each follicle is richly innervated by free
mechanoreceptive nerve endings that either wrap around it or run parallel to it. Bending of the hair causes deformation of the follicle and surrounding tissue, which stretches, bends, or flattens the nerve endings and increases or decreases their firing frequency. Various mechanoreceptors innervate hair follicles, and they may be either slowly or rapidly adapting.

## Separate thermoreceptors detect warmth and cold

Neurons are sensitive to changes in temperature, as are all of life's chemical reactions. Neuronal temperature sensitivity has two consequences: first, neurons can measure temperature; but second, to work properly, most neural circuits need to be kept at a relatively stable temperature. Neurons of the mammalian CNS are especially vulnerable to temperature changes. Whereas skin tissue temperatures can range from $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ without harm or discomfort, brain temperature must be near $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to avoid serious dysfunction. The body has complex systems to control brain (i.e., body core)

temperature tightly (see pp. 1198-1201). Even though all neurons are sensitive to temperature, not all neurons are thermoreceptors. Because of specific membrane mechanisms, some neurons are extremely sensitive to temperature and seem to be adapted to the job of sensing it. Although many temperature-sensitive neurons are present in the skin, they are also clustered in the hypothalamus and the spinal cord (see pp. 1198-1199). The hypothalamic temperature sensors, like their cutaneous counterparts, are important for regulation of the physiological responses that maintain stable body temperature.

Perceptions of temperature apparently reflect warmth and cold receptors located in the skin. Thermoreceptors, like mechanoreceptors, are not spread uniformly across the skin. When you map the skin's sensitivity to temperature with a small cold or warm probe, you find spots $\sim 1 \mathrm{~mm}$ across that are especially sensitive to either warmth or cold, but not to both. In addition, some areas of skin in between are relatively insensitive. The spatial dissociation of the hot and cold maps shows that they are separate submodalities, with separate receptors to encode each. Recordings from single sensory fibers have confirmed this conclusion. The responses of both warmth and cold thermoreceptors adapt during long stimuli, as many sensory receptors commonly do. Most cutaneous thermoreceptors are probably free nerve endings, without obvious specialization. Their axons are small, either unmyelinated $C$ fibers or the smallest-diameter myelinated $A \delta$ fibers (see Table 12-1).

We can perceive changes in our average skin temperature of as little as $0.01^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Within the skin are separate types of thermoreceptors that are sensitive to a range of relatively hot or cold temperatures. Figure 15-28A shows how the steady discharge rate of both types of receptors varies with temperature. Warmth receptors begin firing above $\sim 30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and increase their firing rate until $44^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $46^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, beyond which the rate falls off steeply and a sensation of pain begins, presumably mediated by nociceptive endings (see the next section). Cold receptors have a much broader temperature response. They are relatively quiet at skin temperatures of $\sim 40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, but their steady discharge rate increases as the temperature falls to $24^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Further decreases in temperature cause the steady discharge rate of the cold receptors to decrease until the temperature falls to $\sim 10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Below that temperature, firing ceases and cold becomes an effective local anesthetic.

In addition to the tonic response just described (i.e., the steady discharge rate), cold receptors also have a phasic response that enables them to report changes in temperature. As shown in Figure 15-28B, when the temperature suddenly shifts from $20.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $15.2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (both points are to the left of the peak in Fig. 15-28A), the firing rate transiently increases (i.e., the phasic response). However, the new steady-state level is lower, as suggested by the left pair of points in Figure 15-28A. When the temperature suddenly shifts from $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $31.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (both points are to the right of the peak in Fig. 15-28A), the firing rate transiently increases, and the new steady-state level is higher, as suggested by the right pair of points in Figure 15-28A.

The transduction of relatively warm temperatures is carried out by several types of TRPV channels (specifically TRPV1 to TRPV4—see Table 6-2, family No. 5) expressed in

Figure 15-28 Temperature sensitivity of cutaneous thermoreceptors. A, The curves represent the mean steady firing rates of neurons from warmth receptors and cold receptors. B, These data from two experiments on cold receptors show the effects of cooling steps of similar magnitude but starting from different temperatures $\left(20.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right.$ and $\left.35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. In both instances, the transient (phasic) responses are the same: an increase in the firing rate. When the starting temperature is $20.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the final firing rate is less than the initial one. However, when the initial temperature is $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the final rate is greater than the initial one. (Data from Somjen GG: Sensory Coding in the Mammalian Nervous System. New York, Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1972.)
thermoreceptors. TRPV1 is a vanilloid receptor-it is activated by the vanilloid class of compounds that includes capsaicin, the pungent ingredient that gives spicy foods their burning quality. Aptly enough, chili peppers taste "hot" because they activate some of the same ion channels that heat itself activates! TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels have painfully high temperature thresholds $\left(\sim 43^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right.$ and $\left.\sim 50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, respectively) and thus help mediate the noxious aspects of thermoreception (see p. 387). Other TRPV channels (TRPV3 and TRPV4) are activated at more moderate temperatures and presumably provide our sensations of warmth.

Yet another TRP channel, TRPM8, mediates sensations of moderate cold. TRPM8 channels begin to open at temperatures below $\sim 27^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and are maximally activated at $8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. In a remarkable analogy to the hot-sensitive TRPV1 channel (the capsaicin receptor), the cool-sensitive TRPM8 channel is a menthol receptor. Menthol evokes sensations of cold because it activates the same ion channel that is opened by cold temperatures.

## Nociceptors are specialized sensory endings that transduce painful stimuli

Physical energy that is informative at low and moderate levels can be destructive at higher intensity. Sensations of pain motivate us to avoid such situations. Nociceptors are the receptors mediating acutely painful feelings to warn us that body tissue is being damaged or is at risk of being damaged (as the Latin roots imply: nocere [to hurt] + recipere [to receive]). The pain-sensing system is entirely separate from the other modalities we have discussed; it has its own peripheral receptors and a complex, dispersed, chemically unique set of central circuits. Nociceptors are free nerve endings, widely distributed throughout the body. They innervate the skin, bone, muscle, most internal organs, blood vessels, and heart. Ironically, nociceptors are generally absent from the brain substance itself, although they are in the meninges.

Nociceptors vary in their selectivity. Mechanical nociceptors, some of which are quite selective, respond to strong pressure-in particular, pressure from sharp objects. A subset of nociceptors expresses Mas-related G proteincoupled receptor D (MrgprD); genetic ablation of just these neurons makes mice insensitive to noxious mechanical stimuli without affecting their responses to painful heat or cold. TRPA1 channels are involved in some forms of painrelated mechanosensation, and they may transduce stimuli that trigger pain originating from viscera such as the colon and bladder.

Thermal nociceptors signal either burning heat (above $\sim 45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, when tissues begin to be destroyed) or unhealthy cold; the heat-sensitive nociceptive neurons express the TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels, whereas the cold-sensitive nociceptors express TRPA1 and TRPM8 channels. A uniquely cold-resistant $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel, Nav1.8, allows cold-sensitive nociceptors to continue firing action potentials even at temperatures low enough to silence other neurons.

Chemical nociceptors, which are mechanically insensitive, respond to a variety of agents, including $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, extremes of pH , neuroactive substances such as histamine and bradykinin from the body itself, and various irritants from the environment. Some chemosensitive nociceptors may express TRP channels that respond to, among other things, plant-derived irritants such as capsaicin (TRPV1), menthol (TRPM8), and the pungent derivatives of mustard and garlic (TRPA1).

Finally, polymodal nociceptors are single nerve endings that are sensitive to combinations of mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. Nociceptive axons include both fast A $\delta$ fibers and slow, unmyelinated C fibers. A $\delta$ axons mediate sensations of sharp, intense pain; C fibers elicit more persistent feelings of dull, burning pain. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel Nav1.7 has a particularly interesting relationship to pain. Patients with loss-of-function mutations of Nav1.7 are insensitive to noxious stimuli and experience repeated injuries because they lack protective reflexes. Several gain-of-function Nav1.7 mutations cause channel hyperexcitability and syndromes of intense chronic pain.

Sensations of pain can be modulated in a variety of ways. Skin, joints, or muscles that have been damaged or inflamed are unusually sensitive to further stimuli. This phenomenon
![bo137099069a0](bo137099069a0.jpg)

Figure 15-29 Hyperalgesia of inflammation.
is called hyperalgesia, and it can be manifested as a reduced threshold for pain, an increase in perceived intensity of painful stimuli, or spontaneous pain. Primary hyperalgesia occurs within the area of damaged tissue, but within $\sim 20$ minutes after an injury, tissues surrounding a damaged area may become supersensitive by a process called secondary hyperalgesia. Hyperalgesia seems to involve processes near peripheral receptors (Fig. 15-29) as well as mechanisms in the CNS.

Damaged skin releases a variety of chemical substances from its many cell types, blood cells, and nerve endings. These substances-sometimes called the inflammatory soup—include neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate, serotonin, adenosine, ATP), peptides (e.g., substance P, bradykinin), various lipids (e.g., prostaglandins, endocannabinoids), proteases, neurotrophins, cytokines, and chemokines, $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{H}^{+}$, and others; they trigger the set of local responses that we know as inflammation. As a result, blood vessels become more leaky and cause tissue swelling (or edema) and redness (see Box 20-1). Nearby mast cells release the chemical histamine, which directly excites nociceptors.

By a mechanism called the axon reflex, action potentials can propagate along nociceptive axons from the site of an injury into side branches of the same axon that innervate neighboring regions of skin. The spreading axon branches of the nociceptors themselves may release substances that sensitize nociceptive terminals and make them responsive to

previously nonpainful stimuli. Such "silent" nociceptors among our small $A \delta$ and $C$ fibers are normally unresponsive to stimuli-even destructive ones. Only after sensitization do they become responsive to mechanical or chemical stimuli and contribute greatly to hyperalgesia. For example, the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF)-part of the inflammatory soup-triggers strong hypersensitivity to heat and mechanical stimuli by modulating TRPV1 channels. Activation of TRPA1 and ASICs are also important in hyperalgesia. The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- $\alpha$ ) potentiates the inflammatory response directly and enhances release of substances that sensitize nociceptors. Drugs that interfere with neurotrophin and cytokine actions can be effective treatments for the pain of inflammatory diseases.

The cognitive sensations of pain are under remarkably potent control by the brain, more so than other sensory system. In some cases, nociceptors may fire wildly, although perceptions of pain are absent; on the other hand, pain may be crippling although nociceptors are silent. Chronic activation of nociceptors can lead to central sensitization, a chronic enhancement of central pain-processing circuits. Prolonged activity in nociceptive axons and their spinal cord synapses causes increased glutamate release, strong activation of AMPA ( $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)- and NMDA ( $N$-methyl-D-aspartate)-type glutamate receptors, and eventually a form of long-term potentiation (see pp. 329-337).

Nonpainful sensory input and neural activity from various nuclei within the brain can modify pain. For example, pain evoked by activity in nociceptors ( $A \delta$ and $C$ fibers) can be reduced by simultaneous activity in low-threshold mechanoreceptors ( $A \alpha$ and $A \beta$ fibers). This phenomenon is a familiar experience-some of the discomfort of a burn, cut, or bruise can be relieved by gentle massage or rubbing (stimulating mechanoreceptors) around the injured area. In 1965, Melzack and Wall proposed that this phenomenon involves a circuit in the spinal cord that can "gate" the transmission of nociceptive information to the brain; control of the gate could be provided by other sensory information (e.g., tactile stimulation) or by descending control from the brain itself. Gate-like regulation of pain may arise from the modulation of gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated and glycine-mediated inhibitory circuits in the spinal cord.

A second mechanism for modifying the sensation of pain involves the relatively small peptides called endorphins. In the 1970s, it was discovered that a class of drugs called opioids (including morphine, heroin, and codeine) act by binding tightly and specifically to opioid receptors in the brain and, furthermore, that the brain itself manufactures "endogenous morphine-like substances," collectively called endorphins (see p. 315).

## Muscle spindles sense changes in the length of skeletal muscle fibers, whereas Golgi tendon organs gauge the muscle's force

The somatic sensory receptors described thus far provide information about the external environment. However, the body also needs detailed information about itself to know where each of its parts is in space, whether it is moving, and if so, in which direction and how fast. Proprioception
provides this sense of self and serves two main purposes. First, knowledge of the positions of our limbs as they move helps us judge the identity of external objects. It is much easier to recognize an object if you can actively palpate it than if it is placed passively into your hand so that your skin is stimulated but you are not allowed to personally guide your fingers around it. Second, proprioceptive information is essential for accurately guiding many movements, especially while they are being learned.

Skeletal muscles, which mediate voluntary movement, have two mechanosensitive proprioceptors: the muscle spindles (or stretch receptors) and Golgi tendon organs (Fig. 15-30). Muscle spindles measure the length and rate of stretch of the muscles, whereas the Golgi tendon organs gauge the force generated by a muscle by measuring the tension in its tendon. Together, they provide a full description of the dynamic state of each muscle. The different sensitivities of the spindle and the tendon organ are due partly to their structures but also to their placement: spindles are located in modified muscle fibers called intrafusal muscle fibers, which are aligned in parallel with the "ordinary" forcegenerating or extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers. On the other hand, Golgi tendon organs are aligned in series with the extrafusal fibers.

The Golgi tendon organ consists of bare nerve endings of group Ib axons (see Table 12-1). These endings intimately invest an encapsulated collagen matrix and usually sit at the junction between skeletal muscle fibers and the tendon. When tension develops in the muscle as a result of either passive stretch or active contraction, the collagen fibers tend to squeeze and distort the mechanosensitive nerve endings, triggering them to fire action potentials.

The mammalian muscle spindle is a complex of modified skeletal muscle fibers (intrafusal fibers) combined with both afferent and efferent innervation. The spindle does not contribute significant force generation to the muscle but serves a purely sensory function. A simplified summary of the muscle spindle is that it contains two kinds of intrafusal muscle fibers (bag and chain), with two kinds of sensory endings entwined about them (the primary and secondary endings). The different viscoelastic properties of the muscle fibers make them differentially sensitive to the consequences of muscle stretch. Because the primary sensory endings of group Ia axons coil around and strongly innervate individual bag muscle fibers (in addition to chain fibers), they are very sensitive to the dynamics of muscle length (i.e., changes in its length). The secondary sensory endings of group II axons mainly innervate the chain fibers and most accurately transduce the static length of the muscle; in other words, they are slowly adapting receptors. The discharge rate of afferent neurons increases when the whole muscle-and therefore the spindle-is stretched. ENaC and ASIC2 channels may contribute to the stretch sensitivity of the sensory nerve terminals in muscle spindles.

What is the function of the motor innervation of the muscle spindle? Consider what happens when the $\alpha$ motor neurons stimulate the force-generating extrafusal fibers and the muscle contracts. The spindle, connected in parallel to the extrafusal fibers, quickly tends to go slack, which makes it insensitive to further changes in length. To avoid this situation and to continue to maintain control over the sensitivity

![bo138099069a0](bo138099069a0.jpg)

Figure 15-30 Golgi tendon organ and muscle spindle fibers. A muscle contains two kinds of muscle fibers, extrafusal fibers (ordinary muscle fibers that cause contraction) and intrafusal fibers (aligned in parallel with the extrafusal fibers). Some of the extrafusal fibers have Golgi tendon organs located in series between the end of the muscle fiber and the macroscopic tendon. The intrafusal fibers contain muscle spindles, which receive both afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) innervation. The spindle (inset) contains both bag fibers, with nuclei bunched together, and chain fibers, with nuclei in a row.
of the spindle, $\gamma$ motor neurons cause the intrafusal muscle fibers to contract in parallel with the extrafusal fibers. This ability of the spindle's intrafusal fibers to change their length as necessary greatly increases the range of lengths over which the spindle can work. It also means that the sensory responses of the spindle depend not only on the length of the whole muscle in which the spindle sits but also on the contractile state of its own intrafusal muscle fibers. Presumably, the ambiguity in this code is sorted out centrally by circuits that simultaneously keep track of the spindle's sensory output and the activity of its motor nerve supply.

In addition to the muscle receptors, various mechanoreceptors are found in the connective tissues of joints, especially within the capsules and ligaments. Many resemble Ruffini, Golgi, and Pacini end organs; others are free nerve endings. They respond to changes in the angle, direction, and velocity of movement in a joint. Most are rapidly adapting,
which means that sensory information about a moving joint is rich. Nerves encoding the resting position of a joint are few. We are nevertheless quite good at judging the position of a joint, even with our eyes closed. It seems that information from joint receptors is combined with that from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, and probably from cutaneous receptors as well, to estimate joint angle. Removal of one source of information can be compensated by use of the other sources. When an arthritic hip is replaced with a steel and plastic one, patients are still able to tell the angle between their thigh and their pelvis, even though all hip joint mechanoreceptors are long gone.

# CIRCUITS OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM 

Barry W. Connors

## ELEMENTS OF NEURAL CIRCUITS

## Neural circuits process sensory information, generate motor output, and create spontaneous activity

A neuron never works alone. Even in the most primitive nervous systems, all neurons participate in synaptically interconnected networks called circuits. In some hydrozoans (small jellyfish), the major neurons lack specialization and are multifunctional. They serve simultaneously as photodetectors, pattern generators for swimming rhythms, and motor neurons. Groups of these cells are repetitively interconnected by two-way electrical synapses into simple ringlike arrangements, and these networks coordinate the rhythmic contraction of the animal's muscles during swimming. This simple neural network also has the flexibility to command defensive changes in swimming patterns when a shadow passes over the animal. Thus, neuronal circuits have profound advantages over unconnected neurons.

In more complex animals, each neuron within a circuit may have very specialized properties. By the interconnection of various specialized neurons, even a simple neuronal circuit may accomplish astonishingly intricate functions. Some neural circuits may be primarily sensory (e.g., the retina) or motor (e.g., the ventral horns of the spinal cord). Many circuits combine features of both, with some neurons dedicated to providing and processing sensory input, others to commanding motor output, and many neurons (perhaps most) doing both. Neural circuits may also generate their own intrinsic signals, with no need for any sensory or central input to activate them. The brain does more than just respond reflexively to sensory input, as a moment's introspection will amply demonstrate. Some neural functions-such as walking, running, breathing, chewing, talking, and piano playing-require precise timing, with coordination of rhythmic temporal patterns across hundreds of outputs. These basic rhythms may be generated by neurons and neural circuits called pacemakers because of their clock-like capabilities. The patterns and rhythms generated by a pacemaking circuit can always be modulated-stopped, started, or altered-by input from sensory or central pathways. Neuronal circuits that produce rhythmic motor output are sometimes called central pattern generators; we discuss these in a section below.

This chapter introduces the basic principles of neural circuits in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). We
describe a few examples of specific systems in detail to illuminate general principles as well as the diversity of neural solutions to life's complex problems. However, this topic is enormous, and we have necessarily been selective and somewhat arbitrary in our presentation.

## Nervous systems have several levels of organization

The function of a nervous system is to generate adaptive behaviors. Because different species face unique problems, we expect brains to differ in their organization and mechanisms. Nevertheless, certain principles apply to most nervous systems. It is useful to define various levels of organization.
O N16-1 We can analyze a complex behavior-reading the words on this page-in a simple way, with progressively finer detail, down to the level of ion channels, receptors, messengers, and the genes that control them. At the highest level, we recognize neural subsystems and pathways (see Chapter 10), which in this case include the sensory input from the retina (see Chapter 15) leading to the visual cortex, the central processing regions that make sense of the visual information and the motor systems that coordinate movement of the eyes and head. Many of these systems can be recognized in the gross anatomy of the brain. Each specific brain region is extensively interconnected with other regions that serve different primary functions. These regions tend to have profuse connections that send information in both directions along most sensory/central motor pathways. The advantages of this complexity are obvious; while you are interpreting visual information, for example, it can be very useful simultaneously to analyze sound and to know where your eyes are pointing and how your body is oriented.

The systems of the brain can be more deeply understood by studying their organization at the cellular level. Within a local brain region, the arrangement of neurons and their synaptic connections is called a local circuit. A local circuit typically includes the set of inputs, outputs, and all the interconnected neurons that are essential to functions of the local brain region. Many regions of the brain are composed of a large number of stereotyped local circuits, almost modular in their interchangeability, that are themselves interconnected. Within the local circuits are finer arrangements of neurons and synapses sometimes called microcircuits. Microcircuits may be repeated numerous times within a local circuit, and they determine the transformations of

# N16-1 Levels of Organization of the Nervous System 

![bo139099069a0](bo139099069a0.jpg)

information that occur within small areas of dendrites and the collection of synapses impinging on them. At even finer resolution, neural systems can be understood by the properties of their individual neurons (see Chapter 12), synapses, membranes, molecules (e.g., neurotransmitters and neuromodulators), and ions as well as the genes that encode and control the system's molecular biology.

## Most local circuits have three elements: input axons, interneurons, and projection (output) neurons

One of the most fascinating things about the nervous system is the wide array of different local circuits that have evolved for different behavioral functions. Despite this diversity, we can define a few general components of local circuits, which we illustrate with two examples from very different parts of the CNS: the ventral horn of the spinal cord and the cerebral neocortex. Some of the functions of these circuits are described in subsequent sections; here, we examine their cellular anatomy.

All local circuits have some form of input, which is usually a set of axons that originate elsewhere and terminate in synapses within the local circuit. A major input to the spinal cord (Fig. 16-1) is the afferent sensory axons in the dorsal roots. These axons carry information from somatic sensory receptors in the skin, connective tissue, and muscles (see pp. 383-389). However, local circuits in the spinal cord also have many other sources of input, including descending input from the brain and input from the spinal cord itself, both from the contralateral side and from spinal segments
above and below. Input to the local circuits of the neocortex (Fig. 16-2) is also easily identified; relay neurons of the thalamus send axons into particular layers of the cortex to bring a range of information about sensation, motor systems, and the body's internal state. By far, the most numerous type of input to the local circuits of the neocortex comes from the neocortex itself-from adjacent local circuits, distant areas of cortex, and the contralateral hemisphere. These two systems illustrate a basic principle: local circuits receive multiple types of input.

Output is usually achieved with a subset of cells known as projection neurons, or principal neurons, which send axons to one or more targets. The most obvious spinal output comes from the $\alpha$ motor neurons, which send their axons out through the ventral roots to innervate skeletal muscle fibers. Output axons from the neocortex come mainly from large pyramidal neurons in layer V, which innervate many targets in the brainstem, spinal cord, and other structures, as well as from neurons in layer VI, which make their synapses back onto the cells of the thalamus. However, as was true with inputs, most local circuits have multiple types of outputs. Thus, spinal neurons innervate other regions of the spinal cord and the brain, whereas neocortical circuits make most of their connections to other neocortical circuits.

Rare, indeed, is the neural circuit that has only input and output cells. Local processing is achieved by additional neurons whose axonal connections remain within the local circuit. These neurons are usually called interneurons or intrinsic neurons. Interneurons vary widely in structure and function, and a single local circuit may have many different

Figure 16-1 Local circuits in the spinal cord. A basic local circuit in the spinal cord consists of inputs (e.g., sensory axons of the dorsal roots), interneurons (both excitatory and inhibitory), and output neurons (e.g., $\alpha$ motor neurons that send their axons through the ventral roots).

types. Both the spinal cord and neocortex have excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, interneurons that make very specific or widely divergent connections, and interneurons that either receive direct contact from input axons or process only information from other interneurons. In many parts of the brain, interneurons vastly outnumber output neurons. To take an extreme example, the cerebellum has $\sim 10^{11}$ granule cells-a type of excitatory interneuron-which is more than the total number of all other types of neurons in the entire brain!

The "principles" of local circuits outlined here have many variations. For example, a projection cell may have some of the characteristics of an interneuron, as when a branch of its output axon stays within the local circuit and makes synaptic connections. This branching is the case for the projection cells of both the neocortex (pyramidal cells) and the spinal cord ( $\alpha$ motor neurons). On the other hand, some interneurons may entirely lack an axon and instead make their local synaptic connections through very short neurites or even dendrites. In some rare cases, the source of the input to a local circuit may not be purely synaptic but chemical (as with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-sensitive neurons in the medulla; see p. 714) or physical (as with temperature-sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus; see p. 1199). Although the main neurons within a generic local circuit are wired in series (see Figs. 16-1 and 16-2), local circuits, often in massive numbers, operate in parallel with one another. Furthermore, these circuits usually
demonstrate a tremendous amount of crosstalk; information from each circuit is shared mutually, and each circuit continually influences neighboring circuits. Indeed, one of the things that makes analysis of local neural circuits so exceptionally difficult is that they operate in highly interactive, simultaneously interdependent, and expansive networks.

## SIMPLE, STEREOTYPED RESPONSES: SPINAL REFLEX CIRCUITS

## Passive stretching of a skeletal muscle causes a reflexive contraction of that same muscle and relaxation of the antagonist muscles

Reflexes are among the most basic of neural functions and involve some of the simplest neuronal circuits. A motor reflex is a rapid, stereotyped motor response to a particular sensory stimulus. Although the existence of reflexes had been long appreciated, it was Sir Charles Sherrington (O) N10-2 who, beginning in the 1890s, first defined the anatomical and physiological bases for some simple spinal reflexes. So meticulous were Sherrington's observations of reflexes and their timing that they offered him compelling evidence for the existence of synapses, a term he originated.

Reflexes are essential, if rudimentary, elements of behavior. Because of their relative simplicity, more than a century of research has taught us a lot about their biological basis. However, reflexes are also important for understanding more complex behaviors. Intricate behaviors may sometimes be built up from sequences of simple reflexive responses. In addition, neural circuits that generate reflexes almost always mediate or participate in much more complex behaviors. Here we examine a relatively well understood example of reflex-mediating circuitry.

The CNS commands the body to move about by activating motor neurons, which excite skeletal muscles (Sherrington called motor neurons the final common path). Motor neurons receive synaptic input from many sources within the brain and spinal cord, and the output of large numbers of motor neurons must be closely coordinated to achieve even uncomplicated actions such as walking. However, in some circumstances, motor neurons can be commanded directly by a simple sensory stimulus-muscle stretch-with only the minimum of neural machinery intervening between the sensory cell and motor neuron: one synapse. Understanding of this simplest of reflexes, the stretch reflex or myotatic reflex, first requires knowledge of some anatomy.

Each motor neuron, with its soma in the spinal cord or brainstem, commands a group of skeletal muscle cells; a single motor neuron and the muscle cells that it synapses on are collectively called a motor unit (see pp. 241-242). Each muscle cell belongs to only one motor unit. The size of motor units varies dramatically and depends on muscle function. In small muscles that generate finely controlled movements, such as the extraocular muscles of the eye, motor units tend to be small and may contain just a few muscle fibers. Large muscles that generate strong forces, such as the gastrocnemius muscle of the leg, tend to have large motor units with as many as several thousand muscle fibers. There are two types of motor neurons (see Table 12-1): $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ motor neurons

![bo142099069a0](bo142099069a0.jpg)

Figure 16-3 Knee-jerk (myotatic) reflex. Tapping the patellar tendon with a percussion hammer elicits a reflexive knee jerk caused by contraction of the quadriceps muscle: the stretch reflex. Stretching the tendon pulls on the muscle spindle, exciting the primary sensory afferents, which convey their information via group la axons. These axons make monosynaptic connections to the $\alpha$ motor neurons that innervate the quadriceps, resulting in the contraction of this muscle. The la axons also excite inhibitory interneurons that reciprocally innervate the motor neurons of the antagonist muscle of the quadriceps (the flexor), resulting in relaxation of the semitendinosus muscle. Thus, the reflex relaxation of the antagonistic muscle is polysynaptic.
innervate the main force-generating muscle fibers (the extrafusal fibers), whereas $\gamma$ motor neurons innervate only the fibers of the muscle spindles. The group of all motor neurons innervating a single muscle is called a motor neuron pool (see pp. 241-242).

When a skeletal muscle is abruptly stretched, a rapid, reflexive contraction of the same muscle often occurs. The contraction increases muscle tension and opposes the stretch. This stretch reflex is particularly strong in physiological extensor muscles-those that resist gravity-and it is sometimes called the myotatic reflex because it is specific for the same muscle that is stretched. The most familiar version is the knee jerk, which is elicited by a light tap on the patellar tendon. The tap deflects the tendon, which then pulls on and briefly stretches the quadriceps femoris muscle. A reflexive contraction of the quadriceps quickly follows (Fig. 16-3). Stretch reflexes are also easily demonstrated in the biceps of the arm and the muscles that close the jaw. Sherrington
showed that the stretch reflex depends on the nervous system and requires sensory feedback from the muscle. For example, cutting the dorsal (sensory) roots to the lumbar spinal cord abolishes the stretch reflex in the quadriceps muscle. The basic circuit for the stretch reflex begins with the primary sensory axons from the muscle spindles (see p. 388) in the muscle itself. Increasing the length of the muscle stimulates the spindle afferents, particularly the large group Ia axons from the primary sensory endings. In the spinal cord, these group Ia sensory axons terminate monosynaptically onto the $\alpha$ motor neurons that innervate the same (i.e., the homonymous) muscle from which the group Ia axons originated. Thus, stretching a muscle causes rapid feedback excitation of the same muscle through the minimum possible circuit: one sensory neuron, one central synapse, and one motor neuron (Box 16-1).

Monosynaptic connections account for much of the rapid component of the stretch reflex, but they are only the

## BOX 16-1 Motor System Injury

The motor control systems, because of their extended anatomy, are especially susceptible to damage from trauma or disease. The nature of a patient's motor deficits often allows the neurologist to diagnose the site of neural damage with great accuracy. When injury occurs to lower parts of the motor system, such as motor neurons or their axons, deficits may be very localized. If the motor nerve to a muscle is damaged, that muscle may develop paresis (weakness) or complete paralysis (loss of motor function). When motor axons cannot trigger contractions, there can be no reflexes (areflexia). Normal muscles are slightly contracted even at rest-they have some tone. If their motor nerves are transected, muscles become flaccid (atonia) and eventually develop profound atrophy (loss of muscle mass) because of the absence of trophic influences from the nerves.

Motor neurons normally receive strong excitatory influences from the upper parts of the motor system, including regions of the spinal cord, the brainstem, and the cerebral cortex. When upper regions of the motor system are injured by stroke, trauma, or demyelinating disease, for example, the signs and symptoms are distinctly different from those caused by lower damage. Complete transection of the spinal cord leads to profound paralysis below the level of the lesion. This is called paraplegia when only both legs are selectively affected, hemiplegia when one side of the body is affected, and quadriplegia when the legs, trunk, and arms are involved. For a few days after an acute injury, there is also areflexia and reduced muscle tone (hypotonia), a condition called spinal shock. The muscles are limp and cannot be controlled by the brain or by the remaining circuits of the spinal cord. Spinal shock is temporary; after days to months, it is replaced by both an exaggerated muscle tone (hypertonia) and heightened stretch reflexes (hyperreflexia) with related signs-this combination is called spasticity. The biological mechanisms of spasticity are poorly understood, although the hypertonia is the consequence of tonically overactive stretch reflex circuitry, driven by spinal neurons that have become chronically hyperexcitable.
beginning of the story. At the same time the stretched muscle is being stimulated to contract, parallel circuits are inhibiting the $\alpha$ motor neurons of its antagonist muscles (i.e., those muscles that move a joint in the opposite direction). Thus, as the knee-jerk reflex causes contraction of the quadriceps muscle, it simultaneously causes relaxation of its antagonists, including the semitendinosus muscle (see Fig. 16-3). To achieve inhibition, branches of the group Ia sensory axons excite specific interneurons that inhibit the $\alpha$ motor neurons of the antagonists. This reciprocal innervation increases the effectiveness of the stretch reflex by minimizing the antagonistic forces of the antagonist muscles.

## Force applied to the Golgi tendon organ regulates muscle contractile strength

Skeletal muscle contains another mechanosensory transducer in addition to the stretch receptor: the Golgi tendon organ (see p. 388). Tendon organs are aligned in series with the muscle; they are exquisitely sensitive to the tension
within a tendon and thus respond to the force generated by the muscle rather than to muscle length. Tendon organs may respond during passive muscle stretch, but they are stimulated particularly well during active contractions of a muscle. The group Ib sensory axons of the tendon organs excite both excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within the spinal cord (Fig. 16-4). In some cases, this interneuron circuitry inhibits the muscle in which tension has increased and excites the antagonistic muscle; therefore, activity in the tendon organs can yield effects that are almost the opposite of the stretch reflex. Under other circumstances, particularly during rapid movements such as locomotion, sensory input from Golgi tendon organs actually excites the motor neurons activating the same muscle. The reflex effects of Golgi tendon organ activity vary because the interneurons receiving input from Ib axons also receive input from other sensory endings in the muscle and skin, and from axons descending from the brain. In general, reflexes mediated by the Golgi tendon organs serve to control the force within muscles and the stability of particular joints.

## Noxious stimuli can evoke complex reflexive movements

Sensations from the skin and connective tissue can also evoke strong spinal reflexes. Imagine walking on a beach and stepping on a sharp piece of shell. Your response is swift and coordinated and does not require thoughtful reflection: you rapidly withdraw the wounded foot by activating the leg flexors and inhibiting the extensors. To keep from falling, you also extend your opposite leg by activating its extensors and inhibiting its flexors (Fig. 16-5). This response is an example of a flexion-withdrawal reflex. The original stimulus for the reflex came from fast pain afferent neurons in the skin, primarily the group $\mathrm{A} \delta$ axons.

This bilateral flexor reflex response is coordinated by sets of inhibitory and excitatory interneurons within the spinal gray matter. Note that this coordination requires circuitry not only on the side of the cord ipsilateral to the wounded side but also on the contralateral side. That is, while you withdraw the foot that hurts, you must also extend the opposite leg to support your body weight. Flexor reflexes can be activated by most of the various sensory afferents that detect noxious stimuli. Motor output spreads widely up and down the spinal cord, as it must to orchestrate so much of the body's musculature into an effective response. A remarkable feature of flexor reflexes is their specificity. Touching a hot surface, for example, elicits reflexive withdrawal of the hand in the direction opposite the side of the stimulus, and the strength of the reflex is related to the intensity of the stimulus. Unlike simple stretch reflexes, flexor reflexes coordinate the movement of entire limbs and even pairs of limbs. Such coordination requires precise and widespread wiring of the spinal interneurons.

## Spinal reflexes are strongly influenced by control centers within the brain

Axons descend from numerous centers within the brainstem and the cerebral cortex and synapse primarily on the spinal interneurons, with some direct input to the motor neurons.

![bo143099069a0](bo143099069a0.jpg)

Figure 16-4 Golgi tendon organ reflex. Contraction of the quadriceps muscle can elicit a reflexive relaxation of this muscle and contraction of the antagonistic semitendinosus muscle. Contraction of the muscle pulls on the tendon; this squeezes and excites the sensory endings of the Golgi tendon organ, which convey their information via group lb axons. These axons synapse on both inhibitory and excitatory interneurons in the spinal cord. The inhibitory interneurons innervate $\alpha$ motor neurons to the quadriceps, relaxing this muscle. The excitatory interneurons innervate $\alpha$ motor neurons to the antagonistic semitendinosus muscle, contracting it. Thus, both limbs of the reflex are polysynaptic.

This descending control is essential for all conscious (and much unconscious) command of movement, a topic beyond the scope of this chapter. Less obvious is that the descending pathways can alter the strength of reflexes. For example, to heighten an anxious patient's stretch reflexes, a neurologist will sometimes ask the patient to perform the Jendrassik maneuver. The patient clasps his or her hands together and pulls; while the patient is distracted with that task, the examiner tests the stretch reflexes of the leg. Another example of the brain's modulation of a stretch reflex occurs when you catch a falling ball. If a ball were to fall unexpectedly from the sky and hit your outstretched hand, the force applied to your arm would cause a rapid stretch reflex-contraction in the stretched muscles and reciprocal inhibition in the antagonist muscles. The result would be that your hand would slap the ball back up into the air. However, if you anticipate catching the falling ball, for a short period around the time of impact (about $\pm 60 \mathrm{~ms}$ ), both your stretched muscles and the antagonist muscles contract! This maneuver stiffens your arm just when you need to squeeze that ball to avoid dropping it. Stretch reflexes of the leg also vary dramatically during each step as we walk, thereby facilitating movement of the legs.

Like stretch reflexes, flexor reflexes can also be strongly affected by descending pathways. With mental effort,
painful stimuli can be tolerated and withdrawal reflexes suppressed. On the other hand, anticipation of a painful stimulus may heighten the vigor of a withdrawal reflex when the stimulus actually arrives. Most of the brain's influence on spinal circuitry is achieved by control of the many spinal interneurons.

Spinal reflexes are frequently studied in isolation from one another, and textbooks often describe them this way. However, under realistic conditions, many reflex systems operate simultaneously, and motor output from the spinal cord depends on interactions among them as well as on the state of controlling influences descending from the brain. It is now well accepted that reflexes do not simply correct for external perturbations of the body; in addition, they play a key role in the control of all movements.

The neurons involved in reflexes are the same neurons that generate other behaviors. Think again of the flexor response to the sharp shell-the pricked foot is withdrawn while the opposite leg extends. Now imagine that a crab pinches that opposite foot-you respond with the opposite pattern of withdrawal and extension. Repeat this a few times, crabs pinching you left and right, and you have achieved the basic pattern necessary for walking! Indeed, rhythmic locomotor patterns use components of these same spinal reflex circuits, as discussed next.

![bo144099069a0](bo144099069a0.jpg)

Figure 16-5 Flexion-withdrawal reflex. A painful stimulus to the right foot elicits a reflexive flexion of the right knee and an extension of the left knee. The noxious stimulus activates nociceptor afferents, which convey their information via group A8 axons. These axons synapse on both inhibitory and excitatory interneurons. The inhibitory interneurons that project to the right side of the spinal cord innervate $\alpha$ motor neurons to the quadriceps and relax this muscle. The excitatory interneurons that project to the right side of the spinal cord innervate $\alpha$ motor neurons to the antagonistic semitendinosus muscle and contract it. The net effect is a coordinated flexion of the right knee. Similarly, the inhibitory interneurons that project to the left side of the spinal cord innervate $\alpha$ motor neurons to the left semitendinosus muscle and relax this muscle. The excitatory interneurons that project to the left side of the spinal cord innervate $\alpha$ motor neurons to the left quadriceps and contract it. The net effect is a coordinated extension of the left knee.

## RHYTHMIC ACTIVITY: CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS

## Central pattern generators in the spinal cord can create a complex motor program even without sensory feedback

A common feature of motor control is the motor program, a set of structured muscle commands that are determined by the nervous system before a movement begins and that can be sent to the muscles with the appropriate timing so that a sequence of movements occurs without any need for sensory feedback. The best evidence for the existence of motor programs is that the brain or spinal cord can command a variety of voluntary and automatic movements, such as walking and breathing (see pp. 706-709), even in the complete absence
of sensory feedback from the periphery. The existence of motor programs certainly does not mean that sensory information is unimportant; on the contrary, motor behavior without sensory feedback is always different from that with normal feedback. The neural circuits responsible for various motor programs have been defined in a wide range of species. Although the details vary endlessly, certain broad principles emerge, even when vertebrates and invertebrates are compared. Here we focus on central pattern generators, wellstudied circuits that underlie many of the rhythmic motor activities that are central to animal behavior.

Rhythmic behavior includes walking, running, swimming, breathing, chewing, certain eye movements, shivering, and even scratching. The central pattern generators driving each of these activities share certain basic properties. At their core is a set of cyclic, coordinated timing signals that are

![bo145099069a0](bo145099069a0.jpg)

Figure 16-6 Rhythmic patterns during locomotion. A, The experimental tracings are electromyograms (EMGs)—extracellular recordings of the electrical activity of muscles—from the extensor and flexor muscles of the left hind limb of a walking cat. The pink bars indicate that the foot is lifted; the purple bars indicate that the foot is planted. B, The walk, trot, pace, and gallop not only represent different patterns and frequencies of planting and lifting for a single leg but also different patterns of coordination among the legs. LF, left front; LH, left hind; RF, right front; RH, right hind. (Data from Pearson K: The control of walking. Sci Am 2:72-86, 1976.)
generated by a cluster of interconnected neurons. These basic signals are used to command as many as several hundred muscles, each precisely contracting or relaxing during a particular phase of the cycle; for example, with each walking step, the knee must first be flexed and then extended. Figure 16-6A shows how the extensor and flexor muscles of the left hind limb of a cat contract rhythmically-and out of phase with one another-while the animal walks. Rhythms must also be coordinated with other rhythms; for humans to walk, one leg must move forward while the other thrusts backward, then vice versa, and the arms must swing in time with the legs, but with the opposite phase. For four-footed animals, the rhythms are even more complicated and must be able to accommodate changes in gait (see Fig. 16-6B). For coordination to be achieved among the various limbs, sets of central pattern generators must be interconnected. The motor patterns must also have great flexibility so that they can be altered on a moment's notice-consider the adjustments necessary when one foot strikes an obstacle while walking or the changing motor patterns necessary to go from walking, to trotting, to running, to jumping. Finally, reliable methods must be available for regulating the speed of the patterns and for turning them on and off.

The central pattern generators for some rhythmic functions, such as breathing, are in the brainstem (see p. 706). Surprisingly, those responsible for locomotion reside in the spinal cord itself. Even with the spinal cord transected so that the lumbar segments are isolated from all higher centers, cats on a treadmill can generate well-coordinated stepping
movements. Furthermore, stimulation of sensory afferents or descending tracts can induce the spinal pattern generators in four-footed animals to switch rapidly from walking, to trotting, to galloping patterns by altering not only the frequency of motor commands but also their pattern and coordination. During walking and trotting and pacing, the hind legs alternate their movements, but during galloping, they both flex and extend simultaneously (compare the different leg patterns in Fig. 16-6B). Grillner and colleagues showed that each limb has at least one central pattern generator. If one leg is prevented from stepping, the other continues stepping normally. Under most circumstances, the various spinal pattern generators are coupled to one another, although the nature of the coupling must change to explain, for example, the switch from trotting to galloping patterns.

## Pacemaker cells and synaptic interconnections both contribute to central pattern generation

How do neural circuits generate rhythmic patterns of activity? There is no single answer, and different circuits use different mechanisms. The simplest pattern generators are single neurons whose membrane characteristics endow them with pacemaker properties that are analogous to those of cardiac muscle cells (see p. 489) and smooth muscle cells (see p. 244). Even when experimentally isolated from other neurons, pacemaker neurons may be able to generate rhythmic activity by relying only on their intrinsic membrane conductances (see Fig. 12-4). It is easy to imagine how

![bo146099069a0](bo146099069a0.jpg)

Figure 16-7 Half-center model for alternating rhythm generation in flexor and extensor motor neurons. Stimulating the upper excitatory interneuron has two effects. First, the stimulated excitatory interneuron excites the motor neuron to the flexor muscle. Second, the stimulated excitatory interneuron excites an inhibitory interneuron, which inhibits the lower pathway. Stimulating the lower excitatory interneuron has the opposite effects. Thus, when one motor neuron is active, the opposite one is inhibited.
intrinsic pacemaker neurons might act as the primary rhythmic driving force for sets of motor neurons that in turn command cyclic behavior. Among vertebrates, however, pacemaker neurons may contribute to some central pattern generators, but they do not appear to be solely responsible for generating rhythms. Instead, pacemakers are embedded within interconnected circuits, and it is the combination of intrinsic pacemaker properties and synaptic interconnections that generates rhythms.

Neural circuits without pacemaker neurons can also generate rhythmic output. In 1911, T. Graham Brown proposed a pattern-generating circuit for locomotion. The essence of Brown's half-center model is a set of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons arranged to inhibit one another reciprocally (Fig. 16-7). The half-centers are the two halves of the circuit, each commanding one of a pair of antagonist muscles. For the circuit to work, a tonic (i.e., nonrhythmic) drive must be applied to the excitatory interneurons; this drive could come from axons originating outside the circuit (e.g., from neurons in the brain) or from the intrinsic excitability of the neurons themselves. Furthermore, some built-in mechanism must limit the duration of the inhibitory activity so that excitability can cyclically switch from one half-center to the other. Note that feedback from the muscles is not needed for the rhythms to proceed indefinitely. In fact, studies of $>50$ vertebrate and invertebrate motor circuits have confirmed that rhythm generation can continue in the absence of sensory information.

## Central pattern generators in the spinal cord take advantage of sensory feedback, interconnections among spinal segments, and interactions with brainstem control centers

The half-center model can produce rhythmic, alternating neural activity, but it is clearly too simplistic to account for most features of locomotor pattern generation. Analysis of vertebrate pattern generators is a daunting task, made difficult by the complexity of the circuits and the behaviors they control. In one of the most detailed investigations, Grillner and colleagues studied a simple model of vertebrate locomotion circuits: the spinal cord of the sea lamprey. Lampreys
are among the simplest fish, and they swim with undulating motions of their body by using precisely coordinated waves of contractions of body muscles. At each spinal segment, muscle activity alternates-one side contracts as the other relaxes. As in mammals, the rhythmic pattern is generated within the spinal cord, and neurons in the brainstem control the initiation and speed of the patterns. The basic patterngenerating circuit for the lamprey spinal cord is repeated in each of the animal's 100 or so spinal segments.

The lamprey pattern-generating circuit improves on the half-center model in three ways. The first is sensory feedback. The lamprey has two kinds of stretch receptor neurons in the lateral margin of the spinal cord itself. These neurons sense stretching of the cord and body, which occurs as the animal bends during swimming. One type of stretch receptor excites the pattern generator interneurons on that same side and facilitates contraction, whereas the other type inhibits the pattern generator on the contralateral side and suppresses contraction. Because stretching occurs on the side of the cord that is currently relaxed, the effect of both stretch receptors is to terminate activity on the contracted side of the body and to initiate contraction on the relaxed side.

The second improvement of the lamprey circuit over the half-center model is the interconnection of spinal segments, which ensures the smooth progression of contractions down the length of the body, so that swimming can be efficient. Specifically, each segment must command its muscles to contract slightly later than the one anterior to it, with a lag of $\sim 1 \%$ of a full activity cycle for normal forward swimming. Under some circumstances, the animal can also reverse the sequence of intersegment coordination to allow it to swim backward!

A third improvement over the half-center model is the reciprocal communication between the lamprey spinal pattern generators and control centers in the brainstem. Not only does the brainstem use numerous pathways and transmitters to modulate the generators, but the spinal generators also inform the brainstem of their activity.

The features outlined for swimming lampreys are relevant to walking cats and humans. All use spinal pattern generators to produce rhythms. All use sensory feedback to modulate locomotor rhythms (in mammals, feedback from muscle,

joint, and cutaneous receptors is all-important). All coordinate the spinal pattern generators across segments, and all maintain reciprocal communication between spinal generators and brainstem control centers.

## SPATIAL REPRESENTATIONS: SENSORY AND MOTOR MAPS IN THE BRAIN

We have already seen that the spinal cord can receive sensory input, integrate it, and produce motor output that is totally independent of the brain. The brain also receives this sensory information and uses it to control the motor activity of the spinal reflexes and central pattern generators. How does the brain organize this sensory input and motor output? In many cases, it organizes these functions spatially with neural maps.

In everyday life, we use maps to represent spatial locations. You may use endless ways to construct a map, depending on which features of an area you want to highlight and what sort of transformation you make as you take measurements from the source (the thing being mapped) and place them on the target (the map). Maps of the earth may emphasize topography, the road system, political boundaries, distributions of air temperature and wind direction, population density, or vegetation. A map is a model of a part of the world-and a very limited model at that. The brain also builds maps, most of which represent very selected aspects of our sensory information about the environment or the motor systems controlling our body. These maps can represent spatial qualities of various sensory modalities (e.g., a place in the visual field) or nonspatial qualities (e.g., smell).

## The nervous system contains maps of sensory and motor information

Almost all sensory receptors are laid out in planar sheets. In some cases, these receptor sheets are straightforward spatial maps of the sensory environment that they encode. For example, the somatic sensory receptors of the skin literally form a map of the body surface. Similarly, a tiny version of the visual scene is projected onto the mosaic of retinal photoreceptors. The topographies of other sensory receptor sheets represent qualities other than spatial features of the sensory stimuli. For example, the position of a hair cell along the basilar membrane in the cochlea determines the range of sound frequencies to which it will respond. Thus, the sheet of hair cells is a frequency map of sound rather than a map of the location of sounds in space. Olfactory and taste receptors also do not encode stimulus position; instead, because the receptor specificity varies topographically, the receptor sheets may be chemical maps of the types of stimuli. The most interesting thing about sensory receptor maps is that they often project onto many different regions of the CNS. In fact, each sensory surface may be mapped and remapped many times within the brain, the characteristics of each map being unique. In some cases, the brain constructs maps of stimulus features even when these features are not mapped at the level of the receptors themselves. Sound localization is a good example of this property (see the next section). Some neural maps may also combine the features of other neural
maps, for example, overlaying visual information with auditory information.

## The cerebral cortex has multiple visuotopic maps

Some of the best examples of brain maps are those of the visual fields. Figure 16-8A shows the basic anatomical pathway extending from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and on to the primary visual cortex (area V1). Note that area V1 actually maps the visual thalamus, which in turn maps the retina, the first visuotopic map in the brain. Thus, the V1 map is sometimes referred to as a retinotopic map. Figure 16-8B shows how the visual fields are mapped onto cortical area V1. The first thing to notice is that the left half of the visual field is represented on the right cortex and the upper half of the visual field is represented on the lower portions of the cortex. This orientation is strictly determined by the system's anatomy. For example, all the retinal axons from the left-most halves of both eyes (which are stimulated by light from the right visual hemifield) project to the left half of the brain. Compare the red and blue pathways in Figure 16-8A. During development, each axon must therefore make an unerring decision about which side of the brain to innervate when it reaches the optic chiasm!

The second thing to notice is that scaling of the visual fields onto the visual cortex-often called the magnification factor-is not constant. In particular, the central region of the visual fields-the fovea-is greatly magnified on the cortical surface. Behavioral importance ultimately determines mapping in the brain. Primates require vision of particularly high resolution in the center of their gaze; photoreceptors and ganglion cells are thus packed as densely as possible into the central retinal region (see p. 363). About half of the primary visual cortex is devoted to input from the relatively small fovea and the retinal area just surrounding it.

Understanding a visual scene requires us to analyze many of its features simultaneously. An object may have shape, color, motion, location, and context, and the brain can usually organize these features to present a seamless interpretation, or image. The details of this process are only now being worked out, but it appears that the task is accomplished with the help of numerous visual areas within the cerebral cortex. Studies of monkey cortex by a variety of electrophysiological and anatomical methods have identified $>25$ areas that are mainly visual in function, most of which are in the vicinity of area V1. According to recent estimates, humans devote almost half of their neocortex primarily to the processing of visual information. Several features of a visual scene, such as motion, form, and color, are processed in parallel and, to some extent, in separate stages of processing. The neural mechanisms by which these separate features are somehow melded into one image or concept of an object remain unknown, but they depend on strong and reciprocal interconnections between the visual maps in various areas of the brain.

The apparently simple topography of a sensory map looks much more complex and discontinuous when it is examined in detail. Many cortical areas can be described as maps on maps. Such an arrangement is especially striking in the visual system. For example, within area V1 of Old World monkeys and humans, the visuotopic maps of the two eyes remain

Figure 16-8 Visual fields and visual maps. A, The right sides of both retinas (which sense the left visual hemifield) project to the right lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), which in turn projects to the right primary visual cortex (area V1). B, The upper parts of the visual fields project to lower parts of the contralateral visual cortex, and vice versa. Although the fovea represents only a small part of the visual field, its representation is greatly magnified in the primary visual cortex, which reflects the large number of retinal ganglion cells that are devoted to the fovea.
segregated. In layer IV of the primary visual cortex, this segregation is accomplished by having visual input derived from the left eye alternate every 0.25 to 0.5 mm with visual input from the right. Thus, two sets of information, one from the left eye and one from the right eye, remain separated but adjacent. Viewed edge on, these left-right alternations look like columns (Fig. 16-9A); hence their name: ocular dominance columns, which were identified by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, who shared half of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (c) N16-2 Viewed from the surface of the brain, this alternating left-right array of inputs looks like bands or zebra stripes (see Fig. 16-9B).

Superimposed on the zebra-stripe ocular dominance pattern in layer IV of the primary visual cortex, but quite distinct from these zebra stripes, layers II and III have structures called blobs. These blobs are visible when the cortex is stained for the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase. Viewed edge on, these blobs look like round pegs (see Fig. 16-9). Viewed from the surface of the brain (see Fig. 16-9), the blobs appear as a polka-dot pattern of small dots that are $\sim 0.2 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter.

Adjacent to the primary visual cortex (V1) is the secondary visual cortex (V2), which has, instead of blobs, a
series of thick and thin stripes that are separated by pale interstripes. Some other higher-order visual areas also have striped patterns. Whereas ocular dominance columns demarcate the left and right eyes, blobs and stripes seem to demarcate clusters of neurons that process and channel different types of visual information between areas V1 and V2 and pass them on to other visual regions of the cortex. For example, neurons within the blobs of area V1 seem to be especially attuned to information about color and project to neurons in the thin stripes of V2. Other neurons throughout area V1 are very sensitive to motion but are insensitive to color. They channel their information mainly to neurons of the thick stripes in V2.

## Maps of somatic sensory information magnify some parts of the body more than others

One of the most famous depictions of a neural map came from studies of the human somatosensory cortex by Penfield and colleagues. Penfield stimulated small sites on the cortical surface in locally anesthetized but conscious patients during neurosurgical procedures; from their verbal descriptions of the position of their sensations, he drew a

homunculus, a little person representing the somatotopymapping of the body surface-of the primary somatic sensory cortex (Fig. 16-10A). The basic features of Penfield's map have been confirmed with other methods, including recording from neurons while the body surface is stimulated and modern brain-imaging methods, such as positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. The human somatotopic map resembles a trapeze artist hanging upside down-the legs are hooked over the top of the postcentral gyrus and dangle into the medial cortex between the hemispheres, and the trunk, upper limbs, and head are draped over the lateral aspect of the postcentral gyrus.

Two interesting features should be noticed about the somatotopic map in Figure 16-10A. First, mapping of the body surface is not always continuous. For example, the representation of the hand separates those of the head and face. Second, the map is not scaled like the human body. Instead, it looks like a cartoon character: the mouth, tongue, and fingers are very large, whereas the trunk, arms, and legs are tiny. As was the case for mapping of the visual fields onto the visual cortex, it is clear in Penfield's map that the magnification factor for the body surface is not a constant but varies for different parts of the body. Fingertips are magnified on the cortex much more than the tips of the toes. The relative size of cortex that is devoted to each body part is correlated with the density of sensory input received from that part, and $1 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ of fingertip skin has many more sensory endings than a similar patch on the buttocks. Size on the map is also related to the importance of the sensory input from that part
of the body; information from the tip of the tongue is more useful than that from the elbow. The mouth representation is probably large because tactile sensations are important in the production of speech, and the lips and tongue are one of the last lines of defense in deciding whether a morsel is a potential piece of food or poison.

The importance of each body part differs among species, and indeed, some species have body parts that others do not. For example, the sensory nerves from the facial whisker follicles of rodents have a huge representation on the cortex, whereas the digits of the paws receive relatively little. Rodent behavior explains this paradox. Most are nocturnal, and to navigate they actively sweep their whiskers about as they move. By touching their local environment, they can sense shapes, textures, and movement with remarkable acuity. For a rat or mouse, seeing things with its eyes is often less important than "seeing" things with its whiskers.

As we have already seen for the visual system, other sensory systems usually map their information numerous times. Maps may be carried through many anatomical levels. The somatotopic maps in the cortex begin with the primary somatic sensory axons (see Table 12-1) that enter the spinal cord or the brainstem, each at the spinal segment appropriate to the site of the information that it carries. The sensory axons synapse on second-order neurons, and these cells project their axons into various nuclei of the thalamus and form synapses. Thalamic relay neurons in turn send their axons into the neocortex. The topographical order of the body surface (i.e., somatotopy) is maintained at each anatomical stage, and somatotopic maps are located within the

spinal cord, the brainstem, and the thalamus as well as in the somatosensory cortex. Within the cortex, the somatic sensory system has several maps of the body, each unique and each concerned with different types of somatotopic information. Multiple maps are the rule in the brain.

## The cerebral cortex has a motor map that is adjacent to and well aligned with the somatosensory map

Neural maps are not limited to sensory systems; they also appear regularly in brain structures that are considered to have primarily motor functions. Studies done in the 1860s by Fritsch and Hitzig showed that stimulation of particular parts of the cerebral cortex evokes specific muscle contractions in dogs. Penfield and colleagues generated maps of the primary motor cortex in humans (see Fig. 16-10B) by microstimulating and observing the evoked movements. They noted an orderly relationship between the site of cortical stimulation and the body part that moved. Penfield's motor maps look remarkably like his somatosensory maps, which lie in the adjacent cortical gyrus (see Fig. 16-10A). Note that the sensory and motor maps are adjacent and similar in basic layout (legs represented medially and head laterally), and both have a striking magnification of the head and hand regions. Not surprisingly, there are myriad axonal interconnections between the primary motor and primary somatosensory areas. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging of the human motor cortex shows that the motor map for hand movements is not nearly as simple and somatotopic as Penfield's drawings might imply. Movements of individual fingers or the wrist that are initiated by the individual activate specific and widely distributed regions of motor cortex, but these regions also overlap one another. Rather than following an obvious somatotopic progression, it instead appears that neurons in the arm area of the motor cortex form distributed and cooperative networks that control collections of arm muscles. Other regions of the motor cortex also have a distributed organization when they are examined on a fine scale, although Penfield's somatotopic maps still suffice to describe the gross organization of the motor cortex.

In other parts of the brain, motor and sensory functions may even occupy the same tissue, and precise alignment of the motor and sensory maps is usually the case. For example, a paired midbrain structure called the superior colliculus receives direct retinotopic connections from the retina as well as input from the visual cortex. Accordingly, a spot of light in the visual field activates a particular patch of neurons in the colliculus. The same patch of collicular neurons can also command, through other brainstem connections, eye and head movements that bring the image of the light spot into the center of the visual field so that it is imaged onto the

fovea. The motor map for orientation of the eyes is in precise register with the visual response map. In addition, the superior colliculus has maps of both auditory and somatosensory information superimposed on its visual and motor maps; the four aligned maps work in concert to represent points in polysensory space and help control an animal's orienting responses to prominent stimuli (Fig. 16-11).

## Sensory and motor maps are fuzzy and plastic

We have described a sample of the sensory and motor maps in the brain, but we are left to wonder just why neural maps are so ubiquitous, elaborate, and varied. What is the advantage of mapping neural functions in an orderly way? You could imagine other arrangements: spatial information might be widely scattered about on a neural structure, much as the bytes of one large digital file may be scattered across the array of memory elements in a computer. Various explanations may be proposed for the phenomenon of orderly mapping in the nervous system, although most remain speculations. Maps may be the most efficient way of generating nearest-neighbor relationships between neurons that must be interconnected for proper function. For example, the collicular neurons that participate in sensing stimuli 10 degrees up and 20 degrees to the left and other collicular neurons that command eye movements toward that point undoubtedly need to be strongly interconnected. Orderly collicular mapping enforces togetherness for those cells and minimizes the length of axons necessary to interconnect them. In addition, if brain structures are arranged topographically, neighboring neurons will be most likely to become activated synchronously. Neighboring neurons are very likely to be interconnected in structures such as the cortex, and their synchronous activity serves to reinforce the strength of their interconnections because of the inherent rules governing synaptic plasticity (see pp. 328-333).

An additional advantage of mapping is that it may simplify establishment of the proper connections between neurons during development. For example, it is easier for an axon from neuron A to find neuron B if distances are short. Maps may thus make it easier to establish interconnections precisely among the neurons that represent the three sensory maps and one motor map in the superior colliculus. Another advantage of maps may be to facilitate the effectiveness of inhibitory connections. Perception of the edge of a stimulus (edge detection) is heightened by lateral connections that suppress the activity of neurons representing the space slightly away from the edge. If sensory areas are mapped, it is a simple matter to arrange the inhibitory connections onto nearby neurons and thereby construct an edge-detector circuit.

It is worth clarifying several general points about neural maps. "The map is not the territory," as the philosopher Alfred Korzybski pointed out. In other words, all maps, including neural maps, are abstract representations. They are also distorted by the shortcomings of particular experimental measurements. A problem with neural maps is that different experimenters, using different methods, may sometimes generate quite different maps of the same part of the brain. As more and better-refined methods become available, our understanding of these maps is evolving. Moreover,

A, The first panel on the right, labeled "Normal organization," shows the somatotopic organization of the right hand in the left somatosensory cortex of the monkey brain. The colors correspond to different regions of the hand (viewed from the palm side, except for portions labeled "Dorsum"). The second panel shows (in gray) the territory that is deprived of input by sectioning the median nerve. The third panel shows that the cortical map is greatly changed several months after nerve section. The nerve was not allowed to regrow, but the previously deprived cortical region now responds to the dorsal skin of D3, D2, and D1. Notice that responses to regions P1, P2, and T have disappeared; region I has encroached; and regions H and P3 have suddenly appeared at a second location. B, The first panel on the right, labeled "Normal organization," shows the somatotopic organization of the left motor cortex (M1) of the rat brain. The colors correspond to the muscles that control different regions of the body. The second panel shows (in gray) the territory that normally provides motor output to the facial nerve, which has been severed. The third panel shows that, after several weeks, the deprived cortical territory is now remapped. Notice that the deprived territory that once evoked whisker movements now evokes eye, eyelid, and forelimb movements. FL, additional representation of forelimb; N, neck area.

the brain itself muddies its maps. Maps of sensory space onto a brain area are not point-to-point representations. On the contrary, a point in sensory space (e.g., a spot of light) activates a relatively large group of neurons in a sensory region of the brain. However, such activation of many neurons is not due to errors of connectivity; the spatial dissemination of activity is part of the mechanism used to encode and to process information. The strength of activation is most intense within the center of the activated neuronal group, but the population of more weakly activated neurons may encompass a large portion of an entire brain. This diversity in strength of activation means that a point in sensory space is unlikely to be encoded by the activity of a single neuron;
instead it is represented by the distributed activity in a large population of neurons. Such a distributed code has computational advantages, and some redundancy also guards against errors, damage, and loss of information.

Finally, maps may change with time. All sensory and motor maps are clearly dynamic and can be reorganized rapidly and substantially as a function of development, behavioral state, training, or damage to the brain or periphery. Such changes are referred to as plasticity. Figure 16-12 illustrates two examples of dramatic changes in neocortical mapping, one sensory and one motor, after damage to peripheral nerves. In both cases, severing a peripheral nerve causes the part of the map that normally relates to the body

part served by this severed nerve to become remapped to another body part. Although the mechanisms of these reorganizations are only partially known, they probably reflect the same types of processes that underlie our ability to learn sensorimotor skills with practice and to adjust and improve after neural damage from trauma or stroke.

## TEMPORAL REPRESENTATIONS: TIME-MEASURING CIRCUITS

## To localize sound, the brain compares the timing and intensity of input to the ears

Neural circuits are very good at resolving time intervals, in some cases down to microseconds or less. One of the most demanding tasks of timing is performed by the auditory system as it localizes the source of certain sounds. Sound localization is an important skill, whether you are prey, predator, or pedestrian. Vertebrates use several different strategies for localization of sound, depending on the species, the frequency of the sound, and whether the task is to localize the source in the horizontal (left-right) or vertical (up-down) plane. In this subchapter, we briefly review general strategies of sound localization and then explain the mechanism by which a brainstem circuit measures the relative timing of low-frequency sounds so that the source of the sounds can be localized with precision.

Sound localization along the vertical plane (the degree of elevation) depends, in humans at least, on the distinctive shape of the external ear, the pinna. Much of the sound that we hear enters the auditory canal directly, and its energy is transferred to the cochlea. However, some sound reflects off the curves and folds of the pinna and tragus before it enters the canal and thus takes slightly longer to reach the cochlea. Notice what happens when the vertical direction of the sound changes. Because of the arcing shape of the pinna, the reflected path of sounds coming from above is shorter than that of sounds from below (Fig. 16-13). The two sets of sounds (the direct and, slightly delayed, the reflected) combine to create sounds that are slightly different on entering the auditory canal. Because of the interference patterns created by the direct and reflected sounds, the combined sound has spectral properties that are characteristic of the elevation of the sound source. This mechanism of vertical sound localization works well even with one ear at a time, although its precise neural mechanisms are not clear.

For humans, accurate determination of the direction of a sound along the horizontal plane (the azimuth) requires two working ears. Sounds must first be processed by the cochlea in each ear and then compared by neurons within the CNS to estimate horizontal direction. But what exactly is compared? For sounds that are relatively high in frequency ( $\sim 2$ to 20 kHz ), the important measure is the interaural (i.e., ear-to-ear) intensity difference. Stated simply, the ear facing the sound hears it as louder than the ear facing away because the head casts a "sound shadow" (Fig. 16-14A). If the sound is directly to the right or left of the listener, this difference is maximal; if the sound is straight ahead, no difference is heard; and if the sound comes from an oblique direction, intensity differences are intermediate. Note that this system can be fooled. A sound source straight ahead gives the

Figure 16-13 Detection of sound in the vertical plane. The detection of sound in the vertical plane requires only one ear. Regardless of the source of a sound, the sound reaches the auditory canal by both direct and reflected pathways. The brain localizes the source of the sound in the vertical plane by detecting differences in the combined sounds from the direct and reflected pathways.
same intensity difference (i.e., none) as a sound source directly behind.

The interaural intensity difference is not helpful at lower frequencies. Sounds below $\sim 2 \mathrm{kHz}$ have a wavelength that is longer than the width of the head itself. Longer sound waves are diffracted around the head, and differences in interaural intensity no longer occur. At low frequencies, the nervous system uses another strategy-it measures interaural delay (see Fig. 16-14B). Consider a $200-\mathrm{Hz}$ sound coming directly from the right. Its peak-to-peak distance (i.e., the wavelength) is $\sim 172 \mathrm{~cm}$, which is considerably more than the $20-\mathrm{cm}$ width of the head. Each sound wave peak will reach the right ear $\sim 0.6 \mathrm{~ms}$ before it reaches the left ear. If the sound comes from a 45 -degree angle ahead, the interaural delay is $\sim 0.3 \mathrm{~ms}$; if it comes from straight ahead (or directly behind), the delay is 0 ms . Delays of small fractions of a millisecond are well within the capabilities of certain brainstem auditory neurons to detect. Sounds need not be continuous for the interaural delay to be detected. Sound onset or offset, clicks, or any abrupt changes in the sound give opportunities for interaural time comparisons. Obviously, measurement of interaural delay is subject to the same front-back ambiguity as interaural intensity, and indeed, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish whether a sound is in front of or behind your head.

## The brain measures interaural timing by a combination of neural delay lines and coincidence detectors

How does the auditory system measure interaural timing? Surprisingly, to detect very small time differences, the nervous system uses a precise arrangement of neurons in space. Figure 16-15A summarizes the neuroanatomy of the

B LOW-FREQUENCY SOUND
![bo155099069a0](bo155099069a0.jpg)

Figure 16-14 Sound detection in a horizontal plane. A, Two ears are necessary for the detection of sound in a horizontal plane. For frequencies between 2 kHz and 20 kHz , the CNS detects the ear-to-ear intensity difference. In this example, the sound comes from the right. The left ear hears a weaker sound because it is in the shadow of the head. B, For frequencies $<2 \mathrm{kHz}$, the CNS detects the ear-to-ear delay. In this example, the width of the head is 20 cm , and sound with a frequency of 200 Hz (wavelength of 172 cm ) comes from the right. The peak of each sound wave reaches the left ear $\sim 0.6 \mathrm{~ms}$ after it reaches the right.
first stages of central auditory processing within the brainstem. Notice that neurons in each of the cochlear nuclei receive information from only the ear on that one side, whereas neurons from the medial superior olivary (MSO) nucleus-and higher CNS centers-receive abundant input from both ears. Because horizontal sound localization requires input from both ears, we may guess that "directionsensitive neurons" will probably be found somewhere central to the cochlear nuclei. When cochlear nucleus neurons are activated by auditory stimuli, their action potentials tend to fire with a particular phase relationship to the sound stimulus. For example, such a neuron might fire at the peak of every sound wave or at the peak of every fifth sound wave. That is, its firing is phase locked to the sound waves, at least for relatively low frequencies. Hence, cochlear neurons preserve the timing information of sound stimuli. Neurons in the MSO nucleus receive synaptic input from axons originating in both cochlear nuclei, so they are well placed to compare the timing (the phase) of sounds arriving at the two ears. Recordings from MSO neurons demonstrate that they are exquisitely sensitive to interaural time delay, and the optimal delay for superior olivary neurons varies systematically across the nucleus. In other words, the MSO nucleus has a spatial map of interaural delay. The MSO also has a
systematic map of sound frequency, so it simultaneously maps two qualities of sound stimuli.

In the brains of birds, and perhaps also in mammals, the tuning of MSO neurons to interaural delay seems to depend on neural circuitry that combines "delay lines" with "coincidence detection," an idea first proposed by Jeffress in 1948. Delay lines are the axons from each cochlear nucleus; their length and conduction velocity determine how long it takes sound-activated action potentials to go from a cochlear nucleus to the axon's presynaptic terminals onto MSO neurons (see Fig. 16-15B). Axons from both the right and left cochlear nuclei converge and synapse onto a series of neurons in the MSO nucleus. However, each axon (each delay line) may take a different time to conduct its action potential to the same MSO neuron. The difference in conduction delay between the axon from the right side and that from the left side determines the optimal interaural delay for that particular olivary neuron. It is the olivary neuron that acts as the coincidence detector: only when action potentials from both the left- and right-ear axons reach the postsynaptic MSO neuron simultaneously (meaning that sound has reached the two ears at a particular interaural delay) is that neuron likely to receive enough excitatory synaptic transmitter to trigger an action potential. If input from the two ears arrives at the neuron out of phase, without coincidence in time, the neuron will not fire. All these postsynaptic MSO neurons are fundamentally the same: they fire when there is coincidence between input from the left and right. However, because neurons arrayed across the olive are mapped so that the axons connecting them have different delays, they display coincidence for different interaural delays. Thus, each is tuned to a different interaural delay and a different sound locale along the horizontal axis. The orderly arrangement of delay lines across the olive determines each of the neurons' preferred delays (and thus sound location preferences) and leads to the orderly spatial mapping of sound direction.

The neural circuit we just described, which combines axonal delay lines and coincidence detection neurons, may not be the main mechanism by which interaural timing is measured in mammalian brains. In the auditory system of gerbils, it appears that synaptic inhibition contributes to the sensitivity of MSO neurons to interaural delay. It is possible that delay lines, synaptic inhibition, and perhaps other neuronal properties combine to optimize the measurement of timing in mammals.

Neural maps of sound localization are an interesting example of a sensory map that the brain must compute. This computed map contrasts with many other sensory maps that are derived more simply, such as by an orderly set of connections between the sensory receptor sheet (e.g., the retinal photoreceptors) and a central brain structure (e.g., the superior colliculus), as described in the preceding subchapter (see Fig. 16-8). The cochlea does not have any map for sound location. Instead, the CNS localizes low-frequency sounds by calculating an interaural time-delay map, using information from both ears together. Other circuits can build a computed map of interaural intensity differences, which can be used for localization of high-frequency sounds (see Fig. 16-14A). Once these two orderly sensory maps have been computed, they can be remapped onto another part of the brain by a

A SOME MAJOR AUDITORY PATHWAYS
![bo156099069a0](bo156099069a0.jpg)

Figure 16-15 CNS processing of sounds. A, A cross section of the mammalian medulla is shown. After a sound stimulus to the cochlea, the cochlear nerve carries an action potential to the cochlear nucleus, which receives information only from the ear on the same side. However, higher auditory centers receive input from both ears. B, Neurons in the MSO nucleus are each tuned to a different interaural delay that provides information about the horizontal direction of sound sources. Only when action potentials from the right and left sides arrive at the MSO neuron simultaneously does the neuron fire an action potential (coincidence detection). In this example, the two action potentials are coincident at MSO neuron D because the brief acoustic delay to the left ear is followed by a long neuronal-conduction delay, whereas the long acoustic delay to the right ear is followed by a brief neuronal-conduction delay. Additional neural mechanisms, such as inhibitory circuits, probably contribute to the determination of interaural delays in the mammalian brain.

B CALCULATION OF INTERAURAL DELAY BY COINCIDENCE DETECTION
![bo157099069a0](bo157099069a0.jpg)
simple system of orderly connections. For instance, the inferior colliculus receives parallel information on both timing delay and intensity difference; it transforms these two sets of information, combines them, and produces a complete map of sound direction. This combination of hierarchic (lower to higher centers) and parallel information processing is ubiquitous in the CNS and is a general strategy for the analysis
of much more complex sensory problems than those described here.

# ORGANIZATION OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

## ELEMENTS OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

## The circulation is an evolutionary consequence of body size

Isolated single cells and small organisms do not have a circulatory system. They can meet their metabolic needs by the simple processes of diffusion and convection of solutes from the external to the internal milieu (Fig. 17-1A). The requirement for a circulatory system is an evolutionary consequence of the increasing size and complexity of multicellular organisms. Simple diffusion (see p. 108) is not adequate to supply nutrients to centrally located cells or to eliminate waste products; in large organisms, the distances separating the central cells from the external milieu are too long. A simple closedend tube (see Fig. 17-1B), penetrating from the extracellular compartment and feeding a central cell deep in the core of the organism, would not be sufficient. The concentration of nutrients inside the tube would become very low at its closed end because of both the uptake of these nutrients by the cell and the long path for resupply leading to the cell. Conversely, the concentration of waste products inside the tube would become very high at the closed end. Such a tube represents a long unstirred layer; as a result, the concentration gradients for both nutrients and wastes across the membrane of the central cell are very small.

In complex organisms, a circulatory system provides a steep concentration gradient from the blood to the central cells for nutrients and in the opposite direction for waste products. Maintenance of such steep intracellular-toextracellular concentration gradients requires a fast convection system that rapidly circulates fluid between surfaces that equilibrate with the external milieu (e.g., the lung, gut, and kidney epithelia) and individual central cells deep inside the organism (see Fig. 17-1C). In mammals and birds, the exchange of gases with the external milieu is so important that they have evolved a two-pump, dual circulatory system (see Fig. 17-1D) that delivers the full output of the "heart" to the lungs (see pp. 683-684).

The primary role of the circulatory system is the distribution of dissolved gases and other molecules for nutrition, growth, and repair. Secondary roles have also evolved: (1) fast chemical signaling to cells by means of circulating hormones or neurotransmitters, (2) dissipation of heat by delivery of heat from the core to the surface of the body, and
(3) mediation of inflammatory and host defense responses against invading microorganisms.

The circulatory system of humans integrates three basic functional parts, or organs: a pump (the heart) that circulates a liquid (the blood) through a set of containers (the vessels). This integrated system is able to adapt to the changing circumstances of normal life. Demand on the circulation fluctuates widely between sleep and wakefulness, between rest and exercise, with acceleration/deceleration, during changes in body position or intrathoracic pressure, during digestion, and under emotional or thermal stress. To meet these variable demands, the entire system requires sophisticated and integrated regulation.

## The heart is a dual pump that drives the blood in two serial circuits: the systemic and the pulmonary circulations

A remarkable pump, weighing $\sim 300 \mathrm{~g}$, drives the human circulation. The heart really consists of two pumps, the left heart, or main pump, and the right heart, or boost pump (see Fig. 17-1D). These operate in series and require a delicate equalization of their outputs. The output of each pump is $\sim 5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, but this can easily increase 5 -fold during exercise.

During a 75-year lifetime, the two ventricles combined pump 400 million L of blood (enough to fill a lake 1 km long, 40 m wide, and 10 m deep). The circulating fluid itself is an organ, kept in a liquid state by mechanisms that actively prevent cell-cell adhesion and coagulation. With each heartbeat, the ventricles impart the energy necessary to circulate the blood by generating the pressure head that drives the flow of blood through the vascular system. On the basis of its anatomy, we can divide this system of tubes into two main circuits: the systemic and the pulmonary circulations (see Fig. 17-1D). We could also divide the vascular system into a high-pressure part (extending from the contracting left ventricle to the systemic capillaries) and a low-pressure part (extending from the systemic capillaries, through the right heart, across the pulmonary circulation and left atrium, and into the left ventricle in its relaxed state). The vessels also respond to the changing metabolic demands of the tissues they supply by directing blood flow to (or away from) tissues as demands change. The circulatory system is also self-repairing/self-expanding. Endothelial cells lining vessels
